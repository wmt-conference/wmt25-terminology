This folder contains the submissions that are **preprocessed** for the consistency metric to be applied to them (aligned on the paragraph level). 
The preprocessing can be reproduced by the ~/term-consistency/track2-sent-alignment.ipynb code. 

If you want to use preprocessed files, unzip the 'track2.zip' folder into the current folder.

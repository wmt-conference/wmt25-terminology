{"en": "# Resilience in the face of adversity\n\nReverberations from slowing global economic growth amid a “high for longer” interest rate environment and intensifying geopolitical tensions — not just stemming from the RussiaUkraine war and China-US tensions but also the outbreak of conflict in the Middle East — were the key themes for the financial markets in 2023. The March banking turmoil in the US and Europe, the most significant system-wide banking stress since the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, weighed further on market sentiment. Major economies grappled with the harsh realities of tightened monetary conditions and greater uncertainty over the inflationary path and interest rate outlook. Adding to the uncertainty was the pace of Mainland China’s economic recovery, which was slower than general market expectations.\n\nWith volatility and unpredictability becoming the “new normal” in financial markets, Hong Kong has again demonstrated its well-known ability to adapt, showing remarkable resilience. Since the city’s full-fledged post-COVID reopening last year, much work has been done to attract people back to our dynamic city and reconnect them with Hong Kong. The HKMA has contributed by hosting a series of large-scale international events such as the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit and conferences with the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), which showcased our vibrant city and helped send the message worldwide that Hong Kong, as a major international financial centre (IFC), is open for business and remains the centre of action and innovation. There are clear signs of gradual recovery, driven by an encouraging revival of inbound tourism and improved private consumption, also supported by a resilient labour market and the various support measures rolled out by the Government. For 2023 as a whole, Hong Kong’s gross domestic product growth bounced back to 3.2% from negative territory in 2022.\n\nThe HKMA entered its fourth decade in 2023. The past 30 years have seen the dynamics of the economy and the financial markets change drastically, with technology driving advances beyond anyone’s wildest imagination. The invaluable experience and wisdom gained over the past three decades have enabled us to face the future with confidence. Despite macroeconomic headwinds and an uncertain external environment, the HKMA will continue to uphold its mandate of safeguarding monetary and banking stability in Hong Kong, and will actively pursue developmental opportunities to anchor that stability and cement the city’s status as a leading IFC.\n\nFormer and current Financial Secretaries of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Chief Executives of HKMA at a gathering to celebrate the HKMA’s 30th anniversary: (from left) Mr Joseph Yam, Mr Henry Tang, Mr Donald Tsang, Mr Paul Chan, Mr Eddie Yue, Mr Antony Leung, Mr John Tsang, and Mr Norman Chan\n\n# LERS — Weathering the storms\n\nLast year marked the 40th anniversary of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), a staunch pillar supporting Hong Kong’s strong and stable monetary and financial systems. Four decades of transparent and effective operation have nurtured confidence in the LERS and its credibility in the market. Throughout the year, the Hong Kong dollar stayed within the Convertibility Zone and the Hong Kong dollar market operated smoothly, reflecting the strong market confidence in the LERS, a confidence also shared and expressed by the International Monetary Fund and global market players.\n\nBehind this confidence lie the HKMA’s proactive efforts in public and market engagements, along with effective surveillance. We spared no effort during the year in communicating with key stakeholders to foster a clear understanding of the functioning of the LERS, which is all the more important in times of volatility, be it stemming from economic stress or political uncertainties. We also strengthened surveillance of our monetary system, leveraging the use of datasets from the trade repository and expanded granular data from banks, as well as advanced data analytics and artificial intelligence, to enhance our capability, enabling more timely and comprehensive analysis of financial stability and macro-prudential surveillance.\n\n# Banking system — A major source of stability\n\nDespite a multitude of challenges including the high-interestrate environment, persistent geopolitical tensions and a challenging credit landscape, Hong Kong’s banking system remained stable throughout the year, underpinned by strong capital and liquidity buffers.\n\nAs at the end of 2023, the consolidated total capital ratio of local banks stood at 21.1%, well above the international minimum requirement of 8%. The Liquidity Coverage Ratio of large banks edged up to 178.6% as of the fourth quarter of 2023, likewise well above the statutory minimum requirement of 100%. While the classified loan ratio increased slightly from 1.40% at the end of 2022 to 1.56% at the end of 2023, it remained below the long-term historical average of 2.0%. The increase was mainly driven by exposures to Mainland privately-owned enterprise (POE) property developers; but such exposure levels were generally well-contained as a result of banks’ prudent credit risk management over the years, and the overall asset quality of the banking sector remained sound.\n\nWhat caught most market players by surprise in 2023 was unquestionably the banking turmoil in the US spilling over to Europe, which created a level of system-wide banking stress unseen since the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. The HKMA remained on high alert as the situation unfolded and took a number of precautionary actions to limit any potential adverse spillover effects on confidence in the local banking and financial systems. This, coupled with the strong capital and liquidity buffers maintained by banks in Hong Kong, meant that our banking sector was largely unaffected by the turmoil, remaining resilient even as the global financial markets were roiled. In the aftermath of this episode, the HKMA conducted a comprehensive internal review with a view to drawing out lessons for the local banking sector and strengthening the HKMA’s supervisory effectiveness and agility to handle a banking crisis should one occur.\n\nWhile prudent credit risk management is important, we have always reiterated our supervisory expectation for banks to be mindful of the need to support the real economy. As the orderly exit from the banking sector’s Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme commenced in July 2023 with the economic effects of COVID-19 receding, the HKMA worked closely with banks to ensure a gradual and smooth transition to normal loan repayment with flexibility for those borrowers who continued to be under pressure. Earlier this year, recognising that some small and medium-sized enterprises are still facing challenges in their operations despite the end of the pandemic, nine new measures were rolled out to further assist them in obtaining financing from banks.\n\nHaving reviewed the risks associated with the local property market in the context of banks’ property lending, the HKMA announced in July 2023 the first relaxation of the countercyclical macroprudential measures for residential properties since their introduction in 2009. This relaxation increased the loan-to-value ratio cap for most residential mortgage loans as well as for financing for property development and investment. It was later followed by suspension of the interest rate stress testing requirement in early 2024.\n\nThe HKMA’s supervision of financial institutions has been moving with the times. With recent years having seen a sharp global increase in fraud cases, we have considerably stepped up our efforts to counter new fraud tactics by introducing a holistic set of measures to protect bank customers. These include enhancing information sharing between banks and with law enforcement agencies; strengthening the monitoring of suspicious transactions (including implementation of real-time fraud monitoring and tightened payment card authentication); empowering customers to have more controls on their payment cards; and educating customers and raising public awareness of frauds with the launch of the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter, as well as a pre-transaction alert mechanism which warns users if a higher-risk Faster Payment System (FPS) transaction is spotted.\n\nIn light of a proliferation of innovative and digital banking products and services, the HKMA has worked with the banking industry to step up consumer and investor protection more broadly and enhance the banks’ operational and cyber resilience, as well as their collective defences against systemic cyber events. At the same time, all major banks have considerably strengthened their capabilities to respond to, and recover from, destructive ransomware attacks. The HKMA together with the industry has also pursued various consumer data infrastructure projects, such as the “Credit Data Smart” pilot programme to enhance consumer credit reference services, and taken forward a cross-boundary credit reference initiative to facilitate crossboundary financing activities by corporates.\n\nFintech and digitalisation can bring about enormous opportunities when the risk is properly managed. Leveraging earlier success in facilitating the uptake of Regtech, the HKMA, with the support of the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Insurance Authority, published a new Fintech Promotion Roadmap in August 2023 to promote further development of fintech by financial institutions in five focus areas — Wealthtech, Insurtech, Greentech, artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology. We anticipate local regulators continuing to collaborate and work closely together with their industry sectors in the coming years in order for the Hong Kong financial industry as a whole to keep abreast and reap the benefits of dynamic fintech development.\n\n# Hong Kong as an IFC — The centre of action and innovation\n\nIn 2023, we fully emerged from the pandemic. Hong Kong was not only back in business but its position as one of the world’s leading IFCs was further underscored by the return of global investors and our strengthened global network. Domestically, we took the opportunity of the 30th anniversary of the HKMA’s establishment to host a series of large-scale, international events with top-level participation from the global financial and banking community to demonstrate Hong Kong’s vibrancy and to send a clear message that Hong Kong as an IFC remained relevant and indispensable to global investors and financial institutions seeking growth and innovation. Of particular note was the return of the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit, held in November, which attracted to our city more than 350 international and regional leaders from some 160 global financial institutions. Other high-powered events hosted in Hong Kong included a meeting of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) and two HKMA-BIS Conferences which were among the largest gatherings of central bank governors and banking supervisors of the year. These events attest to the global financial sector’s commitment to and confidence in Hong Kong.\n\nExternally, 2023 was also a year in which Hong Kong proactively reached out to strengthen its connections with traditional markets including the US and Europe, as well as new destinations such as those in the Middle East. We met with peer regulators and top management of global financial institutions in these markets to both apprise and update them on the opportunities in Hong Kong and the Mainland, while seeking out new collaboration opportunities for Hong Kong.\n\nTo complement these engagement efforts, we actively contributed to the work of international and regional forums by taking up certain leadership roles. During the year, I accepted invitations to chair the BIS Meeting of Governors from Major Emerging Market Economies and to co-chair the Financial Stability Board (FSB)’s Regional Consultative Group for Asia. My colleagues are also chairing or co-chairing a number of other important groupings under the Basel Committee, the Financial Action Task Force, and the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks, to name a few. The HKMA’s leadership at many regional and international forums is a recognition of Hong Kong’s expertise and contribution to international central banking and regulatory efforts in the pursuit of global monetary and financial stability, as well as Hong Kong’s importance as an IFC.\n\nTo build on the above accomplishments, we must position ourselves as a forward-looking IFC, staying ahead of the curve to ensure our ongoing competitiveness. We have identified three long-term trends in the coming years that will shape our future: namely the continued opening-up of the Mainland, the development of green and sustainable finance and the deployment of fintech. We will continue to support the development of our financial markets to capture the opportunities from these long-term trends while positioning our financial platform to provide leading services to attract more businesses to Hong Kong.

{"en": "# Highlights of 2023\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nDespite a challenging external environment, the Hong Kong economy stages a positive growth in 2023, driven by revivals in inbound tourism and domestic demand. The labour market continues to improve alongside the economic recovery, while inflation remains moderate. Economic activities for 2024 are expected to recover further at a moderate pace, although the outlook is clouded by multiple external uncertainties.\n\nThe banking sector in Hong Kong remains sound in 2023, supported by strong capital and liquidity buffers. Asset quality remains at a healthy level.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nAmid market expectations of a “high for longer” US policy rate, the Hong Kong dollar mostly trades on the weak side of the Convertibility Zone in 2023, with the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking being triggered eight times between mid-February and early May. The Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets remain stable, and continue to trade in a smooth and orderly manner.\n\n2023 marks the 40th anniversary of the Linked Exchange Rate System. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, the Linked Exchange Rate System has helped Hong Kong weather a succession of shocks and crises in the past four decades, demonstrating the system’s resilience and robustness.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA responds swiftly to the March banking turmoil in the US and Europe — from managing the ripple effects to completing an internal review drawing lessons for the local banking sector, while maintaining its focus on the credit, liquidity and market risk management of banks. In light of escalating cyber threats and increasing use of technology services provided by third parties, the HKMA also works closely with banks to enhance their operational and cyber resilience.\n\nThe HKMA enhances consumer protection on payment cards, and through further revision of the Code of Banking Practice as well as the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter. The HKMA works with fellow regulators on a balanced regulatory regime for virtual asset-related activities, streamlines the selling process for sophisticated professional investors, introduces enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Pilot Scheme, and commences supervision of trust business. A pilot programme on consumer credit reference services under “Credit Data Smart” is also launched.\n\nThe HKMA’s efforts in anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism reflect a commitment to targeting the highest threats under a risk-based approach. To address increasing digital fraud, the HKMA has strengthened ecosystem collaboration through the launch of real-time fraud monitoring, enhanced information sharing between banks and with law enforcement agencies, intensified public education, and launched a new pre-transaction alert mechanism when using the Faster Payment System. In parallel, supervisory technology capabilities have been advanced through the Macro Analytics pilot scheme.\n\nThe HKMA makes good progress on implementing international supervisory standards locally, including those on capital adequacy and disclosure, and makes notable efforts in enhancing capacity building in the banking sector.\n\nThe HKMA also advances its work to ensure a credible resolution regime, including developing a new resolution standard on accessing critical financial market infrastructures, and completing a review on the implementation of loss-absorbing capacity policy standards.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\nThe successful conclusion of the second Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit and the HKMA-BIS High-Level Conference demonstrates the global financial sector’s commitment to and confidence in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA works closely with its Mainland and Hong Kong counterparts to deepen and widen the mutual access between the Hong Kong and Mainland financial markets. This includes enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Scheme, designation of additional market makers for Southbound Trading under Bond Connect, the successful launch of Northbound Trading of Swap Connect, and the roll-out of the HKD-RMB Dual Counter Model and the Dual Counter Market Making Programme, all of which are effective in solidifying Hong Kong’s status as a global hub for offshore renminbi business.\n\nOn strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, notable progress is made in areas including bond issuance, asset and wealth management, green and sustainable finance, and corporate treasury centres.\n\nThe HKMA continues to make significant progress on various fronts of the “Fintech 2025” strategy. Project mBridge enters the Minimum Viable Product development phase, Phase 1 of the e-HKD Pilot Programme is completed, and Commercial Data Interchange sees increasing usage and the successful linkage with Government data source. Moreover, a new Fintech Promotion Roadmap is announced to further develop Wealthtech, Insurtech, Greentech, artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology in the banking sector. Meanwhile, the Faster Payment System marks its fifth anniversary and continues to see expanded adoption and enhancements including new functionalities like the linkage with Thailand’s PromptPay for cross-border QR payment. Significant progress is also made in relation to developing a regulatory regime for stablecoin issuers, with a public consultation paper published for gathering views on the legislative proposal.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\nDespite a volatile and challenging investment environment, the Exchange Fund manages to achieve a decent investment income of HK$226.0 billion, representing an investment return of 5.5%.\n\nThe HKMA continues its efforts on asset diversification and responsible investing.

{"en": "# Priorities for 2024 and Beyond\n\nEntering 2024, the Hong Kong economy is expected to continue to recover at a moderate pace, riding on the ongoing revival of inbound tourism, public infrastructure projects and stable private consumption. However, the external environment is fraught with risks and uncertainties, especially those relating to the future US policy rate path, the global growth prospects, and the evolving geopolitical tensions. That said, Hong Kong’s financial system remains well-positioned to weather adverse shocks given its resilience and ample buffers built up over the years.\n\nThe HKMA attaches great importance to safeguarding Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. Looking ahead, we will stay vigilant in the face of the uncertain macroeconomic environment, seeking to promptly identify emerging risks and respond to them in an agile manner. At the same time, we will seek opportunities and create policy headroom to help further enhance Hong Kong’s status as a leading international financial centre. In managing the Exchange Fund in this challenging investment environment, we will continue to invest prudently, while remaining flexible, taking defensive measures as appropriate, and maintaining a high degree of liquidity.\n\n# Stability and integrity of the financial system\n\nThe global economic uncertainties of recent years look set to continue in 2024. The HKMA will keep abreast of latest developments and stay vigilant against potential risks, with the aim of upholding the resilience and stability of the financial system, which are essential for the ongoing provision of critical financial services that support the functioning of the Hong Kong economy.\n\n# Staying vigilant against potential risks\n\nLooking into 2024, global financial markets could experience volatility as a result of uncertainties surrounding the US monetary policy outlook, evolving geopolitical risks, and an uneven global economic recovery. 2024 is also a key election year as many major elections are scheduled to be held across the world. The outcome of these elections could further increase market uncertainties. Nevertheless, Hong Kong’s financial system is well-positioned to withstand adverse shocks given its resilience and buffers built up over the years. The HKMA also has the capability, the resources and the commitment to safeguard Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nThe HKMA will continue its efforts to closely monitor any risks and vulnerabilities arising in the domestic and external environments, and will deploy appropriate measures where necessary to maintain Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. We will also conduct research into issues affecting the Hong Kong economy, assessing and addressing any potential risks associated with these issues.\n\n# Maintaining banking stability\n\nIn 2023, new geopolitical tensions across the world broke out while others remained unresolved, contributing to political uncertainty and instability that looks set to continue into 2024. Economic pressures in the form of high interest rates were a feature of the global landscape, and rates remain high entering 2024. Within the banking sector, the continued drive towards digitalisation and the implementation of new technology, including artificial intelligence, have brought many advantages but are also posing new operational and cyber security risks as well as supervisory challenges. In such a volatile political, economic and technological landscape, the HKMA strives to ensure banks’ ability to withstand shocks through its ongoing supervisory efforts. At the same time, we will continue to enhance and refine our banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account technological developments, changes in customer expectations, as well as international standards and best practices.\n\n# A risk-based supervisory focus\n\n# Credit, liquidity and market risks\n\nIn light of the increasingly challenging macroeconomic landscape, a special focus of the HKMA will be on monitoring the asset quality of authorized institutions (AIs) and assessing the effectiveness of their credit risk management and controls, particularly with respect to loan classification and provisioning practices and problem loans management. We will also maintain close dialogue with the banking and commercial sectors with a view to ensuring that AIs are striking an appropriate balance between undertaking prudent credit risk management and fulfilling their financial intermediation function throughout economic cycles. In particular, we will follow up with banks through the Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism on the nine new measures rolled out in March 2024 to assist small and medium-sized enterprises in obtaining financing from banks.\n\nUncertainties in the global economic outlook as well as elevated geopolitical tensions may increase the volatility of both asset prices and cross-border fund flows. The HKMA will make vigilance a priority, and will continue to effectively supervise the liquidity and market risk management of AIs.\n\n# Follow-up actions on lessons drawn from the 2023 banking turmoil\n\nThe HKMA will implement the follow-up actions identified in the internal review that it undertook in response to the 2023 banking turmoil in the US and Europe. These are actions that will further strengthen supervisory effectiveness and enhance its ability to handle a banking crisis should one arise. They include enhancing the risk capture of AIs’ interest rate risk in the banking book in the context of the HKMA’s supervisory review process, improving the preparedness of AIs for dealing with liquidity stresses given the continuing digitalisation of banking services, streamlining the HKMA’s crisis management processes, and further enhancing interagency and cross-border supervisory co-ordination.\n\n# Operational and technology risk\n\nThe HKMA will continue to monitor AIs’ progress towards achieving full compliance with the HKMA Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module OR-2 on “Operational Resilience”, and assess and benchmark banks’ tolerance limits for plausible disruptions, with a view to enhancing the overall resilience of the banking system. With respect to cyber risk, we will oversee a new round of self-assessments by AIs under the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 and monitor AIs’ implementation of a secure tertiary data backup to enhance their data recovery capabilities if faced with destructive cyber attacks.\n\nGiven the accelerating pace of digitalisation in banking operations, the HKMA will keep a close watch on emerging risks arising from the use of advanced technologies such as generative artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology. We will also collaborate with banks and other relevant stakeholders in operating an agile and pre-emptive mechanism to counter the growing trend of digital fraud.\n\n# Combatting money laundering and terrorist financing\n\nIn 2024, to uphold the integrity of the banking system and build customer confidence, the HKMA will target high-risk areas and prioritise risk-based regulatory updates, including issuing guidance to support an effective, risk-based implementation of changes to requirements for politically exposed persons, and supporting the implementation of the regulatory regime for stablecoin issuers. We will also issue guidance to help AIs optimise their transaction monitoring systems and to promote the responsible use of artificial intelligence, and focus on controls targeting high-end money laundering through our thematic work. To strengthen the ecosystem response to digital fraud and reduce losses to victims, we will further consult the public and the industry on a proposal to expand the scope of bank-to-bank information sharing from corporate accounts to personal accounts and, based on the feedback received, pursue necessary legislative amendments. We will move to a full build of Macro Analytics 3.0 by pooling data relevant to anti-money laundering across multiple banks and interfacing this with existing ecosystem fraud analysis. This will deliver more rapid cross-bank responses and further enhance our datadriven anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism supervision, enabling us to take quicker, more decisive action against systemic money laundering and terrorist financing risks.\n\n# Wealth management and Mandatory Provident Fundrelated businesses\n\nIn 2024, the HKMA will step up both its on-site examinations and off-site surveillance of AIs’ conduct in relation to wealth management and the selling of securities, investment products, and insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses. More specifically, we will focus on Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) business, digital distribution and advisory platforms, virtual asset (VA)-related products, long term insurance products and premium financing activities, taking into account the latest market developments as well as evolving international standards.\n\nThe HKMA will communicate closely with fellow regulators and the banking industry to provide guidance on regulatory standards in relation to the sale of investment, insurance and MPF products as appropriate. In particular, to support the sustainable and responsible development of the VA sector, we will continue to work with the Government and fellow regulators to ensure that the regulatory regime in place for the VA sector is robust, comprehensive and well-balanced.\n\nThe HKMA will facilitate and monitor the industry’s implementation of enhancements to Cross-boundary WMC, and continue to engage with the industry and relevant regulatory authorities in order to further enhance the scheme. We will also continue to work with fellow regulators and the industry to streamline the selling process for investment products, and will consolidate and clarify guidance, as appropriate, to facilitate industry compliance. In addition to trust business, we will also commence the supervision of new Type 13 regulated activity under the Securities and Futures Ordinance for AIs providing depositary services for collective investment schemes authorised by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), which will come into operation on 2 October 2024.\n\n# Oversight of financial market infrastructures\n\nThe HKMA aims to promote the safety and efficiency of the financial market infrastructures (FMIs) under its oversight in accordance with the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO), the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMI) and the various guidance issued by the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI). We will continue to participate in the CPMI-IOSCO1 PFMI implementation monitoring and assessment exercise, and in other international working groups to discuss the implementation of new and innovative FMI-related initiatives. We will also participate in the work of international standard-setting bodies, and will review and strengthen our oversight requirements as appropriate to reflect the latest international practices as well as market and technology developments.\n\n# Policy development\n\nThe HKMA will continue to strengthen and refine its banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account international standards and best practices.\n\n# Implementation of Basel standards in Hong Kong\n\nThe proposed amendments to the Banking (Capital) Rules (BCR) and the Banking (Disclosure) Rules (BDR) for implementing the Basel III final reform package (Final Package) are expected to take effect on 1 January 2025 following the passage of the amended Rules in the Legislative Council. In 2024, the HKMA will continue to prepare the supporting guidance, banking returns and standard disclosure templates and tables needed to facilitate the application of the Rules. In particular, we plan to:\n- consult the industry in the second quarter of 2024 on the revisions to the SPM module CA-B-3 on “Countercyclical Capital Buffer (CCyB)–Geographic Allocation of Private Sector Credit Exposures” and Return MA(BS)25 “Quarterly reporting on the Countercyclical Capital Buffer”, reflecting the consequential changes arising from the implementation of the Final Package and the revised Return of International Banking Statistics; and\n- finalise the package for effecting the reporting-only requirement for the new standards on market and credit valuation adjustment risks, which starts on 1 July 2024.\n\nThose parts of the proposed amendments to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules (BELR) and the Banking (Liquidity) Rules (BLR) that are largely consequential to the implementation of the Final Package under the amended BCR are also targeted to take effect on 1 January 2025. The HKMA plans to finalise the proposed consequential amendments to the related regulatory returns in 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, with a new standard on the prudential treatment of banks’ crypto-asset exposures and subsequent targeted revisions to the standard having been issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December 2022 and December 2023 respectively, local implementation of the standard is planned for 2025. The HKMA will examine the need for potential legislative amendments to various sets of rules, including the BCR, the BDR, the BELR and the BLR, and conduct the statutory consultation on the necessary rule amendments in the first half of 2025.\n\n# Other supervisory policies and risk management guidelines\n\nThe HKMA plans to update a number of SPM modules in response to lessons learned from the banking turmoil in the US and Europe of March 2023, as well as developments in regulatory requirements and international standards. These modules include:\n", "zh": "\n《2024年及以後的優先事項》\n\n進入2024年，香港經濟預期將以溫和的速度持續復甦，主要受入境旅遊活動的持續恢復、公共基建項目及穩定的私人消費所推動。然而，外部環境仍充滿風險與不確定性，特別是未來美國利率走勢、全球增長前景以及地緣政治緊張局勢等問題。儘管如此，鑒於香港金融系統的韌性和多年來建立的充足緩衝，其仍有能力應對不利衝擊。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）高度重視保障香港的貨幣及金融穩定。展望未來，我們將在面對不確定的宏觀經濟環境時保持警覺，盡快識別新出現的風險並靈活應對。同時，我們將尋求機遇並創造政策空間，協助進一步提升香港作為國際金融中心的地位。在這具有挑戰性的投資環境中管理外匯基金，我們將繼續採取謹慎投資策略，保持靈活性，在適當情況下採取防禦性措施，並維持高程度的流動性。\n\n《金融體系的穩定與完整性》\n\n近年來的全球經濟不確定性似乎将在2024年延續。HKMA將密切關注最新發展，警惕潛在風險，目標是維護金融體系的韌性和穩定性，這是持續提供支持香港經濟運作的重要金融服務的必要條件。\n\n《針對潛在風險的警覺》\n\n展望2024年，由於美國貨幣政策展望的不確定性、地緣政治風險的演變以及全球經濟復甦的不平衡，全球金融市場可能經歷波動。此外，2024年也是一個關鍵選舉年，全球多個主要國家將舉行選舉。這些選舉結果可能會進一步增加市場的不確定性。然而，鑒於香港金融系統的韌性和多年來建立的緩衝，其仍然具備應對不利衝擊的能力。HKMA亦具備能力、資源及承諾來保障香港的貨幣及金融穩定。\n\nHKMA將持續努力密切監測來自本地及外部環境中的任何風險與脆弱性，並在必要時採取適當措施，以維持香港的貨幣及金融穩定。我們亦將進行有關影響香港經濟問題的研究，評估並處理與這些問題相關的潛在風險。\n\n《維持銀行穩定》\n\n2023年，全球各地爆發新的地緣政治緊張關係，其他地區的問題仍未解決，導致政治不確定性和不穩定局面似乎將持續至2024年。高利率形式的經濟壓力仍是全球格局特徵，且利率在2024年初依然處於高位。在銀行業內，數字化進程的推進及新技術（包括人工智能）的應用帶來許多好處，但也帶來新的操作風險、網絡安全風險及監督挑戰。在這樣的政治、經濟和技術動蕩的背景下，HKMA致力於通過持續的監督工作確保銀行具備應對衝擊的能力。同時，我們將繼續加強和完善銀行監督及監管框架和政策，考慮技術發展、客戶期望的變化以及國際標準和最佳實踐。\n\n《以風險為導向的監督重點》\n\n《信用、流動性和市場風險》\n\n鑒於日益嚴峻的宏觀經濟環境，HKMA的重點將是監測認可機構（AIs）的資產質素，並評估其信用風險管理及控制措施的有效性，尤其是貸款分類及撥備做法及問題貸款管理。我們還將與銀行業及商業部門保持密切溝通，以確保AIs在整個經濟週期中既能進行審慎的信貸風險管理，又能履行其金融中介職能。特別地，我們將透過「銀行為中小企業融資協調機制」跟進銀行在2024年3月推出的九項新措施的落實情況，幫助中小型企業從銀行獲得融資。\n\n全球經濟前景的不確定性以及升高的地緣政治緊張局勢可能會提高資產價格及跨境資金流動的波動性。HKMA將把警覺性列為首要任務，並繼續有效地監督AIs的流動性和市場風險管理。\n\n《回應2023年銀行危機教訓的後續行動》\n\nHKMA將實施內審中發現的後續行動，以應對2023年美國及歐洲銀行危機。這些行動將進一步加強監督效果，提高處理銀行危機的能力。其中包括在HKMA監督審查過程中增強AIs銀行帳戶中的利率風險風險捕捉、提高AIs在銀行服務持續數位化的背景下的流動性壓力準備度、簡化HKMA的危機管理流程，以及進一步加強跨機構和跨境監督協調。\n\n《操作風險與技術風險》\n\nHKMA將持續監控AIs實現完全符合HKMA監管政策手冊（SPM）第OR-2模組「操作彈性」的進展，並評估和衡量銀行對合理中斷的容忍限度，以提高整體銀行體系的彈性。在網路風險方面，我們將監督AIs根據《網路彈性評估框架2.0》進行新一轮自評，並監督AIs實施安全的第三級數據備份，以增強他們在面對破壞性網絡攻擊時的資料恢復能力。\n\n隨著銀行業務數位化速度加快，HKMA將密切關注使用生成式人工智能和分布式賬本技術等先進技術產生的新風險。我們還將與銀行及其他相關利益相關者合作，運營一個敏捷且具前瞻性的方法，以應對日益增長的數位詐騙趨勢。\n\n《打擊洗錢及恐怖主義融资》\n\n在2024年，為了維護銀行體系的完整性和建立客戶信心，HKMA將針對高風險領域，優先考慮基於風險的法規更新，包括頒布指引以支持對政治人物要求的變更有效執行，並支持穩定幣發行人的法規架構的實施。我們還將頒布指引，協助AIs優化交易監測系統，促進人工智能的負責任使用，並針對高端洗錢活動的控制開展主題性工作。為加強數位詐騙的生態系統回應并減少對受害者的損失，我們將進一步就擴大銀行間信息共享範圍從公司帳戶擴展到個人帳戶的提案諮詢公眾及行業意見，並根據收到的反饋 pursued必要的立法修訂。我們將全面建設Macro Analytics 3.0，整合多個銀行相關的反洗錢數據，並與現有的生態系統詐騙分析接口。這將實現更快的跨銀行回應，進一步提升我們的數據驅動型反洗錢和打擊恐怖主義融资監督能力，使我們能夠更快、更決斷地應對系統性洗錢和恐怖主義融资風險。\n\n《理財業務及強積金相關業務》\n\n2024年，HKMA將加強對AIs在理財業務及銷售證券、投資產品、保險和強積金（MPF）相關業務方面的行為進行現場檢查和非現場監測。更具體來說，我們將專注於跨境理財連接（Cross-boundary WMC）業務、數位分銷和顧問平台、虛擬資產（VA）相關產品、長期保險產品和保證金融資活動，考慮最新的市場發展以及不斷變化的國際標準。\n\nHKMA將與同行監管機構和銀行業密切溝通，就投資、保險和MPF產品的銷售相關監管標準提供建議。特別是，為了支持VA行業的可持續和負責任發展，我們將繼續與政府及同行監管機構合作，確保目前適用的VA行業監管架構堅固、全面且平衡。\n\nHKMA將促進並監測行業對跨境WMC的改進措施的實施情況，並繼續與業界及相關監管當局合作，進一步完善該計劃。我們將繼續與同行監管機構和業界合作，簡化投資產品的銷售過程，並根據需要進行整合和澄清指引，以促進業界合規。除了信託業務外，我們還將開始對AIs提供由證券及期貨事務監察委員會（SFC）批准的集體投資計畫的保管服務的新類型13規管活動進行監督，該活動將於2024年10月2日生效。\n\n《金融市場基礎設施的監督》\n\nHKMA旨在根據《支付系統及儲值消費券業務條例》（PSSVFO）、《金融市場基礎設施原則》（PFMI）以及支付及市場基礎設施委員會（CPMI）發布的各項指引，推動其監督範圍內金融市場基礎設施（FMIs）的安全性和效率。我們將繼續參與CPMI-IOSCO 1 PFMI實施監測和評估工作，以及其他國際工作小組討論新興和創新FMI相關計劃的實施。我們將參與國際標準制定機構的工作，並根據最新國際實踐以及市場和技術發展適當地 reviewing 和加強我們的監督要求。\n\n《政策發展》\n\nHKMA將持續加強和完善銀行監督和監管框架及政策，考慮國際標準和最佳實踐。\n\n《香港實施巴塞爾標準》\n\n為落實巴塞爾III最終改革方案（Final Package）而提出的《銀行（資本）條例》（BCR）和《銀行（披露）條例》（BDR）修訂案預計在立法會通過後於2025年1月1日生效。2024年，HKMA將繼續準備支持指引、銀行回報及標準披露模板和表格以 facilitating 該條例的應用。特別地，我們計劃：\n- 在2024年第2季度就《SPM模組CA-B-3「逆周期資本緩衝（CCyB）－私人部門信貸暴露地理分配」》及「報告MA(BS)25「逆周期資本緩衝 quarterly 报告」」的修改征求業界意見，反映因實施Final Package及修訂國際銀行統計報告所致的後果改變；以及\n- 完成新標準市場和信用估值調整風險的僅報告要求的打包，該標準於2024年7月1日起生效。\n\n擬議修正案中涉及《銀行（曝險限額）條例》（BELR）和《銀行（流動性）條例》（BLR）的部分，大多數屬於因修訂BCR而實施Final Package的後果，預計於2025年1月1日生效。HKMA計劃在2024年完成相關監管回報的擬議後果修正案。\n\n同時，巴賽爾銀行監督委員會於2022年12月和2023年12月分別發佈了關於銀行加密資產曝險的審慎處理新標準及其後針對該標準的修正案。本地實施此標準計劃於2025年進行。HKMA將評估是否需要對各種規則（包括BCR、BDR、BELR和BLR）進行可能的法律修正案，並於2025年上半年進行法定諮詢。\n\n《其他監督政策及風險管理指南》\n\nHKMA計劃根據從2023年3月美國及歐洲銀行危機中吸取的經驗，以及監管要求和國際標準的發展，更新若干SPM模塊。這些模塊包括：\n"}
{"en": "# About the HKMA\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is Hong Kong’s central banking institution. The HKMA has four main functions:\n- maintaining currency stability within the framework of the Linked Exchange Rate System;\n- promoting the stability and integrity of the financial system, including the banking system;\n- helping to maintain Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre, including the maintenance and development of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure; and\n- managing the Exchange Fund.\n\n# HKMA’s legal mandate\n\nThe HKMA was established on 1 April 1993 after the Legislative Council passed amendments to the Exchange Fund Ordinance in 1992 empowering the Financial Secretary to appoint a Monetary Authority.\n\nThe powers, functions and responsibilities of the Monetary Authority are set out in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the Banking Ordinance, the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance, the Deposit Protection Scheme Ordinance, the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, and other relevant Ordinances. The division of functions and responsibilities in monetary and financial affairs between the Financial Secretary and the Monetary Authority is set out in an exchange of letters dated 25 June 2003. The exchange of letters discloses delegations made by the Financial Secretary to the Monetary Authority. The letters are public documents and can be found on the HKMA website.\n\nThe Exchange Fund Ordinance establishes the Exchange Fund under the control of the Financial Secretary. According to the Ordinance, the Fund shall be used primarily for affecting the exchange value of the Hong Kong dollar. It may also be used (whilst having regard to its primary purpose) for maintaining the stability and integrity of the monetary and financial systems of Hong Kong, with a view to maintaining Hong Kong as an international financial centre.\n\nThe Monetary Authority is appointed under the Exchange Fund Ordinance to assist the Financial Secretary in performing his functions under the Exchange Fund Ordinance and to perform such other functions as are assigned by other Ordinances or by the Financial Secretary. The office of the Monetary Authority is known as the HKMA, and the Monetary Authority is the Chief Executive of the HKMA.\n\nThe Banking Ordinance provides the Monetary Authority with the responsibility and powers for regulating and supervising banking business and the business of taking deposits. Under the Ordinance, the Monetary Authority is responsible for the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong.\n\nThe Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance provides that the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for banking sector entities. The Monetary Authority is vested with a range of powers to effect the orderly resolution of a non-viable banking sector entity (the failure of which could pose systemic risk). The purpose is to maintain financial stability, while seeking to protect public funds.\n\nThe Securities and Futures Ordinance and the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Ordinance provide certain powers to the Monetary Authority regarding the securities and mandatory provident fund businesses of banks.\n\nThe Monetary Authority has been delegated with powers of inspection and investigation by the Insurance Authority under the Insurance Ordinance in relation to the insurance related businesses of banks.\n\nThe Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance empowers the Monetary Authority to supervise banks’ compliance with the customer due diligence and record-keeping requirements under the Ordinance.\n\nThe Deposit Protection Scheme Ordinance confers responsibility on the Monetary Authority to assist in the operation of the Deposit Protection Scheme and to trigger payment of compensation from the Deposit Protection Scheme Fund to depositors of a failed licensed bank.\n\nThe Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance provides a statutory regime for the Monetary Authority to designate and oversee certain significant clearing and settlement systems and retail payment systems operating in Hong Kong. It also empowers the Monetary Authority to administer a licensing regime for electronic and physical “facilities”, which are used to store monetary value and which meet the criteria specified in the Ordinance.", "zh": "\n<para><strong>關於香港金融管理局（HKMA）</strong></para>\n<p>\n香港金融管理局是香港的中央銀行機構。香港金融管理局有四大主要職能：\n<ol>\n<li>在<a href=\"https://www.hkma.gov.hk\">聯繫匯率制度</a>框架內維持貨幣穩定；</li>\n<li>促進金融體系的穩定與完整，包括銀行體系；</li>\n<li>協助維持香港作為國際金融中心的地位，包括香港金融基建的維護與發展；以及</li>\n<li>管理外匯基金。</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n\n<para><strong>HKMA 的法律權限</strong></para>\n<p>\n香港金融管理局於1993年4月1日成立，此前立法會通過了1992年的《外匯基金條例》修訂案，授權財政司司長任命貨幣當局。\n</p>\n\n<p>\n貨幣當局的權力、職責及責任載列於《外匯基金條例》、《銀行條例》、《金融機構（解決）條例》、《存款保障計劃條例》、《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》，以及其他相關條例中。財政司司長與貨幣當局在貨幣及金融事務方面的職能劃分，見於2003年6月25日來往信件所載明。該信件披露財政司司長向貨幣當局作出的權限轉授內容，且為公眾文件，可在HKMA網頁上找到。\n</p>\n\n<p>\n根據《外匯基金條例》，外匯基金由財政司司長負責管轄。依條例規定，基金的主要用途是影響港元兌換價值。除主要用途外，亦可在顧及此原則的前提下，用以維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定與完整性，以確保香港作為國際金融中心的地位。\n</p>\n\n<p>\n根據《外匯基金條例》，貨幣當局被任命以協助財政司司長履行其在《外匯基金條例》下的職能，並執行其他條例或財政司司長授予的職能。貨幣當局辦事處稱為「香港金融管理局」，而貨幣當局即為香港金融管理局總裁。\n</p>\n\n<p>\n《銀行條例》賦予貨幣當局監管及監督銀行業務及存款業務的責任及權力。根據條例，貨幣當局負責香港持牌銀行、限制牌照銀行及存款公司之發牌。\n</p>\n\n<p>\n《金融機構（解決）條例》規定，貨幣當局為銀行業界實體的解決當事人。貨幣當局擁有廣泛權力，以有序方式處理無法繼續經營的銀行業界實體（其失敗可能導致系統性風險）。目的為維持金融穩定，同時力求保護公眾資金。\n</p>\n\n<p>\n《證券及期貨條例》與《強制性公積金計劃條例》賦予貨幣當局對銀行證券及強制性公積金業務的部分權力。\n</p>\n\n<p>\n根據《保險條例》，保險委員會已將檢查及調查權限授予貨幣當局，針對銀行的保險業務進行監督。\n</p>\n\n<p>\n《防止洗黑錢及反恐融資條例》授權貨幣當局監督銀行遵守條例下的客戶盡職審查及紀錄保存要求。\n</p>\n\n<p>\n《存款保障計劃條例》規定貨幣當局需協助運作存款保障計劃，並在發牌銀行失敗時，觸發從存款保障計劃基金向存款人支付賠償。\n</p>\n\n<p>\n《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》為貨幣當局設立法定機制，以指定及監督在香港運營的重要結算及清算系統，以及零售支付系統。該條例亦授權貨幣當局管理電子及實體「儲值工具」的發牌制度，這些工具用以存儲貨幣價值且符合條例規定的標準。\n</p>\n"}
{"en": "# Corporate Governance\n\nAs Hong Kong’s central banking institution, the HKMA is committed to high standards of corporate governance, as good governance is crucial in maintaining and safeguarding the trust and confidence of the public in the HKMA to fulfil its statutory mandate.\n\nTo achieve its commitment to good corporate governance, the HKMA:\n- puts in place a well-defined governance structure with a high degree of accountability;\n- exercises robust controls to manage risks and ensure that staff behaviours at all levels and its day-to-day operations are consistent with specified standards; and\n- pursues a policy of high transparency and accessibility, and keeps close contacts with stakeholders.\n\n# The HKMA and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government\n\nThe HKMA is an integral part of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government, but is able to employ staff on terms different from those of the civil service in order to attract personnel of the right experience and expertise. The Chief Executive of the HKMA and his staff are public officers. In its day-to-day work, the HKMA operates with a high degree of autonomy within the relevant statutory powers conferred upon, or delegated to, the Monetary Authority.\n\nThe Financial Secretary is responsible for determining the monetary policy objective and the structure of the monetary system of Hong Kong: a letter from the Financial Secretary to the Monetary Authority dated 25 June 2003 specifies that these should be currency stability defined as a stable exchange value at around HK$7.80 to one US dollar maintained by Currency Board arrangements. The Monetary Authority is on his own responsible for achieving the monetary policy objective, including determining the strategy, instruments and operational means for doing so. The Monetary Authority also has responsibilities in relation to the maintenance of the stability and integrity of the monetary system of Hong Kong.\n\nThe Financial Secretary, assisted by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, has responsibility for policies for maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s financial system and the status of Hong Kong as an international financial centre. In support of these policies, the Monetary Authority’s responsibilities include:\n- promoting the general stability and effective working of the banking system;\n- promoting the development of the debt market, in co-operation with other relevant bodies;\n- matters relating to the issuance and circulation of legal tender notes and coins;\n- promoting the safety and efficiency of the financial infrastructure through the development of payment, clearing and settlement systems and, where appropriate, the operation of these systems; and\n- seeking to promote, in co-operation with other relevant bodies, confidence in Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems, and market development initiatives to help strengthen the international competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial services.\n\nThe Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary. The Monetary Authority, under delegation from the Financial Secretary, is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the use of the Exchange Fund, and for the investment management of the Fund.\n\n# Accountability and transparency\n\nThe autonomy given to the HKMA in its day-to-day operations, and in the methods it uses to pursue policy objectives determined by the Government, is complemented by a high degree of accountability and transparency.\n\nThe HKMA serves Hong Kong by promoting monetary and banking stability, by managing the official reserves effectively, and by developing and overseeing a robust and diverse financial infrastructure. These processes help to strengthen Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre and to foster Hong Kong’s economic well-being.\n\nThe HKMA must have the confidence of the community if it is to perform its duties well. The HKMA therefore takes seriously the duty of explaining its policies and work to the general public and makes every effort to address any concerns within the community relevant to the HKMA’s responsibilities. In particular, the HKMA makes timely clarifications on misinformation and rumours about the HKMA’s policies via traditional and social media.\n\nThe HKMA is accountable to the people of Hong Kong through the Financial Secretary, who appoints the Monetary Authority, and through the laws passed by the Legislative Council that set out the Monetary Authority’s powers and responsibilities. The HKMA also recognises a broader responsibility to promote a better understanding of its roles and objectives and to keep itself informed of community concerns. In its day-to-day operations and in its wider contacts with the community, the HKMA pursues a policy of transparency and accessibility. This policy has two main objectives:\n- to keep the financial industry and the public as fully informed about the work of the HKMA as possible, subject to considerations of market sensitivity, commercial confidentiality and statutory restrictions on disclosure of confidential information; and\n- to ensure that the HKMA is in touch with, and responsive to, the community it serves.\n\nThe HKMA seeks to follow international best practices in its transparency arrangements. It maintains extensive relations with the mass media and produces a range of regular and special publications in both English and Chinese. The HKMA’s bilingual website (www.hkma.gov.hk) carries a large number of HKMA publications, press releases, speeches and presentations, in addition to dedicated sections on research, statistics, regulatory resources, consumer information and other topics. Social media platforms are also used to communicate with the public more efficiently in the digital era. The HKMA maintains an Information Centre at its offices, consisting of a library and an exhibition area, which is open to the public six days a week. Further information on the HKMA’s work on public communications and engagement is contained in the Corporate Functions chapter on pages 185 to 193.\n\nOver the years, the HKMA has progressively increased the detail and frequency of its disclosure of information on the Exchange Fund and Currency Board Accounts. Since 1999, the HKMA has participated in the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard project for central banks. The HKMA publishes records of meetings of the Currency Board Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee and the reports on Currency Board operations. The supervisory policies and guidelines on banking have been published on the HKMA website since 1996.\n\nThe relations between the HKMA and the Legislative Council play an important part in promoting accountability and transparency. There is a formal commitment from the Chief Executive of the HKMA to appear before the Panel on Financial Affairs of the Legislative Council three times a year to brief Members and to answer questions on the HKMA’s work. Representatives from the HKMA attend Legislative Council panel and committee meetings from time to time to explain and discuss particular issues and to assist Members in their scrutiny of draft legislation.\n\n# Controls\n\nThe HKMA adopts robust internal and external control mechanisms to ensure that it upholds a high standard of staff conduct, prudent risk management as well as appropriate checks and balances. Internal and external audit functions provide independent assessment on the adequacy and effectiveness of the control mechanisms.\n\n# Code of Conduct\n\nA Code of Conduct, which provides guidance to staff on their ethical and legal responsibilities, is in place to ensure that staff behaviours are consistent with specified standards at all levels.\n\n# Internal controls\n\n# Operational controls\n\nAll departments and divisions have ownership and responsibility to identify and assess risks of their operational processes and put in place appropriate controls for ensuring proper day-to-day operations of the HKMA. This serves as the first line of defence for risk management.\n\n# Organisational risk management\n\nRisk management is also undertaken at the corporate level, with the Risk Committee, chaired by the Chief Executive of the HKMA, being one of the cornerstones of the organisational risk management framework.\n\nPotential and emerging risks identified by the functional units, and the adequacy of the control measures and mitigating strategies they devise, are reported to and discussed at the Risk Committee, which decides on appropriate follow-up actions.\n\n# Internal audit\n\nThe Internal Audit Division of the HKMA independently assesses the adequacy and effectiveness of governance, risk management and control processes of different functional units, and advises on areas for improvement.\n\n# External audit\n\nIn accordance with section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the Audit Commission of the HKSAR Government audits the financial statements of the Exchange Fund. The Commission does not charge for this service. The audited financial statements of the Exchange Fund are included in the HKMA Annual Report.\n", "zh": "\n﻿\n\n# 公司治理\n\n作為香港的中央銀行機構，金管局致力於高標準的公司管治，因為良好的管治對於維護及保障公眾對金管局履行法定職責的信任與信心至關重要。\n\n為實現其對良好公司管治的承諾，金管局：\n- 建立明確的管治架構並具高度責任感；\n- 執行堅強的風險管理控制機制，確保各層級員工行為及其日常運作均符合指定標準；以及\n- 推行高透明度和可接觸性的政策，並與利益相關者保持密切聯絡。\n\n# 金管局與香港特別行政區政府\n\n金管局是香港特別行政區（HKSAR）政府的重要組成部分，但可根據不同於公務員的條件聘用人員，以吸引具有適當經驗和專業知識的人才。金管局總裁及其員工屬公職人員。在日常工作中，金管局在其法定權力範圍內享有高度自主性。\n\n財政司司長負責制定香港的貨幣政策目標及貨幣體系結構：一份於2003年6月25日由財政司司長致金管局的信函指明，該目標應為透過貨幣局安排維持約7.80港元兌1美元的穩定匯價，以達致貨幣穩定。金管局獨自負責任何實現貨幣政策目標，包括確定實現目標的策略、工具及操作手段。金管局亦有維護香港貨幣體系穩定與完整性的責任。\n\n財政司司長（由財政事務及庫務 secretary 支援）對維持香港金融體系穩定與完整性，以及香港作為國際金融中心的地位負有責任。支持這些政策，金管局的責任包括：\n- 推動銀行系統的整體穩定與有效運作；\n- 合作其他相關機構推進債券市場發展；\n- 涉及紙幣與硬幣發行及流通的事項；\n- 通過發展支付、清算及結算系統來提升金融基建的安全性與效率，適當時亦運營這些系統；以及\n- 在與其他相關機構合作下，推廣對香港貨幣及金融體系的信心，並推動市場發展計劃，以增強香港金融服務的國際競爭力。\n\n外匯基金受財政司司長控制。經財政司司長授權，金管局對外匯基金的運用及其投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 質詢與透明度\n\n金管局在日常運作中所享有的自主權，以及其在追求政府設定政策目標時採用的方法，均得到高度質詢與透明度的補充。\n\n金管局通過促進貨幣與銀行業務穩定，有效管理官方儲備，並發展與監督穩健多樣化的金融基礎設施來服務香港。這些程序有助加強香港作為國際金融中心的角色，並促進香港的經濟福祉。\n\n如果金管局要良好執行其職責，則必須獲得社區的信任。因此，金管局重視向公眾解釋其政策和工作，並努力解決與其職責相關的社區關注問題。特別是在資訊不實或謠言方面，金管局利用傳統媒體和社交平台進行及時澄清。\n\n金管局透過財政司司長任命的金管局總裁，以及立法會通過的規定金管局權限和責任的法律，對香港市民負起質詢責任。金管局也認識到一個更廣泛的責任，即促進人們更好地了解其角色和目標，並隨時掌握社區關注點。在其日常運作和與社區的廣泛接觸中，金管局推行透明度和易接觸性政策。此政策主要有兩個目標：\n- 就金管局的工作盡可能全面地讓金融業界及公眾知情，同時考慮市場敏感性、商業保密性及法規限制下的信息披露；以及\n- 確保金管局能接觸並回應其所服務社區的需求。\n\n金管局力求遵循國際最佳實踐進行透明度安排。它與大眾媒體保持廣泛關係，並出版一系列定期和特殊出版物，內容以中英文呈現。金管局雙語網站（www.hkma.gov.hk）載有大量金管局出版物、新聞稿、講話及簡報，除此之外還有專門的Research（研究）、Statistics（統計）、Regulatory Resources（規管資源）、Consumer Information（消費者資料）及其他主題的頁面。在數位時代，還利用社交媒體平台提高與公眾溝通的效率。金管局在其辦公室設有資訊中心，包含圖書館和展覽區，每週開放六天，供公眾參觀。有關金管局在公共溝通和參與方面的詳情請見第185至193頁的《企業功能》章節。\n\n多年來，金管局逐步增加了對外匯基金和貨幣局賬戶信息披露的詳細程度和頻率。自1999年起，金管局參加了國際貨幣基金組織針對央行的「特別數據發布標準」項目。金管局公開了外匯基金諮詢委員會貨幣局小組會議記錄及貨幣局運作報告。自1996年起，金管局已將銀行監管政策和指引上網公布。\n\n金管局與立法會之間的關係在推動質詢與透明度方面發揮重要作用。金管局總裁有正式承諾每年三次出席立法會財務事務委員會，向議員簡報並回答有關金管局工作的問題。金管局代表偶爾會出席立法會委員會和小組會議，說明並討論特定問題，協助議員審查草案法律。\n\n# 控制\n\n金管局採用健全的內部和外部控制機制，以確保其員工行為符合高標準、審慎風險管理和適當的制衡機制。內部和外部審計部門提供獨立評估，以判斷控制機制的充分性和有效性。\n\n# 行為守則\n\n現有一套行為守則，為員工提供在道德與法律責任方面的指導，以確保其行為在所有層次均符合指定標準。\n\n# 內部控制\n\n# 操作控制\n\n所有部門及單位均有責任識別和評估其操作流程的風險，並建立適當的控制措施以確保金管局的日常運作順利進行。這成為風險管理的第一道防線。\n\n# 組織風險管理\n\n風險管理工作也在公司層面進行，由金管局總裁擔任主席的風險委員會是組織風險管理框架的核心之一。\n\n功能部門辨識出的潛在和新出現的風險，以及他們設計的控制措施和緩解策略的有效性，會向風險委員會報告並討論，風險委員會決定採取適當的跟進一步行動。\n\n# 內部審計\n\n金管局內部審計部門獨立評估不同功能部門治理、風險管理和控制過程的充分性和有效性，並就改進區域提供建議。\n\n# 外部審計\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》第七條，香港特別行政區政府審計處審計外匯基金的財務報表。該機構不收取任何費用。經審計的外匯基金財務報表納入金管局年度報告中。\n"}
{"en": "# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nDespite a challenging external environment, the Hong Kong economy staged a positive growth in 2023, thanks to the revivals in inbound tourism and domestic demand. The labour market continued to improve alongside the economic recovery, while inflation remained moderate. Asset markets remained soft amid tightened financial conditions and weak market sentiment. Economic activities for 2024 are expected to recover further at a moderate pace, although the outlook is clouded by multiple external uncertainties.\n\n# The economy in review\n\n# Real activities\n\nHaving navigated through the severe challenges posed by the pandemic in the previous year, the Hong Kong economy grew steadily by 3.2% in 2023 (Table 1 and Chart 1). Domestically, private consumption recovered notably on the back of improved labour market conditions and various support initiatives introduced by the Government, such as the Consumption Voucher Scheme and a series of promotional campaigns. Despite tightened financial conditions, overall investment expenditure registered significant growth against a low base of comparison from the previous year. Externally, Hong Kong’s exports of services rebounded, due mainly to the robust revival of inbound tourism. However, their positive impact on growth was more than offset by the strong recovery in outbound tourism, which was measured as imports of services. On the other hand, exports of goods remained lacklustre amid weak external demand, and put a drag on Hong Kong’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth.\n\nChart 1 Real GDP growth by contribution\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\nTable 1 Real GDP growth by expenditure component (period-over-period)\nNote: The seasonally-adjusted quarter-on-quarter rates of change in the gross domestic fixed capital formation are not available.\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\n# Inflation\n\nLocal inflation remained moderate in 2023 as external price pressures gradually eased, while domestic cost pressures remained broadly in check despite rising slightly as the economy recovered (Chart 2)1. For 2023 as a whole, the underlying and headline inflation rates were 1.7% and 2.1% respectively.\n\n# Labour market\n\nLabour market conditions improved further in 2023, with the unemployment rate falling to a decade-low level of 2.8% in July and hovering at a low level for the remaining months of the year2 (Chart 3). Both labour demand and labour supply increased, as reflected respectively by the pick-up in total employment (Chart 3) and in the labour force. In view of Hong Kong’s manpower shortages, the Government rolled out various labour importation schemes3 and talent attraction initiatives4 in 2023. Meanwhile, with tight labour market conditions, the year-on-year growth rates of nominal wages and of labour earnings increased gradually towards their pre-pandemic levels.\n\nChart 2 Underlying consumer price inflation\n\nChart 3 Labour market conditions\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\n# Stock market\n\nAfter stabilising in early 2023, the local stock market turned sluggish in the second half. Extending its rebound in late 2022, the Hang Seng Index rose to a year-high daily close of 22,689 on 27 January 2023. It then retreated and dropped further to low levels by December (Chart 4), reflecting weak market sentiment due to the banking sector problems in the US and Switzerland in March, as well as weaker global economic prospects and tightened financial conditions in the second half. The Hang Seng Index closed the year at 17,047, down notably by 13.8% from the end of 2022, and marking the fourth consecutive year of decline.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market experienced a rebound in the first four months of 2023 on the back of the resumption of normalcy in the Mainland and Hong Kong, but softened subsequently alongside rising mortgage rates5 and weak market sentiment. Overall, housing prices dropped by 6.9% year on year in 2023, while housing transactions further declined by 4.5% to a record-low of 43,002 units. Housing affordability remained stretched despite improving slightly along with the downward adjustment of housing prices. Similarly, the non-residential property markets continued to face headwinds, with prices of offices, retail premises and flatted factories softened further. The rentals for offices remained under pressure due to high vacancy rates amid the increasing prevalence of work-from-home arrangements and large supply. On the other hand, the rentals for retail premises increased in 2023 with the revival of inbound tourism and the improvement in private consumption.\n\nChart 4 Asset prices\nSources: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited\n\n# Outlook for the economy\n\n# Economic environment\n\nIn 2024, the Hong Kong economy is expected to continue its recovery at a moderate pace. Inbound tourism is set to expand further alongside the continuous improvement in handling capacity and the Government’s effort to promote mega events, while local consumption activities should be supported by a steady labour market. The various infrastructure projects to be taken forward by the Government will also lend support to the economy. Meanwhile, Hong Kong’s exports of goods will likely stabilise alongside the expected upturn in the global technology cycle. The Government forecasts real GDP to grow steadily by 2.5% –3.5% in 20246. However, the outlook is clouded by multiple risks and uncertainties, including those stemming from the US policy rate path, the pace of technology cycle recovery, the prospects for global economic growth, and evolving geopolitical tensions.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nLocal inflation is expected to remain mild in 2024, with softened external price pressures helping to offset the upward pressures on domestic costs amid further economic recovery and rising housing rentals. Market consensus forecasts a headline inflation rate of 2.1% in 2024, while the Government projects the headline and underlying inflation rates to be 2.4% and 1.7% respectively. On the other hand, the labour market is expected to be supported by the ongoing economic recovery, while the various labour importation and talent attraction schemes will continue to help alleviate manpower shortages across different industries.\n\n# Performance of the banking sector\n\nIn 2023, the Hong Kong banking sector faced a number of challenges including a high interest rate environment, heightened volatility in global financial markets caused by the March banking turmoil in the US and Europe, and a slowerthan-expected economic recovery in the Mainland and Hong Kong. Despite these multiple headwinds, the Hong Kong banking sector remained sound and continued to be supported by strong capital and liquidity buffers. The asset quality of the banking sector remained healthy despite an increase in the classified loan ratio. The profitability of banks improved notably, driven by higher net interest income.\n\n# Asset quality\n\nThe classified loan ratio of the banking sector rose to 1.56% at the end of 2023 from 1.40% at the end of 2022, with the overdue and rescheduled loan ratio increasing to 1.24% from 0.85% during the same period (Chart 5). The classified loan ratio for Mainland-related lending also rose to 2.58% at the end of 2023 from 2.26% a year before. The increase in the classified loan ratio was mainly due to downgrades of exposures to Mainland property developers. Nevertheless, the provisions set aside by banks remained sufficient. The provision coverage ratio (i.e.  total provisions to classified loans) stood at 75% at the end of 2023. If the market value of collateral held against the classified loans is taken into account, the adjusted provision coverage ratio would reach around 145%. Meanwhile, the delinquency ratios of residential mortgage lending and credit card lending remained low, at 0.08% and 0.30% respectively, at the end of 2023 (Chart 6).\n\nChart 5 Asset quality of the banking sector\nNote: Figures cover Hong Kong offices, overseas branches and major overseas subsidiaries.\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 6 Delinquency ratios of residential mortgage lending and credit card lending\nSource: HKMA\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe banking sector recorded notable profit growth in 2023. The aggregate pre-tax operating profit of retail banks increased by 62.1% in the year, while the post-tax return on average assets rose to 0.89% from 0.57% during the same period (Chart 7). The improvement in profit was predominantly the result of an increase in net interest income (+30%), coupled with a significant gain in investments held for trading in 2023 as compared to a mild loss in the previous year. This was partly offset by an increase in loan impairment charges (+28%), as specific provisions were set aside for new classified loans. Against the backdrop of rising interest rates, the net interest margin of retail banks widened to 1.68% in 2023 from 1.31% a year before (Chart 8). Meanwhile, retail banks’ cost-to-income ratio fell to 38.8% in 2023 from 48.0% in 2022 (Chart 9).\n\nChart 7 Retail banks’ performance\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 8 Retail banks’ net interest margin\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 9 Retail banks’ cost-to-income ratio\nSource: HKMA\n\n# Balance sheet trends\n\nThe banking sector’s balance sheet grew by 0.9% in 2023, as growths in negotiable debt instruments held (+8.6%) and interbank lending (+4.4%) were mostly offset by a decline in total loans. Given the subdued loan demand amid higher borrowing costs and a weakened global economic outlook, total loans decreased by 3.6% in 2023. Of the total loans, loans for use in Hong Kong remained broadly stable (-0.4%), while loans for use outside Hong Kong and trade finance decreased by 10.4% and 13.1% respectively. Mainlandrelated lending fell by 6.6% in 2023.\n\nOn the liability side, total deposits rose by 5.1% in 2023, compared with a growth of 1.7% in 2022. As total loans declined while total deposits grew, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio decreased to 62.8% at the end of 2023 from 68.5% a year before (Chart 10).\n\n# Capital adequacy\n\nThe banking sector remained well capitalised in 2023. The consolidated total capital ratio of locally incorporated authorized institutions (AIs) stood at 21.1% at the end of 2023, compared with 20.1% a year before. The Tier 1 capital ratio was 18.9% (Chart 11). Both ratios were well above their respective international minimum requirements. The Basel III leverage ratio was 7.9% at the end of 2023 (Chart 12).\n\nChart 10 Loans and deposits of the banking sector\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 11 Consolidated capital ratios of locally incorporated AIs\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 12 Consolidated leverage ratio of locally incorporated AIs\nSource: HKMA\n\n# Liquidity conditions\n\nThe banking sector continued to maintain a strong liquidity position. The quarterly average Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) of category 1 institutions was 178.6% in the fourth quarter of 2023, and the quarterly average Liquidity Maintenance Ratio (LMR) of category 2 institutions was 65.7% (Chart 13). The main source of funding for the banking sector continued to be customer deposits. The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) of category 1 institutions and the Core Funding Ratio (CFR) of category 2A institutions were 144.4% and 169.4% respectively at the end of 2023 (Chart 14). All four ratios were well above the statutory minimum requirements.\n\nChart 13 Liquidity ratios of designated AIs\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 14 Funding ratios of designated AIs\nSource: HKMA\n", "zh": "\n# 經濟與金融環境\n\n儘管面臨挑戰性的外部環境，香港經濟在2023年因入境旅遊及本地需求復甦而實現正面增長。勞工市場隨著經濟復甦持續改善，而通脹保持溫和。資產市場在金融條件收緊及市場情緒疲弱的情況下仍然低迷。預期2024年的經濟活動將以較緩慢的速度進一步復甦，但多項外部不確定因素使前景變得模糊。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 實體活動\n\n經歷前一年疫情帶來的重大挑戰後，香港經濟於2023年穩步增長3.2%（表1及圖表1）。本地方面，由於政府推出如「消費券計劃」及一系列促銷活動等支援措施，加上就業市場狀況改善，私人消費顯著恢復。儘管金融條件收緊，整體投資開支仍相比去年同期低基數取得顯著增長。外圍方面，香港的服務出口反彈，主要受益於入境旅遊的強勁復甦。然而，這種積極影響被出境旅遊的強勁複蘇所抵消，出境旅遊被視為服務進口。另一方面，商品出口仍乏善可陳，受弱勢外圍需求拖累，對香港國內生產總值（GDP）增長形成壓力。\n\n圖表1 按貢獻計算的實際GDP增長  \n來源：統計處\n\n表1 按支出項目計算的實際GDP增長（期間對期間）  \n注意：經季節調整的季度固定資本形成總額變動率未提供。  \n來源：統計處\n\n# 通脹\n\n2023年本地通脹維持溫和水平，因為外部價格壓力逐漸減輕，同時即便經濟復甦導致成本壓力略微上升，但整體仍大致受控（圖表2）。2023年全年，核心通脹率和總體通脹率分別為1.7%和2.1%。\n\n# 勞工市場\n\n2023年，勞工市場情況進一步改善，失業率於7月降至十年最低水平2.8%，並在餘下幾個月內保持低水平（圖表3）（圖表3）。勞工需求和供應均有所增加，分別反映在總就業人數（圖表3）和勞動力的增長上。鑒於香港人力短缺問題，政府於2023年推行各項勞動力輸入方案和人才吸引措施。同時，在緊張的勞工市場情況下，名義工資和勞動收入的按年增長率逐步向疫情前水準靠攏。\n\n圖表2 核心消費者物價通脹  \n\n圖表3 勞工市場情況  \n來源：統計處  \n\n# 股票市場\n\n2023年初股市穩定後，本地股市在第二季度轉為乏力。延續2022年末的反彈，恒生指數於2023年1月27日創下年度最高單日收市點數22,689點。其後回落，至12月進一步下跌至低位（圖表4），反映了美國及瑞士銀行業問題所致的市場情緒疲弱、全球經濟前景不佳以及第二季度後金融條件收緊。恒生指數全年結市為17,047點，較2022年底大幅下跌13.8%，標誌連續第四年下滑。\n\n# 房地產市場\n\n2023年前四個月，住宅樓市因內地與香港常態化復甦而出現反彈，但隨後因房貸利率上升及市場情緒疲弱而轉趨放緩。整體而言，房屋價格同比下跌6.9%，房屋交易進一步減少4.5%至歷史低位的43,002宗。儘管房價向下調整略有改善，住房負擔依然吃重。同樣，非住宅樓市繼續面臨阻力，辦公室、零售店面及板房工廠的物價進一步走軟。由於遠程办公安排日益普遍及大量供應，辦公室租金受到高空置率的壓力。相比之下，零售店面租金在2023年因入境旅遊復甦及私人消費改善而上升。\n\n圖表4 資產價格  \n來源：評估與估值處及香港交易所有限公司\n\n# 經濟展望\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n2024年，香港經濟預計將以適度速度繼續復甦。隨著處理能力的持續提升及政府推動大型活動的努力，入境旅遊將進一步擴展，而本地消費活動將得到穩定就業市場的支持。政府推出的各項基建項目亦將有助於經濟。同時，香港的商品出口料將隨著全球科技週期的預期回升而穩定。政府預測2024年實質GDP將穩步增長2.5%-3.5%。然而，前景仍受多重風險和不確定因素影響，包括美國政策利率路徑、技術週期復甦步伐、全球經濟增長前景及不斷演變的地緣政治緊張局勢。\n\n# 通脹與勞工市場\n\n2024年本地通脹預計維持溫和，外部價格壓力減弱有助於抵消經濟進一步復甦及房租上升造成的內部成本上漲壓力。市場共識預測2024年總體通脹率為2.1%，而政府預計總體及核心通脹率分別為2.4%及1.7%。另一方面，勞工市場將得到經濟復甦的支撐，而各種勞動力輸入及人才吸引方案將持續幫助緩解各行業的人力短缺問題。\n\n# 銀行業表現\n\n2023年，香港銀行業面對多項挑戰，包括高利率環境、由美國及歐洲3月銀行危機引發的全球金融市場波動，以及內地與香港經濟復甦速度不及預期。儘管面臨多重困難，香港銀行業依然健全，並持續獲得強大資本及流動性緩衝支持。即使分類貸款比例上升，銀行業資產質量仍保持健康。銀行盈利明顯改善，主要由更高的淨利息收入驅動。\n\n# 資產質量\n\n銀行業的分類貸款比率於2023年底升至1.56%，較2022年底的1.40%上升，同期逾期及重新安排貸款比率亦增至1.24%，較0.85%上升（圖表5）。內地相關信貸的分類貸款比率於2023年底升至2.58%，較一年前的2.26%上升。分類貸款比率上升主要是因對內地房地產開發商的信貸評級下调。然而，銀行設定的撥備仍足夠。截至2023年底，撥備覆蓋率（即總撥備與分類貸款之比）為75%。若考慮分類貸款所持有的抵押品市值，調整後的撥備覆蓋率將達到約145%。同時，住宅按揭貸款及信用卡貸款的違約比率於2023年底分別為0.08%及0.30%（圖表6）。\n\n圖表5 銀行業資產質量  \n注意：數據涵蓋香港辦事處、海外分支機構及主要海外子公司。  \n來源：香港金融管理局\n\n圖表6 住宅按揭貸款及信用卡貸款違約比率  \n來源：香港金融管理局\n\n# 盈利趨勢\n\n2023年銀行業錄得顯著的利潤增長。零售銀行的總稅前營運利潤在該年增長62.1%，而稅後平均資產回報率則從同一時期的0.57%升至0.89%（圖表7）。利潤改善主要歸因於淨利息收入增加（+30%），以及與去年微虧相比，2023年交易性投資產生重大收益。這部分增益部分被新分類貸款的具體撥備導致貸款減值撥備增加（+28%）所抵銷。在利率上升背景下，零售銀行的淨息差擴大至1.68%，較一年前的1.31%上升（圖表8）。同時，零售銀行的成本收入比於2023年降至38.8%，較2022年的48.0%下降（圖表9）。\n\n圖表7 零售銀行表現  \n來源：香港金融管理局\n\n圖表8 零售銀行淨息差  \n來源：香港金融管理局\n\n圖表9 零售銀行成本收入比  \n來源：香港金融管理局\n\n# 資產負債表趨勢\n\n2023年銀行業資產負債表增長0.9%，因持有的可交易債務證券（+8.6%）及銀行間貸款（+4.4%）的增長幾乎被總貸款減少所抵消。由於借貸成本上升及全球經濟前景弱化，總貸款於2023年減少3.6%。總貸款中，用於香港的貸款大致穩定（-0.4%），而用於境外及貿易融資的貸款分別減少10.4%及13.1%。內地相關信貸於2023年減少6.6%。\n\n負債方面，總存款於2023年增長5.1%，較2022年的1.7%增長更高。總貸款減少而總存款增長，使得整體貸款與存款比率於2023年底降至62.8%，較一年前的68.5%下降（圖表10）。\n\n# 資本充足性\n\n2023年銀行業資本充足狀態良好。根據當地註冊認可機構（AIs）合併總資本比率於2023年底達21.1%，較一年前的20.1%上升。一級資本比率為18.9%（圖表11）。兩項比率皆遠高於各自國際最低要求。巴塞爾III槓桿比率於2023年底為7.9%（圖表12）。\n\n圖表10 銀行業貸款與存款  \n來源：香港金融管理局\n\n圖表11 根據當地註冊AIs的合併資本比率  \n來源：香港金融管理局\n\n圖表12 根據當地註冊AIs的合併槓桿比率  \n來源：香港金融管理局\n\n# 流動性條件\n\n銀行業持續維持強大的流動性地位。2023年第四季，第一類機構的季度平均流動性覆蓋比率（LCR）為178.6%，第二類機構的季度平均流動性維持比率（LMR）為65.7%（圖表13）。銀行業的主要資金來源仍然是客戶存款。第一類機構的淨穩定資金比率（NSFR）及第二類A機構的核心資金比率（CFR）分別於2023年底達144.4%及169.4%（圖表14）。所有四種比率均遠高於法定最低要求。\n\n圖表13 設定AIs的流動性比率  \n來源：香港金融管理局\n\n圖表14 設定AIs的資金比率  \n來源：香港金融管理局\n"}
{"en": "# Monetary Stability\n\nIn 2023, amid market expectations of a “high for longer” US policy rate, the Hong Kong dollar mostly traded on the weak side of the Convertibility Zone, with the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking being triggered eight times between mid-February and early May.  The Hong Kong dollar had regained some momentum since May and traded around the central parity rate of 7.8 at year end.  Under the Linked Exchange Rate System, which marked its 40th anniversary in 2023, the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates generally track their US dollar counterparts, while also being affected by local supply and demand.  Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets remained stable and traded in a smooth and orderly manner.  As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, the Linked Exchange Rate System has shown its strength and resilience to various external shocks time after time.\n\n# Objectives\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability.  This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1.  The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n- Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks;\n- Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation;\n- The Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of clearing account balances kept with the HKMA; and\n- Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs).  With the HKMA standing ready to sell (or buy) Hong Kong dollars to (or from) banks in exchange for US dollars upon request at HK$7.75 (or HK$7.85) per US dollar when the strong-side (or weak-side) CU is triggered, the Aggregate Balance will expand (or contract) to push down (or up) Hong Kong dollar interest rates, helping move the Hong Kong dollar back to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85.\n\n# Review of 2023\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nAmid the market expectation of a “high for longer” US policy rate, the Hong Kong dollar remained soft and mostly traded on the weak side of the Convertibility Zone throughout 2023.  The weak-side CU was triggered eight times from mid-February to early May.  The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate regained some strength during early May to July, partly driven by dividend payment-related demand from listed companies and half-year-end funding needs by corporates. Thereafter, the Hong Kong dollar was mainly driven by the changes in local funding demands, such as buying flows through the Southbound Stock Connect, and traded around the central parity rate of 7.8 at year end (Chart 1).  Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market continued to function normally throughout 2023.\n\nChart 1 Market exchange rate in 2023\n\nFrom February to May, the HKMA purchased a total of HK$51.5 billion at the weak-side CU at the request of banks in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS).  Reflecting the triggering of the weak-side CU, the Aggregate Balance decreased from HK$96.3 billion at the end of 2022 to HK$45.0 billion at the end of 2023. Meanwhile, the outstanding EFBNs increased slightly from HK$1,200.4 billion to HK$1,245.5 billion during the year. The total of the Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs therefore declined from HK$1,296.7 billion at the end of 2022 to HK$1,290.4 billion at the end of 2023 (Chart 2). The Monetary Base as a whole remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\nChart 2 Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding Exchange Fund papers in 2023\n\n# Money market\n\nUnder the LERS, the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs) generally track their US dollar counterparts.  As the US continued to raise interest rates in the first seven months of 2023, the HIBORs generally rose (Chart 3).  For the year as a whole, the overnight, 1-month and 3-month HIBORs increased respectively by 286, 92 and 16 basis points to 6.09%, 5.27% and 5.15% at year end.\n\nFollowing the increases in the target range for the US federal funds rate, the Base Rate was adjusted upwards four times by a total of one percentage point (i.e. 100 basis points) from 4.75% to 5.75%.1 On the retail front, following the US policy rate hikes, many banks raised their Best Lending Rates by 12.5 basis points in early May and another 12.5 basis points in late July.  Some banks also increased the cap on HIBOR-based mortgage rates of newly approved mortgage loans during the year, and the average interest rate of new mortgage loans rose from 3.35% in 2022 to 4.13% in December 2023.  Overall, Hong Kong’s money markets continued to function normally.  Discount Window borrowing increased to HK$38.8 billion in 2023 from HK$8.4 billion in 2022 and no abnormality was noted in the relevant usage.\n\nChart 3 Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates in 2023\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nThe LERS has been a strong anchor of Hong Kong’s financial system for four decades and has shown its strength and resilience to challenges.  Despite lingering uncertainties surrounding the US interest rate path and global economic recovery, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to function in an orderly manner, reflecting the robustness of the LERS.  The Government is firmly committed to the LERS.  In its 2023 External Sector Report, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) once again reiterated that the credibility of the LERS has been ensured by a transparent set of rules, large fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nA robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS.  Hong Kong’s banking sector continued to operate smoothly with liquidity positions and capitalisation faring very well by international standards.  To ensure the resilience of the banking sector, the HKMA has been closely monitoring banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress testing results, and has maintained its supervisory efforts on bank lending.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of the Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) rose from 110.12% at the end of 2022 to a high of 112.71% on 4 May 2023, surpassing the Upper Trigger Level of 112.5% (Chart 4).  This largely reflected the contraction in the Aggregate Balance as a result of the triggering of the weak-side CU in the first half of the year2. In accordance with the arrangement approved by the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee and as a result of the redemption of Certificates of Indebtedness, assets were transferred out of the Backing Portfolio to the Investment Portfolio to reduce the Backing Ratio to around 109.97% on 8 May.  Thereafter, the Backing Ratio rose steadily to close at 110.73% on 31 December.  Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate.  The ample financial resources of the Exchange Fund, together with the sound banking system, provide a powerful backstop to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nChart 4 Daily movement of the Backing Ratio in 2023\n\n# Currency Board Sub-Committee\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong.  In 2023, the CBC considered issues including the May 2022 stablecoin market crash, the transmission of Federal Reserve’s dollar liquidity backstop measures to banks in Hong Kong, and the recent movements in the Hong Kong dollar interest rates.  Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Notes and coins\n\nThe below table summarises the value of the notes and coins in circulation at the end of 2023:\n\nChart 5 Banknotes in circulation by note-issuing banks at the end of 2023\n\nChart 6 Distribution of banknotes in circulation at the end of 2023\n\nChart 7 Banknotes in circulation at the end of 2023\n\nChart 8 Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation at the end of 2023\n\nChart 9 Breakdown of Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation at the end of 2023\n\n# Hong Kong banknotes\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA continued to organise seminars on the design and security features of Hong Kong banknotes for bank tellers, cashiers from retail establishments and students to help enhance their knowledge and skills in authenticating banknotes.  During 2023, 15 seminars were arranged for around 3,000 participants.\n\n# Coin Collection Programme\n\nThe Coin Collection Programme continued to be well received by the public.  More information about the Programme can be found in the Sustainable HKMA chapter of the Sustainability Report 2023.\n\n# Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\n\nThe EFBN Programme operated smoothly.  At the end of 2023, the nominal amount of outstanding Exchange Fund papers stood at around HK$1,255.4 billion (Table 2).\n\nTable 2 Outstanding issues of EFBNs\n\n# Monetary research\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMR)3, the research arm of the Hong Kong Academy of Finance, published 20 working papers and held 17 seminars/ webinars on monetary and financial research topics that are of strategic importance to Hong Kong and the region. The HKIMR also published six eJournals on the Social Science Research Network (SSRN) to disseminate research outputs to SSRN’s global research community.  Moreover, to provide the public with a high-level, non-technical summary of the recently published working papers, the HKIMR published two issues of Insights from Monetary Research.\n\nApart from its research activities, the HKIMR organised four international events, one roundtable and four seminars/ webinars with academia, global central banks and international financial institutions to promote dialogue and exchange on economic and financial issues:\n\n# 9 Mar\n\nA seminar on China’s Rebound: Recent Developments and Outlook by Dr Steven Alan Barnett, Senior Resident Representative in China of the IMF, and Dr Phakawa Jeasakul, Resident Representative for People’s Republic of China – Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) of the IMF, was held. Dr Barnett shared his views on the latest developments in the Chinese economy, as well as short- and medium-term issues that need to be addressed. More than 100 participants attended the seminar.\n\n# 17 Apr\n\nA seminar on Navigating Through a Challenging World was held. Four experts from the IMF shared their views on the analytical chapters of the most recent issues of World Economic Outlook and Global Financial Stability Report by the IMF. Over 50 participants attended the seminar.\n\n# 25 Apr\n\nA seminar with the presentation of the IMF’s April 2023 Global Financial Stability Report titled Safeguarding Global Financial Stability amid High Inflation and Interest Rates by Dr Jason Wu, Assistant Director, and Mr Thomas Pointek, Senior Financial Sector Expert, of the IMF’s Monetary and Capital Markets Department was held. More than 80 participants attended the seminar.\n\n# 2 May\n\nA fireside chat on Asia in a Challenging World was hosted between Mr Krishna Srinivasan, Director of the Asia and Pacific Department of the IMF, and Mr Eddie Yue, Chief Executive of the HKMA. Mr Srinivasan outlined the key messages of the recent IMF Regional Economic Outlook report for Asia and shared his views on the key drivers and risks of the global and regional economy. In addition, the dialogue covered many important issues concerning the regional economy and the evolution of the international monetary system. Around 120 participants attended the event.\n", "zh": "\n# 貨幣穩定\n\n2023年，在市場預期美國政策利率將「長時間維持高位」的背景下，港元大致處於兌換區間的弱方，自2月中期至5月初，弱方兌換承諾共被觸發八次。自五月份起，港元逐步恢復動能，並在年底時大致穩定在7.8港元對1美元的中心匯率水平。根據於2023年迎來40週年的聯繫匯率制度，香港銀行同業拆息（HIBORs）通常追隨其美元相應指標，同時亦受本地供給與需求影響。整體而言，港元匯率及貨幣市場保持穩定，運作順暢有序。作為香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石，聯繫匯率制度歷經各種外部衝擊，充分展現其強大與韌性。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的首要目標是貨幣穩定。此項目標定義為港元的外幣兌換價值穩定，即港元對美元的外匯市場匯率在7.75–7.85港元對1美元的範圍內。貨幣體系的結構特徵為貨幣局制度，要求貨幣基礎至少百分之百由外匯基金持有的美元儲備資產支持，且貨幣基礎的任何變動均需百分之百匹配美元儲備的相應變動。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n- 債務證券，用以完全支持三家發鈔銀行所發行的紙幣；\n- 政府發行流通中的紙幣及硬幣；\n- 總結算餘額，即存放於金管局之結算賬戶餘額的總和；以及\n- 外匯基金票據及債券（EFBNs），由金管局代表政府發行。\n\n港元匯率的穩定性透過自動利息率調節機制和金管局確保履行兌換承諾（CUs）的堅實承諾來實現。當強方或弱方兌換承諾被觸發時，金管局隨時準備按每美元7.75港元（或7.85港元）的匯率向銀行買入或賣出港元，由此促使總結算餘額擴張（或收縮），推低（或提高）港元利息率，幫助港元重新回到7.75至7.85港元的兌換區間。\n\n# 2023年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n在市場預期美國政策利率將「長時間維持高位」的背景下，港元整體偏軟，全年大致處於兌換區間的弱方。弱方兌換承諾從2月中至5月初被觸發八次。五月初至七月初期間，由於上市公司的紅利支付相關需求及企業半年末資金需求推動，港元匯率有所回升。之後，港元主要受本地資金需求變化驅動，例如南向交易的買盤流動，全年最後以約7.8港元對1美元的中心匯率收市（圖表1）。整體而言，港元外匯市場在2023年繼續正常運作。\n\n圖表1 2023年市場匯率\n\n2月至5月期間，根據聯繫匯率制度（LERS）設計，金管局按照銀行要求購入總計515億港元的弱方兌換承諾。反映弱方兌換承諾被觸發的情況，總結算餘額由2022年末的963億港元降至2023年末的450億港元。同時，待償EFBNs在本年度略有增加，由1,200.4億港元增至1,245.5億港元。因此，總結算餘額與待償EFBNs總額由2022年末的1,296.7億港元降至2023年末的1,290.4億港元（圖表2）。整體貨幣基礎仍完全由外匯儲備支持。\n\n圖表2 2023年總結算餘額（扣除貼現窗）及待償外匯基金票據\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n根據LERS，香港銀行同業拆息（HIBORs）通常跟隨其美元相應指標。美國在2023年前七個月持續加息，HIBORs通常上漲（圖表3）。全年來看，過夜、1個月及3個月的HIBORs分別上升286、92及16個基點，至年末分別為6.09%、5.27%及5.15%。\n\n隨著美國聯邦基金利率目標區間的調整，基本利率共上調四次，總幅度達1個百分點（即100個基點），由4.75%升至5.75%。零售方面，美國政策利率上調後，多家銀行於5月初率先將最佳貸出利率上調12.5個基點，並於7月底進一步上調12.5個基點。部分銀行亦於年內提高新批核抵押貸款的HIBOR上限，使新抵押貸款平均利率由2022年的3.35%上升至2023年12月的4.13%。整體而言，香港的貨幣市場運作正常。貼現窗借款由2022年的84億港元增至2023年的388億港元，有關使用情況未見異常。\n\n圖表3 2023年香港銀行同業拆息\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n聯繫匯率制度（LERS）作為香港金融體系的重要支柱已逾四十年，面對美國利率路徑的不確定性和全球經濟複甦的挑戰，該制度顯示出其強大與韌性。儘管存在上述不確定因素，港元外匯及貨幣市場仍然有序運作，反映了LERS的穩健性。政府堅定致力於維護LERS。在其《2023年外匯部門報告》中，國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）重申，LERS的可信度由透明規則、龐大的財政及外匯儲備、健全的金融監管與監督、靈活的經濟體系及謹慎的財政框架確保。\n\n完善的銀行體系對於LERS的正常運作至關重要。香港銀行業繼續順暢運作，流動性狀況及資本充足率在國際標準下表現良好。為確保銀行體系的韌性，金管局一直密切監測銀行對信貸、流動性和利率風險的管理情況及壓力測試結果，並持續加強對銀行放款的監管。\n\n為提高貨幣局帳戶的透明度，自1998年10月起，外匯基金資產的一個指定部分已被用於支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（定義為支持資產除以貨幣基礎）由2022年末的110.12%上升至2023年5月4日的高點112.71%，超越上限觸發水平112.5%（圖表4）。這主要是由於今年上半年弱方兌換承諾觸發導致總結算餘額收窄所致。根據外匯基金諮詢委員會批准的安排，以及因債務證券贖回而轉移資產出支持組合至投資組合，支持比率於5月8日減至約109.97%。此後，支持比率持續上升，至12月31日收盤為110.73%。根據LERS，雖然外匯基金的某些資產已指定用於支持組合，但所有外匯基金資產均可用於支持港元匯率。外匯基金充足的財務資源，加上健全的銀行體系，為香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供了強有力的保障。\n\n圖表4 2023年每日支持比率走勢\n\n# 貨幣局小組委員會\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會下的貨幣局小組委員會（CBC）負責監督及評估與香港貨幣及金融穩定相關的事宜。2023年，CBC探討了包括2022年5月穩定幣市場崩潰、美國聯準會美元流動性救濟措施傳導至香港銀行的情況，以及近期港元利率的走勢等議題。CBC就這些議題的討論記錄及提交給CBC的貨幣局運作報告均已發布於金管局網站。\n\n# 貨幣與硬幣\n\n下表概述了截至2023年年底流通中的紙幣與硬幣價值：\n\n圖表5 截至2023年底發鈔銀行流通紙幣\n\n圖表6 截至2023年底流通紙幣分布\n\n圖表7 截至2023年底流通紙幣\n\n圖表8 截至2023年底政府發行的紙幣與硬幣\n\n圖表9 截至2023年底政府發行的紙幣與硬幣細分\n\n# 香港紙幣\n\n本年度，金管局繼續為銀行櫃員、零售機構收銀員及學生舉辦關於香港紙幣設計及防偽特徵的講座，有助提升他們識別紙幣的能力。2023年，共舉辦15場講座，約有3,000名參與者。\n\n# 硬幣收集計劃\n\n硬幣收集計劃受到公眾廣泛歡迎。更多有關計劃詳情請參閱《2023年可持續發展報告》中的「可持續發展 HKMA 篇章」。\n\n# 外匯基金票據及債券\n\nEFBN 計畫運作順暢。截至2023年年底，待償外匯基金票據面值約為1,2554億港元（表2）。\n\n表2 EFBN 的待償發行量\n\n# 貨幣研究\n\n香港貨幣與金融研究所（HKIMR），香港金融學院的研究機構，出版了20篇工作論文，舉辦了17場有關對香港及地區具有戰略意義的貨幣與金融研究主題的研討會/網絡研討會。HKIMR還在社會科學研究網絡（SSRN）上發表了6期電子期刊，以向SSRN全球研究社區 dissemination 研究成果。此外，為向公眾提供近期發表的工作論文的高層次、非技術性摘要，HKIMR出版了兩期刊物《貨幣研究洞察》。\n\n除了研究活動，HKIMR還組織了四場國際活動、一場圓桌會議及四場與學術界、全球中央銀行及國際金融機構合作的研討會/網絡研討會，以促進經濟及金融問題的對話與交流：\n\n# 3月9日\n\n由國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）中國首席代表Steven Alan Barnett博士及IMF人民共和國中國—香港特別行政區（HKSAR）代表Phakawa Jeasakul博士主辦的講座，內容為「中國的反彈：最新發展與前景」。Barnett博士分享了中國經濟最新發展，以及短期和中期需要解決的問題。超過100人參加了講座。\n\n# 4月17日\n\n舉行了一場關於「在充滿挑戰的世界中尋找出路」的講座。四位來自IMF的專家分享了IMF最新版《世界經濟展望》和《全球金融穩定報告》的分析章節觀點。共有逾50人參加講座。\n\n# 4月25日\n\n由IMF貨幣與資本市場部助理主任Jason Wu博士及資深金融部門專家Thomas Pointek先生主持，針對IMF2023年4月《全球金融穩定報告》的主題「在高通脹和利率環境中保障全球金融穩定」進行講座。超過80人出席講座。\n\n# 5月2日\n\nIMF亞太地區部門主任Krishna Srinivasan與金管局總裁馮鵬飛舉行了關於「充滿挑戰的亞洲」的座談會。Srinivasan概述了IMF最近《亞太地區經濟展望》報告的主要資訊，並分享了全球及區域經濟的主要推動因素和風險。此外，對話涵蓋許多有關亞洲經濟及國際貨幣體系演變的重要議題。約120人參與了活動。\n"}
{"en": "# Banking Stability\n\nThe banking sector in Hong Kong remained strong and resilient in 2023 despite multiple headwinds, including the March banking turmoil in the US and Europe, a high interest rate environment and geopolitical tensions. The HKMA responded swiftly to the March banking turmoil — from managing the ripple effects to completing an internal review (covering such areas as the supervisory processes and resolution framework) drawing lessons for the local banking sector, while maintaining its focus on the credit, liquidity and market risk management of authorized institutions. In light of escalating cyber threats and the increasing use of technology services provided by third parties, the HKMA also worked closely with authorized institutions to enhance their operational and cyber resilience.\n\nThe HKMA enhanced consumer protection in respect of payment cards, and through further revision of the Code of Banking Practice as well as the launch of the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter. The HKMA worked with fellow regulators on a balanced regulatory regime for virtual asset-related activities, streamlined the selling process for sophisticated professional investors, introduced enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Pilot Scheme, and commenced supervision of trust business. A pilot programme was launched to prepare for provision of consumer credit reference services under “Credit Data Smart”.\n\nThe HKMA’s efforts in anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) reflect a commitment to targeting the highest threats under a risk-based approach. To address increasing digital fraud, the HKMA has strengthened ecosystem collaboration through the launch of real-time fraud monitoring and expanding the scope of public-private information-sharing partnerships, including the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce. The launch of a ground-breaking platform to facilitate bank-to-bank information sharing will help address the risk of mule account networks, while the HKMA also worked closely with the industry to take concerted action to handle increasing fraud-related banking complaints and raise public awareness about different scams, including a pre-transaction alert mechanism when using the Faster Payment System. In parallel, supervisory technology capabilities were also advanced through the Macro Analytics pilot scheme.\n\nGood progress was made on implementing international supervisory standards locally, including those on capital adequacy and disclosure. Notable efforts were also made in enhancing capacity building in the banking sector, attracting and nurturing future talents and upskilling existing practitioners. In addition, the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board completed a public consultation on proposed enhancements to the Deposit Protection Scheme.\n\nThe HKMA continued to advance its work to ensure a credible resolution regime. A new resolution standard related to accessing critical financial market infrastructures was developed and a review on experiences of implementing loss-absorbing capacity policy standards was completed. Significant progress was made in resolution planning with banks to address early termination risk and operational continuity in resolution. The HKMA also continued to be active in international policy initiatives and regional co-operation on resolution.\n\n# Objectives\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this objective is contingent upon a highly resilient financial system that is capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their businesses and, in extreme cases, by failing in a disorderly manner. The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring that banks are resilient to shocks and able to recover their positions in response to crises, ultimately helping to prevent failures. The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks and is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs).\n\nThe Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework is not designed to ensure a zero-risk financial system. Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that, in the event of an AI becoming non-viable, its failure can be managed in an orderly manner. To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong has been established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs, among other types of institutions. To operationalise the resolution regime in Hong Kong, it is important to lay down resolution rules and policy standards, undertake resolution planning to remove impediments to AIs’ resolvability and develop the HKMA’s operational capability to resolve a failing AI. In order to carry out these tasks effectively, the HKMA adopts an internationally harmonised and co-ordinated approach.\n\nThe Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs). In overseeing FMIs, the HKMA aims to promote their general safety and efficiency, limit systemic risk and foster transparency. Making FMIs more resilient to financial crises protects the monetary and financial systems in Hong Kong from possible destabilising effects arising from disruption to the FMIs.\n\n# Review of 2023\n\n# Licensing\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA granted one banking licence and one restricted bank licence to two banks incorporated outside Hong Kong. The HKMA also granted money broker approval to four foreign trading platform operators and revoked another approval granted to one money broker. The HKMA revoked authorizations of five licensed banks during the year.\n\nMore information about the AIs and local representative offices in Hong Kong can be found in the Annex and Tables D to F on pages 313 to 316 and 322 to 325 respectively.\n\n# Review of three-tier banking system\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA conducted a comprehensive review on the three-tier banking system in order to simplify the structure of Hong Kong’s banking system. The review found that the three-tier system has become more complex than necessary to achieve the original aim to strike a balance between flexibility of entry into the banking system and protection of small depositors. Subsequently, the HKMA commenced a three-month consultation in June on a proposal to simplify the three-tier banking system into two tiers by merging deposit-taking companies into the restricted licence bank sector, thereby forming a new second tier of Hong Kong’s banking system. Respondents were generally supportive of the proposal.\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA conducted 177 off-site reviews covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL rating assessment1, corporate governance and risk management. As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance, 38 meetings were held with the boards of directors, independent non-executive directors or board-level committees of AIs. Furthermore, 38 tripartite meetings were held among the HKMA, AIs and their external auditors.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA conducted regular on-site examinations on a wide range of AIs’ activities. Credit risk management was a key focus given the challenging credit risk landscape amid a high interest rate environment and debt defaults by some Mainland property developers. The management of operational risk and technology risk was another major focus as the adoption of technology by AIs gathered further momentum. The HKMA also stepped up its supervisory work on climate risk management and rolled out a new round of thematic examinations focused on climaterelated risk governance, and a series of consultative sessions to provide supervisory guidance to AIs.\n\nThe banking turmoil in the US and Europe that started in March 2023 was the most significant system-wide banking stress since the Great Financial Crisis of 2008 in terms of scale and scope. The HKMA stayed on high alert as the turmoil unfolded and took a number of precautionary actions to ensure that any potential fallout would not undermine confidence in the local banking and financial system. After the episode, the HKMA conducted an internal review exercise having regard to the observations and experience gained from the turmoil. Based on this exercise, the HKMA developed a detailed action plan to incorporate lessons learnt with a view to strengthening its supervisory effectiveness and augmenting its ability to handle a banking crisis if one did occur. See Liquidity and market risks on page 95 for more details on the HKMA’s work in this respect.\n\nOn conduct supervision, the HKMA carried out on-site examinations in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses as well as consumer protection matters, supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk or new initiatives.\n\nTable 1 contains a summary of the HKMA’s supervisory activities in 2023.\n\nTable 1 Summary of supervisory activities\n\n# Credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nTotal loans decreased by 3.6% in 2023, compared with a decline of 3.0% in 2022. Table 2 shows the breakdown of growth in loans and advances. Mainland-related lending decreased by 6.6% to HK$4,226 billion in 2023 (Table 3).\n\nTable 2 Growth in loans and advances\n\nTable 3 Growth in Mainland-related lending\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA intensified supervisory efforts in monitoring AIs’ asset quality and assessing their credit risk management practices given the high interest rate environment and continued weakness in the Mainland property market. The asset quality of the banking sector deteriorated during the year but remained manageable. The classified loan ratio of the banking sector was 1.56% at the end of 2023, up from 1.40% at the end of 2022. The classified loan ratio for Mainland-related lending increased to 2.58% from 2.26% at the end of 2022.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA conducted targeted and thematic examinations to evaluate AIs’ credit risk management focusing on exposures to vulnerable sectors, premium financing, oversight of credit risks at operations outside Hong Kong and exposures to non-bank financial institutions.\n\n# Alleviating cash flow pressure faced by bank customers\n\nThe HKMA and the Banking Sector Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) Lending Coordination Mechanism announced in July the commencement of an orderly exit from the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme. The Scheme was introduced in May 2020 to tide eligible corporates over the pandemic. Taking into account the views of the commercial sectors, the partial principal repayment options were enhanced to assist corporates’ gradual return to normal repayment. Where sectors or individual borrowers were still facing challenges despite the end of the pandemic, banks continued to offer principal moratorium or other suitable credit relief measures on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe HKMA also encouraged banks to be sympathetic in handling the funding needs of corporates which had not participated in the Scheme but were facing cash flow pressures due to individual circumstances. The HKMA reminded banks to follow the “Hong Kong Approach to Corporate Difficulties” guidelines in dealing with corporates encountering repayment problems, so that individual banks would act collaboratively in the common interest of the lenders involved.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nThe successive rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures introduced by the HKMA since 2009 have strengthened banks’ risk management of their property mortgage lending business and the banking sector’s capacity to cope with challenges arising from a sharp correction in property prices. The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of new residential mortgage loans approved in 2023 stood at 57%, compared with 64% in September 2009 before the countercyclical measures were first introduced (Chart 1). The average debt servicing ratio (DSR) of new mortgages stayed low at 40% in 2023, compared with 41% in August 2010 when a cap on DSR was first applied.\n\nOn 7 July, the HKMA adjusted the countercyclical macroprudential measures after taking into account factors such as property prices, transaction volumes and the local and external economic environment. This was the first time the countercyclical macroprudential measures for residential properties were relaxed since their introduction in 2009. The adjustments included increasing the maximum LTV ratios for residential properties and commercial properties, as well as for mortgage loans assessed based on the net worth of mortgage applicants. In addition, the requirements to lower the applicable maximum LTV ratio and DSR limit by ten percentage points for mortgage applicants with incomes derived mainly from places outside of Hong Kong were lifted. The HKMA also removed the requirement to apply a five-percentage-point reduction on applicable DSR limits when mortgage applicants’ total mortgage finance exceeded the HKMA’s normal permissible LTV ceilings by 20 percentage points.\n\nChart 1 Average LTV ratio and DSR of new residential mortgage loans approved\n", "zh": "\n# 銀行穩定性\n\n2023年香港銀行業整體表現強健且具有韌性，儘管面臨多種挑戰，包括美國及歐洲三月的銀行危機、高利率環境及地緣政治緊張局勢。金管局迅速應對三月銀行危機——從管理連帶影響到完成內部審查（涵蓋監督程序及解決框架等領域），總結經驗以提升本地銀行業的抗風險能力，同時持續關注授權機構的信貸、流動性和市場風險管理工作。鑑於網絡攻擊威脅加劇及第三方技術服務使用的增加，金管局亦與授權機構密切合作，增強其營運及網絡彈性。\n\n金管局在支付卡相關消費者保護方面採取更嚴格措施，通過進一步修訂《銀行實務守則》以及推出《反詐騙消費者保護承諾書》。金管局與其他監管機構共同制定針對虛擬資產活動的平衡規範制度，簡化專業投資者銷售流程，引入跨境理財通試點計劃的改進措施，並啟動信託業務監督。為準備「信貸數據智慧」項目下消費信貸資料服務的提供，金管局推出了試點計畫。\n\n金管局在反洗錢及防止資助恐怖主義（AML/CFT）方面的努力體現出一種基於風險的方法，專注於針對最高威脅進行監管。為了應對日益嚴重的數位詐欺，金管局透過推出即時詐欺監測系統擴展公私部門資訊共享夥伴關係（包括詐欺與資金洗白情報特別小組）來加強生態系統合作。推出一個突破性平台，促進銀行間資訊共享，將有助於應對販子賬戶網絡的風險，同時金管局也與業界密切協調，採取聯合行動處理日益增多的詐欺相關銀行投訴，提高公眾對各種詐騙手段的認識，包括在使用快速支付系統時推出的交易前警示機制。同時，監管科技能力也在宏觀分析試點方案中得到提升。\n\n在本地實施國際監管標準方面取得良好進展，包括資本充足率和披露條款。還在銀行業能力建設上做出顯著努力，吸引和培育未來人才並提昇現有人員技能。此外，香港存款保障委員會完成了有關存款保障計劃擬議改進措施的公眾諮詢。\n\n金管局繼續推進確保可信解決制度的工作。開發了一項與接觸關鍵金融市場基建相關的新解決標準，並完成對執行損失吸收能力政策標準經驗的審查。在解決規劃方面取得重大進展，銀行旨在應對提前終止風險及解決過程中的營運連續性。金管局也持續參與國際政策倡議及區域合作解決問題。\n\n# 目標\n\n金管局的目標是推動銀行系統的安全和穩定。達成此目標取決於一個高度具韌性的金融系統，能夠提供香港經濟所需要的關鍵金融服務。\n\n銀行通過其業務經營方式會影響系統的穩定性，在極端情況下可能因混亂失敗而產生影響。作為監督機構，貨幣當局在確保銀行具有抵禦衝擊的能力並能在危機中恢復地位方面發揮關鍵作用，最終幫助預防失敗。貨幣當局負責銀行的審慎監督，並被授權對香港的持牌銀行、限制牌照銀行和存款機構進行許可，這些機構合稱為授權機構（AIs）。\n\n香港的審慎監管架構並非設計為確保零風險的金融系統。相反，作為解決機構，貨幣當局旨在確保一旦某個AIs無法維持，其失敗能以有序的方式處理。為此，已建立了一套針對香港金融機構的解決制度，根據該制度，貨幣當局是AIs等若干類型機構的解決機構。為在香港具體實施解決制度，重要的是制定解決規則和政策標準，進行解決規劃以消除AIs可解決性的障礙，並發展貨幣當局解決失敗AIs的操作能力。為有效執行這些任務，貨幣當局採用國際統一協調的方法。\n\n貨幣當局還負責指定和監督某些金融市場基建（FMIs）。在監督FMIs時，金管局旨在促進其一般安全性與效率，限制系統性風險並促進透明度。使FMIs更具韌性以應對金融危機，有助於保護香港的貨幣和金融系統免受FMIs中斷可能帶來的不穩定影響。\n\n# 2023年回顧\n\n# 授牌\n\n在今年期間，金管局向兩家註冊在外地的銀行頒發了銀行牌照和一家限制牌照銀行許可證。金管局亦批准四家外國交易平台操作商成為資金經紀人，並撤銷另一家資金經紀人的批准。金管局於今年撤銷五家持牌銀行的授權。\n\n更多關於AIs和在香港的本地代表辦事處的資訊，請參閱附錄及第313至316頁和322至325頁的表D至F。\n\n# 三層銀行制度的審視\n\n2023年，金管局對三層銀行制度進行了全面審視，以簡化香港銀行業結構。審視發現，三層制度現在變得比原初目標所需的更複雜，以達到入門靈活性與保護小型存戶之間的平衡。隨後，金管局於六月開始進行三個月的諮詢，提出將三層銀行制度簡化為兩層的建議，將存款機構納入限制牌照銀行部門，從而形成香港銀行業新的第二層。大部分意見表示支持這個建議。\n\n# 監督活動概覽\n\n2023年，金管局進行了177次遠程審查，涵蓋廣泛的議題，包括CAMEL評級評估、公司治理和風險管理。作為金管局持續推動更強風險治理的努力的一部分，召開了38次與AIs董事會、獨立非執行董事或董事會級別委員會的會議。此外，還舉辦了38次三方會議，會同金管局、AIs及其外部審計師。\n\n除遠程活動外，金管局定期對大量AIs的活動進行現場檢查。由於高利率環境及內地房地產開發商債務違約造成的信貸風險景況，信貸風險管理成為重點關注領域。隨著AIs技術應用的進一步推進，操作風險和技術風險管理也是主要焦點。金管局也加強了氣候風險管理的監督工作，推出了一系列針對氣候相關風險治理的主題檢查，並舉行一系列諮詢會以提供監督指導給AIs。\n\n2023年3月開始的美國和歐洲銀行危機是自2008年大蕭條以來規模和範圍最大的系統性銀行壓力事件。金管局在危機中保持高度警惕，採取了一些預防措施，確保任何潛在後果不會損害本地銀行和金融系統的信心。危機後，金管局進行了一次內部審查，考慮觀察和從危機中獲得的經驗。根據這次審查，金管局制定了詳細的行動計劃，結合所學經驗，以加強其監督有效性並增強在發生銀行危機時處理危機的能力。有關金管局在此方面的詳細工作，請參閱第95頁的流動性與市場風險。\n\n在行為監督方面，金管局對證券、投資產品、保險和強制性公積金（MPF）相關業務進行了現場檢查，並補充對高風險或新業務領域的主題審查。\n\n表1概述了金管局在2023年的監督活動。\n\n表1 監督活動摘要\n\n# 信用風險\n\n# 信貸增長與資產質量\n\n2023年總貸款較2022年減少3.6%，2022年為減少3.0%。表2顯示了貸款和信貸的增長情況。內地相關信貸在2023年減少了6.6%，降至4,2260億港元（表3）。\n\n表2 貸款和信貸的增長\n\n表3 內地相關信貸的增長\n\n2023年，金管局加強對AIs資產質量的監督及評估其信貸風險管理實務，這是因為高利率環境及內地房地產業持續疲軟。銀行業的資產質量在這一年有所惡化，但仍然可控。銀行業的分類信貸比例在2023年底為1.56%，較2022年底的1.40%有所上升。內地相關信貸的分類信貸比例從2022年底的2.26%升至2.58%。\n\n全年內，金管局進行了針對性及主題式檢查，以評估AIs的信貸風險管理，重點關注易受影響部門的信貸敞口、高額融資、海外業務的信貸風險監控及對非銀行金融機構的信貸敞口。\n\n# 減輕銀行客戶的現金流壓力\n\n金管局與銀行業中小企業（SME）信貸協調機制於七月宣布逐步退出預批準本金寬限期計劃。該計劃於2020年5月推出，用以幫助合格企業渡過疫情。鑑於商業界的看法，我們加強了部分本金償還選項，協助企業逐漸恢復正常償還。如果某些行業或個人借款人即使在疫情結束後仍面臨困難，銀行會根據個案情況繼續提供本金延緩償還或其他適當的信貸緩解措施。\n\n金管局亦鼓勵銀行在處理未參與該計劃但因特殊情況面臨現金流壓力的企業資金需求時給予同情。金管局提醒銀行遵循「香港企業困難處理方法」指南來處理遇到償還問題的企業，這樣各銀行就會以貸方的共同利益為前提進行協作。\n\n# 房屋按揭信貸\n\n自2009年起，金管局推出的一系列逆周期宏觀審慎措施已經加強了銀行對房屋按揭信貸業務的风险管理能力和銀行業應對樓價大幅下跌挑戰的能力。2023年新批准住宅按揭貸款的平均貸款價值比率(LTV)為57%，較2009年9月首次推出逆周期措施時的64%有所下降(圖1)。2023年新房貸的平均債務償還比率(DSR)保持低水平，為40%，較2010年8月首次適用DSR上限時的41%略低。\n\n7月7日，金管局在考慮樓價、交易量以及本地和外圍經濟環境等因素後，調整了逆周期宏觀審慎措施。這是自2009年引入該措施以來首次放鬆住宅物業的逆周期宏觀審慎措施。調整內容包括提高住宅物業和商用地產的最高貸款價值比率(LTV)，以及根據按揭申請人淨資產計算的按揭貸款。此外，對於主要收入來自香港以外地區的按揭申請人，降低適用最高LTV比率和DSR限額十個百分點的要求已被取消。金管局同時取消了當按揭申請人總房貸融資超過金管局常規允許的LTV上限20個百分點時，需適用DSR限額降低五個百分點的要求。\n\n圖1 新住宅按揭貸款的平均LTV比率和DSR\n"}
{"en": "# International Financial Centre\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA utilised a multi-pronged approach to achieve notable progress in consolidating Hong Kong’s status as a globally competitive international financial centre.\n\nThe success of two major events, namely the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit and the HKMA-BIS High-Level Conference, had reinforced Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre and created positive ripple effects.\n\nThe HKMA, together with its Mainland and Hong Kong counterparts, made concerted efforts to deepen and widen the mutual access between the financial markets of Hong Kong and the Mainland. This included enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Scheme in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, the designation of additional market makers for Southbound Trading under Bond Connect, the successful launch of Northbound Trading of Swap Connect, and the roll-out of the HKD-RMB Dual Counter Model and the Dual Counter Market Making Programme. These initiatives were effective in strengthening Hong Kong’s gateway position and reinforcing the city’s status as a global hub for offshore renminbi business.\n\nThe HKMA also made good progress in strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, in areas including bond issuance, asset and wealth management, green and sustainable finance, and corporate treasury centres. To promote Hong Kong’s financial services, the HKMA stepped up its market outreach activities to overseas and Mainland stakeholders to keep them well informed about the opportunities in Hong Kong’s financial market and its resilience.\n\nSignificant progress has been made on all fronts of the HKMA’s “Fintech 2025” strategy, including in areas such as promoting fintech adoption, Central Bank Digital Currency, data infrastructure, talent development, and policies and funding support.\n\nThe Faster Payment System (FPS) marked its fifth anniversary in September. The number of registrations has grown steadily, and had reached 13.6 million at the end of 2023. The average daily turnover for the year rose to 1.25 million real-time transactions. FPS x PromptPay link for cross-border QR payment between Hong Kong and Thailand was jointly launched with the Bank of Thailand in December, providing a fast, secure and easily accessible cross-border retail payment service for people travelling between the two places.\n\nAs an active member of many international and regional central banking and regulatory forums, the HKMA continued to contribute to global efforts to maintain financial stability and promote financial market developments.\n\n# Overview\n\nThroughout the year, the HKMA continued making proactive efforts to strengthen Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre. In November, it organised the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit for the second year. This three-day event brought together prominent financial leaders from around the world to share their unique perspectives under the theme of “Living with Complexity”. With over 350 participants from 160 international financial institutions attending, the summit clearly showed the global financial sector’s commitment to and confidence in Hong Kong. In the same month, the HKMA and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) co-hosted the HKMA-BIS High Level Conference, which attracted more than 300 participants, including over 20 current and former central bank governors. The conference highlighted the HKMA’s close collaboration with the BIS as well as with the international central banking community.\n\nThe expansion of and enhancements made to the MainlandHong Kong Connect schemes have reinforced Hong Kong’s role as the bridge between the Mainland and international financial markets. A series of enhancements to the Crossboundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) scheme were introduced to facilitate cross-boundary retail investment in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA). Riding on the smooth operations of Southbound Bond Connect, the HKMA designated nine additional market makers to improve secondary liquidity and meet investor demand. Northbound Trading of Swap Connect was successfully launched in the year, enabling global investors to better manage the interest rate risks associated with their Mainland fixed income portfolio via Hong Kong.\n\nHong Kong’s offshore renminbi businesses saw robust growth during the year. The HKMA collaborated with the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) to launch the HKD-RMB Dual Counter Model and the Dual Counter Market Making Programme in June. This helped develop a more diverse range of renminbi-denominated products in Hong Kong by facilitating the issuance and trading of renminbidenominated stocks in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA continued to work on strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. In particular, to enhance Hong Kong’s appeal as a preferred fund management centre, the HKMA worked closely with the Government and the financial industry to provide a more facilitative tax and regulatory environment. Significant progress was also made in promoting innovation in Hong Kong’s bond market, and consolidating Hong Kong’s position as a regional green and sustainable finance hub. At the same time, the HKMA stepped up its market outreach activities to promote Hong Kong’s financial services to overseas and Mainland stakeholders.\n\nBoth the Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO) and the banking departments of the HKMA continued to implement the “Fintech 2025” strategy1 to promote wide adoption of financial technology (fintech) and strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia. Key initiatives implemented during the year included:\n- promoting further adoption in the tech focus areas of Wealthtech, Insurtech, Greentech, artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology (DLT);\n- advancing the work on wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) to improve cross-border payments;\n- progressing further in the study on the prospect of introducing a retail CBDC in Hong Kong, i.e. an e-HKD;\n- stepping up efforts to develop Commercial Data Interchange (CDI);\n- enhancing talent development;\n- nurturing the fintech ecosystem through funding and policies;\n- strengthening cross-border collaboration in fintech; and\n- expanding the adoption of the FPS.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure is vital for maintaining the city’s position as a leading international financial centre. In 2023, the four interbank Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) and the Hong Kong Trade Repository (HKTR) achieved 100%2 system availability, outperforming the target of 99.95%. The debt securities settlement service, including the Northbound and Southbound Bond Connect linkage service, continued to operate smoothly.\n\nAdoption of the FPS continued to increase in 2023, marking the significant milestone of the FPS reaching its fifth anniversary. The number of registrations for the FPS and the FPS turnover have grown steadily over the past five years, with the number of registrations growing to 13.6 million at the end of 2023 and the average daily turnover for the year rising by 33% from 2022. The increased use of the FPS for settling Government bills, making merchant payments, and topping up Stored Value Facility (SVF) e-wallets or bank accounts, were key drivers for the continued rise in the transaction volume, on top of steady growth in person-toperson and business payments.\n\nTo ensure the safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA oversees six designated retail payment systems (RPSs) and supervises 17 licensed SVFs (four of which are SVFs issued by licensed banks) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO). During the year, the HKMA also continued to facilitate the smooth implementation of the Government’s Consumption Voucher Scheme, helping to co-ordinate the relevant Government parties and the SVF licensees appointed for the scheme, and facilitate dialogue and co-operation between them.\n\nOn 27 December, the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau and the HKMA jointly issued a public consultation paper on regulation for stablecoin issuers. The HKMA subsequently introduced a sandbox arrangement on 12 March 2024 for institutions planning to issue fiat-referenced stablecoins in Hong Kong. At the same time, the HKMA has been actively participating in the work of international bodies in relation to crypto-asset activities, and monitoring the development of the market closely.\n\nInternationally, the HKMA has remained an active member of the central banking community and continued to play a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees. Currently, the HKMA co-chairs the Policy and Standards Group of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), as well as the Regional Consultative Group for Asia, the Non-Bank Monitoring Experts Group (until June) and the Financial Innovation Network of the Financial Stability Board (FSB). The HKMA also chairs the BIS’ Meeting of Governors from Major Emerging Market Economies (EMEs). Between 2018 and 2023, the HKMA served consecutive terms as the chair of the Working Group on Financial Markets established under the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP)3.\n\nThe HKMA also held bilateral meetings with the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates and the Saudi Central Bank in May and July respectively to promote investment and financial market connectivity between the Middle East and Asia.

{"en": "# Reserves Management\n\nThe investment environment in 2023 was volatile and challenging. Although some banks in the US and Europe experienced liquidity issues at the beginning of the year, the associated risks did not spread across the financial markets. While levels of inflation in major developed economies have declined from their peak in 2023, they have remained above the targets set by major central banks. Following an aggressive rate hike cycle, the US Federal Reserve has paused hiking rate since the third quarter, and indicated that the policy rate was likely at or near its peak. This, coupled with a resilient US economy, has made investor sentiment more optimistic. However, ongoing geopolitical tensions, such as the Russia-Ukraine war and the outbreak of conflict in the Middle East during the year, added turbulence and uncertainties to the investment market. In this complicated and dynamic investment environment, the investment performance of the Exchange Fund experienced some ups and downs. Despite this, the Exchange Fund managed to achieve a decent investment return. In 2023, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$226.0 billion, representing an investment return of 5.5%.\n\n# The Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems in order to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The HKMA, under the delegated authority of the Financial Secretary and within the terms of the delegation, is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# Management of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(i) To preserve capital;\n(ii) To ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(iii) To ensure that sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(iv) Subject to (i)–(iii), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Exchange Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 Portfolio segregation of the Exchange Fund\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP). The BP holds highly liquid US dollardenominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base, as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The IP invests primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member economies of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, with a view to preserving the value and long-term purchasing power of its assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA diversifies part of the Exchange Fund’s investments in a prudent and incremental manner into a wider variety of asset classes. These include emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The target asset allocation of the LTGP is determined concurrently with that of other asset classes, subject to prudent risk management principles and portfolio diversification strategy.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007, holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that have been acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes. Due to its unique nature, the Strategic Portfolio is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by the Fiscal Reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP1. A major exception is the Future Fund2, which links its interest rate to the return of both the IP and the LTGP in accordance with the portfolio mix. The portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 35:65 in 2023.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: strategic asset allocation and tactical asset allocation. Strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents long-term asset allocation based on the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark (or strategic) allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and tracking error3 limit are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with the EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may assume positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nThe HKMA’s Exchange Fund Investment Office houses the Exchange Fund’s investment and related risk management functions. Exchange Fund Investment Office staff members directly manage about 71% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, comprising the entire BP and part of the IP. The part of the IP managed internally includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 29% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes. The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to realise sustainable returns, while also drawing on diverse and complementary investment styles and taking advantage of external market insights and technical expertise in investment.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is determined primarily by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nAs the investment environment becomes more complex, good risk management is increasingly important. The HKMA sets stringent controls and investment guidelines for both its internally and externally managed portfolios, and ensures that a proper risk monitoring and compliance system is in place. Three lines of defence are in place to implement effective risk management and governance of investment-related activities. Key risk categories (including credit, market, liquidity and operational risks) are regularly monitored. The risk management process provides a robust framework that supports the HKMA’s strategic planning and investment diversification efforts.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nThe HKMA believes that an appropriate emphasis on responsible investment and sustainable long-term economic performance can help better achieve the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund, as well as reduce risks associated with environmental, social and governance (ESG)-related matters of its underlying investments. To embrace responsible investment practices, the HKMA has integrated ESG factors into the investment processes of the Exchange Fund, with the guiding principle that priority will generally be given to ESG investments if their long-term risk-adjusted returns are comparable with other investments. For more details about the HKMA’s responsible investment work, see the Responsible Investment chapter of the Sustainability Report 2023.\n\n# Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\n# The financial markets in 2023\n\nThe investment environment in 2023 was volatile and challenging.\n\nGlobal equities were generally on an upward trend in 2023. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose by 24% during the year, especially in the fourth quarter as markets began to anticipate sooner-than-expected rate cuts.\n\nIn the bond markets, yields remained high, with the 10-year US Treasury yield surging above 5% at one point to reach its highest level since 2007. However, as market expectations of central banks’ monetary policies shifted, bond yields retreated towards the end of the year alongside a gradual increase in bond prices.\n\nIn the currency markets, the US dollar recorded a mixed performance against major currencies. Among these, the pound sterling and the euro appreciated against the US dollar, while the yen and the renminbi depreciated.\n\nThe performance of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2023 is shown in Table 1.\n\nTable 1 2023 market returns\n\n# Reserves Management\n\n# Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$226.0 billion in 2023. This comprised gains on bonds of HK$144.7 billion, gains on equities of HK$58.1 billion (with gains of HK$73.6 billion from foreign equities, and losses of HK$15.5 billion from Hong Kong equities), a negative currency translation effect of HK$0.5 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets, and gains of HK$23.7 billion on other investments held by the investment-holding subsidiaries of the Fund. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation loss of HK$4.8 billion.\n\nTotal assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,016.5 billion at the end of the year. The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$517.3 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$411.9 billion and real estate HK$105.4 billion. Outstanding investment commitments of the LTGP amounted to HK$291.1 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund in 2023, excluding the Strategic Portfolio, was 5.5%. The returns of the IP and the BP were 6.4% and 5.0% respectively. The LTGP has recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 11.8% since its inception in 2009.\n\nThe annual returns of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2023 are set out in Chart 1. Table 2 shows the 2023 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over several different time horizons. The average return was 1.6% during 2021–2023, 3.3% during 2019–2023, 2.7% during 2014–2023 and 4.5% since 1994.

It contains the register of authorized institutions (AIs) and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance (BO), as well as the register of stored value facility licensees under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance.\n\nThe HKMA has been releasing financial data and important information on its website via an Open Application Programming Interface (Open API) in phases since 2018. By the end of 2023, the HKMA had opened up 175 sets of Open APIs on its website, in line with its target schedule.\n\nThe HKMA’s Open API portal:\n\n# Information Centre\n\nLocated on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre, the HKMA Information Centre consists of an exhibition area and a library designed to introduce the work of the HKMA to the community and enhance public awareness of monetary and banking matters. The interactive exhibition area presents an overview of the HKMA’s work, and of the development of money and banking in Hong Kong, along with information and exhibits useful for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nDuring the year, the Information Centre welcomed more than 31,000 visitors and hosted over 480 guided tours for schools and other groups.\n\nThe library, next to the exhibition area, houses over 26,000 books, journals and other publications on Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs as well as central banking topics.

To date, more than 66,000 people have participated in the public education programme. In 2023, a webinar was organised for over 1,200 students and teachers from 58 secondary schools. The webinar topics included an overview of the HKMA’s work, the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, protection of personal digital keys, the Deposit Protection Scheme, green finance, and career opportunities in the banking industry.\n\nThe HKMA educates and engages the public on how to be smart and responsible financial consumers. In light of the rise in phishing scams and credit card fraud, the HKMA continued its efforts across different media to remind the public to stay vigilant. A brand new awareness campaign was rolled out following the launch of the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter, emphasising that banks and major merchants have committed not to send hyperlinks via instant electronic messages soliciting personal and credit card information. The HKMA also passed on smart tips on credit cards, personal loans, online shopping, banking services and different payment options (including “Buy Now, Pay Later” products) via radio and social media channels.\n\nA new video and animations with cannibal plant and animal trap are produced with the theme “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!”\n\nCross-media publicity is produced reminding members of the public not to click on suspicious links\n\nAnimated video to promote e-laisees\n\nIn support of the environment, and drawing on technological advances in financial services, the HKMA encouraged members of the public to give out electronic lai sees (e-laisees) and to consider using good-as-new banknotes for physical lai sees over the Chinese New Year through social media and radio promotions.\n\nThe HKMA also seeks to enhance public understanding of the financial industry and raise young people’s interest in pursuing a career in the industry, thus enlarging Hong Kong’s talent pool for the financial industry. Following positive feedback for its earlier video series “Four Faces of Talents in Central”, the HKMA launched a new video series titled “Financial Special Forces: Unleashing New Horizons” that featured four growth areas in the financial industry: data science, fintech, green and sustainable finance, and wealth management. The video series utilised computer graphics and animation to show seasoned market practitioners supervising young talents as they managed daily work challenges, providing a light-touch introduction to career opportunities and prospects within the industry.\n\nA video series “Financial Special Forces: Unleashing New Horizons” is produced to keep the younger generation abreast of career opportunities in finance\n\nMentors from different areas sharing their expertise and experience with students\n\nTo enhance financial literacy among secondary school students, the HKMA worked with other stakeholders to co-organise the “Hong Kong Financial Literacy Championship” for the ninth consecutive year. Under the theme of digital and sustainable economy, the event helped students learn more about money management, green and sustainability, the current state of the financial market and career opportunities. It also included an online quiz that received around 20,000 submissions, mentoring by experienced practitioners from diverse areas, and design thinking challenge.\n\n# $mart Money Management 321\n\nThe HKMA launched its first financial education board game called “$mart Money Management 321”, which is jointly designed and developed with a social enterprise specialising in board game production. The board game was designed to help primary school students learn about different payment methods, money management concepts, fintech and cybersecurity in a simulated setting.\n\nThe HKMA took a booth at the Hong Kong Book Fair 2023 to promote the board game, which was one of the best-selling items at the Fair. In addition, the HKMA organised a series of free promotional activities, which included workshops in community centres, trials for students in primary schools, and train-the-trainer workshops for primary school teachers and social workers at non-governmental organisations, as well as running a “$mart Money Management Experiential Centre” at PMQ during the festive season.\n\nThe HKMA’s first financial education board game, “$mart Money Management 321”, and the “$mart Money Management Experiential Centre” receive several international design awards\n\nFollowing its launch at the Hong Kong Book Fair, the board game is promoted through train-the-trainer workshops, student trial sessions and an experiential centre at PMQ\n\nThe HKMA also collaborated with different stakeholders in a number of community engagement programmes. One of these was the second phase of a cross-generation outreach educational programme, organised jointly with an educational institution. It included a bank simulation game along with talks targeting kindergarten students, their parents and teachers, and young adults.\n\nThe HKMA continued to support the work of the Investor and Financial Education Council in promoting financial literacy and financial capacity in Hong Kong. It will explore further collaboration with different stakeholders to maximise the impact of its community engagement work.\n\n# Financial disclosure\n\nTo maintain a high level of transparency, the HKMA adopts international standards in financial disclosure insofar as they are applicable to central banking operations. These include the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and other applicable reporting requirements, such as the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard. The Finance Division works with external auditors and other accounting professionals to prepare and present the Exchange Fund’s financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards. The HKMA also provides detailed disclosures and thorough analyses of a wide range of expense items and budgetary information in its Annual Report.\n\n# Accountability and controls\n\n# Risk management\n\nOne of the HKMA’s most important tasks is to manage risks to the monetary and banking systems.

{"en": "# The Exchange Fund\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 211 to 311, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2023, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including material accounting policy information.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2023, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards. My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report. I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises all the information included in the 2023 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. I also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and\n- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nProf. LAM Chi Yuen Nelson\nDirector of Audit\n\n# 1 PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES\n\nThe Monetary Authority, under delegated authority from the Financial Secretary as Controller of the Exchange Fund (the Fund), manages the Fund in accordance with the provisions of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66). The principal activities of the Fund are safeguarding the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong and maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems.\n\nThe assets of the Fund are managed as four portfolios: the Backing Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio and the Strategic Portfolio. The assets of the Backing Portfolio fully match the Monetary Base, under Hong Kong’s Currency Board system. The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The Long-Term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments. The Strategic Portfolio holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited acquired by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government for the account of the Fund for strategic purposes. Operating segment information is set out in note 31.\n\n# 2 MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n# 2.1 Statement of compliance\n\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRSs), which is a collective term that includes all applicable individual HKFRSs, Hong Kong Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), and accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong. Material accounting policies adopted by the Fund and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) is set out below.\n\nThe HKICPA has issued certain new or revised HKFRSs that are first effective or available for early adoption for the current accounting period of the Group. Note 3 provides information on the changes, if any, in accounting policies resulting from initial application of these developments to the extent that they are relevant to the Group for the current and prior accounting periods reflected in these financial statements.\n\n# 2.2 Basis of preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe Group financial statements include the financial statements of the Group as well as the Group’s interests in associates and joint ventures. The principal activities of the principal subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are shown in notes 16 and 17.\n\nThe measurement basis used in the preparation of the financial statements is historical cost except for the following assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value:\n- derivative financial instruments (note 2.6);\n- financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value through income and expenditure account (note 2.6);\n- financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (note 2.6);\n- gold (note 2.10); and\n- investment properties (note 2.11).\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with HKFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nJudgements made by management in the application of HKFRSs that have significant effect on the financial statements and major sources of estimation uncertainty are disclosed in note 2.18.\n\nCertain comparative figures have been restated to conform to the current year presentation of the Group financial statements.\n\n# 2.3 Subsidiaries and non-controlling interests\n\nA subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. When assessing whether the Group has power, only substantive rights (held by the Group and other parties) are considered.\n", "zh": "\n# 外匯基金\n\n# 核數主任報告書\n\n# 獨立核數師報告書致財政司司長\n\n# 意見\n\n本人證明已根據外匯基金及其附屬公司(「集團」)於第211至311頁列示的財務報表進行核數，該等財務報表包括外匯基金及集團截至2023年12月31日止年度的資產負債表，以及相關收益及開支賬目、綜合損益帳、股東權益變動表及現金流量表，並附有財務報表附註，包括重要會計政策資料。\n\n本人認為，該等財務報表以符合香港財務報告準則（HKFRSs）的方式編製，且已按照行政長官根據《外匯基金條例》（第66章）第7條作出的指示準備，因此真實而公平地反映了基金及集團截至2023年12月31日止年度的財務狀況，以及當年度的財務表現及現金流量。\n\n# 發表意見的基礎\n\n本人根據行政長官根據《外匯基金條例》第7條作出的指示及審計委員會審計標準進行核數。根據這些標準，本人的責任進一步闡述於本報告書中「核數師對財務報表核數的責任」部分。本人遵循這些標準與集團保持獨立性，並履行其他道德責任。我相信所取得的審計證據足夠適當，足以作為發表意見的基礎。\n\n# 對審計最具影響力的事項\n\n對審計最具影響力的事項是指本人認為在審計期間具備最重要意義的項目。這些事項是在審計財務報表整體背景下處理的，在形成意見時予以考慮，但本人不就這些事項提供單獨意見。\n\n# 其他資訊\n\n貨幣管理處負責其他資訊。其他資訊包含2023年香港金融管理局年度報告中除財務報表及本人之核數師報告以外的所有資訊。\n\n本人對財務報表的意見不涵蓋其他資訊，亦不就其他資訊作出任何形式的保證結論。\n\n就本人審核財務報表而言，本人責任是閱讀其他資訊，並在此過程中考慮其他資訊是否與財務報表或本人透過審核所得知識存在重大不一致。若基於已完成的工作，本人得出其他資訊存在重大誤報的結論，則必須報告此情況。本無需報告任何內容。\n\n# 貨幣管理處及外匯基金諮詢委員會核數小組對財務報表的責任\n\n貨幣管理處負責按HKFRSs由香港會計師公會發佈的準則編製財務報表，以提供真實而公平的披露，同時遵守行政長官根據《外匯基金條例》（第66章）第7條作出的指示，以及建立必要的內部控制機制以確保財務報表無重大誤報（無論為欺詐或錯誤所致）。\n\n在編製財務報表時，貨幣管理處負責評估集團持續經營的能力，適當地披露相關持續經營事宜，並採用持續經營會計基礎。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會核數小組負責監督集團的財務報導程序。\n\n# 核數師對財務報表核數的責任\n\n本人的目標是通過審計獲得合理保證，確認財務報表整體不存在因欺詐或錯誤導致的重大誤報，並發佈載有本人意見的核數師報告。合理保證是一種高水準的保證，但並不代表按照審計委員會審計標準進行的審計一定能發現所有重大誤報。誤報可能來自於欺詐或錯誤，如果個別或合計起來可能合理預期影響使用者基於此等財務報表做出的經濟決策，則視為重大。\n\n根據審計委員會審計標準進行審計時，本人貫徹專業判斷並保持專業懷疑態度。本人亦執行以下工作：\n\n- 識別及評估財務報表重大誤報風險（無論為欺詐或錯誤），設計及執行針對這些風險的審計程序，並獲取足夠且適當的審計證據以支持本人的意見。由於欺詐可能涉及串通、偽造、故意漏報、虛假陳述或內部控制的規避，因此未能檢測到因欺詐導致的重大誤報風險較因錯誤導致者更高；\n- 為了設計適合情況的審計程序，了解與審計有關的內部控制，但不為此目的表達對集團內部控制有效性的意見；\n- 評估貨幣管理處使用的會計政策的適當性及會計估算及相關披露的合理性；\n- 確定貨幣管理處使用持續經營會計基礎的適當性，並根據審計證據確定是否存在與集團繼續作為持續經營能力相關的重大不確定因素。若認為存在重大不確定因素，需在核數師報告中指出財務報表中的相關披露；如披露不足，則需修改意見。本人的結論基於審計報告日期前獲得的審計證據。然而未來事件或條件可能使集團停止持續經營；\n- 評估財務報表的整體呈報、結構及內容，包括披露，並確認財務報表以達到公允陳述的方式呈現底層交易及事件；以及\n- 獲取足夠適當的審計證據以針對集團內實體或業務活動的財務資訊發表意見。本人對集團審計的方向、監督及執行負全部責任。本人對審計意見負全責。\n\n本人就計劃的審計範圍及時間安排及重大審計發現（包括在審計期間識別出的任何重大內部控制缺陷）與外匯基金諮詢委員會核數小組進行溝通。\n\n本人亦向外匯基金諮詢委員會核數小組提交聲明，說明已遵守關於獨立性的相關道德要求，並與其溝通所有可能合理被認為影響獨立性的關係及其他事項，如有關保障措施適用。\n\n根據與外匯基金諮詢委員會核數小組溝通的事項，本人確定構成當前期間財務報表審計最重要的事項，因此為關鍵審計事項。除非法律法規禁止公開披露該事項，或在極端罕見的情況下，本人認為該事項不應在報告中披露，因為這樣做的不利後果合理預期將超過公開利益，否則會在核數師報告中描述這些事項。\n\n林志遠博士  \n核數主任  \n\n# 1 主要活動  \n\n貨幣管理處根據財政司司長作為外匯基金（基金）監管人的授權，根據《外匯基金條例》（第66章）的規定管理基金。基金的主要活動是保障香港貨幣的匯兌價值，維護香港貨幣及金融系統的穩定性和完整性。  \n\n基金的資產分為四個組合管理：後備組合、投資組合、長期增長組合及戰略組合。後備組合的資產完全匹配貨幣基礎，根據香港currency board體系。投資組合主要投資於經合組織（OECD）成員國的債券及股票市場。長期增長組合持有私募股權及房地產投資。戰略組合持有透過香港特別行政區政府為基金帳戶購入的香港交易所及結算有限公司股份，以戰略目的持有。經營部門資訊載於注釋31。  \n\n# 2 重要會計政策  \n\n# 2.1 合規聲明  \n\n本財務報表已根據香港財務報告準則（HKFRSs）編製，該術語總括所有適用的個別HKFRSs、香港會計準則及由香港會計師公會（HKICPA）頒布的解釋，以及在香港普遍接受的會計原則。基金及其附屬公司（統稱「集團」）採用的重要會計政策載於下文。  \n\nHKICPA已頒布某些新的或修訂的HKFRSs，這些準則首次生效或可供提前採用於集團當前會計期間。注釋3提供了關於因這些發展而在集團當前及先前會計期間相關的會計政策變化的資訊（如有）。  \n\n# 2.2 財務報表編製基礎  \n\n集團財務報表包括集團本身的財務報表及集團對關聯公司及合營企業的權益。主要子公司的主要活動載於註釋16及17。  \n\n財務報表的編製基礎為歷史成本，除非下列資產及負債按公允價值計算：\n- 衍生金融工具（註釋2.6）；\n- 按損益賬目計價的金融資產及金融負債（註釋2.6）；\n- 按其他綜合收入計價的金融資產（註釋2.6）；\n- 黃金（註釋2.10）；以及\n- 投資物業（註釋2.11）。\n\n根據HKFRSs編製財務報表需要管理層做出判斷、估計及假設，這會影響政策應用及報告的資產、負債、收入及開支金額。這些估計及相關假設基於歷史經驗及其他認為在當時情況下合理的因素，其結果構成對不易從其他來源直接取得的資產及負債賬面值作出判斷的基礎。實際結果可能與這些估計有所不同。\n\n這些估計及相關假設會持續進行審閱。若修正僅影響該時期，則在修正當期確認會計估計的修正；若修正同時影響現行及未來期間，則在修正當期及以後期間確認。\n\n管理層在應用HKFRSs時作出的重大判斷及會計估計的主要不确定性來源載於註釋2.18。\n\n某些比較數據已根據集團當年前述財務報表的披露進行重述。\n"}

{"en": "# Chief Executive’s Statement\n\nIn 2017, the global economy and financial markets performed much better than expected: the real economy saw steady growth; inflation remained subdued; the three interest rate hikes and the reduction in the balance sheet by the US Federal Reserve during the year did not result in capital outflows from emerging market economies or a strengthening of the US dollar. Amid bullish sentiment, global stock markets, including the three major US stock indices, kept hitting new highs. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index surged by 34%. The Hang Seng Index gained nearly 8,000 points (or 36%) in 2017 and surpassed the 30,000-point level to reach an all-time high in January 2018.\n\nMany investors were filled with optimism, even exuberance, in such a favourable environment. However, this was until early February this year when the latest data showed a higher than expected wage increase in the US, prompting investors to reappraise inflation risks and triggering significant corrections to global stock markets. The Dow Jones Index fell more than 1,000 points in two days during the second week of February, and the Hang Seng Index dropped more than 3,000 points in the same week. The 10-year US Treasury yield surged to as high as 2.95%. The swift reversal of fund flows indicated that the record high market valuation was not built on a solid foundation. It also reminded us of the importance of a sound and robust financial system for Hong Kong to meet the challenges brought by asset market volatility and capital outflows.\n\n# Banking system resilience boosted by precautionary measures\n\nAs the saying goes, “prevention is better than cure”. The HKMA implemented further risk mitigation measures in 2017 to safeguard the stability of Hong Kong’s banking and financial systems. In May, we introduced the eighth round of countercyclical measures for banks’ mortgage loans and strengthened banks’ credit risk management on lending to property developers, with the aim of enhancing the banking system’s resilience to shocks arising from any downturn in the property market. With the several rounds of measures, the average loan-to-value ratio of new residential mortgage loans fell to 49% at the end of 2017 from 64% in September 2009, while the average debt servicing ratio also declined to 35% from 41% in August 2010.\n\nIn 2017, we established the Resolution Office to implement international standards on the resolution of non-viable financial institutions that are considered “too big to fail”. This will help prevent a recurrence of a global financial crisis similar to the one in 2008 where public money was used to save failing financial institutions, and will minimise the impact of their closures on the financial system, the economy and the community at large.\n\nRobust risk management is the cornerstone of steady and sustainable development of the banking sector. The liquidity ratio and capital adequacy ratio of Hong Kong’s banking system are well above the applicable statutory requirements and among the highest in the world. This undoubtedly reflects the high resilience of Hong Kong’s banking system. Indeed, the banking sector registered strong growth in 2017, with total loans increasing by 16%, while the asset quality also held up well. The classified loan ratio of retail banks fell to 0.54% from 0.72% in 2016, well below the long-term average of 2.2% since 2000. The banking industry’s overall return on equity (based on pre-tax operating profits) reached 11.74% in 2017, a very healthy level compared with other international financial centres.\n\n# Sound banking the key to long-term financial stability\n\nThe 2008 global financial crisis revealed the limitations of relying solely on rules and regulations to restrain the financial industry from pursuing profitability without regard to their primary responsibilities. In light of this, the HKMA has stepped up the promotion of “sound banking” practices in recent years, encouraging banks to develop and pursue good corporate culture and values. In particular, to address the issue of bank staff pursuing short-term profits at the expense of the long-term interests of their customers or banks, we are encouraging banks to put in place appropriate incentive systems that are in line with their corporate culture and values. As part of this campaign, we arranged the inaugural Annual Conference for Independent Non-Executive Directors (INEDs) in March 2017 to highlight the importance of establishing a good banking culture and to empower the INEDs to perform their oversight and monitoring roles more effectively.\n\nWith the support of the banking industry, 2017 was a successful year for the HKMA in the advancement of financial inclusion. Six physical bank branches and three mobile branches began operating in remote areas. The Hong Kong Association of Banks worked out an arrangement with EPS and a convenience store chain to launch a pilot scheme allowing the elderly to withdraw cash from the stores in remote areas without the need to make purchases. Hongkong Post is also launching this year a cash withdrawal service for the elderly at seven Post Offices mainly on outlying islands and in the New Territories. Regarding account opening, the HKMA last year set up a webpage and an email account with a dedicated team to follow up public enquiries or complaints relating to the opening of bank accounts. Thanks to the concerted efforts of various stakeholders, there has been a significant improvement in customer experience in opening individual and corporate bank accounts.\n\n# Fintech a game changer for the banking industry\n\nIn an era of rapid technological advancement, fintech has been gradually integrated into our daily lives. In this ever changing technological environment, banks must embrace new developments and pursue innovation in their application of fintech. With the new era of Smart Banking, the HKMA launched seven initiatives in September (see page 106 for details) promoting the adoption of fintech in banking to improve the quality of banking products and services for customers. While these initiatives are independent of one another, they are complementary and will be a game changer for the future landscape of payment and banking services in Hong Kong. Customers will not only enjoy more convenient, efficient and secure payment and banking services, they will also have more choices and greater control over their financial transactions. Fintech will be the key to banks’ future business success, and moving into the new era of Smart Banking will be a great opportunity for the banks to upgrade and transform themselves.\n\n# Enormous opportunities created by the Belt and Road and the Bay Area Initiatives\n\nWith competition among international financial centres becoming more intense, a diversified financial industry is of paramount importance to Hong Kong. In 2017, the HKMA stepped up its work on enhancing Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre. Given Hong Kong’s unparalleled advantage of “having the Mainland as our hinterland while maintaining an international outlook”, the Belt and Road Initiative and the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Bay Area (Bay Area) will offer enormous opportunities for the financial and banking sectors and give new impetus to the economic growth of Hong Kong. The HKMA Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office, which was established in response to the Belt and Road Initiative, saw the number of its partners grow to around 90 since launch, laying a solid foundation for promoting Hong Kong as a financing hub for infrastructure investments. The issuance of the first Belt and Road bond in Hong Kong by the China Development Bank in 2017 highlighted the pivotal role Hong Kong can play in facilitating the financing of these infrastructure projects.\n\nIn addition to infrastructure financing, we are actively involved in the development of Hong Kong as a hub for corporate treasury centres, private equity funds and Asian derivatives businesses, by attracting multinational corporations and major financial institutions to manage their funds, assets and various financial risks in the city. These initiatives will further consolidate and upgrade Hong Kong’s financial and related professional services sectors. The HKMA also maintains close dialogue with the relevant authorities responsible for the development of the Bay Area to strengthen collaboration with a view to contributing to the financial development of the area as a world-class city cluster.\n\nOver the years, Hong Kong’s financial industry has been developing under the theme of “leveraging Hong Kong’s advantages, meeting the country’s needs”. With the introduction of the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect in 2014, the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect in 2016 and the Northbound Trading of Bond Connect in July last year, the mutual market access between the Mainland and the rest of the world through Hong Kong’s financial platform has been expanded from stock markets to bond markets. This underscores Hong Kong’s unique role as a financial intermediary in facilitating global investors’ access to the Mainland’s financial markets. In 2017, Hong Kong maintained its position as the leading global hub for offshore renminbi business. Average daily turnover of the renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement system stood at RMB900 billion. In addition, according to SWIFT statistics, more than 70% of global renminbi payment transactions were handled through Hong Kong during the year. The offshore renminbi market continued to operate smoothly and develop steadily.\n\n# Nurturing talent to strengthen the soft power of the banking industry\n\nWith the continuing growth of the financial industry, nurturing talent is crucial to its sustainable development. The HKMA attaches great importance to the soft power of the banking industry, and we have been encouraging and supporting ongoing capacity building of banking practitioners. Following the introduction of two modules on anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism and cybersecurity under the Enhanced Competency Framework, we expanded its coverage last year by including retail wealth management and treasury management to enhance the level of core competence of banking practitioners through continuing professional development. The HKMA is also committed to nurturing young talent for the banking industry. In 2017, we launched the Pilot Apprenticeship Programme for Private Wealth Management and the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme in collaboration with the industry. Given the overwhelming response, the coverage of these programmes will be further expanded in the future.\n\n# Prudent investment strategy achieving a reasonable and stable return over the medium to long term\n\nOn the back of strong global economic growth, the Exchange Fund achieved a record high investment income of HK$264 billion last year with gains across the board, including equities, bonds and foreign exchange. The overall investment return was 7.4%. The Investment Portfolio achieved a rate of return of 12.1%, while the Backing Portfolio gained 1.8%. The Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP)’s annualised internal rate of return since its inception in 2009 reached as high as 13.7%. While the investment performance last year was satisfactory, the increasingly complex investment environment requires the HKMA to continue its prudent management of the Exchange Fund. We will remain agile and nimble, monitor market developments closely and deploy defensive measures as and when appropriate. Investments under the LTGP will also be further expanded. As always, the investment principle of “capital preservation first, long-term growth next” within acceptable risk levels will be adhered to when managing the wealth for the people of Hong Kong.\n\nWhile the global real economy is extending last year’s growth momentum, uncertainties and risks still abound in 2018. These include a faster-than-expected pace of US interest rate hikes in case inflation picks up, escalating trade frictions and a deteriorating geopolitical landscape. Should these downside risks materialise, they will have significant and widespread implications for global financial markets, and knock-on effects for Hong Kong’s fund flows, asset prices and real economy. It is therefore advisable that we should all manage the risks prudently.\n\nIn the coming months, it is likely Hong Kong dollar interest rate movements will remain in the spotlight. The US Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times since December 2015. With widening spreads between Hong Kong dollar interest rates and their US dollar counterparts, there is a greater incentive for funds to flow from the Hong Kong dollar into the US dollar. The Hong Kong dollar has been under weakening pressure recently and the 7.85 weak-side Convertibility Undertaking (CU) has been triggered. As we have repeatedly stated, when the 7.85 weak-side CU is triggered, the HKMA will act as a “super money changer” by buying Hong Kong dollars and selling US dollars in the market to ensure that the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate will not weaken beyond the 7.85 level. Such operations are normal and in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System. This should not cause any concern. Indeed, the Exchange Fund currently holds more than HK$4 trillion worth of assets, of which the Hong Kong dollar Monetary Base amounts to about HK$1.7 trillion, providing a strong buffer in the event of fund outflows. Over the years, the HKMA has put in place various lines of defence to safeguard the stability of the banking and financial systems. From a positive perspective, capital outflows will lead to a gradual increase in Hong Kong dollar interest rates, which will be conducive to the normalisation of the interest rate environment in Hong Kong and hence the sustainable development of the local economy and asset markets. During this process, the HKMA will stay vigilant and make every effort to maintain monetary and banking stability in Hong Kong.\n", "zh": "\n<reflect>已完成初步分析，現進行具體翻譯工作。</reflect>\n<translate>\n\n# 行政長官談話\n\n2017年，全球經濟和金融市場表現好過預期：實體經濟持續增長；通脹仍然溫和；美國聯邦儲備局於該年度內進行的三次加息及資產負債表收緊未導致新興市場經濟體資本外流或美元走強。在樂觀情緒中，包括三大美國股票指數在内的全球股市屢創新高。MSCI新興市場指數上漲了34％。恆生指數在2017年內上升近8,000點（或36％），突破30,000點大關，在2018年1月創下歷史新高。\n\n許多投資者在這樣的有利環境中充滿樂觀甚至熱情。然而，直到今年初，最新數據顯示美國工資增幅超預期，引發投資者重新評估通脹風險，觸發全球股市大幅修正。道瓊斯指數在2月第二週內行內兩天內下跌超過1,000點，恒生指數在同一週內下跌逾3,000點。十年期美國國庫券收益率激增至2.95％。資金流向的迅速反轉表明，紀錄高位的市場估值並不建立在堅實基礎之上。這也提醒我們，對香港來說，擁有一個健全且強韌的金融系統對於應對資產市場波動和資金外流帶來的挑戰至關重要。\n\n# 銀行業穩定性因預防措施而增強\n\n有句諺語說：“預防勝於治療”。2017年，香港金融管理局推行進一步的風險緩解措施，以保障香港銀行業和金融系統的穩定。五月份，我們推出了第八輪針對銀行房貸的反週期措施，並加強銀行對房地產開發商的信貸風險管理，旨在提升銀行業面對房地產市場下滑衝擊的抗風險能力。通過多輪措施，2017年底新房貸價值比平均降至49%，較2009年9月的64%有所下降，而平均還款比例也從2010年8月的41%降至35%。\n\n2017年，我們設立了解決辦公室，以實施國際標準對“太大而不能倒”的不當金融機構進行清盤。這有助防止重演2008年那樣的全球金融危機，當時使用公共資金拯救失敗金融機構，並將其關閉對金融體系、經濟及社會產生的影響最小化。\n\n穩健的風險管理是銀行業穩步和可持續發展的基石。香港銀行業的流動性比率及資本充足率均遠高於法定要求，位居世界前列。這無疑反映了香港銀行業的強韌程度。實際上，銀行業於2017年實現了強勁增長，總貸款增加16%，資產質素亦保持良好。零售銀行的特定貸款比率自2016年的0.72%降至0.54%，遠低於自2000年以來的長期平均水平2.2%。銀行業整體股本回報率（根據稅前業務利潤計算）達11.74%，與其他國際金融中心相比處於非常健康的水平。\n\n# 健全的銀行經營是長遠財務穩定的關鍵\n\n2008年全球金融危機揭示了僅依靠規則和法規來約束金融業追逐盈利而不顧其基本責任的局限性。鑑於此，近年來香港金融管理局積極推廣“健全銀行經營”做法，鼓勵銀行發展和追求良好的企業文化與價值觀。尤其是為了應對銀行員工為追求短期利益而損害客戶或銀行長期利益的情況，我們鼓勵銀行建立符合其企業文化和價值觀的適當激勵機制。作為此項運動的一部分，我們於2017年3月舉行了首屆獨立非執行董事（INED）年度會議，重點強調建立良好銀行文化的必要性，並賦予INED更有效地履行監督和監測職責的能力。\n\n在銀行業的支持下，2017年是香港金融管理局推動金融包容性的成功一年。六家實體分行和三家流動分行已在偏遠地區營運。香港銀行協會與EPS及便利店連鎖店協議，推出試點計劃讓老年人可在偏遠地區商店提取現金而不必購物。郵政署亦將於本年在主要位於離島及新界地區的七間郵局推出老年人提款服務。關於帳戶開設方面，香港金融管理局去年設立了專門網頁和電子郵箱，由專人跟進公眾有關開設銀行帳戶的查詢或投訴。感謝各方共同努力，個人及公司銀行帳戶開設的客戶體驗已取得顯著改善。\n\n# 金融科技改變銀行業格局\n\n在技術快速進步時代，金融科技已逐步融入我們的日常生活。在這種不斷變化的技術環境中，銀行必須接受新發展並在應用金融科技方面追求創新。隨著智能銀行的新時代來臨，香港金融管理局於九月推出七項措施（詳見第106頁）推動銀行業採用金融科技，以提高客戶的銀行產品和服務品質。雖然這些措施各自獨立，但它們相互補充，將成為改變香港未來支付和銀行業服務面貌的重要力量。顧客不僅能享受更加便捷、高效和安全的支付及銀行服務，他們還能有更多的選擇和對財務交易更大的控制權。金融科技將成為銀行未來商業成功的關鍵，進入智能銀行的新時代將是銀行升級和轉型的重大機會。\n\n# “一帶一路”和灣區建設創造巨大機遇\n\n在全球金融中心競爭日益激烈的背景下，多元化金融產業對香港至為重要。2017年，香港金融管理局加快了提升香港作為國際金融中心競爭力的工作。鑒於香港擁有“內地為後盾，放眼國際”的獨特優勢，“一帶一路”倡議及粵港澳大灣區的發展將為金融和銀行部門創造巨大的機遇，為香港經濟增長注入新的動力。“一帶一路”倡議下成立的香港金融管理局基建融資促進辦事處，自啟動以來合作夥伴數量已經增至約90家，為推廣香港作為基礎設施投資融資樞紐奠定了堅實基礎。2017年由中國開發銀行在香港發行的第一筆“一帶一路”債券突顯了香港在促進這些基礎設施項目融資方面的關鍵作用。\n\n除了基礎設施融資之外，我們正在積極參與將香港打造為企業財務中心、私募基金及亞洲衍生品業務中心，吸引跨國公司及大型金融機構在該市管理其資金、資產及各類金融風險。這些舉措將進一步鞏固和提升香港的金融及相關專業服務業。香港金融管理局也持續與負責灣區建設的相關當局保持密切溝通，加強合作，以貢獻於該地區作為世界一流城市群的金融發展。\n\n多年來，香港金融業一直以“發揮香港優勢，服務國家需要”為主題發展。繼2014年引入滬港股票通、2016年引入深港股票通以及去年7月開放債券通北向交易後，透過香港金融平台內地與世界各地市場的互聯互通已從股票市場擴展至債券市場。這凸顯了香港作為金融中介在協助全球投資者接入內地金融市場中的獨特性角色。2017年，香港繼續作為離岸人民幣業務的主要中心，人民幣即時支付結算系統（RTGS）的日均交易額達到9,000億元。根據SWIFT統計，全年超過70%的全球人民幣支付交易經由香港進行。離岸人民幣市場繼續順暢運作并穩定發展。\n\n# 培養人才強化銀行業軟實力\n\n隨着金融業的持續增長，培養人才對其可持續發展至關重要。香港金融管理局高度重視銀行業的軟實力，一直鼓勵和支持銀行業從業者的持續發展。繼推出反洗錢和反恐融資、網絡安全兩個模塊後，我們去年進一步拓展範圍，加入零售財富管理和資金管理，以通過持續專業發展提升銀行從業者的核心能力。香港金融管理局也致力於培養年輕人才。2017年，我們與業界合作推出了私人財富管理試點學徒計劃及金融科技職業加速計劃。由於反應熱烈，未來將進一步擴大這些計劃的覆蓋範圍。\n\n# 審慎投資策略實現中長期合理穩定回報\n\n受強勁全球經濟增長推動，外匯基金去年實現歷史最高投資收入2,640億港元，股權、債券和外匯等所有領域均有收益。整體投資回報率為7.4%。投資組合實現了12.1%的回報率，支持組合獲得了1.8%的回報。長期增長組合（LTGP）自2009年啟動以來的年化內部收益率高達13.7%。儘管去年投資表現令人滿意，但日益複雜的投資環境要求香港金融管理局繼續對外匯基金進行審慎管理。我們將保持靈活敏捷，密切關注市場發展，在適當時機採取防禦性措施。LTGP下的投資也將進一步擴大。一如既往地，我們將遵循「保護本金為先，長期增長次之」的投資原則，在可接受風險水平內管理香港市民的財富。\n\n儘管全球實體經濟延續去年的增長動能，但2018年仍存在諸多不確定性和風險。其中包括美國利率上調速度可能快於預期，若通脹上升；貿易摩擦加劇以及地緣政治形勢惡化。如果這些下行風險成真，將對全球金融市場產生重大廣泛的影響，並對香港資金流動、資產價格和實體經濟產生連帶效應。因此建議大家都要謹慎管理風險。\n\n今後幾個月，港元利率變化將成為焦點。美國聯邦儲備局自2015年12月以來已加息六次。隨著港元利率與美元利率之間的差距擴大，資金從港元流向美元的誘因增加。近期港元面臨弱勢壓力，7.85弱方掛鈎承諾（CU）已被觸發。正如我們多次表示的，當7.85弱方掛鈎承諾被觸發時，香港金融管理局將作為“超級兌換商”，在市場上購買港元並出售美元，以確保港元匯率不會超越7.85水準。此類操作屬正常範疇，符合聯繫匯率制度設計。這不應引起任何擔憂。其實，外匯基金目前持有超過4,000億港元資產，其中港元貨幣基礎約為1,700億港元，在資金外流情況下提供強有力的緩衝。多年來，香港金融管理局已建立各種防線以保障銀行業和金融體系的穩定。從正面角度來看，資金外流將促使港元利率逐步上升，這有利於香港利率環境的正常化，進而促進本地經濟和資產市場的可持續發展。在此過程中，香港金融管理局將保持警惕，盡最大努力維護香港的貨幣和銀行業穩定。\n"}

{"en": "# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nAgainst the backdrop of a more synchronised expansion of the global economy, Hong Kong saw faster economic growth, tighter labour market conditions and subdued inflationary pressures in 2017. Economic growth for 2018 is expected to remain solid.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Real activities\n\nAmid a more synchronised expansion of the global economy, the Hong Kong economy grew faster in 2017. Growth in real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increased to 3.8%, much higher than the 2.1% growth in 2016 and the long-term growth of about 3% over the past decade (Chart 1 and Table 1). Domestic demand firmed up, with private consumption growth accelerating and overall investment spending reviving. Stronger domestic demand reflected favourable job and income conditions, booming asset prices and improved business sentiment. Externally, Hong Kong’s exports of goods expanded at a faster pace due to increased global trade flows, and exports of services recovered because of vibrant trade and cargo flows and improving inbound tourism. Imports of goods recorded stronger growth on export-induced demand, and imports of services increased steadily amid strong travel interest among residents. On a net basis, the overall trade surplus shrank, making a negative contribution to GDP growth.\n\n\n# Monetary conditions\n\nOn the monetary front, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate generally eased against the US dollar driven primarily by interest rate arbitrage activities amid the negative interest rate differentials between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar. This reflected the normal functioning of the Linked Exchange Rate System in accordance with its design. While still at relatively low levels, Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates faced more upward pressures towards the end of 2017 due to Initial Public Offeringrelated funding demand and banks’ year-end liquidity needs. For credit growth, after two years of single-digit growth, total bank loans increased at a notably faster pace of 16.1% in 2017, reflecting improving economic conditions and positive financial market sentiment. Despite faster loan growth, there were no signs of loosening of banks’ credit underwriting standards, and overall loan quality remained good.\n\n# Inflation\n\nInflationary pressures remained well contained throughout 2017 (Chart 2). Netting out the effects of the Government’s one-off relief measures, the underlying inflation rate declined to 1.7%, down from 2.3% in 2016. In particular, the housing component of the price index increased at a milder pace, reflecting the filter-through of slower increases in fresh-letting private residential rentals in 2016. More broadly, milder increases in nominal wages and earnings amid strong output growth helped keep local cost pressures in check. Import price inflation was also tame, in line with low inflation in Hong Kong’s major import sources despite a weaker US dollar.\n\n# Labour market\n\nThe labour market tightened in 2017 along with above-par economic growth. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell from 3.4% in 2016 to 2.9% towards the end of 2017, below 3% for the first time in nearly 20 years (Chart 3). Most major economic sectors registered decreases in their respective unemployment rates, with more notable declines seen in the retail, financing and professional and business services sectors. As total employment grew faster and the number of private-sector vacancies picked up, overall labour demand continued to strengthen. The labour force also expanded, partly reflecting more active participation of older-age workers (aged 55 and above). Consistent with tighter labour market conditions and lower inflation, real wages and earnings saw faster increases.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe Hong Kong stock market had an almost uninterrupted rally in 2017. The Hang Seng Index rose by 36%, the largest annual gain since 2010 (Chart 4). The rally reflected optimism about the global economy and corporate earnings, and was in part supported by substantial fund inflows from Mainland investors through the Stock Connects. The Hang Seng Index hit a ten-year high in November and remained at high levels towards the end of 2017. Average daily turnover expanded to HK$88.3 billion from HK$66.9 billion in the previous year, and overall equity funds raised from the local market also increased to HK$581.4 billion, compared with HK$490.1 billion a year earlier.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market maintained its upward momentum throughout the year (Chart 4). Transaction volume expanded from 54,701 units a year ago to 61,591 units and housing prices increased by 14.8% in 2017. Housing affordability stretched further, with a price-toincome ratio of 16.4, higher than the previous peak in 1997, and an income-gearing ratio of 74.1, far above its long-term average.1 In view of rising property prices and the intensifying competition for mortgage business among banks, the HKMA introduced the eighth round of prudential measures in May to strengthen banks’ risk management and safeguard banking stability. Housing price growth moderated temporarily following these measures before accelerating in the fourth quarter. As for the commercial and industrial property markets, trading activities increased significantly during the year, with both transaction value and volume registering double-digit growth. With the pick-up in non-residential property prices, corresponding rental yields fell slightly compared to the previous year.\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nEconomic growth for 2018 is expected to remain solid. The Government forecasts growth in the range of 3–4%, while private-sector analysts project the economy to expand at an average rate of 3.2%. Externally, Hong Kong’s export performance will continue to benefit from the improving global growth outlook and the gradual recovery in inbound tourism. Domestically, private consumption growth is expected to hold up mainly as a result of favourable labour market conditions. As for fixed capital formation, building and construction activity should progress steadily on the back of rising housing supply and continuing infrastructure projects. While improved economic conditions will support business capital spending, headwinds may come from potential rises in interest rates.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nWith still-moderate global inflation and steady increase in local costs, inflationary pressures in Hong Kong are anticipated to remain moderate in 2018, but the inflation rate is likely to pick up gradually from the low in 2017. For example, the rental component of inflation may gather momentum in the latter part of 2018 because of feedthrough from increases in fresh-letting private residential rentals. Market consensus predicts the headline inflation rate to be a still-moderate 2.2% for 2018, and the Government projects the underlying inflation rate to be 2.5%. On the other hand, sustained economic growth, expanding building and construction activity and the gradual recovery in inbound tourism are expected to keep the labour market tight in the near future. Private-sector analysts forecast the unemployment rate to stay at about 3.0% in 2018.\n\n# Uncertainties and risks\n\nThe economic outlook for 2018 is subject to a number of uncertainties and risks including those relating to major central banks’ monetary policy normalisation and global financial market stability, as well as heightened protectionist sentiment and deteriorating geopolitical tensions. In particular, if such risks materialise to trigger reversal of fund flows in Hong Kong, local monetary conditions could tighten faster than expected, putting downward pressures on the real economy and asset prices.\n\nThe outlook for the residential property market remains uncertain. In the near term, the current favourable domestic economic conditions, perceived housing shortage, low mortgage rates and alternative sources of home financing (including mortgage loans provided by property developers and financial support from parents), will continue to support the demand for properties. However, the recent sell-off in global financial markets may dampen sentiments. Over the longer term, the property market will continue to face a number of headwinds. In particular, as the US monetary policy normalisation continues, domestic mortgage rates will rise eventually. In addition, on the back of the Government’s effort to increase the supply of land and residential properties, the housing demand-supply gap is expected to narrow gradually, which would ease the upward pressure on property prices in the longer term.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector continued to be safe and sound in 2017 notwithstanding uncertainties surrounding the global economy. The capital and liquidity positions of authorized institutions (AIs) remained strong, asset quality stayed at healthy levels, and profitability improved notably thanks to increased interest margins and robust credit growth.\n\n# Interest rate trends\n\nAs the US interest rate normalisation continued, the onemonth and three-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) fixings increased by 49 basis points and 39 basis points respectively in 2017. More notable rises were observed in the fourth quarter. Nevertheless, the Hong Kong dollar funding cost of retail banks, as measured by the composite interest rate, remained broadly stable over the year (Chart 5).\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe aggregate pre-tax operating profits of retail banks’ Hong Kong offices grew by 15.8% in 2017. The improved performance was mainly due to increases in net interest income (+20.3%) and fee and commission income (+9.4%). However, these increases were partially offset by a decline in income from foreign exchange and derivatives operations (-29.9%) and a growth in operating expenses (+8.4%). The aggregate post-tax profit of retail banks dropped by 18.1% because of certain non-recurring items recorded in 2016. The post-tax return on average assets of retail banks dropped to 1.07% from 1.44% in 2016 (Chart 6).\n\nRetail banks’ net interest margin widened to 1.45% in 2017 from 1.32% in 2016 (Chart 7) mainly due to rising market interest rates.\n\nThe proportion of retail banks’ non-interest income to total operating income decreased to 40% from 44.3% in 2016. While fee and commission income increased by 9.4%, income originated from foreign exchange and derivatives operations dropped by 29.9%.\n\nRetail banks’ cost-to-income ratio declined to 41.9% in 2017 from 43.2% in 2016, as operating costs (+8.4%) increased at a slower pace than operating income (+11.8%) (Chart 8). Retail banks’ loan impairment charges decreased to HK$7.3 billion from HK$8 billion in 2016.\n\n# Asset quality\n\nLoan quality of retail banks improved during the year, with the classified loan ratio decreasing to 0.54% from 0.72% a year earlier. The overdue and rescheduled loan ratio also decreased to 0.4% from 0.53% in 2016 (Chart 9). Similarly, the classified loan ratio and the overdue and rescheduled loan ratio of the whole banking sector decreased to 0.67% and 0.52%, from 0.85% and 0.67% respectively.\n\nThe quality of banks’ residential mortgage lending portfolios remained good, with the delinquency ratio staying at a low level of 0.03% at the end of 2017 (Chart 10). The rescheduled loan ratio was close to 0%. There was no residential mortgage loan in negative equity at the end of the year, as compared with four cases a year ago.\n\nThe delinquency ratio of credit card lending stayed low at 0.22% at the end of 2017, compared with 0.24% a year ago (Chart 10). The combined delinquent and rescheduled loan ratio edged down to 0.31% from 0.33% during the period. The charge-off ratio also fell slightly to 1.75% from 1.92% in 2016.\n\n# Balance sheet trends\n\nTotal loans of the banking sector grew by 16.1% in 2017, compared with 6.5% in 2016. Demand for credit increased, driven by optimism about the global economic outlook. As total deposits increased at a slower pace than total loans, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio rose to 73% at the end of 2017 from 68.4% a year earlier. The Hong Kong-dollar loan-to-deposit ratio also increased to 82.7% from 77.1% during the same period (Chart 11).\n\nMainland-related lending (including loans booked in Mainland subsidiaries of locally incorporated banks) increased by 17.5% in 2017, compared with a growth of 7% recorded in 2016.\n\n# Holdings of negotiable debt securities\n", "zh": "\n<economic-and-financial-environment>\n面對全球經濟更加同步擴張的背景下，香港在2017年經濟增速加快、勞動力市場緊張及通脹壓力低迷。預期2018年的經濟增長將持續穩健。\n</economic-and-financial-environment>\n\n<the-economy-in-review>\n<real-activities>\n在全球經濟更加同步擴張的背景下，香港經濟在2017年增長加快。實質國內生產總值（GDP）增長達3.8%，遠高於2016年的2.1%以及過去十年約3%的長期增長水平（圖表1及表格1）。國內需求走強，私人消費增長加速，整體投資開支復甦。更強勁的國內需求反映就業和收入情況良好、資產價格上升及商業氛圍改善。在外部方面，由於全球貿易流量增加，香港商品出口增長加快；服務出口因貿易和貨運流量活躍以及入境旅遊改善而恢復。進口商品因出口引發的需求錄得更強勁增長，服務進口則因居民旅行興趣強烈而穩定增長。淨出口方面，整體貿易順差收窄，對GDP增長產生負面影響。\n</real-activities>\n\n<monetary-conditions>\n在貨幣方面，港元兌美元匯率主要因港元與美元之間的負息差套利活動而普遍放寬。這反映了聯繫匯率制度按設計正常運作。雖然仍處於相對低水平，但在2017年末，由於首次公開招股相關資金需求及銀行年度流動性需求，港元銀行同業利率面臨更多上行壓力。關於信貸增長，繼兩年單位數增長後，2017年總銀行貸款以顯著更快的16.1%速度增長，反映經濟情況改善及正面的金融市場氣氛。儘管貸款增長加快，並無跡象顯示銀行信貸評審標準鬆懈，整體貸款質量仍然良好。\n</monetary-conditions>\n\n<inflation>\n2017年全年通脹壓力維持在較低水平（圖表2）。剔除政府一次性減輕措施的影響，核心通脹率下降至1.7%，低於2016年的2.3%。特別是物價指數中的房屋項目增幅有所緩和，反映2016年新租用私人住宅租金增幅較慢的傳導作用。更廣泛而言，強勁的產出增長下名義薪資和收益增長溫和，有助於控制本地成本壓力。進口物價漲幅也較為溫和，與香港主要進口來源地的低通脹水平一致，即使美元走弱亦然。\n</inflation>\n\n<labour-market>\n2017年隨著經濟表現優於平均水平，勞動力市場進一步緊縮。經季節性調整的失業率從2016年的3.4%降至2017年底的2.9%，近20年來首次低於3%（圖表3）。大多數主要經濟部門各自失業率均有下降，零售、融資及專業及商業服務業的降幅尤為顯著。隨着總就業人數加速增長及私營部門空缺數量增加，整體勞動需求繼續增強。勞動力人口也擴大，部分反映出年長工作者（年齡55歲及以上）參與度提高。與緊縮的勞動力市場條件和低通脹相一致，實際工資和薪金出現較快增長。\n</labour-market>\n\n<stock-market>\n2017年香港股市幾乎持續上漲。恆生指數上漲36%，創2010年以來最大年度增幅（圖表4）。此輪上漲反映了對全球經濟和企業盈利的樂觀情緒，部分受到內地投資者通過滬港通及深港通大量資金流入的支持。恆生指數於11月觸及十年高位，並在2017年底保持高水平。每日平均成交額從前一年的669億港元增至883億港元，本地市場集資總額也增至5,814億港元，較去年同期的4,901億港元增加。\n</stock-market>\n\n<property-market>\n住宅樓市全年保持向上勢頭（圖表4）。交易量從去年的54,701宗增至61,591宗，住房價格在2017年上漲14.8%。樓價償付能力進一步惡化，買賣比達16.4，高于1997年的歷史高點，房貸佔收入比為74.1，遠高於長期平均水平。鑒於樓價上漲及銀行為房貸業務競爭加劇，金管局於5月推出了第八輪審慎措施，以加強銀行風險管理，保障銀行穩定性。這些措施實施後，樓價漲幅暫時放緩，但在第四季度重新加速。至於商用及工業物業市場，全年交易活動顯著增加，交易價值及成交量均實現雙位數增長。隨著非住宅物業價格上漲，相應的租金回報率較上年同期略有下降。\n</property-market>\n\n<outlook-for-the-economy>\n<economic-environment>\n2018年經濟增長預計將保持堅韌。政府預測增長幅度為3%-4%，而民間機構預期經濟將以平均3.2%的速度擴展。外部方面，香港出口表現將持續受益於全球經濟前景改善及入境旅遊逐步復蘇。內部方面，私人消費增長預期將保持，主要是由於有利的勞動力市場條件。對於固定資本形成，由於住宅供應增加及持續的基建項目，建築和施工活動應穩步推進。雖然改善的經濟情況將支持企業資本支出，但潛在的利率上漲可能帶來阻力。\n</economic-environment>\n\n<inflation-and-the-labour-market>\n鑒於全球通脹依然溫和且本地成本持續上升，預計香港2018年的通脹壓力將維持溫和，但通脹率可能從2017年的低位逐步上升。例如，因為新租用私人住宅租金上漲的傳導作用，租金項目的通脹可能會在2018年下半年加快。市場共識預測2018年整體通脹率將為2.2%的溫和水平，政府預測核心通脹率將為2.5%。另一方面，持續的經濟增長、建築和建設活動擴張及入境旅遊逐步復蘇預計將使勞動力市場在近期保持緊張。民間機構預測2018年失業率將保持在約3.0%。\n</inflation-and-the-labour-market>\n\n<uncertainties-and-risks>\n2018年的經濟前景面臨多種不確定性和風險，包括主要央行貨幣政策正常化和全球金融市場穩定性，以及升高的保護主義情緒和惡化的地緣政治緊張局勢。特別是，如果這種風險導致香港資金流動逆轉，本地貨幣條件可能比預期更快緊縮，對實體經濟和資產價格造成下行壓力。\n\n住宅樓市前景依然不明朗。短期內，目前有利的本地經濟狀況、 perceive 房屋短缺、低房貸利率和替代性房屋融資來源（包括房地產開發商提供的房貸和父母的財務支持），將繼續支持房屋需求。然而，全球金融市場最近的拋售可能抑制市場情緒。長期來看，樓市將繼續面臨許多阻力。特別是，隨著美國貨幣政策正常化持續，本地房貸利率最終將上升。此外，隨著政府努力增加土地和住宅供應，住房供需差距預計將逐漸縮小，這將在長遠內緩解樓價上漲壓力。\n</uncertainties-and-risks>\n\n<performance-of-the-banking-sector>\n2017年香港銀行業在充滿不確定性的全球經濟環境中繼續安全稳健。認可機構（AI）的資本和流動性狀況保持強健，資產質量保持健康水平，盈利能力因利率差擴大和信貸增長強勁而顯著改善。\n</performance-of-the-banking-sector>\n\n<interest-rate-trends>\n隨著美國利率正常化持續進行，2017年一個月期和三個月期港元拆借銀行優惠利率（HIBOR）分別上調49個基點和39個基點。第四季度觀察到更顯著的上升。不過，零售銀行的港元融資成本，根據綜合利率衡量，整年大致穩定（圖表5）。\n</interest-rate-trends>\n\n<profitability-trends>\n2017年零售銀行在香港辦事處的合計稅前營運利潤增長了15.8%。業績改善主要來自淨利息收入（+20.3%）和費用及佣金收入（+9.4%）的增加。然而，這些增長部分被外匯及衍生品業務收入（-29.9%）的減少和經營費用（+8.4%）的增長所抵消。由於2016年記錄了一些非經常性項目，零售銀行的合計稅後利潤下降了18.1%。零售銀行的稅後平均資產收益率從2016年的1.44%下降至1.07%（圖表6）。\n\n2017年零售銀行的淨息差擴大至1.45%，相比2016年的1.32%（圖表7），主要原因是市場利率上升。\n\n零售銀行的非利息收入占總營運收入的比例從2016年的44.3%下降至40%。雖然費用及佣金收入增加了9.4%，但外匯及衍生品業務收入卻下降了29.9%。\n\n由於經營費用（+8.4%）的增長速度比經營收入（+11.8%）慢，2017年零售銀行的成本收入比從2016年的43.2%降至41.9%（圖表8）。零售銀行的貸款減值撥備從2016年的80億港元降至73億港元。\n</profitability-trends>\n\n<asset-quality>\n2017年零售銀行的貸款質量改善，分類貸款比率從去年同期的0.72%下降至0.54%。逾期及重組貸款比率也從2016年的0.53%下降至0.4%（圖表9）。同樣，整個銀行業的分類貸款比率和逾期及重組貸款比率分別從0.85%和0.67%降至0.67%和0.52%。\n\n銀行的住宅抵押貸款組合質量依然良好，截至2017年底，拖欠率維持在低水平的0.03%（圖表10）。重組貸款比率接近0%。年底時沒有住宅抵押貸款處於贊助不足狀態，與一年前的四宗相比有所改善。\n\n信用卡貸款的拖欠率在2017年底維持在0.22%，低於一年前的0.24%（圖表10）。逾期及重組貸款的總體拖欠率在該期間略微下降至0.31%，較0.33%有所降低。損貸率也略微下降至1.75%，較2016年的1.92%有所減少。\n</asset-quality>\n\n<balance-sheet-trends>\n2017年銀行業的總貸款增長16.1%，而2016年僅增長6.5%。信貸需求增加，這是對全球經濟前景樂觀所致。由於總存款增速低於總貸款，截至2017年底，整體貸款對存款比率上升至73%，較一年前的68.4%有所提高。同期內，港元貸款對存款比率也上升至82.7%，較77.1%有所提高（圖表11）。\n\n內地相關貸款（包括在香港註冊銀行的內地子公司記賬的貸款）在2017年增長17.5%，較2016年記錄的增長率7%有所提升。\n</balance-sheet-trends>\n\n<holdings-of-negotiable-debt-securities>\n</holdings-of-negotiable-debt-securities>\n"}
{"en": "# Monetary Stability\n\nDespite weakening pressure on the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to operate in an orderly manner with ample liquidity. The Linked Exchange Rate System has served as a strong anchor for Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability and proved to be highly resilient against various shocks.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability. This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n- Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three noteissuing banks\n- Government-issued notes and coins in circulation\n- the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of the clearing account balances of banks kept with the HKMA\n- Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the HKMA’s firm commitment to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs). When the demand for Hong Kong dollars is greater than the supply and the market exchange rate strengthens to the strong-side CU of HK$7.75 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to sell Hong Kong dollars to banks for US dollars. The Aggregate Balance will then expand to push down Hong Kong dollar interest rates, creating monetary conditions that move the Hong Kong dollar away from the strong-side limit to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if the supply of Hong Kong dollars is greater than the demand and the market exchange rate weakens to the weak-side CU of HK$7.85 to one US dollar, the HKMA will buy Hong Kong dollars from banks. The Aggregate Balance will then contract to drive Hong Kong dollar interest rates up, pushing the Hong Kong dollar away from the weak-side limit to stay within the Convertibility Zone.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2017\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate generally saw weakening pressure in 2017 (Chart 1). Driven mainly by interest carry trade activities amid widened negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates, the Hong Kong dollar eased gradually against the US dollar, from 7.7566 on 3 January to the year-low of 7.8265 on 22 August. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate gained some strength between late September and early November, underpinned by a tightening of Hong Kong dollar liquidity due to initial public offering (IPO)-related funding demand, and traded steadily within a narrow range of 7.80–7.81. Weakening pressures on the Hong Kong dollar were seen again towards the end of the year, partly reflecting slightly improved Hong Kong dollar liquidity conditions as well as increased year-end commercial demand for the US dollar. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market functioned normally throughout 2017.\n\nAs the CUs were not triggered, the total of the Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs remained virtually unchanged at around HK$1,225.3 billion in 2017 (Chart 2). During the year, the HKMA issued a total of HK$80 billion additional Exchange Fund Bills to meet banks’ increased demand for liquidity management. This led to a contraction of the Aggregate Balance to HK$179.8 billion at the end of 2017. The issuance of additional Exchange Fund Bills was consistent with Currency Board principles, as it only represented a change in the composition of the Monetary Base, with a shift from the Aggregate Balance to the outstanding EFBNs. The Monetary Base remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\n# Money market\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates stayed soft in the first eight months of 2017 before facing more upward pressure towards the end of the year (Chart 3). Despite concerns about the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes and balance sheet normalisation, the Hong Kong dollar interbank rates generally remained soft for the first eight months. As such, the negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates widened between January and August. From September onward, the shortdated Hong Kong dollar interbank rates witnessed large pick-ups, driven mainly by IPO-related and year-end funding demand. Correspondingly, the negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates narrowed in the short-dated segment. Overall, the short-dated interbank rates traded mostly below the Base Rate in 2017.\n\nThe Base Rate was adjusted upwards on 16 March, 15 June and 14 December, by a total of 75 basis points from 1.00% to 1.75%, as the target range for the US federal funds rate moved upward three times by a total of 75 basis points from 0.50–0.75% to 1.25–1.50% during the year. The adjustment of the Base Rate was in accordance with the revised formula announced on 26 March 2009, in which the Base Rate is set at either 50 basis points above the lower bound of the prevailing target range for the US federal funds rate or the average of the five-day moving averages of the overnight and one-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs), whichever is the higher.\n\nRoughly tracking the movements of the Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads, the discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points widened gradually during the first three quarters, with the 12-month Hong Kong dollar forward points reaching about -615 pips in midSeptember (Chart 4). In the fourth quarter, the discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points narrowed slightly along with the narrowing of the negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates. Overall, Hong Kong’s money market continued to operate in an orderly manner and interbank liquidity remained ample. Discount Window borrowing increased from HK$5.3 billion in 2016 to HK$10.3 billion in 2017.\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nSince its establishment in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has served as a strong anchor for Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, and proved to be highly resilient in a series of regional and global financial crises. The Government has reasserted its full commitment to the LERS and the credibility of its commitment was further reinforced by the stability in the foreign exchange and money markets. There is also continued strong public confidence in the Hong Kong dollar as a means of payment and a storage of value. In its 2017 Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund reaffirmed its support for the LERS, commenting that the LERS remained the best exchange rate arrangement for Hong Kong. Combined with robust financial supervision and regulation, prudent fiscal management, and flexible markets, the LERS has worked well to help Hong Kong navigate successfully through both external and domestic challenges.\n\nInternational Monetary Fund: “The Linked Exchange Rate System remains the best arrangement for Hong Kong.”\n\nA sound banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS. During 2017, the HKMA continued to monitor closely banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and stepped up its supervisory efforts on corporate, property-related and mainland-related lending to bolster the resilience of the banking sector. As the US Federal Reserve continues to normalise its monetary policy, the Hong Kong dollar interest rates will gradually normalise as well. The HKMA reiterated that, under the design of the LERS, the outflow of capital, the weakening of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, the triggering of the weak-side CU and the reduction of the Monetary Base are part of the necessary process of the normalisation of Hong Kong dollar interest rates. The HKMA also reminded the public to manage their risks prudently and be well prepared for potential financial turbulence.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio, defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base, moved within a range of 106.7–108.2% during 2017, without touching the Upper or Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 108.1% on 31 December (Chart 5). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. In the event of abrupt shocks, the sizeable amount of financial resources of the Exchange Fund will provide a powerful backstop in protecting Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\n# Other activities\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to the monetary and financial stability of Hong Kong. In 2017, the CBC considered various issues, including the drivers of short-run dynamics in Hong Kong’s housing prices, the determinants of HIBOR-London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) spreads, the effect of property valuation changes on corporate borrowing in Mainland China, and the effect of mortgage debt service burden on private consumption in Hong Kong. Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and the reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research (HKIMR) continued to sponsor research in the fields of monetary policy, banking and finance. Over the past three years, the HKIMR has been re-orienting its activities towards higher policy relevance. This is reflected, in particular, in its conference activities and visiting fellowship programmes. The HKIMR has been collaborating with major central banks and policy institutions to jointly organise more policyfocused conferences. Meanwhile, a thematic research fellowship programme introduced in 2016 has been supporting more research projects related to policy issues that are of importance to the HKMA.\n\nIn 2017, the HKIMR hosted 18 research fellows and published 29 working papers. It also organised four international conferences and workshops during the year:\n- The Eighth Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy, titled “China’s Economic Rebalancing: Where is it Heading?”, was held in January in Hong Kong. The conference provided a forum for academics, policy makers and business economists to discuss important analytical and policy issues related to the Mainland economy. 11 highquality research papers were presented, covering a wide variety of issues including Mainland’s economic rebalancing, structural reform and international spillovers, issues on the renminbi exchange rate, and Mainland’s monetary policy framework and transmission.\n- The 15th HKIMR Summer Workshop was held in July. The workshop was intended to provide an opportunity for staff members of the HKIMR and the HKMA to present their research papers, and to enhance interaction between research staff and visiting fellows.\n- A joint conference organised by the HKMA and the Bank for International Settlements, titled “The Price, Real and Financial Effects of Exchange Rates”, was held in August. The conference provided a platform for in-depth and insightful discussion. A wide range of important topics were covered, including the exchange rate system, the pricing system of international trade, risk taking in the accumulation of foreign currency reserves, and foreign exchange market behaviour.\n- A conference jointly sponsored by the HKMA, the US Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta on “Unconventional Monetary Policy: Lessons Learned” was held in October. The conference reviewed lessons learned from the unconventional monetary policies (UMP) of major central banks over the past ten years. The topics included monetary policy in a low interest rate environment, UMP and its spillovers to emerging economies, UMP and bank lending, and UMP and its effects on the real economy and financial stability.\n", "zh": "\n# 貨幣穩定  \n\n儘管港元兌美元匯率面臨減弱壓力，港元匯率及貨幣市場仍持續有序運作，流動性充裕。聯繫匯率制度作為香港貨幣及金融穩定的重要支撐，並證明其在各種衝擊下具有高度彈性。  \n\n# 目標  \n\n香港貨幣政策的主要目標是維持貨幣穩定。這被定義為港幣在國際外匯市場上對美元兌換價值的穩定，其範圍為港元7.75–7.85對美國1美元。貨幣體系的結構特徵為貨幣局安排，要求貨幣基礎至少由外匯基金持有的100%美元儲備支持，貨幣基礎的變動需與相應的美元儲備變動完全匹配。  \n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括：  \n- 承諾證書，用以完全支援三家發鈔銀行發行的紙幣  \n- 政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣  \n- 清算帳戶餘額總額，即銀行存於香港金融管理局的清算賬戶餘額之和  \n- 香港金融管理局代表政府發行的外匯基金債券及紙幣（EFBNs）。  \n\n港元兌美元匯率的穩定透過自動利率調節機制以及香港金融管理局承諾履行兌換承諾（CUs）來實現。當港元需求大於供給，市場匯率強化至強側CUs的港元7.75對1美元時，香港金融管理局將準備向銀行出售港元以换取美元。隨後，清算帳戶餘額總額將擴張，壓低港元利息率，創造讓港元遠離強側限額並進入兌換區間7.75至7.85的貨幣條件。相反，若港元供給大於需求，市場匯率弱化至弱側CUs的港元7.85對1美元時，香港金融管理局將從銀行買入港元。清算帳戶餘額總額隨後收縮，推動港元利息率上升，使港元遠離弱側限額並保持在兌換區間內。  \n\n# 2017年回顧  \n\n# 匯率穩定  \n\n2017年，港元兌美元匯率普遍面臨減弱壓力（圖表1）。主要受港元與美元利率差擴大所驅動的套利交易活動影響，港元逐步貶值，從1月3日的7.7566降至8月22日的年度低位7.8265。由於新股上市相關資金需求導致港元流動性緊縮，港元兌美元匯率在9月下旬至11月初一度走強，並在7.80–7.81的窄幅範圍內波動。年末期間，港元再次出現減弱壓力，部分原因是港元流動性條件略有改善以及年底對美元的商業需求增加。整體而言，2017年港元外匯市場運作正常。  \n\n由于未觸發CUs，2017年清算帳戶餘額總額與待償EFBNs總額基本保持不變，約為1,2253億港元（圖表2）。全年內，香港金融管理局發行總計800億港元額外外匯基金債券，以滿足銀行增加的流動性管理需求。這導致清算帳戶餘額總額於2017年年底收縮至1798億港元。額外外匯基金債券的發行符合貨幣局原則，僅代表貨幣基礎組成的變化，即從清算帳戶餘額轉移至待償EFBNs。貨幣基礎始終由外匯儲備完全支持。  \n\n# 貨幣市場  \n\n2017年前八個月，港元銀行間利率保持疲軟，年底則面臨更大上漲壓力（圖表3）。儘管美國聯邦儲備理事會加息及資產負債表正常化的擔憂，港元銀行間利率在前八個月中整體保持疲軟。因此，港元與美元利率差自1月至8月進一步擴大。自9月起，短期港元銀行間利率大幅上升，主要受到新股上市相關及年底資金需求的驅動。由此，港元與美元利率差在短端段收窄。整體而言，2017年短期銀行間利率大多低於基準利率。  \n\n基準利率於3月16日、6月15日及12月14日共三次上調，累計75個基點，由1.00%升至1.75%，因美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍全年三次上調，共75個基點，由0.50–0.75%升至1.25–1.50%。基準利率的調整遵循2009年3月26日宣布的修訂公式，其中基準利率設定為現行美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍下限之上50個基點，或五天移動平均的隔夜及一個月Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate（HIBOR）的平均值，以較高者為準。  \n\n大致追蹤港元與美元利率差的走勢，港元期權貼水在頭三個季度逐步擴大，至9月中旬，12個月港元期權貼水達到約-615個基點（圖表4）。第四季度，隨著港元與美元利率差的收窄，港元期權貼水略微收窄。整體而言，香港貨幣市場繼續有序運作，銀行間流動性依然充足。貼現窗借款由2016年的53億港元增至2017年的103億港元。  \n\n# 聯繫匯率制度  \n\n自1983年建立以來，聯繫匯率制度（LERS）一直作為香港貨幣及金融穩定的重要支撐，在一系列區域性和全球金融危機中證明其高度彈性。政府重申對LERS的全面承諾，其承諾的可信度亦因外匯及貨幣市場的穩定而進一步加強。公眾對港元作為支付手段和價值儲藏工具的信心持續強勁。在2017年與香港的第四條款磋商中，國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）重申支持LERS，評論稱LERS仍是香港最合適的匯率安排。結合堅實的金融監督與規管、謹慎的財政管理和靈活的市場，LERS有效地幫助香港成功應對外國內挑戰。  \n\n國際貨幣基金組織：“聯繫匯率制度仍然是香港的最佳選擇。”  \n\n健全的銀行系統對於LERS的正常運作至關重要。2017年，香港金融管理局持續密切監測銀行對信貸、流動性及利率風險的管理情況及壓力測試結果，並加強對企業、房地產及內地相關貸款的監督，以增強銀行業的抗風險能力。隨著美國聯邦儲備理事會繼續推行貨幣政策正常化，港元利率將逐漸趨於正常化。香港金融管理局重申，在LERS設計框架下，資本外流、港元兌美元匯率弱化、觸發弱側CU以及貨幣基礎減少均屬港元利率正常化的必要過程。香港金融管理局也提醒公眾審慎管理風險，做好迎接潛在金融波動的準備。  \n\n為了提高貨幣局賬戶的透明度，自1998年10月起，一部分外匯基金資產已專門撥備以支持貨幣基礎。按鈕率（Backing Ratio）定義為按鈕資產除以貨幣基礎，在2017年內維持在106.7–108.2%範圍內，未觸及上限或下限觸發水平。該比率於12月31日收盤為108.1%（圖表5）。根據LERS，雖然指定部分外匯基金資產專門用於按鈕投資組合，但所有外匯基金資產均可用于支持港元兌美元匯率。在突發衝擊情況下，外匯基金龐大的財務資源將提供強有力的防護，保障香港的貨幣及金融穩定。  \n\n# 其他活動  \n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會的貨幣局子委員會（CBC）監督及審查與香港貨幣及金融穩定相關的事項。2017年，CBC審議多項議題，包括香港樓市短線動態的驅動因素、HIBOR－倫敦銀行同業拆借利率（LIBOR）差價的決定因素、房產估值變動對中國大陸企業借錢的影響，以及房貸還款負擔對香港私人消費的影響。CBC就這些問題的討論記錄及其提交給CBC的貨幣局運作報告均已張貼於香港金融管理局網站。  \n\n香港貨幣研究院（HKIMR）持續贊助貨幣政策、銀行及金融領域的研究。過去三年，HKIMR重新定位其活動方向，以提高政策相關性。特別是在其會議活動和訪問研究人員計劃方面有所反映。HKIMR已與主要中央銀行及政策機構合作舉辦更多聚焦政策的研討會。同時，2016年推出的主題研究訪問計畫已經支持更多與香港金融管理局重要政策議題相關的研究項目。  \n\n2017年，HKIMR接待了18位研究員，並發表了29份工作論文。同年還組織了四次國際研討會及會議：  \n- 第八屆中國經濟國際年會於1月在香港舉行，主題為“中國經濟再平衡：方向何在？”。本次會議為學者、政策制定者及商界經濟學家提供了探討內地經濟相關分析與政策議題的平台。共有11篇高質量研究論文提出，涵蓋內容廣泛，包括內地經濟再平衡、結構改革及國際溢出效應、人民幣匯率問題，以及內地貨幣政策架構及傳導機制。  \n- 第十五屆HKIMR夏季研討會於7月舉行。該研討會旨在為HKIMR及HKMA的員工提供機會展示研究成果，並促進研究人員與訪問學者的互動。  \n- 由HKMA與國際清算銀行聯合舉辦的研討會，主題為“匯率的價格、實際及金融影響”，於8月舉行。此次會議提供了深入且有見地的討論平台，涵蓋一系列重要的議題，包括匯率制度、國際貿易價格體系、外幣儲備積累中的風險承擔及外匯市場行為。  \n- 由HKMA、美國聯邦儲備局及亞特蘭大聯邦儲備銀行共同資助的研討會，主題為“非常規貨幣政策：經驗教訓”，於10月舉行。該研討會回顧了主要中央銀行過去看十多年的非傳統貨幣政策（UMP）的經驗教訓。議題包括低利率環境下的貨幣政策、UMP及其對新興經濟體的溢出效應、UMP與銀行貸放，以及UMP對實體經濟及金融穩定的影響。"}
{"en": "# Banking Stability\n\nIn 2017, the HKMA continued to place its supervisory focus on the effectiveness of authorized institutions’ risk governance framework, including credit and liquidity risk management systems. During the year, another round of countercyclical macro-prudential measures was introduced to strengthen the resilience of the banking sector to cope with any downturn in the property market. With cyber threats on the rise, the HKMA stepped up the supervision of authorized institutions’ technology risk management. At the same time, the HKMA launched seven initiatives that prepare Hong Kong to move into a New Era of Smart Banking. The effectiveness of authorized institutions’ anti-money laundering and counterterrorist financing controls remained a key supervisory focus of the HKMA as part of its efforts to combat financial crimes. On conduct supervision, the HKMA took further steps to promote a customer-centric corporate culture, foster financial inclusion, and address difficulties encountered by small and medium-sized enterprises and start-up companies in opening and maintaining bank accounts in Hong Kong. Efforts were also made to enhance the supervision of authorized institutions’ sales practices for investment and insurance products to further strengthen customer protection.\n\nSubstantial progress was made on the local implementation of international supervisory and accounting standards, including capital adequacy standards, disclosure standards, the Net Stable Funding Ratio, large exposure limits, recovery planning and International Financial Reporting Standard 9. In support of the need for capacity building amid an ever-changing banking environment and evolving risk landscape, the HKMA co-ordinated with the industry to develop director empowerment programmes and the Enhanced Competency Framework for banking practitioners.\n\nThe Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance came into operation on 7 July 2017, making Hong Kong one of the few Financial Stability Board member jurisdictions with a fully cross-sectoral resolution regime for financial institutions. The Ordinance, establishing a new line of defence for financial stability, confers necessary powers on the Monetary Authority to manage, in an orderly manner, failure of a financial institution in circumstances where such failure could have adverse systemic consequences.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this objective is contingent upon the financial system being highly resilient and capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their business and, in extremis, by failing in a disorderly manner. The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring banks are resilient to shocks and are able to recover their positions in response to crises, which ultimately helps prevent failures. The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banking business, which includes the business of taking deposits, in Hong Kong. It is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposittaking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs). The Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs).\n\nHowever, the Monetary Authority cannot ensure, nor is the Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework designed to ensure, a zero-risk financial system. Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that in the event of an AI’s failure, resolution may be conducted in an orderly manner such that continuity in critical financial services provided by AIs to their customers can be maintained. To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong is established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs, amongst other financial institutions.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2017\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nIn 2017, 192 off-site reviews were conducted covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL ratings1, corporate governance, business operations and risk management of AIs. As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance at AIs, 30 meetings were held with the boards of directors or board-level committees of AIs, with the discussions focused on important risk management issues. The HKMA also conducted a survey to monitor the adoption of its recent guidance on corporate governance. 27 tripartite meetings among the HKMA, AIs and their external auditors were also held.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA continued to conduct regular on-site examinations supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk. This approach has allowed the HKMA to prioritise its supervisory resources to focus on emerging and more significant risks faced by AIs. The HKMA conducted 401 on-site examinations and thematic reviews during the year. Credit risk management and controls remained the key focus of these examinations and reviews. Another major focus was technology risk and operational risk management. The HKMA also increased the number of overseas examinations and the number of on-site examinations and thematic reviews targeted at liquidity and market risk management as well as anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML/CFT) controls. On-site examinations of AIs’ activities in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses were also conducted by specialist teams.\n\n# Supervision of credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nTotal bank lending grew by 16.1%, compared with a growth of 6.5% in 2016. As shown in Table 2, the loan growth was broad-based.\n\nSpecifically, Mainland-related lending grew by 17.5% to HK$4,188 billion at the end of 2017 (Table 3). This included HK$644 billion of loans booked with Mainland subsidiaries of banks incorporated in Hong Kong.\n\nThe asset quality of AIs remained healthy in 2017. Retail banks’ classified loan ratio edged down from 0.72% at the end of 2016 to 0.54% at the end of 2017, well below the long-run historical average of 2.2% since 2000. For the banking industry as a whole, the classified loan ratio decreased from 0.85% to 0.67%. As regards Mainlandrelated lending, retail banks’ classified loan ratio of such lending edged down to 0.75% in 2017 from 0.82%. For the banking industry as a whole, the ratio decreased to 0.67% from 0.80% a year ago.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA stepped up its supervisory efforts to ensure that AIs continued to adopt prudent credit risk management standards. In particular, the surveillance of AIs’ exposures to major corporates was enhanced. Targeted thematic examinations were conducted, focusing on key credit risk management controls such as loan underwriting standards, the loan classification and provisioning system, credit risk governance framework and risk management for lending to property developers, asset-backed financing and insurance premium financing.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nProperty prices continued to rise in 2017. There were more loans extended by AIs involving borrowers with multiple mortgages or with income derived from outside of Hong Kong. In view of these developments, the HKMA introduced another round of countercyclical macroprudential measures on 19 May. The eighth round of measures included raising the risk-weight floor for the calculation of capital charges for new residential mortgage loans granted by AIs, lowering the applicable loan-to-value (LTV) ratio cap for property mortgage loans extended to borrowers with pre-existing mortgages, and lowering the applicable debt servicing ratio (DSR) limit for property mortgage loans extended to borrowers whose income is derived mainly from outside of Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA’s macro-prudential measures on property mortgage loans, introduced since 2009, have enhanced banks’ resilience to risks associated with the property market. The average LTV ratio of new residential mortgage loans fell to 49% in December 2017 from 64% in September 2009, before the countercyclical measures were first introduced. The average DSR also decreased to 35% in December 2017 from 41% in August 2010, when a cap on DSR was first applied (Chart 1).\n\nThe HKMA observed that some developers financed their property development projects with high gearing and some of them provided mortgages with high LTV ratios to buyers of properties. To address the risks associated with these developments, the HKMA introduced new risk management measures for lending to property developers on 12 May. These included requiring AIs to lower the financing caps for construction financing; requiring AIs to set aside more capital for their lending to property developers with a higher proportion of mortgage loans relative to equity; and performing a round of thematic examinations to ensure that banks continue to follow prudent underwriting standards in their lending to property developers.\n\nSeparately, the HKMA worked with the Land Registry in launching an e-Alert service in February. The e-Alert service provides a notification to the AI concerned whenever a further mortgage in respect of the mortgaged property is lodged with the Land Registry for registration, so that the mortgagee bank can take appropriate risk mitigating actions as appropriate.\n\n# Supervision of operational and technology risks\n\nCybersecurity threats continued to increase over the year. The HKMA stepped up its supervisory efforts in a bid to enhance the cyber resilience of the banking sector. As part of the Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative (CFI) rolled out by the HKMA in 2016, 30 AIs completed an assessment of the maturity of their cyber defences. Separately, the HKMA and the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), after extensive consultation with the banking and securities industry, jointly decided to introduce a mandatory twofactor authentication for online share trading. A round of on-site examinations focused on banks’ cybersecurity controls and operational resilience was also conducted. The HKMA further completed a round of discussions with the senior management of major banks to assess how the banks were managing strategic risks posed by potential new market entrants powered by technological advancement.\n\n# Smart Banking\n\nIn September, the HKMA announced a package of measures to assist Hong Kong’s banking sector in migrating to a new era of Smart Banking. On the supervisory front, the HKMA enhanced the Fintech Supervisory Sandbox to version 2.0, with new features including a Chatroom facility accessible by both banks and technology firms and the establishment of linkages among the sandboxes of the HKMA, the SFC and the Insurance Authority (IA), so as to provide a single point of entry for conducting trials of cross-sector fintech products.\n\nThe HKMA also launched a Banking Made Easy initiative to identify and minimise regulatory frictions with the aim of further improving customers’ experience in using fintech and digital banking services. A taskforce has been set up with the current focus on remote onboarding and account maintenance, online finance and online wealth management.\n\nA review of the existing Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks has commenced to facilitate the introduction of virtual banking in Hong Kong.\n\n# Supervision of treasury activities and liquidity risk\n\nAs the US continued to normalise its monetary policy, global fund flows might become increasingly volatile. In consideration of this, the HKMA placed increased focus on the supervision of liquidity risk during the year. The HKMA enhanced its supervisory liquidity stress testing with additional scenarios, including a more stressful but plausible scenario of fund outflows and a short-term, confidencedriven bank run scenario. The HKMA also stepped up the monitoring and analysis of individual AIs’ liquidity profiles and required selected AIs to strengthen their liquidity risk management capability.\n\nSeparately, the HKMA conducted more on-site examinations of AIs’ market risk management in respect of their debt securities portfolios. A round of thematic reviews were carried out to evaluate potential risks arising from AIs’ increased investment activities in foreign currency bonds and to assess the effectiveness of the corresponding risk management, including hedging practices.\n\n# Prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF)\n\nThe Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) (Amendment) Bill 2017 was gazetted on 23 June and will come into operation in 2018. The amendment is intended to update Hong Kong’s regulatory regime for AML/CFT in line with the latest international requirements as promulgated by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). These changes, together with updates to the statutory guideline on AML/CFT, will help clarify and implement the risk-based approach in customer due diligence (CDD) processes for account opening and the maintenance of bona fide customers, and encourage innovation where such processes are carried out remotely.\n", "zh": "\n# 銀行穩定性\n\n2017年，香港金融管理局持續將監管重點放在認可機構（AIs）風險治理架構的有效性上，包括信貸風險及流動性風險管理系統。該年度，推出了另一輪反週期宏观審慎措施，以加強銀行業對房地產市場下行的韌性。隨著網絡威脅增加，香港金融管理局加強了對認可機構技術風險管理的監督。同時，香港金融管理局推出七項計劃，協助香港邁向智能銀行的新時代。認可機構反洗錢及打擊恐怖主義融資控制的有效性仍是香港金融管理局監管重點之一，作為其打擊金融罪案努力的一部分。在業務行為監管方面，香港金融管理局採取進一步行動促進以客戶為中心的企業文化，推動金融包容性，並解決中小企業和創業公司在香港開設和維護銀行帳戶時遇到的困難。亦致力於加強對認可機構投資及保險產品銷售實務的監管，以進一步強化客戶保護。\n\n在本地實施國際監管及會計標準方面取得重大進展，包括資本充足率標準、披露標準、淨穩定資金比例（NSFR）、大筆敞口限額、恢復計劃及國際財務報告準則第9號（IFRS 9）。為支持不斷變化的銀行業環境及風險景觀所需的能力建設，香港金融管理局與業界協調開發董事授權計畫及銀行從業人員增強專業能力框架。\n\n《金融機構（清算）條例》於2017年7月7日生效，使香港成為金融穩定理事會成員中少數具備針對金融機構全面跨領域清算機制的司法管轄區之一。該條例建立了一道新的防線來確保金融穩定，賦予貨幣當局在可能造成系統性負面影響的情況下有序管理金融機構失敗的必要權力。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港金融管理局的一般目標是促進銀行體系的安全與穩定。實現這一目標取決於金融體系具有高度韌性，並能夠提供香港經濟所需的重要金融服務。\n\n銀行通過其營運方式可以影響體系的穩定性，尤其是在極端情況下以無序的方式失敗。作為監管機構，貨幣當局透過確保銀行具備應對衝擊的韌性和在危機中恢復地位的能力，在保障金融穩定方面扮演關鍵角色，這最終有助防止失敗。貨幣當局負責銀行業的審慎監管，包括吸收存款的業務。它負責授權香港的持牌銀行、有限牌照銀行及接受存款公司，統稱為認可機構（AIs）。貨幣當局還負責指定及監督某些金融市場基礎設施（FMIs）。\n\n然而，貨幣當局無法確保，也不期望香港的審慎監管框架能確保零風險的金融體系。相反，作為清算機構，貨幣當局旨在確保在認可機構失敗的情況下，清算可在有序進行，使認可機構對其客戶提供的關鍵金融服務保持連續性。為此，建立了香港金融機構的清算機制，在此機制下，貨幣當局是認可機構及其他金融機構的清算機構。\n\n# 2017年回顧\n\n# 監管活動概覽\n\n2017年，進行了192次非現場評估，涵蓋廣泛議題，包括CAMEL評級、公司治理、認可機構（AIs）的業務操作及風險管理。為了持續推進提升AIs風險治理，與AIs的董事會或董事會委員會舉辦了30次會議，探討重要的風險管理工作。香港金融管理局還進行了一項調查以追蹤其近期公司治理指引的採納情況。此外，還舉辦了27次香港金融管理局、AIs及其外部核數師三方會議。\n\n除了非現場活動外，香港金融管理局繼續進行定期現場檢查，並補充針對高風險領域的主題審查。這種方法讓香港金融管理局能夠優先分配監管資源，專注於AIs面臨的新興和更重大的風險。該年度進行了401次現場檢查和主題審查。信貸風險管理和控製仍然是這些檢查和審查的主要焦點。另一個主要關注點是技術風險和操作風險管理。香港金融管理局也增加了海外檢查數量及針對流動性風險和市場風險管理以及反洗錢及打擊恐怖主義融資（AML/CFT）控製的現場檢查和主題審查數量。專業小組也對AIs在證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（MPF）相關業務進行了現場檢查。\n\n# 信貸風險監管\n\n# 信貸增長與資產質素\n\n總銀行信貸較2016年的增長6.5%成長了16.1%。如表2所示，信貸增長是廣泛的。\n\n具體而言，內地相關信貸於2017年末達到4,1880億港元，增幅達17.5%（表3）。其中包括6440億港元由在香港註冊的銀行之內地子公司發放的信貸。\n\n2017年，認可機構（AIs）的資產質素仍然健康。零售銀行的分類貸款比率自2016年末的0.72%微降至2017年末的0.54%，遠低於自2000年以來長期歷史平均值2.2%。整個銀行業的分類貸款比率從0.85%下降至0.67%。就內地相關信貸而言，零售銀行的該類信貸分類貸款比率自2017年的0.82%微降至0.75%。整個銀行業的比率則自一年前的0.80%下降至0.67%。\n\n期間，香港金融管理局加強了監管努力，以確保認可機構（AIs）持續採用謹慎的信貸風險管理標準。特別是加強了對AIs對主要企業的信貸曝光的監測。進行了針對性的主題審查，聚焦於關鍵信貸風險管理控制，例如信貸評核標準、信貸分類和撥備制度、信貸風險治理架構及對樓宇發展商、資產抵押融資及保險保費融資的風險管理。\n\n# 房地產按揭信貸\n\n2017年，房價持續上漲。AIs發放的信貸中有更多借款人涉及多筆按揭或收入來自香港以外地區。鑒於這些發展，香港金融管理局於5月19日引入另一次反週期宏觀審慎措施。第八輪措施包括提高新住宅按揭信貸計算資本費用的風險加權基準；降低對已有按揭貸款的借款人發放按揭信貸的貸款價值比（LTV）上限；以及降低對收入主要來自香港以外地區的借款人的按揭信貸債務還款比率（DSR）上限。\n\n自2009年起推出的香港金融管理局房地產按揭信貸宏觀審慎措施，提高了銀行對房地產市場風險的韌性。截至2017年12月，新住宅按揭信貸的平均LTV比率降至49%，而2009年9月首次引入反週期措施前為64%。截至2017年12月，平均DSR也降至35%，而2010年8月首次應用DSR上限時為41%（圖表1）。\n\n香港金融管理局觀察到一些發展商以高槓桿資金進行房地產開發項目，一些發展商為買家提供高LTV比率的按揭。為處理這些發展所帶來的風險，香港金融管理局於5月12日引入針對樓宇發展商貸款的新風險管理措施。這些措施包括要求AIs降低建築融資的融資上限；要求AIs為對擁有較高抵押貸款比例相對於股本的樓宇發展商的貸款準備更多資本；並進行主題審查，確保銀行繼續遵循對樓宇發展商貸款的謹慎評核標準。\n\n另外，香港金融管理局與土地註冊處合作，於2月推出電郵警報服務。該電郵警報服務在土地註冊處收到有關抵押物的進一步抵押登記時通知有關AIs，讓抵押人銀行可以採取適當的風險緩解措施。\n\n# 操作風險與技術風險監管\n\n全年網路安全威脅持續增加。為提高銀行業的網絡安全韌性，香港金融管理局加強了監管努力。根據香港金融管理局2016年推出的「網絡安全加固計劃」(CFI)，30家AIs已完成對其網絡防禦成熟度的評估。此外，經過與銀行業及證券業的深入磋商，香港金融管理局與證券及期貨事務監察委員會（SFC）共同決定對網上股票交易實施強制雙因素驗證。還進行了一輪以銀行網絡安全控制及操作韌性為重點的現場檢查。香港金融管理局也完成了與大型銀行高層管理團隊的討論，評估銀行如何應對由科技進步驅動的新市場參與者的戰略風險。\n\n# 智能銀行\n\n9月，香港金融管理局宣布一整套措施，幫助香港銀行業遷移至智能銀行的新時代。在監管方面，香港金融管理局升級了金融科技監管沙盒至2.0版本，新增功能包括銀行和科技公司均可訪問的聊天室功能，以及建立香港金融管理局、證券及期貨事務監察委員會（SFC）及保險資訊處（IA）沙盒之間的連結，以便為跨領域金融科技產品的試驗提供單一入口。\n\n香港金融管理局還推出了「銀行易」計劃，識別並減少監管摩擦，進一步改善用戶使用金融科技及數字銀行服務的體驗。已成立一個工作小組，目前重點關注遠程開戶及賬戶維護、線上信貸及線上理財。\n\n現正進行對現有虛擬銀行授權指南的審查，以方便在香港引進虛擬銀行。\n\n# 財務活動與流動性風險監管\n\n美國持續正常化其貨幣政策，全球資金流入可能變得更加波動。鑑於此，香港金融管理局於該年度加強了對流動性風險的監管。香港金融管理局透過加入新的情景，加強了監管流動性壓力測試，包括更具壓倒性但合理的資金流出情景，以及短期、受信心驅動的銀行擠提情景。香港金融管理局還加強了對個別AIs流動性狀況的監測與分析，並要求部分AIs加強其流動性風險管理能力。\n\n另外，香港金融管理局加強了對AIs在其債券證券組合中的市場風險管理的現場檢查。進行了一輪主題審查，以評估AIs增加在外幣債券上的投資活動可能產生的風險，並評估相應風險管理措施（包括對沖做法）的效果。\n\n# 防止洗錢及恐怖主義融資（ML/TF）\n\n《防止洗錢及恐怖主義融資（金融機構）（修訂）條例草案》於6月23日公佈，預計2018年生效。修訂目的是根據金融行動特別任務組（FATF）最新發布的國際要求更新香港的反洗錢及打擊恐怖主義融資監管制度。這些變化連同對反洗錢及打擊恐怖主義融資法定指引的更新，有助澄清並落實客戶盡職調查（CDD）程序中的風險為本方法，以開立賬戶及維護誠信客戶，並鼓勵在執行此等程序時進行創新。\n"}
{"en": "# International Financial Centre\n\nTo consolidate Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre, the HKMA strives to enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. On fintech, the seven new initiatives aimed at facilitating the development and use of fintech in the banking and payment industries were well received by stakeholders and the public. Hong Kong’s international profile as a financing hub for infrastructure investments was raised further, thanks to a series of efforts on network and capacity building on this front. The launch of Bond Connect reinforced Hong Kong’s position as the main gateway to opportunities in Mainland China. The HKMA’s efforts on other areas such as corporate treasury centres were also bearing fruits.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nIn view of the rapid technological advancements, the HKMA in September announced the launch of seven initiatives to prepare Hong Kong to move into a new era of Smart Banking. These initiatives included:\n- developing the Faster Payment System (FPS) to achieve full connectivity of digital retail payments;\n- introducing an Open Application Programming Interface (Open API) framework;\n- enhancing fintech research and talent development;\n- stepping up cross-border collaboration in fintech;\n- upgrading our existing Fintech Supervisory Sandbox (FSS) 1.0 to Version 2.0;\n- facilitating the introduction of virtual banking; and\n- promoting a new Banking Made Easy initiative to minimise regulatory frictions in customers’ digital experience.\n\nThe HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO), together with the banking departments of the HKMA, played a pivotal role in driving the implementation of these initiatives to strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia.\n\nHong Kong’s international profile as a financing hub for infrastructure investments was raised further, as the number of partners of the HKMA Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO) grew to 87 as at 31 January 2018 from about 40 at inception. During the year, IFFO organised and participated in more than 10 seminars and workshops to facilitate experience sharing and collaborative networking among key stakeholders. In particular, IFFO steered the development of an infrastructure equity investment reference term sheet in its inaugural Debt Financing and Investors’ Roundtables with a view to enhancing infrastructure projects’ bankability and investability.\n\nBond Connect was launched in July, marking another major milestone in mutual access between the Hong Kong and Mainland capital markets, and further solidifying our gateway position for international investors seeking to enter the Mainland market. During the year, Hong Kong’s Renminbi Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (RQFII) quota was increased to RMB500 billion from RMB270 billion. Hong Kong maintained the world’s largest offshore renminbi liquidity pool, with vibrant renminbi financial intermediation activities as evidenced by a high turnover of our renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system and the lion’s share of Hong Kong’s renminbi payment activities in the world.\n\nFollowing the introduction of the tax regime for corporate treasury centres (CTCs) in 2016, the HKMA stepped up its outreach efforts with a view to attracting more multinational corporates to set up treasury centres in Hong Kong. By the end of 2017, more than 40 corporates reflected to the HKMA that they were actively planning to set up, or had set up, treasury centre operations in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA actively contributed to international discussions on issues of significance to global and regional financial stability. The Chief Executive of the HKMA became the Chair of the Standing Committee on Supervisory and Regulatory Co-operation (SRC) of the Financial Stability Board (FSB)1 in April to lead discussions on key financial stability issues.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure lays a solid foundation for Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre and global offshore renminbi business hub. The four interbank RTGS systems and the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) achieved 100% system availability in 2017, as compared to the target of 99.95%. To support Northbound Trading of Bond Connect, CMU has set up accounts with the two Mainland central securities depositories (CSDs) to facilitate the settlement of Bond Connect transactions and holding of Mainland debt securities on behalf of relevant CMU members.\n\nTo promote the general safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA designated four retail payment systems (RPSs) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO) in August to bring their operations under the HKMA’s oversight. The HKMA also conducted supervision of 16 stored value facility (SVF) licensees which actively launched new products and services that sought to offer customers more choices and better user experience. Separately, the coverage of e-Cheque and Electronic Bill Presentment and Payment (EBPP) service was further expanded to include crossboundary payments between Hong Kong and the entire Guangdong Province.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2017\n\n# Hong Kong as a fintech hub in Asia\n\n# Smart Banking Initiatives\n\nIn light of the rapid technological advancements, the HKMA in September announced seven initiatives that would prepare Hong Kong to move into a new era of Smart Banking. The initiatives aimed to help the banking sector to rise to a higher level and embrace the enormous opportunities brought about by the convergence of banking and technology.\n\n“Smart Banking would offer full interconnectivity amongst retail and corporate customers and allow financial services and transactions to be undertaken with great mobility, speed, ease and safety.”\n\nThe HKMA has been working closely with the banking industry and the fintech community, and made good progress in implementing the seven initiatives.\n\n# Faster Payment System\n\nThe FPS is a multi-currency platform that would enable the public to make round-the-clock funds transfers in a real-time manner with ease, through using mobile phone numbers or email addresses. It can support payments in Hong Kong dollars and renminbi. Banks and non-bank payment service providers can participate in the FPS, enabling full connectivity among all payment participants. With system development work close to completion, the FPS is scheduled to launch in September 2018.\n\nFurthermore, the HKMA led a working group, comprising major credit card scheme operators, banks, licensed SVF operators and merchant acquirers, to establish a common QR code standard for retail payments in Hong Kong. A common QR code standard would facilitate merchants in using a single QR code to accept QR code payment solutions from multiple payment service providers, providing greater convenience to customers and merchants. The working group has finalised the relevant technical specification, and would work out the implementation arrangements.\n\n# Open Application Programming Interface\n\nOpen API allows banks’ data to be accessed by third parties to facilitate better and easier integration of services offered by banks and other industries. Users can therefore conveniently stay on one system to enjoy integrated services in a secure environment. To facilitate the development and adoption of Open API by the banking sector, the HKMA has come up with a draft Open API framework, comprising a selection of Open API functions and deployment time frame, technical standards, third-party service provider governance, facilitation measures and maintenance models, for a two-month industry consultation.\n\n# Research and talent development\n\nOne of the major research projects was on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). Following the first DLT whitepaper in 2016, the second whitepaper on DLT was published in October 2017. The second whitepaper further explores the three Proof-of-Concept works, namely trade finance, digital identity management and mortgage application. It also offers advice on the implementation issues relating to governance, legal and compliance, and general control principles on deploying DLT for the banking and payment industries.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan, announces the release of the second whitepaper on DLT at the HKMA Fintech Day.\n\nRiding on the success of the Proof-of-Concept work on trade finance led by the HKMA, seven banks in Hong Kong decided to commercialise the prototype into a production system named Hong Kong Trade Finance Platform (HKTFP) to digitise and share trade documents and automate processes with a view to improving the overall trade process and reducing risks and fraud in the trade finance business.\n\nIn an effort to enlarge the talent pool in the fintech industry, the HKMA launched the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme in collaboration with the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute in December 2016. Response from students was positive. More than 3,000 applications from 421 applicants were received. Finally, 74 students accepted internship offers from the HKMA and 12 banks to work on fintech-related projects for six months or one year starting from July.\n\n# Cross-border collaboration\n\nAs the first step of strengthening our collaboration within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Bay Area, we are partnering with Shenzhen to promote fintech and talent developments. Specifically, the HKMA and the Office of Financial Development Service, the People’s Government of Shenzhen Municipality (OFDS) entered into an agreement in June to (i) provide reciprocal soft-landing support for fintech firms, (ii) co-organise the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Fintech Award in October to recognise and reward outstanding fintech products and solutions in the two cities; and (iii) arrange summer internships at Shenzhen fintech and techfin firms for Hong Kong students.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan (middle), signs and exchanges Memoranda of Understanding on softlanding arrangements with OFDS Director-General, Mr He Xiaojun (left), and Cyberport Chairman, Dr Lee George Lam, at the HKMA Fintech Day.\n\nE-leaflet for the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Fintech Award.\n\nThe HKMA also signed fintech co-operation agreements with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Dubai Financial Services Authority on innovation projects, referrals of innovative businesses, information sharing and exchange of expertise.\n\nIn November, the HKMA further signed a Memorandum of Understanding with MAS to jointly build the Global Trade Connectivity Network (GTCN), which would connect Singapore’s National Trade Platform to the HKTFP to form a cross-border DLT infrastructure in order to digitalise cross-border trade and trade finance processes, making them safer, more efficient and costeffective. It will be an open platform that allows other interested jurisdictions to participate in the future. The GTCN is expected to be launched in the first quarter of 2019.\n\n# Fintech Supervisory Sandbox\n\nThe FSS launched by the HKMA in September 2016 was upgraded to FSS 2.0 to expedite communication with banks and tech firms to facilitate new ideas and initiatives. Specifically, FSS 2.0 has the following new features:\n- A Fintech Supervisory Chatroom is set up to provide feedback to banks and tech firms at an early stage of their fintech projects.\n- Tech firms can access the FSS by seeking feedback from the Chatroom without going through a bank.\n- The sandboxes of the HKMA, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Insurance Authority are linked up so that there is a single point of entry for pilot trials of cross-sector fintech products.\n\nAs of end-2017, 28 new technology products have been tested in the FSS. Out of these cases, 14 pilot trials have been completed, and the relevant products have been rolled out to the market subsequently.\n\n# Banking Made Easy initiative\n\nA Banking Made Easy initiative was launched to minimise regulatory frictions hindering technological innovations. A taskforce has been set up with current focus on the following areas:\n- Remote onboarding and account maintenance\n- Online finance\n- Online wealth management\n\n# Virtual Banking\n\nVirtual banks, which operate without physical branches, are expected to provide additional impetus to the application of fintech in Hong Kong and offer a new kind of customer experience in mobile and digital banking. They may also help promote financial inclusion as they normally target the retail segment, be they individuals or small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The HKMA has commenced the review of the existing Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks with a view to facilitating the introduction of virtual banking in Hong Kong.\n\n# A New Era of Smart Banking\n\n# Supervision and Innovation\n\nThe seven initiatives unveiled by the HKMA last year to prepare Hong Kong for a new era of Smart Banking are a large-scale project involving cooperation among various departments within the HKMA. With fintech becoming an unstoppable force, Mr Raymond Chan, Executive Director (Banking Supervision) of the HKMA, indicated that the HKMA, as a regulator, must embrace this new trend by keeping abreast of the latest technological developments and adjusting its supervisory mindset and approach as appropriate, in order to take bank services and customer experience to a new level.\n", "zh": "\n# 國際金融中心\n\n為鞏固香港作為國際金融中心的地位，香港金融管理局（HKMA）致力提升香港金融平台的競爭力。在金融科技方面，七項新舉措旨在促進銀行業及支付行業的科技發展與應用，受到利益相關者及公眾的歡迎。由於在這個領域進行了一系列網絡建設和能力建設工作，香港作為基礎設施投資融資中心的國際聲譽進一步提高。債券通的推出強化了香港作為進入中國內地市場主要門戶的地位。HKMA在企業財務中心等其他領域的努力也初見成效。\n\n# 概覽\n\n鑒於技術迅速發展，HKMA於九月宣布啟動七項計劃，以準備香港邁入智慧銀行的新時代。這些計劃包括：  \n- 發展快速支付系統（FPS），實現數字零售支付的全面連接；  \n- 引入開放應用程式介面（Open API）框架；  \n- 加強金融科技研究與人才培養；  \n- 加強跨境金融科技合作；  \n- 升級現有的金融科技監督沙盒（FSS）1.0至2.0版本；  \n- 推動虛擬銀行的引入；以及  \n- 推廣「 Banking Made Easy」計劃，以減少客戶數字體驗中的監管障礙。\n\nHKMA金融科技推廣辦公室（FFO）與HKMA銀行部門共同發揮關鍵作用，推動這些計劃的落實，以加強香港作為亞太地區金融科技中心的地位。\n\n香港作為基礎設施投資融資中心的國際聲譽進一步提高，因HKMA基礎設施融資推廣辦公室（IFFO）的合作夥伴數量自成立時約40家增至2018年1月31日的87家。該年度，IFFO組織並參與了超過10場研討會和講座，促進關鍵利益相關者的經驗分享和協作網絡建設。特別是，IFFO在首次債務融資和投資者圓桌會議上引導制定了基礎設施權益投資參考條款模板，以提高基礎設施項目對銀行和投資者的可行性與吸引力。\n\n債券通於七月推出，標誌著香港與內地資本市場相互准入的重大里程碑，進一步鞏固了我們作為國際投資者進入內地市場門戶的地位。該年度，香港人民幣合格境外機構投資者（RQFII）配額從人民幣2700億元增加至人民幣5000億元。香港維持全球最大離岸人民幣流動性池地位，人民幣金融中介活動活躍，這由人民幣即時支付結算系統（RTGS）高交易頻率和香港人民幣支付活動在全球所佔主導份額加以證明。\n\n自2016年引入企業財務中心（CTC）稅收制度以來，HKMA加大了針對外國大型企業的宣傳力度，以吸引其在香港設立財務中心。截至2017年底，超過40家公司向HKMA表示他們正在積極規劃或已在香港建立財務中心業務。\n\nHKMA積極參與全球和區域金融穩定重大問題的國際討論。HKMA行政總裁于四月成為金融穩定理事會（FSB）監管與監督合作常設委員會（SRC）主席，領導關於關鍵金融穩定問題的討論。\n\n香港金融基礎設施的安全高效運作為香港作為國際金融中心和全球離岸人民幣業務中心奠定了堅實基礎。2017年，四大銀行間RTGS系統和中央票券結算系統（CMU）達成100%系統可用性，優於目標值99.95%。為支持債券通北向交易，CMU已與兩個內地中央證券存管機構（CSDs）開設帳戶，以便為有關CMU成員處理債券通交易結算及持有內地債務證券。\n\n為了促進本地零售支付產業的一般安全性和效率，HKMA於八月根據《支付系統及儲值繳費安排條例》（PSSVFO）指定四個零售支付系統（RPSs），使其運營接受HKMA監督。HKMA還對16家儲值繳費安排（SVF）牌照持有人進行監管，這些機構積極推出了新產品和服務，以提供更多的選擇和更好的用戶體驗。此外，電子支票和電子支票提示及支付（EBPP）服務範圍進一步擴大，涵蓋香港與整個廣東省之間的跨境支付。\n\n# 2017年回顧\n\n# 香港作為亞洲金融科技中心\n\n# 智慧銀行計劃\n\n鑒於技術快速發展，HKMA於九月宣布七大計劃，以幫助香港迎來智慧銀行的新時代。這些計劃旨在幫助銀行業達到更高水平，充分利用銀行與科技融合帶來的巨大機遇。\n\n\"智慧銀行將實現零售和公司客戶之間的完全互聯，使金融服務和交易具有高度流動性、速度、便捷性和安全性。\"\n\nHKMA一直與銀行業和金融科技社區密切合作，在實施七項計劃方面取得良好進展。\n\n# 快速支付系統\n\nFPS是一個多幣種平台，讓公眾能夠通過手機號碼或電子郵箱全天候輕鬆實時轉賬。它可支持港幣和人民幣支付。銀行和非銀行支付服務提供商均可參與FPS，實現所有支付參與者的全面連接。隨著系統開發工作的接近尾聲，FPS預計於2018年9月推出。\n\n此外，HKMA領導了一個工作小組，由主要信用卡方案運營商、銀行、持牌SVF運營商和商家收單機構組成，以制定香港零售支付的統一QR碼標準。統一QR碼標準將便於商家使用一個QR碼接收來自多個支付服務提供商的QR碼支付解決方案，為客戶和商家提供更多便利。該工作小組已完成相關技術規範，並將制定具體實施安排。\n\n# 開放應用程式介面\n\n開放API允許第三方訪問銀行數據，以方便銀行和其他行業的服務整合。用戶因此可以在一個系統中輕鬆享受安全環境下的集成服務。為促進銀行業採用開放API，HKMA提出了一份開放API框架草案，包含開放API功能選擇、部署時間表、技術標準、第三方服務供應商治理、推廣措施和維護模型，徵求兩個月行業意見。\n\n# 研究與人才培育\n\n其中一個主要研究專案是分布式分類賬技術（DLT）。繼2016年第一份DLT白皮書後，第二份DLT白皮書於2017年10月發佈。第二份白皮書深入探討了三個概念驗證工作，即貿易融資、數字身份管理和按揭申請。同時還就DLT在銀行和支付行業的實施問題提供了建議，涉及治理、法律合規和一般控制原則。\n\nHKMA行政總裁陳德霖在HKMA金融科技日宣布發布第二份DLT白皮書。\n\n在HKMA領導貿易融資概念驗證工作的成功基礎上，香港七家銀行決定將原型商業化為生產系統，命名為香港貿易融資平台（HKTFP），以數字化共享貿易文件並自動化流程，從而改善整體貿易流程，降低貿易融資業務中的風險和詐騙。\n\n為擴大金融科技行業的人才隊伍，HKMA於2016年12月與香港應用科技研究院合作推出的金融科技職業加速計畫獲得學生積極響應。收到來自421名申請者的逾3000份申請。最終，74名學生接受了HKMA和12家銀行的實習機會，自7月起從事為期六個月至一年的金融科技相關項目。\n\n# 跨境合作\n\n作為加強粵港澳大灣區合作的第一步，我們與深圳合作推動金融科技和人才發展。具體而言，HKMA與深圳市人民政府金融發展服務辦公室（OFDS）於6月簽署協議，(i) 提供雙方金融科技公司的相互落地支援，(ii) 共同舉辦深港金融科技獎，於10月表彰和獎勵兩地優秀的金融科技產品和解決方案；(iii) 安排香港學生赴深圳金融科技和科技金融公司暑期實習。\n\nHKMA行政總裁陳德霖（中）在HKMA金融科技日與OFDS主任黃曉軍（左）和科創園董事長李國賢博士交換軟著陸協議備忘錄。\n\n深港金融科技獎海報。\n\nHKMA還與新加坡金融管理局（MAS）和迪拜金融服務管理局在創新項目、創新企業推介、資訊共用和專家知識交流方面簽訂了金融科技合作協議。\n\n11月，HKMA進一步與MAS簽署備忘錄，共同建設全球貿易連接網絡（GTCN），將新加坡國家貿易平台與HKTFP相連，形成跨國分佈式分類賬基礎設施，以數字化跨國貿易和貿易融資流程，使之更安全、更高效、更具成本效益。這將是一個開放平台，未來允許其他有興趣的司法管轄區參與。GTCN預計於2019年第一季度推出。\n\n# 金融科技監督沙盒\n\nHKMA於2016年9月推出的金融科技監督沙盒升級為FSS 2.0，以加快與銀行和科技公司的溝通，促進新想法和創新計劃的實踐。具體來說，FSS 2.0具有以下新特點：\n- 建立金融科技監督聊天室，為銀行和科技公司在其金融科技項目初期階段提供反饋；\n- 科技公司可以透過聊天室尋求反饋直接接入FSS，無需經過銀行；\n- HKMA、證券及期貨事務監察委員會（SFC）和保險總局的沙盒已連結，實現跨行業金融科技產品試驗的一站式入口。\n\n截至2017年底，FSS共測試了28項新技術產品。其中14項試驗已完成，相關產品隨後推向市場。\n\n# 銀行便利化計劃\n\n銀行便利化計劃旨在減少阻礙技術創新的監管摩擦。已組建特別小組，目前重點關注以下領域：\n- 远程開戶和賬戶管理\n- 在線理財\n- 在線財富管理\n\n# 虛擬銀行\n\n沒有實體分行的虛擬銀行有望為香港金融科技的應用注入新動力，並提供一種全新的移動和數字銀行客戶體驗。它們還可能有助於推動金融包容性，因為它們通常針對零售客戶，無論是個人還是中小企業（SME）。HKMA已經開始審查現有《虛擬銀行授權指南》，以促進香港虛擬銀行的引入。\n\n# 新一代智能銀行\n\n# 監管與創新\n\nHKMA去年公布的七項計劃，為香港迎接智能銀行的新時代奠定了基礎，這是一項需要HKMA內部各部門合作的大規模項目。隨著金融科技成為不可逆轉的趨勢，HKMA銀行監管執行總經理陳志強指出，作為監管機構，HKMA必須緊跟最新技術發展，適時調整監管思維和方法，以全面提升銀行服務和客戶體驗。\n"}
{"en": "# Reserves Management\n\nThe global economy and financial markets performed better than expected in 2017. Global equity markets went up on the back of synchronised economic growth in major developed and emerging market economies, strong corporate earnings, and market expectation of slow and gradual tightening of monetary policies by major central banks. While the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates three times as expected, and began to reduce its balance sheet in October, the 10- Year US Treasury yield remained stable and the US dollar weakened (rather than strengthened) against other major currencies. Under such a favourable environment, the Exchange Fund’s investment income reached a record high of HK$264 billion in 2017, representing an investment return of 7.4%.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary and may be invested in securities or other assets he considers appropriate, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC).\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nEFAC has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n(a) to preserve capital;\n(b) to ensure the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(c) to ensure sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) subject to (a)–(c), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the Fund’s long-term purchasing power.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund.\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP). The BP holds highly liquid US dollardenominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The IP is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of the assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA has been diversifying part of the Exchange Fund’s investments, in a prudent and incremental manner, into a wider variety of asset classes, including emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity and real estate. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The cap for the market value of investments under the LTGP is set at onethird of the accumulated surplus of the Exchange Fund, with further capacity arising from the allocation of part of the Future Fund to long-term assets.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007 to hold shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that were acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes, is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of the unique nature of this Portfolio.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by fiscal reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP1, with the exception of the Future Fund which links its interest rate to both the IP and the LTGP depending on the portfolio mix. As at the end of 2017, the portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 65:35. The portion of the Future Fund linked with the LTGP is expected to gradually build up to around 50% by 2018.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation. The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents the long-term optimal asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark, or strategic allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and tracking error limit are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may take positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nHKMA staff in the Reserves Management Department directly manage about 73% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, which includes the entire BP and part of the IP. This part of the IP includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 27% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes. The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to capture sustainable returns, to benefit from diverse and complementary investment styles and to share market insights and technical expertise with the Exchange Fund.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is primarily determined by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe high volatility of the financial markets subsequent to the 2008/09 global financial crisis has highlighted the importance of risk management. Stringent controls and investment guidelines have been established for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and compliance with guidelines and regulations is closely monitored. Risk assessment has been strengthened to support the Exchange Fund’s increased pace of investment diversification. Risk-control tools are deployed to assess market risks under both normal and adverse market conditions. Detailed performance attribution analyses are also conducted to identify sources of performance, allowing the HKMA to make the best use of the investment skills of internal and external managers.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nThe HKMA is supportive of responsible investment. For instance, the HKMA supports the Principles of Responsible Ownership issued by the Securities and Futures Commission on 7 March 2016, which are voluntary and help investors determine how best to meet their ownership responsibilities in relation to their investments in Hong Kong-listed companies. For the management of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA has encouraged the appointed external fund managers for its Hong Kong equity portfolio to adopt the Principles of Responsible Ownership in managing the investments. Furthermore, the front offices and the Risk Management and Compliance Division have incorporated environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into various internal procedures for making and monitoring investment activities. The HKMA will closely monitor the development of ESG standards and assess how these standards can be further integrated into the investment process.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2017\n\nThe global economy and financial markets in 2017 performed better than expected. On the back of synchronised economic growth in major developed and emerging market economies, strong corporate earnings, and market expectation of slow and gradual tightening of monetary policies by major central banks, the global equity markets performed well. In particular, the Hong Kong equity market rose by 36%, outperforming other major equity markets.\n\nIn the bond markets, short-dated US Treasury yields shot up as the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates three times as expected, and began to reduce its balance sheet in October. Nevertheless, the 10-year US Treasury yield remained stable at about 2.4% over the year. Other major 10-Year government bond yields also ended the year little changed, with the exception of German Bunds which rose on the euro area’s solid economic growth and market expectation of the European Central Bank’s policy tightening.\n\nIn the currency markets, the US dollar weakened against other major currencies, despite the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes and the beginning of its balance sheet reduction. The depreciation of the US dollar was a result of the reviving economic growth in Europe and Japan, and market expectation of diminishing monetary policy divergence between the US and other major economies. The euro and yen appreciated by around 14% and 4% respectively against the US dollar in 2017.\n\nThe performance of major currencies as well as bond and equity markets in 2017 is shown in Table 1.\n\nTable 1 2017 market returns\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$264 billion in 2017. This comprised gains of HK$80.4 billion on overseas equities, gains of HK$58.3 billion on Hong Kong equities, gains of HK$34.4 billion on bonds, a positive currency translation effect of HK$53.5 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets and gains of HK$37.4 billion on other investments held by the investment holding subsidiaries of the Exchange Fund. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$4.5 billion.\n\nThe investment income of HK$264 billion last year is a record high for the Exchange Fund, surpassing the previous record in 2007 (HK$142.2 billion) by HK$121.8 billion.\n\nThe total assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,015.3 billion at year end. The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$235.6 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$157.2 billion and real estate at HK$78.4 billion. Outstanding investment commitments amounted to HK$162.4 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund (excluding the Strategic Portfolio) in 2017 was 7.4%. Specifically, the IP achieved a rate of return of 12.1%, while the BP gained 1.8%. The LTGP recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 13.7% since its inception in 2009.\n\nThe annual return of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2017 is set out in Chart 1. Table 2 shows the 2017 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over several different time horizons. The average return was 2.9% over the past three years, 2.5% over the past five years, 2.2% over the past ten years and 4.9% since 1994. Table 3 shows the currency mix of the Fund’s assets as at 31 December 2017.\n\nHKMA Deputy Chief Executive, Mr Eddie Yue (middle), speaks at the press conference on 2017 Exchange Fund Results.\n\nChart 1 Investment return of the Exchange Fund (1994–2017)\n\nTable 2 Investment return of the Exchange Fund in Hong Kong dollar terms\n\nTable 3 Currency mix of the Exchange Fund’s assets on 31 December 2017 (including forward transactions)\n", "zh": "\n<content>\n# 外匯基金管理\n\n2017年全球經濟及金融市場表現超出預期。由於主要發達市場及新興市場經濟同步增長、企業盈利強勁，加上市場對主要中央銀行逐步收緊貨幣政策的預期，全球股票市場表現良好。雖然美國聯邦儲備局按預期加息三次，並於十月份開始縮減其資產負債表，但十年期美國國庫券收益率保持穩定，美元相較其他主要貨幣走弱（而非走強）。在此有利的環境下，外匯基金2017年的投資收益達到歷史最高的2640億港元，投資回報率為7.4%。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》，外匯基金的主要目標是直接或間接影響香港貨幣的匯率。基金亦可用於維持香港貨幣及金融系統的穩定與完整，以協助維持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。外匯基金由財政司司長管轄，在諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）後，可投資於其認為適當的證券或其他資產。\n\n# 外匯基金管理\n\n# 投資目標及組合結構\n\nEFAC已為外匯基金設定了以下投資目標：\n(a) 保障資本；\n(b) 確保隨時有足夠高流動性的美元資產支持全部貨幣基礎；\n(c) 確保擁有充足的流動性以維持貨幣及金融穩定；以及\n(d) 在符合(a)-(c)的前提下，達致有助於維持基金長期購買力的投資回報。\n\n這些目標充分考慮了外匯基金的法定用途，並納入基金的組合結構和目標資產組合之中。\n\n概括而言，外匯基金設有兩個主要組合：支持組合（BP）及投資組合（IP）。BP持有高度流動性的美元資產，以按照貨幣局安排的要求完全支持貨幣基礎。IP主要投資於經合組織成員國的債券及股票市場，以保存資產價值和長期購買力。\n\n為了更好地管理風險并提高中長期回報，香港金融管理局（HKMA）一直謹慎且逐步地將部分外匯基金投資分散至更廣泛的資產類別，包括新興市場及內地債券和股票、私募股權及不動產。新興市場及內地債券和股票存放於IP中，而私募股權及不動產投資則存放於長線增長組合（LTGP）。LTGP中投資的市值上限設定為外匯基金累積盈餘的三分之一，進一步的容量則來自未來基金部分資金分配至長期資產。\n\n2007年成立的戰略組合旨在持有政府為外匯基金帳戶購入的香港交易及結算所有限公司股權，因該組合具有獨特性，故不計入基金投資績效評估之中。\n\n# 與外匯基金的存款\n\n外匯基金時常接受財政儲備、政府資金及法定機構的存款。一般情況下，利息率與IP1的表現掛鉤，未來基金除外，其利息率根據組合結構與IP及LTGP掛鉤。截至2017年底，未來基金在IP與LTGP之間的組合比例約為65:35。未來基金與LTGP掛鉤的部分預期將逐漸增至約50%，並於2018年實現。\n\n# 投資過程\n\n外匯基金的投資過程建立在兩種資產配置決策之上：戰略資產配置及戰術資產配置。戰略資產配置反映在投資基準中，代表在考慮外匯基金投資目標下的長期最佳資產配置。根據戰略配置，資產被進行戰術配置，以試圖在基準之上取得超額回報。這意味著實際配置往往與基準或戰略配置不同。實際配置與基準之間的差異稱為「戰術偏差」。雖然基準及跟蹤誤差限額由財政司司長諮詢EFAC後確定，但戰術決策及允許的戰術偏差範圍由HKMA在授權下制定。在允許的戰術偏差範圍內，組合經理可採取頭寸以利用短期市場波動。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\nHKMA儲備管理部門的職員直接管理外匯基金約73%的投資，其中包括全部BP及部分IP。此部分IP包括一組投資於全球固定收益市場的組合，以及用於實施基金宏觀風險管理策略的各類衍生工具 Overlay 組合。\n\n# 使用外部管理人\n\n除內部管理資產外，HKMA還聘請外部基金管理人管理外匯基金約27%的資產，包括所有上市股票組合及其他專業資產類別。聘用外部管理人的目的是利用市場上最佳的投資專長以捕捉持續的回報，從多樣化及補充性的投資風格中受益，同時與外匯基金分享市場見解和技術知識。\n\n使用外部管理人的相關支出包括基金管理費及保管費、交易成本以及預扣稅和其他稅項。該等支出主要由市場因素決定，可能每年有所波動。\n\n# 風險管理與合規\n\n自2008/09年全球金融危機以來，金融市場的高度波動凸顯了風險管理的重要性。針對內部及外部管理的組合都建立了嚴格的控制及投資指引，並密切監控對指南及法規的遵守情況。風險評估已加強，以支持外匯基金加快投資多元化進程。風險管控工具用於在正常及不利市場條件下評估市場風險。同時也進行詳細的績效歸因分析，以識別績效來源，使HKMA能最佳運用內部及外部管理人的投資技巧。\n\n# 責任投資\n\nHKMA支持責任投資。例如，HKMA支持證券及期貨事務監察委員會於2016年3月7日發表的「責任所有權原則」，這些原則是自願性質的，幫助投資者確定如何最有效地履行其在香港上市公司的投資責任。對於外匯基金的管理，HKMA鼓勵指定的外部基金管理人在其香港股票組合中採納「責任所有權原則」。此外，前線部門及風險管理與合規部已將環境、社會及治理（ESG）因素融入各種內部程序，以做出及監督投資活動。HKMA將密切關注ESG標準的發展，並評估如何進一步整合這些標準到投資過程中。\n\n# 外匯基金績效\n\n# 2017年金融市場\n\n2017年全球經濟及金融市場表現優於預期。得益於主要發達市場及新興市場經濟同步增長、企業盈利強勁，以及市場對主要中央銀行緩慢且逐步收緊貨幣政策的預期，全球股票市場表現良好。特別是，香港股市全年上漲36%，超越其他主要股票市場。\n\n在債券市場方面，隨著美國聯邦儲備局按預期加息三次，並於十月份開始縮減其資產負債表，短端美國國庫券收益率大幅上揚。然而，十年期美國國庫券收益率全年保持穩定，約為2.4%。其他主要十年期政府債券收益率全年變化不大，德國國債除外，因歐洲區經濟實力強勁及市場對歐洲央行政策收緊的預期，德國國債收益率上漲。\n\n在外匯市場，儘管美國聯邦儲備局加息並開始縮減資產負債表，但美元相較其他主要貨幣走弱。美元貶值是因為歐洲及日本經濟復甦，以及市場預期美國與其他主要經濟體之間貨幣政策差距正在減小。2017年，歐元及日元分別對美元升值約14%及4%。\n\n2017年主要貨幣、債券及股票市場的表現見表1。\n\n表1 2017年市場回報\n\n# 外匯基金的績效\n\n外匯基金於2017年錄得投資收入2640億港元。其中包括海外股票收益804億港元、香港股票收益583億港元、債券收益344億港元、非港元資產的正向外匯兌換效益535億港元，以及投資子公司持有的其他投資收益374億港元。另外，戰略組合錄得估值收益45億港元。\n\n外匯基金去年投資收入2640億港元為歷年最高紀錄，較2007年的先前紀錄（1422億港元）高出1218億港元。\n\n截至年底，外匯基金總資產達40153億港元。LTGP中的投資市值達2356億港元，其中私募股權為1572億港元，不動產為784億港元。未償投資承諾額達1624億港元。\n\n外匯基金（不含戰略組合）2017年的投資回報率為7.4%。具體而言，IP取得了12.1%的回報率，BP獲得了1.8%的收益。自2009年推出LTGP以來，其年化內部收益率為13.7%。\n\n從1994年至2017年，外匯基金的年度回報見圖1。表2顯示了2017年的投資回報及基金在不同時間段內的平均投資回報。過去三年的平均回報為2.9%，過去五年為2.5%，過去十年為2.2%，自1994年起則為4.9%。表3顯示了2017年12月31日外匯基金資產的貨幣組成（包括遠期交易）。\n\nHKMA副董事總經理黃志雄先生（中）在2017年外匯基金結果新聞發布會上發言。\n\n圖1 外匯基金投資回報（1994–2017）\n\n表2 外匯基金以港元計算的投資回報\n\n表3 2017年12月31日外匯基金資產的貨幣組成（包括遠期交易）\n</content>\n"}

Notable examples included the Coin Collection Programme, banking products and services, bankingrelated guidelines and circulars, monetary and economic statistics, prudential measures for property mortgage loans, and prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received since 2014 and Chart 2 provides a breakdown in terms of the nature of enquiries received in 2017.\n\nChart 1 Total number of public enquiries\n\nChart 2 Nature of enquiries received in 2017\n\n# Publications\n\nApart from the HKMA Annual Report, in 2017 the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report and four issues of the Quarterly Bulletin, and released regular updates of the Monthly Statistical Bulletin to provide up-to-date and thematic information and analyses on monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. In addition, the HKMA issued a total of 23 inSight articles, covering various topical issues related to its work.\n\n# HKMA website\n\nThe HKMA corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk), with over 60,000 pages in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, is the public access gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It also contains the register of authorized institutions (AIs) and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the register of stored value facility (SVF) licensees under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance. Dedicated webpages and eye-catching short-cut links are designed to draw public attention to the new initiatives of the HKMA, such as account opening, the regulatory regime for SVFs, the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office and the Fintech Facilitation Office, as well as important and timely information, such as reminders on the need to remain vigilant against bogus telephone calls and the location of Coin Carts under the Coin Collection Programme.\n\n# Public Education Programme\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre is an important resource for introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters. It consists of an exhibition area and a library, and is open to the public six days a week. The exhibition area introduces the work of the HKMA and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong. It also contains reading materials and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nThe new look of the policy section of the Information Centre, which introduces the work of the HKMA and related financial concepts, was re-opened to the public on 24 February 2017 upon completion of the refurbishment work. The revamped policy section contains various interactive games and devices that integrate play into learning and explain complicated financial concepts in a simple way. Feedback from the visitors has been positive.\n\nStudents try out the educational games at the policy section of the Information Centre to learn about the work of the HKMA.\n\nGuided tours of the Information Centre are organised for visitors. During the year, it received more than 59,000 visitors and hosted over 650 guided tours for schools and other groups (Chart 3). More than 645,000 people have visited the Information Centre since it opened in December 2003.\n\nThe library, situated next to the exhibition area, houses more than 23,000 books, journals and other publications for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs and central banking topics. It also maintains the register of AIs and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nThe library in the HKMA Information Centre.\n\nTo reach out to the community and raise public awareness of the HKMA’s work, the HKMA organised four public education seminars for about 2,000 secondary school students and teachers in 2017. Topics covered in the seminars included the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, banking stability, consumer protection, the Deposit Protection Scheme, fintech, the Belt and Road Initiative and careers in the financial industry. More than 58,400 people have participated in this public education programme since its launch in 1998.\n\nStudents and teachers from secondary schools in different districts participate in one of the public education seminars.\n\nChart 3 Types of group visits to the Information Centre in 2017\n\n# HUMAN RESOURCES\n\nThe HKMA recruits, develops and maintains a highly professional workforce to support its policy objectives and respond flexibly to changing work priorities. While the HKMA is an integral part of the Government, it employs staff on terms different from those of the civil service to attract personnel with the right experience and expertise. As a public organisation, the HKMA aims to maintain a lean and flexible structure and, where possible, to redeploy staff resources to undertake new initiatives and meet increasing workload.\n\n# Organisational changes\n\nThe Resolution Office was established on 1 April 2017 to implement the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance enacted in June 2016. The Office aims to ensure that the Hong Kong resolution regime is operational for banks. This is essential to enhancing the resilience of the Hong Kong banking sector in the event of any crisis.\n\n# Staffing\n\nThe establishment of the HKMA in 2017 was 927. This will be increased by 35 to 962 in 2018 (an increase of 3.8%) to ensure that sufficient resources are provided to cope with the new initiatives and the increasing complexity and volume of existing work. The new posts are deployed to the following functions:\n\n- Enhancing banking and financial stability, which includes:\n    – enhancing capacity to support the launch of the Faster Payment System and easy banking initiatives;\n    – strengthening supervisory capacity to deal with the regional and business expansion of banks and to facilitate (i) the wider adoption of fintech in the provision of banking services and (ii) collaboration with other regulatory authorities on cyber security and fintech issues; and\n    – supporting the work of the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce to fight against fraud, money laundering and other types of financial crimes, and strengthening legal support for enforcement actions under legislation governing anti-money laundering and SVFs.\n- Strengthening investment, risk management and other related support for the further expansion and diversification of the Exchange Fund’s investment activities.\n- Stepping up global macro and financial-sector surveillance, and strengthening talent development programmes to ensure that the HKMA has the necessary human capital to meet the long-term development needs of the organisation.\n\nTable 1 gives a breakdown of the establishment and strength of the HKMA.\n\nTable 1 Establishment and strength of the HKMA on 1 January 2018\n\nTemporary resources are deployed to meet other work demands. The HKMA also transfers staff members on secondment to other international or local organisations, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Services Development Council, to assist in activities or policy initiatives in which Hong Kong or the HKMA has an interest. Some staff members are deployed on a full-time or part-time basis to provide operational support to the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board and the Treasury Markets Association.\n\n# Remuneration policies and pay review mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary (FS) determines the pay and conditions of service for HKMA staff on the advice of the Governance Sub-Committee (GSC) through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC), taking into account the prevailing market rates and practices. Remuneration comprises a total cash package and a provident fund scheme, with minimal benefits in kind. The cash package consists of monthly fixed pay (or basic pay) and variable pay, which may be awarded to individual staff members as a lump sum once a year, depending on performance.\n\nPay for HKMA staff is reviewed annually by the FS in the light of recommendations made to him by the GSC through the EFAC, taking into account the GSC’s assessment of the performance of the HKMA in the preceding year, the paysurvey findings of the financial sector conducted by independent human resources consultants, and any other relevant factors. Special pay adjustments may be made from time to time for individual meritorious staff members to maintain their pay competitiveness.\n\nAny approved annual adjustments to the fixed pay and any variable pay awards for the HKMA are distributed to individual staff members based on their performance. Investment professionals in the HKMA are subject to a variable pay system that seeks to strengthen the link between their investment performance and remuneration award. The pay adjustments and awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Executive Director and above are approved by the FS on the advice of the GSC. The staff members concerned are not present at the meetings when their pay is discussed. The pay adjustments and awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Division Head and below are determined by the Chief Executive of the HKMA under delegated authority from the FS and within the approved overall pay awards.\n\n# Remuneration of senior staff members\n\nThe remuneration packages of senior staff members in 2017 are shown in Table 2.\n\nTable 2 Remuneration packages of HKMA senior staff members in 2017\n\n# Manager Trainee (MT) and Graduate Economist (GE) programmes\n\nTo develop a pool of young talent with sharp analytical minds, strong communication skills and good team spirit for a long-term career in central banking, the HKMA runs two trainee programmes: the MT programme and the GE programme. Each programme lasts for a period of two years.\n\nThe MT programme prepares young graduates interested in central banking work to become the HKMA’s future key management staff and contribute to the financial stability and prosperity of Hong Kong. Each MT undergoes on-the-job training in two to three departments to acquire hands-on experience on the important functions of the HKMA. For the GE programme, young graduates interested in economic research are offered the opportunity to harness their research skills in two to three departments to provide important input to the policy formulation process.\n\nBoth the MT and GE programmes provide an all-rounded career development environment for the trainees. Apart from on-the-job training, the MTs and GEs also attend structured foundation central banking courses organised internally and by leading international or regional organisations. Upon successful completion of the respective programme, MTs are offered appointments as Managers and GEs as Economists to continue their pursuit of a professional career in the organisation.\n", "zh": "\n<reflect>\n...\n\n</reflect>\n<translate>\n# 企業職能\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）透過媒體、公眾教育計劃及其他多種渠道與社會及市場保持有效的溝通，以促進大眾對其政策及運作的理解。在該年度，HKMA繼續通過支持員工專業發展、實施嚴格的財務紀律及加強資訊科技保安來改善企業管治，以應對新政策措施的執行所帶來的挑戰及日益複雜的工作內容。\n\n# 社區互動與企業發展\n\n# 媒體關係\n\n香港金融管理局與媒體密切合作，提高透明度並促進公眾對其政策及工作的認識。2017年共舉辦了86場公開記者活動，包括9場記者會、16次現場訪問及61項其他公共活動。此外，安排了42場媒體訪問，發佈了合計360份雙語新聞稿。同時，每日處理大量媒體查詢。\n\n為提升公眾對HKMA重點職能的認識，組織了媒體導覽參觀重新裝修的HKMA資訊中心。此外，針對本地及海外媒體，就多項主題進行深入的媒體簡介及教育研討會，包括債券通計劃、房屋按揭貸款的審慎措施、清算制度及外匯基金投資。\n\nHKMA行政總裁陳德霖先生在HKMA資訊中心向媒體展示一幅名為「小錢大歌」的馬賽克藝術作品。此作品以維多利亞港和香港天際線為題，共由135,811枚不同面值的香港硬幣組成。\n\nHKMA行政總裁陳德霖先生接受本地報紙訪問，介紹HKMA基建融資協調辦事處及金融科技協調辦事處的主要措施。\n\n# 公眾查詢\n\n公眾查詢服務為公眾提供了了解HKMA重點職能及運作的有效途徑。2017年共處理了8,752宗查詢，其中約一半與銀行政策及法規、貨幣及經濟問題、零售銀行為及紙鈔有關。具體例子包括硬幣收藏計劃、銀行產品及服務、銀行相關指引及通告、貨幣及經濟統計數據、房屋按揭貸款的審慎措施，以及防止洗錢及恐怖主義資金的措施。\n\n圖表1顯示自2014年起接獲的公眾查詢數量，而圖表2則提供2017年查詢性質的詳細分佈。\n\n圖表1 公眾查詢總數  \n圖表2 2017年查詢性質  \n\n# 出版物\n\n除《HKMA年度報告》外，2017年HKMA發表兩期半年期貨幣及金融穩定報告，四期季度通訊，並定期更新月度統計通訊，以提供有關香港貨幣、銀行及經濟事務的最新及主題性的資訊及分析。此外，HKMA共發佈了23篇inSight專題文章，涵蓋多項與其工作相關的熱門議題。\n\n# HKMA網站\n\nHKMA企業網站（www.hkma.gov.hk）擁有超過60,000頁英語及繁體與簡體中文網頁，是公眾取得HKMA最新資訊的重要入口。網站亦載有認可機構（AIs）及其本地代表處的註冊資料，以及根據銀行條例第20條維護的AIs證券從業員註冊資料，以及根據支付系統及儲值電子貨品條例維護的儲值電子貨品（SVF）牌照持有者註冊資料。特別網頁及醒目快捷連結旨在吸引公眾注意HKMA的新措施，例如帳戶開設、SVF監管制度、基建融資協調辦事處及金融科技協調辦事處，以及重要及時資訊，例如警惕偽裝電話詐騙的提醒及硬幣收集計劃下的硬幣車位置。\n\n# 公眾教育計畫\n\n位於國際金融中心二期第55樓的HKMA資訊中心是向社區介紹HKMA工作及推廣公眾對貨幣及銀行事務意識的重要資源。資訊中心設有展覽區及圖書館，每週開放六天。展覽區介紹HKMA的工作及香港貨幣與銀行的發展歷史，並設有研究香港貨幣、銀行及金融事務的閱讀材料及展品。\n\n資訊中心政策部分全新改裝後於2017年2月24日重新開放，展出HKMA工作及相關金融概念。改建後的政策部分包含各種互動遊戲和設備，將玩樂融入學習過程，以簡單方式解釋複雜的金融概念。遊客反饋良好。\n\n學生們在資訊中心政策部分嘗試教育遊戲，以了解HKMA的工作內容。\n\n資訊中心為遊客組織導覽。該年度接待超過59,000名遊客，並為學校和其他團體舉辦超過650場導覽（圖表3）。自2003年啟用以來，已有逾645,000人次參觀資訊中心。\n\n圖書館位於展覽區附近，收藏逾23,000冊書籍、期刊及其他刊物，供研究香港貨幣、銀行及金融事務和中央銀行主題之用。圖書館亦根據銀行條例第20條，管理認可機構（AIs）及其本地代表處的註冊資料及AIs證券從業員的註冊資料。\n\nHKMA資訊中心內的圖書館。\n\n為拓展社區接觸範疇及提高公眾對HKMA工作的認識，2017年HKMA為約2,000名中學學生及教師舉辦了四場公眾教育講座。講座內容涵蓋聯繫匯率制度、香港紙鈔、銀行穩定性、消費者保護、存款保障計劃、金融科技、一帶一路倡議及金融行業職業發展等話題。自1998年推出該教育計畫以來，已有逾58,400人次參與。\n\n來自不同地區的中學生及教師參加其中一場公眾教育講座。\n\n圖表3 2017年資訊中心的團體訪問類型  \n\n# 人力資源\n\nHKMA透過招聘、培訓和維持一支高專業素質的員工隊伍，以支援其政策目標並靈活回應不斷變化的工作重點。雖然HKMA是政府的一部分，但其員工聘用條件與公務員有所不同，以吸引具備適當經驗和專業知識的人才。作為一家公營機構，HKMA致力於維持精簡且靈活的結構，並盡可能重新配置人員資源以承擔新措施及應對日益增加的工作量。\n\n# 組織變動\n\n為落實2016年6月頒布的《金融機構（清算）條例》，清算辦公室於2017年4月1日正式成立。該辦公室旨在確保香港的銀行清算制度運作正常，這對於提升香港銀行業在任何危機情況下的韌性至關重要。\n\n# 人事編制\n\n2017年HKMA的編制人數為927人。2018年將增至962人（增加3.8%），以確保有足夠資源應對新措施及現有工作日益增加的複雜性和工作量。新增職位將部署至以下職能：\n\n- 提升銀行及金融穩定性，包括：\n    – 提升支援更快付款系統及便捷銀行服務措施的潛力；\n    – 加強監督能力，以應對銀行的區域擴張業務，並推動（i）銀行服務中金融科技的更廣泛應用，以及（ii）與其他監管機構合作應對網絡安全及金融科技議題；以及\n    – 支援打擊詐騙、洗錢及其他金融犯罪的假幣及洗錢情報任務小組，並加強對反洗錢及SVF法規執法行動的法律支持。\n- 強化對外匯基金投資活動進一步擴張和多元化相關的支持，包括投資、風險管理和其他相關輔助。\n- 提高全球宏观及金融部門監測力度，並加強人才發展計畫，以確保HKMA具備必要的專業人才以滿足組織長期發展需求。\n\n表1列出了HKMA在2018年1月1日的編制與實際人數。\n\n表1 2018年1月1日HKMA的編制與實際人數  \n\n為應對其他工作需求，也部署了臨時人手。HKMA還會派遣員工到其他國際或本地機構，如國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）及金融服務發展委員會，協助 Hong Kong 或 HKMA 感興趣的活動或政策提案。一些員工會以全職或兼職的方式，為香港存款保障局及銀碼市場協會提供運營支持。\n\n# 薪酬政策與薪酬評審機制\n\n財政司（FS）根據治理副委員會（GSC）透過外匯基金顧問委員會（EFAC）提供建議，參考當時市場薪資水平及做法，決定HKMA員工的薪酬及僱傭條件。薪酬包括總額現金包和強制性公積金計劃，福利實物最少。現金包由每月固定薪金（或基本薪金）及獎金組成，每年視表現酌情發放一次。\n\nHKMA員工薪俸每年由財政司根據GSC經EFAC提出的建議審查，考慮GSC對前一年度HKMA表現的評估、獨立人力資源顧問進行的金融行業薪酬調查結果以及其他相關因素。如有需要，也可隨時因個別優秀員工的績效而作出特別薪金調整，以保持其競爭力。\n\n經批准的年度固定薪金調整及獎金授予，將根據個人表現發放給HKMA員工。HKMA的投資專業人士採用獎金制度，旨在加強其投資表現與薪酬獎勵之間的連接。至於行政總裁及以上級別員工的薪金調整及獎金授予，由財政司根據GSC的建議批准。有關員工不會出席討論其薪金的會議。至於副主任級及以下員工的薪金調整及獎金授予，則由HKMA行政總裁根據財政司授權範圍內的核准整體薪金獎勵進行決策。\n\n# 高層管理人員薪酬\n\n2017年高層管理人員的薪酬方案見表2。\n\n表2 2017年HKMA高層管理人員的薪酬方案  \n\n# 管理見習生（MT）及高級經濟學家（GE）計畫\n\n為了培養一批具備敏銳分析能力、強大的溝通技巧和良好的團隊精神的年輕人才，為未來在央行的工作做準備，HKMA運行兩個見習計畫：MT計畫和GE計畫。每個計畫持續兩年的時間。\n\nMT計畫旨在培訓對央行工作感興趣的年輕畢業生，使其成為HKMA未來關鍵管理人員，為香港的金融穩定和繁榮做出貢獻。每位MT將在兩至三個部門接受現場培訓，以獲得HKMA重要職能的實踐經驗。至於GE計畫，對經濟研究感興趣的年輕畢業生將有機會在兩至三個部門運用其研究技能，為政策制定過程提供重要的投入。\n\nMT和GE計畫均為見習生提供全面的職業發展環境。除了現場培訓，MT和GE還參加由內部及知名國際或區域機構組織的結構化基礎央行課程。成功完成各自計畫的MT將被任命為經理，GE將被任命為經濟學家，以繼續他們在該機構的專業生涯。\n"}
{"en": "# The Exchange Fund\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 157 to 243, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2017, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2017, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards.  My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report.  I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards.  I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017.  These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information.  The other information comprises all the information included in the 2017 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.  If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact.  I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.  I also:\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.  The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.  If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion.  My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report.  However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and\n- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements.  I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit.  I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nDavid Sun\nDirector of Audit\n\n11 April 2018\n\n# 1 PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES\n\nThe Monetary Authority, under delegated authority from the Financial Secretary as Controller of the Exchange Fund (the Fund), manages the Fund in accordance with the provisions of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).  The principal activities of the Fund are safeguarding the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong and maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems.\n\nThe assets of the Fund are managed as four portfolios: the Backing Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio and the Strategic Portfolio.  The assets of the Backing Portfolio fully match the Monetary Base, under Hong Kong’s Currency Board system.  The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.  The Long-Term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments.  The Strategic Portfolio holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited acquired by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) for the account of the Fund for strategic purposes. Operating segment information is set out in note 30.\n\n# 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n# 2.1 Statement of compliance\n\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with all applicable Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRSs), which is a collective term that includes all applicable individual Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, Hong Kong Accounting Standards (HKASs) and Interpretations issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), and accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong.  A summary of the significant accounting policies adopted by the Fund and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) is set out below.\n\nThe HKICPA has issued certain new and revised HKFRSs that are first effective or available for early adoption for the current accounting period.  Note 3 provides information on the changes, if any, in accounting policies resulting from initial adoption of these developments to the extent that they are relevant to the Group for the current and prior accounting periods reflected in these financial statements.\n\n# 2.2 Basis of preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe Group financial statements include the financial statements of the Group as well as the Group’s interests in associates and joint ventures.  The principal activities of the principal subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are shown in notes 16 and 17.\n\nThe measurement basis used in the preparation of the financial statements is historical cost except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair values as explained in the accounting policies set out below:\n- trading financial instruments (note 2.6.2.1);\n- financial assets and financial liabilities designated at fair value (note 2.6.2.2);\n- available-for-sale securities (note 2.6.2.5);\n- gold (note 2.11); and\n- investment properties (note 2.12).\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with HKFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure.  The estimates and associated assumptions are based on experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.  Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nNote 18 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of investment properties.  Note 36 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of financial instruments.  Apart from the accounting judgements involving these fair value estimations, there are no other critical accounting judgements involved in the application of the Group’s accounting policies.\n\n# 2.3 Subsidiaries and non-controlling interests\n\nA subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group.  The Group controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.  When assessing whether the Group has power, only substantive rights (held by the Group and other parties) are considered.\n", "zh": "\n# 外匯基金\n\n# 审计主任报告\n\n# 致财政司司长的独立审计师报告\n\n# 意见\n\n我确认已根据第157至243页所载外匯基金及其附属公司（「本組」）的财务报表进行了审核，其中包括2017年12月31日外匯基金及本組的資產負債表，以及截至該日期止年度的損益帳、綜合收益帳、股東權益變動帳及現金流量表，以及財務報表附註，包括主要會計政策摘要。\n\n依我的意見，根據香港財務報告準則（「HKFRSs」）由香港會計師公會（「HKICPA」）發佈，並按總督根據《外匯基金條例》（第66章）第7條作出的指示準備，這些財務報表確實且公平地反映了基金及本組於2017年12月31日的財務狀況，以及截至該日期止年度的財務表現及現金流量。\n\n# 評估依據\n\n我是根據總督根據《外匯基金條例》第7條作出的指示及審計委員會審計標準進行審計。我在這些標準下的責任進一步說明在我報告中「審計師對財務報表審計的責任」部分。根據這些標準，我與本組沒有利益關係，並已按照這些標準履行其他道德責任。我相信我們獲得的審計證據足夠適當，以作為我們評估的基礎。\n\n# 審計重點事項\n\n審計重點事項是指在我專業判斷下，最顯著影響我對截至2017年12月31日止年度財務報表審計的事項。這些事項是在整個財務報表審計背景下處理的，在形成我們的意見時予以考慮，但我並不就這些事項提供獨立意見。\n\n# 其他資訊\n\n貨幣管理機構負責其他資訊。其他資訊包含香港金融管理局2017年年度報告中的所有資訊，但不包括財務報表及我的審計師報告。\n\n針對財務報表的意見並未涵蓋其他資訊，我亦不會就此發表任何保證結論。\n\n就我的財務報表審計而言，我的職責是閱讀其他資訊，並在此過程中考慮其他資訊是否與財務報表或通過審計取得的知識存在重大不一致，或似乎存在重大誤述。如果基於我的工作，我認為其他資訊存在重大誤述，我有義務報告此事實。在此方面，我無需報告任何內容。\n\n# 貨幣管理機構及外匯基金諮詢委員會審計小組對財務報表的責任\n\n貨幣管理機構負責按照HKFRSs由HKICPA發佈的財務報告準則及總督根據《外匯基金條例》第7條作出的指示編製確實且公平反映的財務報表，並負責建立貨幣管理機構認為必要以防止財務報表出現重大誤述（無論是由欺詐還是錯誤造成）的內部控制。\n\n在編製財務報表時，貨幣管理機構負責評估本組持續經營的能力，披露有關持續經營的事項（如適用），並使用持續經營會計基礎。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會審計小組負責監督本組的財務報告流程。\n\n# 審計師對財務報表審計的責任\n\n我的目標是獲得合理保證，以確認整體財務報表不存在因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大誤述，並發出包括我的意見的審計師報告。合理保證是一種高水準的保證，但不是一種擔保，即根據審計委員會審計標準進行的審計總是能發現存在的重大誤述。誤述可能來自欺詐或錯誤，如果單獨或合計起來，可能會合理預期影響使用者根據這些財務報表做出的經濟決策，則視為重大。\n\n在按照審計委員會審計標準進行審計期間，我運用專業判斷並在整个審計過程中保持專業懷疑態度。此外，我也：\n- 辨識及評估財務報表重大誤述風險，無論是因欺詐或錯誤所致，設計及執行針對這些風險的審計程序，並獲取足以提供我們意見基礎的審計證據。由於欺詐可能涉及串通、偽造、故意遺漏、誤導或違背內部控制，因此未能察覺因欺詐造成的重大誤述風險比因錯誤造成的更高；\n- 理解與審計相關的內部控制，以便設計適合情況的審計程序，但並非為了對本組的內部控制有效性發表意見；\n- 評估貨幣管理機構使用的會計政策適當性及會計估計和相關披露的合理性；\n- 對貨幣管理機構使用持續經營會計基礎的適當性做出結論，並根據審計證據，是否存在與事件或條件相關的重大不確定性，這可能對本組繼續作為持續經營的能力產生重大懷疑。如果我得出存在重大不確定性的結論，我必須在審計師報告中指出財務報表中的相關披露，或者如果這樣的披露不足，修改我的意見。我的結論基于我的審計師報告日期前獲得的審計證據。然而，未來的事件或情況可能使本組無法繼續作為持續經營；\n- 評估財務報表的整體陳列、結構及內容，包括披露內容，並確保財務報表以達到公允陳述的方式反映基礎交易和事件；以及\n- 取得關於集團內實體或業務活動的財務資訊的足夠適當審計證據，以發表對財務報表的意見。我負責指導、監督及執行集團審計。我對自己的審計意見負全部責任。\n\n我與外匯基金諮詢委員會審計小組溝通審計計劃範圍和時間安排及重大審計發現，包括在審計期間 identified 的重大內部控制缺陷。\n\n我也向外匯基金諮詢委員會審計小組提交一份聲明，說明我已遵守有關獨立性的相關道德要求，並與他們溝通所有可能合理被認為影響我獨立性的關係及其他事項，如適用，相關保障措施。\n\n從與外匯基金諮詢委員會審計小組溝通的事項中，我確定了對當前期間財務報表審計最重要的事項，因此成為審計重點事項。除非法律法規禁止公開披露該事項，或在極端罕見的情況下，我決定該事項不應在報告中披露，因為這樣做的不利後果合理預期將超過公眾利益的受益，否則我將在審計師報告中描述這些事項。\n\n孫大衛\n審計主任\n\n2018年4月11日\n\n# 1 主要活動\n\n根據財政司司長授權擔任外匯基金（基金）經理人，貨幣管理機構根據《外匯基金條例》（第66章）的規定管理基金。基金的主要活動為維護港元的兌換價值，並維持香港貨幣及金融系統的穩定性和完整性。\n\n基金的資產分為四個投資組合：支持組合、投資組合、長期增長組合及戰略組合。支持組合的資產完全匹配根據香港貨幣局制度的貨幣基礎。投資組合主要集中於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債券及股市市場。長期增長組合持有私人股本及房地產投資。戰略組合持有的股份為香港特別行政區政府（HKSAR）為基金的戰略目的而購入的香港交易所及清算有限公司股票。經營部門資料載於注釋30。\n\n# 2 重要會計政策\n\n# 2.1 合規聲明\n\n本財務報表已根據所有適用的香港財務報告準則（HKFRSs）編製，此為一個集體術語，包括所有適用的個別香港財務報告準則、香港會計準則（HKASs）及由香港會計師公會（HKICPA）發佈的解釋，以及香港普遍接受的會計原則。以下列出基金及其附屬公司（統稱為本組）採用的重要會計政策摘要。\n\n香港會計師公會已頒布某些新的及修訂的HKFRSs，這些準則首次生效或可供提前採用於當前會計期間。注釋3提供了關於因採用這些發展而導致會計政策變化的資訊（如有），並擴展到與目前及之前會計期間的相關集團。\n\n# 2.2 財務報表編製基礎\n\n本組財務報表包含本組的財務報表及本組在關聯公司及合營企業中的權益。主要附屬公司、關聯公司及合營公司的主要業務載於注釋16及17。\n\n財務報表編製所採用的衡量基礎為歷史成本，除非下列資產和負債根據下文所述會計政策按其公允價值計量：\n- 交易性金融工具（注釋2.6.2.1）；\n- 按公允價值計量的金融資產及金融負債（注釋2.6.2.2）；\n- 可供出售證券（注釋2.6.2.5）；\n- 黃金（注釋2.11）；及\n- 投資性房地產（注釋2.12）。\n\n根據HKFRSs編製財務報表需要管理層作出判斷、估計和假設，這些判斷、估計和假設影響政策應用及所報導的資產、負債、收入和支出金額。估算和相關假設基於經驗和其他認為在當時情況下合理的因素，其結果構成有關不直接來自其他來源的資產和負債賬面價值判斷的基礎。實際結果可能與這些估算不同。\n\n估算和相關假設會持續審核。對會計估算的修訂若僅影響當期，則在其修訂的期間確認，若同時影響當期及未來期間，則在修訂的期間及之後期間確認。\n\n注釋18包含有關投資性房地產公允價值估計的假設資訊。注釋36包含有關金融工具公允價值估計的假設資訊。除了涉及這些公允價值估計的會計判斷外，集團會計政策的應用中沒有其他關鍵會計判斷。\n\n# 2.3 附屬公司及非控股權益\n\n附屬公司為受本組控制的實體。當本組因參與該實體而承擔可變回報，且有能力透過對該實體的控制來影響這些回報時，即視為本組控制該實體。在評估本組是否具有控制權時，只考慮實質性權利（由本組及其他方持有的權利）。\n"}

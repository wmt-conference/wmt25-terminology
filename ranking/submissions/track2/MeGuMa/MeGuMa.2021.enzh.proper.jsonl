{"en":"# Chief Executive’s Statement\n\nThe year 2021 was a year of concurrent consolidation and development.\n\nIn 2021, the pandemic entered its second year unabated: global supply chains were disrupted, inflation pressures were on the rise, risk of premature tightening of global financial conditions increased.  Adding to the unpredictability were the emergence of mutant variants of COVID-19 and the intensification of geopolitical tensions.  Despite such a macro environment filled with uncertainties, we continued to safeguard monetary and financial stability and maintain operational resilience.\n\n2021 also brought hope for recovery with the successful rollout of COVID-19 vaccines together with the accommodative monetary and fiscal policies introduced in multiple economies.  The global economy began to recover from the severe contraction in 2020.  Locally, after having endured economic contraction in 2019 and 2020, the Hong Kong economy grew by 6.3% in 2021, thanks to the rollout of the vaccination programme and the Government’s pandemic relief measures which have lent crucial support to our economic recovery.\n\nWith financial and monetary stability maintained, as well as a steadying macro environment, 2021 gave us some room to pursue more development work.  We seized the opportunity and pressed ahead with developmental initiatives that will help our financial sector remain highly competitive. Significant progress has been made across our three strategic priorities, namely fintech, green finance and Mainland market opportunities arising from Hong Kong’s gateway role.\n\nAs we entered 2022, the global environment took a turn for the worse.  But as the saying goes, when the going gets tough, the tough get going.  We will continue to be proactive and pursue our developmental goals and priorities to be better prepared for the next challenge and to cement our status as an international financial centre.  We will also remain steadfast in our commitment to ensure the soundness of Hong Kong monetary and financial systems, as we have risen to the many challenges time and again as in the past.\n\n# Monetary and financial stability: foundation of an international financial centre\n\nSince its establishment in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has been a strong anchor of Hong Kong’s financial system and has helped Hong Kong withstand numerous shocks and challenges.  Despite the lingering uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and market concerns about the pace of US monetary tightening, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to function in an orderly manner throughout the year, reflecting the robustness of the LERS.\n\nThis confidence in our systems did not happen overnight, but is based on the solid foundation which has been built up over the years.  In its 2021 External Sector Report, the International Monetary Fund once again reiterated that the credibility of the LERS has been assured by a transparent set of rules, ample fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy, and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nThe confidence is also a result of our efforts in public and market engagement, as well as effective surveillance.  On the latter, we have leveraged technology and data analytics to strengthen our capability for more timely and comprehensive analysis on financial stability and macroprudential surveillance.\n\nThe robustness of the banking system is of paramount importance to financial stability in Hong Kong.  Two years into the COVID-19 pandemic, our banks remained resilient with liquidity positions and capitalisation faring very well by international standards.  As at end-2021, the capital adequacy ratio of local banks stood at 20.2%, well above the minimum requirement of 8%, while the average Liquidity Coverage Ratio of large banks was 151.9% in the fourth quarter of 2021, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 100%.  Despite a challenging credit landscape amid the pandemic, the asset quality of the banking sector remained largely stable during the year. The classified loan ratio of the industry was 0.88% at the end of 2021, down from 0.90% at the end of 2020, well below the long-run historical average of 1.8% since 2000.\n\n# Banking sector: a pillar of support to the economy\n\nAs always, the banking sector is an important pillar of support to economic activity.  This is ever more crucial in the face of economic fallout from the COVID-19 outbreak.  In the past year, a main challenge was to strike a balance between managing credit risk in the banking sector and maintaining the sector’s support for the real economy.  With our supervisory work over the years, banks continued to manage credit risks effectively.  At the same time, we worked closely with banks to provide the much needed relief to corporate and personal customers through the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme (PPPHS) and other relief measures.  The PPPHS, launched together with the Banking Sector Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) Lending Coordination Mechanism in 2020 allowing eligible corporate customers to defer loan principal payments by six months on a pre-approval basis, was again further extended twice during 2021 until April 2022 recognising that some economic sectors were still hard-pressed by the lingering pandemic and were in need of continued credit relief.  Subsequently, in light of a resurgence of local coronavirus infections, in February 2022, the PPPHS was further extended until the end of October 2022.  It is encouraging to see that the banking sector has joined forces with the HKMA to help relieve cash-flow pressures on corporate and individual borrowers, even whilst the sector itself is experiencing its own difficult operating conditions due to the outbreak of the pandemic.\n\nApart from the challenging credit landscape, the pandemic also brought about a more difficult operating environment and a digital landscape with escalating cyber threat. We have stepped up our efforts to enhance operational and cyber resilience of the banking sector, as well as consumer and investor protection amid increasing digitalisation and a surge in phishing scams.  In particular, the Code of Banking Practice was revised to enhance consumer protection in digital financial services.\n\nBesides supervisory work, we are dedicated to promoting financial inclusion and customer-centric culture in the banking sector.  Enhancing accessibility to banking services by customers in need has been one of our priority areas and we have been working closely with the industry to develop industry guidelines.  Further to the guidance on barrier-free banking services and provision of banking services for persons with intellectual disabilities, the industry, with the support of the HKMA, published in December 2021 a guideline to set out the principles and good practices for the banking industry in providing banking services to persons with dementia and customers in need.\n\nTo support the continued development of the banking sector in the future where the new growth opportunities and challenges require a new set of skills from the workforce, the HKMA has formulated a holistic talent development strategy — “Connecting Talent to the Future” — to groom future talent and upskill existing practitioners in a more systematic and targeted manner.  Our new strategy is built on three “connect” directions: connecting students to the banking industry, connecting practitioners to the future of banking, and connecting the key stakeholders together to enhance collaboration in implementing the strategy.  We have launched a series of outreach and promotional campaigns to attract more students to enter the banking industry. To better prepare university students to be “future ready”, we have launched the Future Banking Bridging Programme jointly with the Hong Kong Institute of Bankers, which comprises a series of courses that cover practical banking knowledge and useful soft skills that are highly in demand in the banking industry.  For the existing banking practitioners, we have been working closely with the industry on developing opportunities for upskilling through providing more in-demand training programmes.  In December 2021, the new Fintech module under the Enhanced Competency Framework for banking practitioners was launched.\n\nFinancial talent is crucial to the future development of Hong Kong as an international financial centre.  We will work hand in hand with all stakeholders with a view to strengthening the talent pool for the further development of the industry.\n\n# International financial centre: strong position underpinned by an unparalleled access to opportunities\n\nThe competitiveness of Hong Kong as an international financial centre is underpinned by the unparalleled access to opportunities it offers.  There is general consensus that global fintech adoption, opening-up of Mainland’s financial markets, and the mainstreaming of green and sustainable finance present huge opportunities for the future development of Hong Kong’s financial sector.  At the HKMA, we have dedicated substantial efforts in leveraging Hong Kong’s unique edge to capture these opportunities.  Let me talk about the fintech and Mainland opportunities first.\n\n# Comprehensive adoption of fintech\n\nThe pandemic has clearly demonstrated the power of fintech and permanently changed customers’ behaviour towards financial services.  To make sure we continue to stay at the forefront of the global fintech scene and are ready to tap all of the potential of fintech, we must build an ecosystem where the value of fintech is experienced across all levels and by all groups of people.\n\nThis vision has driven us to formulate a new strategy, “Fintech 2025”, which was unveiled in June 2021.  As its name suggests, it aspires to help the financial sector adopt technology comprehensively by 2025.  The strategy comprises five focus areas which cover the required elements to achieve a successful ecosystem, and also the right factors for the ecosystem to grow further in a virtuous cycle. The first two parts of the strategy, namely “all banks go fintech” and “future-proofing Hong Kong for Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)” mainly sought to create more demand for fintech adoption.  The other parts of the strategy relate to data, infrastructure, talent and funding, which are vital to the growth of the ecosystem.\n\nUnder this strategy, a number of new initiatives were introduced, such as the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) fintech pilot trial facility which allows financial institutions and technology firms to conduct pilot trials and obtain early feedback from regulators and users on their cross-boundary fintech initiatives, and the pilot launch of the Commercial Data Interchange which leverages the use of alternative data to facilitate SME financing.  We have also stepped up research on the application of wholesale CBDC to cross-border payments, and explored the prospect of e-HKD, which will increase Hong Kong’s readiness in terms of adopting CBDCs and in turn future-proof our city’s financial infrastructure in the decades ahead.\n\nWhile we capitalise on the new opportunities presented by technological advancement, we also continue to build on our existing achievements as well as watch out for new risks that may arise.  For example, the Faster Payment System (FPS) introduced in 2018 has grown rapidly over the years, with the number of registrations reaching 9.6 million at the end of 2021, up 40% year on year.  The average daily turnover also increased 90% from 2020, reaching about 673,000 real-time transactions in 2021.  Meanwhile, in view of the rapid development of crypto-assets particularly payment-related stablecoins, we have issued a discussion paper earlier this year to invite market feedback on the development of an appropriate regulatory framework.\n\nOur new, forward-thinking strategy will set the scene for a healthy growth of the fintech ecosystem.  As the banking sector increasingly adopts fintech to capture the opportunities it offers, this will ultimately benefit both financial institutions and Hong Kong people, while strengthening Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre.\n\n# Hong Kong as the dominant gateway to the Mainland\n\nHong Kong has always played a strategic role in linking the Mainland market with international financial markets, providing international investors with a familiar regime and platform to conduct various kinds of financial, investment and wealth management activities.  The National 14th Five-Year Plan strengthens Hong Kong’s position as an international financial centre, a global offshore renminbi business hub, as well as asset management and risk management centres. This together with global economic trends has reinforced our conviction that Hong Kong should continue to enhance its unique value as a bridge connecting the Mainland and international markets.\n\nIn 2021, we reached a milestone in enhancing connectivity, adding two new members to our family of Connect schemes, namely the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) Scheme in the GBA, and Southbound Trading under Bond Connect, essentially completing the two-way loop of mutual access in a wide spectrum of financial markets including equities, debts and wealth management.  The launch of the two schemes will bring new opportunities for Hong Kong in various aspects. By meeting the increasing diversification needs of Mainland investors, the two schemes will enlarge the customer base of our bond market and wealth management industry.  I am pleased to see that these two schemes have been operating smoothly.  The HKMA will continue to engage the Mainland authorities to further enhance these schemes over time.\n","terms":{"12-month expected credit losses":["12個月預期信用虧損"],"2022–23

總裁報告\n\n2021年是同步整合與發展的一年。\n\n2021年，疫情進入第二年且未有減緩：全球供應鏈受擾，通脹壓力上升，全球金融狀況過早收緊的風險增加。進一步加劇不確定性的是新冠病毒變異株的出現以及地緣政治緊張局勢的加劇。儘管整體宏觀環境充滿不確定性，我們仍持續維護貨幣與金融穩定，並保持運作穩健性。\n\n二零二一年也帶來了復甦的希望，伴隨著新冠疫苗的順利推行，以及多個經濟體引入的貨幣及財政政策。全球經濟開始從二零二零年的嚴重收縮中復甦。本地方面，在經歷了二零一九年和二零二零年的經濟收縮後，香港經濟在二零二一年增長了百分之六點三， وذلك 疫苗接種計劃及抗疫支援措施的推行，為我們的經濟復甦提供了關鍵支持。\n\n在金融及貨幣穩定以及穩健的宏觀環境下，2021年為我們提供了更多發展空間。我們把握機會，積極推動發展計劃，以協助金融業保持高度競爭力。在三個重點策略範疇，即金融科技、綠色金融，以及因香港作為通往內地的門戶而產生的內地市場機遇方面，已取得顯著進展。\n\n踏入2022年，全球環境急轉直下。但正所謂逆境中見真章，我們將繼續積極主動，追求發展目標與優先事項，以更充分準備面對未來的挑戰，並鞏固我們作為國際金融中心的地位。我們亦會堅定不移地致力確保香港貨幣及金融體系的穩健，正如我們在過去屢次成功應對各種挑戰一樣。\n\n# 貨幣與金融穩定：國際金融中心的基礎\n\n自一九八三年創立以來，聯匯制度一直是香港金融體系的堅實支柱，並有助香港度過無數衝擊與挑戰。儘管新冠病毒疫情持續帶來不確定性，且市場對美國收緊貨幣政策的步伐感到擔憂，港元外匯及貨幣市場在全年持續有序運作，反映了聯匯制度的穩健。\n\n這項對我們體系的信心並非一蹴可幾，而是建立在多年來所奠定的堅實基礎之上。在二零二一年《對外部門報告》中，國際貨幣基金組織再次重申，聯匯制度的信譽已由一套透明的規則、充足的財政及外匯儲備、健全的金融監管與監督、靈活的經濟以及審慎的財政架構所確保。\n\n信心亦歸功於我們的公眾及市場溝通，以及有效的監察。後者方面，我們利用科技及數據分析技術，以加強我們對金融穩定和宏觀審慎監察進行更及時和全面的監察及分析的能力。\n\n銀行體系的穩健性對香港的金融穩定至關重要。新冠病毒疫情爆發兩年後，本港銀行在流動性水平和資本充足比率方面表現良好，符合國際標準。截至2021年底，本地銀行的資本充足比率為20.2%，遠高於8%的法定最低要求；而大型銀行在2021年第四季的平均流動性覆蓋比率為151.9%，亦遠高於100%的法定最低要求。儘管疫情期間信貸環境充滿挑戰，銀行業的資產質素在當年仍大致保持穩定。截至2021年底，銀行業的特定分類貸款比率為0.88%，較2020年底的0.90%有所下降，遠低於自2000年以來的長期平均水平1.8%。\n\n# 銀行業：經濟支柱\n\n一如往常，銀行業是經濟活動的重要經濟支柱。面對新型冠狀病毒疫情造成的經濟後果，這一點尤為關鍵。過去一年，主要挑戰在於在銀行業管理信用風險與維持該行業對實體經濟的支持之間取得平衡。憑藉多年來的監管工作，銀行持續有效地管理信用風險。同時，我們與銀行密切合作，透過預先批核還息不還本計劃（PPPHS）及其他紓困措施，為企業和個人客戶提供迫切所需的緩解措施。預先批核還息不還本計劃（PPPHS）於2020年與銀行業中小企貸款協調機制一同推出，允許符合資格的企業客戶在預先批准的基礎上延緩貸款本金償還六個月，該計劃在2021年再次延長兩次，直至2022年4月，以承認某些經濟行業仍因持續的疫情而面臨困難，需要持續的信貸紓困措施。隨後，考慮到本地新型冠狀病毒感染再度爆發，2022年2月，預先批核還息不還本計劃（PPPHS）進一步延長至2022年10月底。令人鼓舞的是，銀行業與金管局合作，協助緩解企業和個人客戶的現金流壓力，即使該行業本身因疫情爆發而面臨自身的艱難營運情況。\n\n除了充滿挑戰的信貸環境外，疫情亦帶來更困難的經營環境，以及伴隨日益嚴重網絡威脅的數碼環境。我們已加強努力，提升銀行業的運作穩健性及網絡防衛能力，並在數碼化不斷推進及網絡釣魚騙案激增的情況下，加強消費者及投資者保障。特別是，銀行業行為守則已進行修訂，以加強數碼金融服務中的消費者保障。\n\n除了監管工作外，我們致力於在銀行業推廣普及金融及以客為本的文化。提升有需要的市民使用銀行服務的方便性一直是我們的重點領域，我們亦一直與業界密切合作，制定行業指引。繼無障礙銀行服務及為智障人士提供銀行服務的指引後，業界在金管局的支持下，於2021年12月發表了一項指引，說明銀行業為認知障礙症患者及有需要市民提供銀行服務的原則及良好實踐。\n\n為支持未來銀行業持續發展，因應新的增長機會和挑戰需要勞動市場具備新的技能，金管局已制定一項「連接人才與未來」的全面人才發展策略，以更系統和有針對性的方式培養未來的專業人才，並提升現有銀行從業員的技能。 我們的全新策略基於三個「連接」方向：將學生與銀行業連接、將銀行從業員與銀行業的未來連接，以及將主要利益相關者聯繫起來，以加強策略實施的協作。 我們已推出一系列推廣及宣傳活動，以吸引更多學生投身銀行業。 為更好地讓大學生為「未來就緒」做好準備，我們與香港銀行學會共同推出銀行業銜接課程，該課程包含一系列涵蓋實用銀行知識和銀行業高度需求的有用的軟技能的課程。 針對現有的銀行從業員，我們一直與業界緊密合作，開發提升技能的機會，提供更多市場需求的培訓課程。 於2021年12月，銀行專業資歷架構下的金融科技新單元正式推出。\n\n金融人才對香港作為國際金融中心的未來發展至關重要。我們將與各方利益相關者緊密合作，以強化人才庫，促進業界的進一步發展。\n\n# 國際金融中心：堅實的地位由無與倫比的機會准入所支撐\n\n香港作為國際金融中心，其競爭力源於其提供的無與倫比的機會。普遍認為，全球金融科技應用、內地金融市場開放以及綠色和可持續金融的普及，為香港金融業的未來發展帶來了巨大的機遇。金管局已投入大量資源，利用香港獨有優勢來把握這些機遇。現在，容我先談談金融科技和內地市場的機會。\n\n# 全面采用金融科技\n\n疫情清楚證明了金融科技的力量，並徹底改變了客戶對金融服務的行為。為確保我們持續保持全球金融科技領域的領導地位，並準備充分挖掘金融科技的全部潛力，我們必須建立一個生態系統，讓金融科技的價值在各個層面和各個群體中得到體現。\n\n這個願景促使我們制定了一項新策略「金融科技2025」，並於2021年6月正式公布。顧名思義，它旨在幫助金融業在2025年前全面採用科技。這項策略包含五個重點領域，涵蓋了實現成功生態系統所需的要素，以及推動生態系統持續良性發展的關鍵因素。策略的前兩個部分，即「銀行全面應用金融科技」和「為央行數碼貨幣做好香港的未來準備」，主要旨在創造更多金融科技應用的需求。策略的其他部分與數據、基建、人才與資源息息相關，這些對於生態系統的發展至關重要。\n\n根據此策略，我們推出一系列新措施，例如粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）金融科技測試工具，讓金融機構和科技公司能夠進行試點，並從監管機構和用戶獲得對跨境金融科技計劃的早期反饋；以及啟動商業數據通的試點，利用替代數據促進中小企貸款。我們亦加強了對批發層面央行數碼貨幣應用於跨境支付的研究，並探討數碼港元的前景，以提升香港在採用央行數碼貨幣方面的準備，並為我們的金融基建在未來數十年內做好充分準備。\n\n我們善用科技發展帶來的新機會，同時持續鞏固既有成果，並密切關注可能出現的新風險。例如，2018年推出的轉數快系統近年來迅速發展，截至2021年底，登記數目已達960萬，較去年同期增長40%。平均每日交易量亦從2020年上升90%，2021年達到約673,000筆即時交易。同時，鑒於加密資產，特別是與支付相關的穩定幣迅速發展，我們今年早些時候已發佈了一份討論文件，以徵求市場對制定適當監管框架的意見。\n\n我們的新穎且具前瞻性的策略將為金融科技生態圈的健康發展奠定基礎。隨著銀行業日益採用金融科技以把握其提供的商機，這最終將同時惠及金融機構及香港市民，並強化香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。\n\n# 香港作為通往內地的主要門戶\n\n香港一直扮演著連接內地市場與金融市場的重要戰略角色，為國際投資者提供熟悉的制度和平台，以開展各類金融、投資和財富管理活動。十四五規劃綱要進一步鞏固香港作為國際金融中心、全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐，以及資產管理和風險管理中心的地位。 加上全球經濟趨勢，這更堅定了我們香港應繼續提升其作為連接內地與國際市場的橋樑的獨特價值的信念。\n\n2021年，我們在加強聯繫方面達成了一個重要里程碑，為我們的「通」計劃家族增添了兩名新成員，分別是大灣區的「跨境理財通」計劃，以及債券通下的「南向通」，基本上完成了在股票、債務及財富管理等廣泛金融市場中的雙向循環。這兩個計劃的啟動將為香港帶來各方面的新機遇。透過滿足內地投資者日益增長的多元化需求，這兩個計劃將擴大我們債券市場及財富管理業的客戶基礎。我很高興看到這兩個計劃運作順利。金管局將繼續與內地當局合作，逐步進一步完善這些計劃。\n"}
{"en":"# Highlights of 2021\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nIn 2021, the Hong Kong economy resumes positive growth on the back of strong merchandise exports, reviving domestic demand and a boost from the Government’s supportive policy measures.

經濟與金融環境\n\n2021年，香港經濟在貨物出口強勁、本地需求復甦以及政府相關政策措施的推動下，恢復正增長。勞工市場亦有所改善，雖然通脹略有上升，但整體仍處於溫和水平。\n\n香港銀行業持續穩健，資本及流動性水平充足。資產質素維持健康水平，符合歷史及國際標準。\n\n# 貨幣穩定\n\n儘管面對新冠病毒疫情帶來的持續不確定性，以及市場對美國收緊貨幣政策步伐的擔憂，港元市場繼續順暢有序地運作。聯繫匯率制度繼續運作良好。\n\n# 儲備管理\n\n隨著環球金融市場於2021年踏上復甦之路，外匯基金錄得投資收入191.9 港元，投資回報率為4.1%。\n\n金管局持續推動負責任投資及資產多元化。長期增長組合自2009年開展投資以來，年化內部回報率達15.4%。\n\n# 銀行體系穩定\n\n金管局繼續專注於監管重點放在銀行的風險管理上。考慮到網絡威脅不斷升級及數碼化加速推進，金管局已加強對銀行運作穩健性及網絡防衛能力的監管。銀行行為守則亦已修訂，以加強對數碼金融服務的消費者保障。\n\n經過廣泛諮詢，粵港澳大灣區跨境理財通業務試點順利啟動。金管局就銀行透過非面對面方式分銷投資及保險產品提供指引，以顧客為本的同時確保保障客戶權益。\n\n在打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集方面，金管局的重點一直是進一步強化銀行預防及偵測與疫情期間增加的網上金融罪行相關的不法資金流動的能力。金管局亦透過公私營夥伴關係加強訊息共享，同時支持遙距開戶，並透過啟動首個反洗錢合規科技實驗室，鼓勵採用其他科技，包括網絡分析。\n\n在軟實力領域持續加強努力，包括銀行文化及人才發展方面。\n\n本地實施國際監管標準取得良好進展，包括資本充足水平及資訊披露方面。金管局亦積極推進處置標準的建立、處置規劃的制定以及處置執行能力的发展，以確保銀行擁有可信的處置機制。\n\n#

1月29日\n\n金管局，連同銀行業中小企貸款協調機制，宣布為符合資格的企業客戶，在預先批核還息不還本計劃（預先批核還息不還本計劃）下，貿易融資提供為期90天的還款寬限。\n\n# 三月四日\n\n金管局，連同銀行業中小企貸款協調機制，宣布將預先批核還息不還本計劃延期六個月至2021年10月，惟貿易貸款的還款期將延遲90天。\n\n#

{"en":"# Priorities for 2022 and Beyond\n\nGlobal and local conditions deteriorated notably entering 2022. On the one hand, the escalation of the Ukraine situation and expectations of rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve triggered market volatility. On the other hand, the local economy took a hit from the new wave of COVID-19 pandemic. That said, Hong Kong’s financial system remains well-positioned to withstand adverse shocks given its resilience and buffers built up over the years. Looking ahead, the HKMA will continue to attach high importance to safeguarding monetary and financial stability. In doing so, we will endeavour to stay ahead of the curve by identifying emerging risks and responding to them in an agile manner. At the same time, the HKMA will seek opportunities that would help bolster Hong Kong’s status as a leading international financial centre. In managing the Exchange Fund in this complicated investment environment, the HKMA will continue to invest prudently, while remaining flexible, implementing defensive measures as appropriate, and maintaining a high degree of liquidity.\n\n# STABILITY AND INTEGRITY OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM\n\nThe global economic outlook remains subject to significant uncertainties.  The HKMA will keep abreast of latest developments and stay vigilant against potential risks, with the aim of upholding the resilience and stability of the financial system, which are essential for the ongoing provision of critical financial services that support the functioning of the Hong Kong economy.\n\n# Staying vigilant against potential risks\n\nLooking ahead, markets may be subject to heightened volatilities amid increased uncertainties on various fronts. On the one hand, the US Federal Reserve’s monetary policy normalisation, if continuing at a fast pace, may tighten global financial conditions visibly ahead and increase the global debt-servicing burden.  On the other hand, following the escalation of the Ukraine situation in early 2022, geopolitical uncertainties including the China–US tension may continue to stay high and trigger bouts of financial market volatility again.  Last but not least, with the evolving pandemic developments, there might be a potential downside scenario where lockdowns were to be re-imposed at a large scale, leading to persistent global supply bottlenecks and adversely affecting global growth and inflation.  Having said that, Hong Kong’s financial system is well-positioned to withstand adverse shocks given the resilience and buffers built up over the years.  The HKMA also has the capability, resources and commitment to safeguard Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nThe HKMA will continue to closely monitor risks and vulnerabilities in the domestic and external environments and stand ready to deploy appropriate measures where necessary to maintain Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. Research programmes in 2022 will study issues affecting the Hong Kong economy and assess their potential risks. Meanwhile, the HKMA’s ongoing Digitalisation Programme will help enhance its surveillance capabilities to support more holistic surveillance and comprehensive analysis of the financial system.\n\n# Maintaining banking stability\n\nAs developed markets tighten monetary policies and the impact of the pandemic lingers, the credit landscape facing the banking sector is expected to remain challenging. At the same time, rapid technological advancement and digitalisation present both opportunities and challenges to the banking sector.  Facing an ever-changing financial landscape, the HKMA strives to ensure banks’ ability to withstand shocks through its ongoing supervisory efforts. At the same time, the HKMA will also continue to enhance and refine its banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account international standards and best practices.\n\n# A risk-based supervisory focus\n\n# Credit risk\n\nIn 2022, the HKMA will step up the surveillance of banks’ credit risk exposures and take proactive steps to ensure that overall risk levels remain well contained.\n\nThe HKMA will also continue to monitor the development of the pandemic and its effect on the operating conditions of corporates, as well as maintain close dialogue with the banking and commercial sectors while keeping the various relief measures under review.\n\n# Operational and technology risks\n\nWith the issuance of the new Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module on “Operational Resilience” in May 2022, the HKMA will continue to engage the industry and understand authorized institutions’ (AIs’) progress in developing their operational resilience frameworks.  In parallel, the HKMA will seek to raise the banking sector’s cyber resilience by following up with AIs on issues revealed by the assessments under the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 and monitoring AIs’ implementation of secure tertiary data backup.  Another key supervisory focus will be evaluating and addressing the risks from AIs’ growing dependency on technology service providers.\n\nWith enhanced digital capabilities and extensive remote working experience accumulated during the pandemic, some AIs are planning to transition to a hybrid working model on a business-as-usual basis.  The HKMA will keep track of this development and assess whether the associated risks are adequately addressed by the industry.\n\n# Liquidity and market risks\n\nThe HKMA will focus on the supervision of AIs’ liquidity and market risk management in 2022.  In particular, the HKMA will continue to monitor AIs’ progress in transitioning away from the remaining London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) settings before these settings cease to be published by 30 June 2023.\n\n# Combating money laundering and terrorist financing\n\nIn 2022, the HKMA’s work on anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT) will continue to focus on strengthening response to fraud and financial crime through collaboration and information sharing, pursuing closer co-operation with various stakeholders in the AML\/CFT ecosystem.  Other priorities are to implement a wider range of risk-sensitive supervisory techniques, by leveraging enhanced data and supervisory technology (Suptech) capabilities, and promote the use of Regtech by banks, including transaction monitoring systems.\n\nThe HKMA will also keep working closely with the Government, the banking and stored value facility (SVF) sectors to publish an updated Hong Kong money laundering and terrorist financing risk assessment, and assist the industry in combatting new and emerging risks.  Work will also continue on understanding evolving money laundering and terrorist financing risks, implementing changes to AML law and related guidance to align with international standards, and maintaining proactive engagement with other regulators and international standard setters.\n\n# Wealth management and mandatory provident fund-related businesses\n\nIn 2022, the HKMA will carry out on-site examinations and off-site surveillance of AIs’ conduct in relation to wealth management and the selling of securities, mandatory provident fund (MPF) and other investment and insurance products, with a focus on the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) Scheme in the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area, digital advisory platforms, complex products, virtual assets and non-investment-linked long term insurance products.\n\nWhile maintaining close communication with other regulators and the banking industry, the HKMA will provide further guidance on regulatory standards in relation to the sale of investment, insurance and MPF products.  This will cover, among other things, investment services related to virtual assets and the selling of Protection Linked Plans, a new subset of investment-linked assurance scheme products with high level of insurance protection.  The HKMA, the Insurance Authority and the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority will jointly launch a mystery shopping programme on the selling practices of intermediaries in respect of Qualifying Deferred Annuity Policies and Tax-deductible Voluntary Contributions.\n\nFollowing the smooth launch of the Cross-boundary WMC, the HKMA will continue engaging the industry and relevant regulatory authorities to enhance the scheme.\n\nMoreover, the HKMA will embark on preparation work for supervising AIs’ trust business under a new SPM module and a new Code of Practice.\n\n# Oversight of financial market infrastructures\n\nThe HKMA will continue to promote the safety and efficiency of the financial market infrastructures (FMIs) under its oversight, in accordance with the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO), the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMI)1, and the various guidances issued by the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI).  It will fine-tune the FMI oversight framework taking into account the latest technological and market developments.\n\nThe HKMA will work with the FMIs on their observance of the PFMI, conducting and updating assessments as appropriate. In addition, the HKMA will continue to participate in the CPMI-IOSCO PFMI implementation monitoring and assessment exercise.  The HKMA will also participate in the work of international standard setting bodies and strengthen its oversight requirements in response to market and technology developments and in line with international practices.  The HKMA will work with relevant authorities to further strengthen co-operative oversight arrangements where appropriate.\n\n# Policy development\n\nThe HKMA will continue to enhance and refine its banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account international standards and best practices.\n\n# Implementation of Basel standards in Hong Kong\n\n# Capital standards\n\nThe HKMA will continue to enhance the capital framework with the implementation of the standards published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) in recent years, which include the following:\n\nThe Capital Requirements for Banks’ Equity Investments in Funds of December 2013 (EIF standard), which will come into effect on 1 July 2022 with the Banking (Capital) (Amendment) Rules 2022 commencing operation after negative vetting by the Legislative Council.\n\nThe revised capital standards set out in the Basel III Finalising Post-crisis Reforms of December 2017, the Minimum Capital Requirements for Market Risk of January 2019 (revised in February 2019), and the Targeted Revisions to the Credit Valuation Adjustment Risk Framework of July 2020, which are collectively referred to as the “Basel III final reform package”.  These revised capital standards set out the revised capital treatment of credit risk, market risk, credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk and operational risk, introduce an output floor requirement, and enhance the leverage ratio framework.  Amendments to the Banking (Capital) Rules (BCR) are being prepared in consultation with the industry with a view to them taking effect from 1 July 2023 as minimum requirements (except for those on market risk and CVA risk2).\n\nGiven that the capital treatment for sovereign concentration risk under the BCR was designed to complement the Basel Committee’s large exposure framework as implemented by the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules, the HKMA will propose amendments to the capital rules in parallel with relevant changes to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules.\n\n# Exposure limits\n\nThe HKMA will continue its work on the proposed amendments to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules in consultation with the industry and the Department of Justice with a target implementation date aligned with the one for the Basel III final reform package, i.e. 1 July 2023.\n\n# Disclosure standards\n\nNew or revised disclosure requirements associated with the revised capital standards in the Basel III final reform package are mainly set out in the Pillar 33 Disclosure Requirements – Updated Framework and the Revisions to Market Risk Disclosure Requirements, published by the Basel Committee in December 2018 and November 2021 respectively.  The Basel Committee also published the Revisions to Leverage Ratio Disclosure Requirements in June 2019 amending the disclosure requirements for leverage ratio to address concerns regarding potential “window-dressing” (i.e. banks reducing the volumes of certain transactions around reporting dates to artificially inflate their leverage ratios for reporting and public disclosure).  Corresponding amendments to the Banking (Disclosure) Rules to implement these new or revised disclosure requirements are also being prepared, with a view to having them take effect in Hong Kong along the same timelines as their associated revised capital standards.\n\n# Other supervisory policies and risk management guidelines\n\nTo reflect developments in regulatory requirements and international standards, the HKMA plans to update certain SPM modules, including those relevant to the implementation of the revised capital and disclosure standards in the Basel III final reform package, “Countercyclical Capital Buffer – Approach to its Implementation”, “Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book”, “New Share Subscription and Share Margin Financing” and “Stress Testing”.  The HKMA will also continue to work on the revised SPM modules on “Code of Conduct” and “Reporting Requirements Relating to Authorized Institutions’ External Auditors under the Banking Ordinance”, with an aim to finalising the revisions within 2022. Consequential to the proposed amendments to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules, the related Code of Practice and SPM modules, e.g. CR-G-8 on “Large Exposures and Risk Concentrations” and CR-G-9 on “Exposures to Connected Parties”, will be updated accordingly.\n","terms":{"12-month expected credit losses":["12個月預期信用虧損"],"2022–23 Budget":["2022至23年度財政預算案"],"24\/7 operations":["每日24小時無間斷運作"],"80%

2022年及以後的重點\n\n全球及本地情況在2022年初顯著惡化。一方面，烏克蘭局勢的升級以及美國聯邦儲備局加息的預期，導致市場波動。另一方面，本地經濟受到新冠病毒疫情新一波的影響。然而，香港金融體系憑藉多年來累積的抗震能力及緩衝，仍能穩健應對不利衝擊。展望未來，金管局將繼續高度重視維護貨幣及金融穩定。為達此目標，我們將積極識別前路的風險，並以靈活的方式作出回應。同時，金管局亦會尋找機會，以鞏固香港作為國際金融中心的領導地位。在這複雜的投資環境下管理外匯基金，金管局將繼續謹慎投資，並保持靈活性，適時採取防禦措施，並維持高度流動性。\n\n# 金融體系的穩定與健全\n\n環球經濟前景仍面臨重大不確定性。金管局將密切關注最新發展，並對潛在風險保持警惕，以維護金融體系的抗震能力與穩定性，這對於持續提供支持香港經濟運作的關鍵金融服務至關重要。\n\n# 保持對潛在風險的警惕。\n\n展望未來，市場可能因各方面的不確定性增加而面臨加劇的波動。一方面，若美國聯邦儲備局的貨幣政策正常化持續以較快步伐推進，可能會明顯收緊全球金融狀況，並增加全球的債務負擔。另一方面，自2022年初烏克蘭局勢升級以來，包括中美緊張關係在內的地緣政治因素可能持續高企，再次引發金融市場波動。最後但同樣重要的是，隨著疫情的持續發展，可能存在一種潛在的下行情景，即大規模封城措施可能再次實施，導致環球供應鏈樽頸問題持續存在，並對全球增長及通脹產生不利影響。儘管如此，香港金融體系憑藉多年來建立的抗震能力及緩衝措施，已具備應對不利衝擊的良好基礎。金管局亦擁有足夠的能力、資源和承諾，以維護香港的貨幣及金融穩定。\n\n金管局將會繼續密切監察本地及外圍環境的風險與不穩定因素，並隨時準備採取適當措施以維持香港的金融穩定。二零二二年的研究計劃將會研究影響香港經濟的議題，並評估其潛在風險。與此同時，金管局持續的數碼化計劃將有助於提升其監察能力，以支援對金融體系更全面的監察及分析。\n\n# 維持銀行體系穩定\n\n隨著已發展市場收緊貨幣政策，且疫情的影響持續存在，銀行業面臨的信貸環境預期將持續嚴峻。同時，快速的科技發展與數碼化為銀行業帶來機會與挑戰。面對不斷變化的金融環境，金管局持續推動監管工作，以確保銀行能承受衝擊。同時，金管局亦會繼續完善及優化銀行監管架構與政策，並參考國際標準及最佳做法。\n\n# 風險為本的監管重點\n\n# 信用風險\n\n2022年，金管局將加強對銀行信用風險的監察，並採取積極措施，確保整體風險水平保持在可控範圍內。\n\n金管局亦會繼續監察疫情的發展及其對企業營運情況的影響，同時與銀行及商業界保持密切對話，並持續審視各項紓困措施。\n\n# 業務操作及科技風險\n\n隨著2022年5月新版《監管政策手冊》（SPM）「運作穩健性」模組的發佈，金管局將繼續與業界溝通，了解認可機構在建立運作穩健性框架方面的進展。同時，金管局將透過跟進認可機構在《網絡防衛評估框架2.0》評估中揭示的問題，並監督認可機構落實安全的三重數據備份，以提升銀行業的網絡防衛能力。另一個重要的監管重點將是評估和應對認可機構日益依賴科技服務供應商所帶來的風險。\n\n憑藉疫情期間提升的數碼能力和累積的大量遠程工作經驗，部分認可機構正計劃在正常營運的基礎上過渡至混合工作模式。金管局將會密切關注此發展，並評估業界是否充分應對相關風險。\n\n# 流動性及市場風險\n\n金管局將於二零二二年專注於對認可機構的流動資金及市場風險管理進行監察。 尤其，金管局將繼續監察認可機構在逐步淘汰倫敦銀行同業拆息 (LIBOR) 剩餘指標方面的進展，這些指標將於二零二三年六月三十日停止發布。\n\n#打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集\n\n於2022年，金管局在打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集方面的工作將繼續專注於透過合作和訊息共享，加強應對詐欺和金融罪行。同時，將會與反洗錢生態系統內各利益相關者更緊密合作。其他重點包括，利用增強的數據和監管科技，實施更廣泛的風險為本監管技巧，並推廣銀行使用合規科技，包括交易監察系統。\n\n金管局亦會繼續與政府、銀行及儲值支付工具（儲值支付工具）業界緊密合作，發表最新的香港洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險評估，並協助業界對抗新的前路的風險。 相關工作亦會繼續進行，以了解不斷演變的洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險，實施對反洗錢法及相關指引的修改，使其符合國際標準，並與其他監管機構及國際標準制定組織保持積極的互動。\n\n# 財富管理及強制性公積金相關業務\n\n2022年，金管局將對認可機構在財富管理及證券銷售、強制性公積金（強積金）和其他投資及保險產品方面的行為進行現場審查及監察，重點關注粵港澳大灣區的跨境理財通計劃、數碼顧問平台、複雜產品、虛擬資產及非投資相連長期保險產品。\n\n在保持與其他監管機構及銀行業的密切溝通之餘，金管局將就投資、保險及強積金產品銷售的監管標準提供進一步指引。這將涵蓋包括但不限於與虛擬資產相關的投資服務，以及銷售保障型投資相連壽險，一種新型的投資相連壽險產品，提供高水平的保險保障。金管局、保險業監管局及強制性公積金計劃管理局將聯手推出喬裝客戶檢查計劃，針對中介機構在銷售合資格延期年金保單及可扣稅自願性供款方面的銷售實踐進行檢查。\n\n隨着跨境理財通順利推出，金管局將繼續與業界及相關監管機構合作，以優化此計劃。\n\n此外，金管局將開展準備工作，以根據新的監管政策手冊模塊和新的營運守則，對認可機構的信託業務進行監管。\n\n# 金融市場基建的監管\n\n金管局將繼續推動其監察範圍內的金融市場基建的安全性及效率，並依據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（支付條例）、《金融市場基建的原則》（基建原則）¹，以及支付及金融基建委員會（CPMI）發布的各項指引來執行。它會根據最新的技術及市場發展，調整金融市場基建的監察架構。\n\n金管局將與金融市場基建機構合作，確保其遵守基建原則，並適時進行及更新評估。此外，金管局將繼續參與支付及金融基建委員會與國際證監會組織的基建原則實施監測及評估工作。金管局亦將參與國際標準制定組織的工作，並根據市場及科技發展情況及國際慣例，加強其監管要求。金管局將與有關當局合作，適時進一步強化協調監管安排。\n\n# 政策制定\n\n金管局將持續完善及優化其銀行監管架構與政策，並參考國際標準及最佳做法。\n\n# 香港推行巴塞爾標準\n\n#資本標準\n\n金管局將繼續根據巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（巴塞爾委員會）近年發布的標準，進一步完善資本架構，其中包括以下內容：\n\n2013年12月頒佈的《銀行於基金的股權投資的資本要求》（EIF標準），將於2022年7月1日生效，並在立法會完成負面審查後，與《2022年銀行業（資本）（修訂）規則》同時實施。\n\n2017年12月《巴塞爾協定三：危機後改革的最終方案》、2019年1月《市場風險最低資本規定》（2019年2月修訂），以及2020年7月《信用估值調整風險架構》的定向修訂，統稱為《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案。 這些修訂後的資本標準闡明了信用風險、市場風險、信用估值調整風險及業務操作風險的資本處理方式，引入出項下限規定，並強化槓桿比率框架。目前正在諮詢業界，準備修訂《銀行業（資本）規則》（BCR），預計自2023年7月1日起生效，作為最低要求（市場風險及信用估值調整風險除外）。\n\n鑒於根據銀行業（資本）規則對官方實體集中風險的資本處理方式，旨在補充巴塞爾委員會所制定的大額風險承擔框架，而該框架已透過銀行業（風險承擔限度）規則實施，因此金管局將同步提出對資本規則的修訂建議，並配合銀行業（風險承擔限度）規則的相關更改。\n\n# 風險承擔限度\n\n金管局將繼續就《銀行業（風險承擔限度）規則》的擬議修訂與業界及律政司磋商，目標實施日期將與《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案的日期一致，即2023年7月1日。\n\n# 披露標準\n\n與《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案中修訂資本標準相關的新披露要求，主要載於巴塞爾委員會於2018年12月及2021年11月分別發布的《第三支柱披露要求 – 更新框架》及《修訂市場風險披露規定》。巴塞爾委員會亦於2019年6月發布《修訂槓桿比率披露規定》，修訂槓桿比率的披露要求，以應對有關潛在「粉飾櫥窗」（即銀行在報告日期前後減少某些交易量，以人為提高其報告及公眾披露的槓桿比率）的擔憂。為落實這些新或修訂的披露要求，亦正在準備對《銀行業（披露）規則》作出相應修訂，目標是在香港與相關修訂資本標準相同的時間表內生效。\n\n# 其他監管政策及風險管理指引\n\n為反映監管要求和國際標準的發展，金管局計劃更新《監管政策手冊》的若干章節，包括與《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案中已修訂資本及披露標準相關的章節，例如「逆周期緩衝資本  實施方法」、「銀行帳內的利率風險」、「新股認購及股票孖展融資」及「壓力測試」。金管局亦將繼續就《行為守則》及《認可機構外聘核數師根據《銀行業條例》提交報告書的規定》的已修訂《監管政策手冊》章節進行工作，目標為於2022年完成修訂。 鑑於《銀行業（風險承擔限度）規則》的建議修訂，相關的《營運守則》及《監管政策手冊》章節，例如關於「大額風險及風險集中度」的CR-G-8及關於「與關聯方風險」的CR-G-9，將相應更新。\n"}
{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nWith strong merchandise exports, reviving domestic demand and a boost from the Government’s supportive policy measures, the Hong Kong economy resumed positive growth in 2021, reversing the contraction experienced during 2019 and 2020. The labour market also improved, and inflation remained moderate albeit having edged up. While economic recovery is expected to continue after the fifth wave of COVID-19 subsides, its strength and speed are subject to uncertainties and risks, especially those surrounding the pandemic and the path of US monetary policy normalisation.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Real activities\n\nDriven by strong merchandise exports and improving domestic demand, the Hong Kong economy grew by 6.3% in 2021, ending the economic contraction in 2019 and 2020 (Table 1 and Chart 1).  Private consumption recovered, thanks to improved labour market conditions and a boost from the Government’s Consumption Voucher Scheme1. Overall investment spending also rebounded as the business environment and outlook improved2.  Externally, HongKong’s exports of goods saw strong growth for the whole year, in part supported by the continued global economic recovery.  Export of services recorded modest growth, reflecting active regional trade and cargo flows as well as stronger cross-border business and financial activities. Total imports rose appreciably, mainly because of greater domestic and re-export-induced demand.  On a net basis, external trade contributed positively to real gross domestic product (GDP) growth in 2021 (Chart 1) as total exports grew faster than imports.\n\nTable 1 Real GDP growth by expenditure component (period-over-period)\n\nNote: The seasonally-adjusted quarter-on-quarter rates of change in the gross domestic fixed capital formation are not available. Source: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Inflation\n\nInflationary pressures edged up but remained moderate during the year.  Netting out the effects of the Government’s one-off relief measures, the year-on-year underlying inflation rate3 picked up gradually to a mild 1.4% in December (Chart 2)4.  Prices of consumer items such as dining out, transport, clothing and footwear regained upward momentum as local consumption demand improved. Import prices also increased notably alongside bottlenecks in global supply chains and the surge in international energy and commodity prices.  By contrast, the housing component was a drag on overall inflation, reflecting the feed-through of the earlier decline in fresh-letting private residential rentals (Chart 2).  More broadly, slow growth in nominal wage and commercial rentals helped keep domestic business cost pressures in check.  For 2021 as a whole, the underlying and headline inflation rates5 stayed mild at 0.6% and 1.6% respectively.\n\nChart 2 Underlying consumer price inflation\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Labour market\n\nAlongside the domestic economic recovery, the labour market improved in 2021.  After reaching a 17-year high of 7.2% in February, the unemployment rate declined visibly to 4.0% in December6 (Chart 3) and the decline was broad based across most economic sectors.  Overall labour demand strengthened gradually as reflected by a pick-up in total employment (Chart 3) and private sector vacancies, though they were still below their pre-pandemic peaks.  On the other hand, the labour force shrank slightly by 1.3% in December compared with a year earlier, partly due to a modest decline in the labour force participation rate. The year-on-year growth in nominal wage and labour earnings, while moderate, showed signs of acceleration in the first three quarters of 2021, reversing the trend of deceleration during 2019–2020.\n\nChart 3 Labour market conditions\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe local stock market was broadly sluggish during the year, despite a continued rally in some major overseas equity markets (Chart 4).  Extending its rebound in late 2020, the Hang Seng Index rose to a high of 31,085 on 17 February 2021, but market sentiment had turned sharply negative since then owing to a host of factors, including concerns about the new COVID-19 virus variants, potential monetary policy tightening by major central banks and reduced inflows from southbound trading under Stock Connect7.  The Hang Seng Index closed the year at 23,398, down markedly by 14.1% from a year ago.\n\nChart 4 Asset prices\nSources: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market regained some upward momentum in the first half of 2021 alongside better economic prospects, but saw some consolidation in the second half amid weakened asset market sentiments (Chart 4).  Overall, housing prices and transaction volume still recorded an increase of 3.7% and 24.1% respectively in 2021. Household affordability also became even more stretched, partly reflecting reduced household income.  On the other hand, after going through sharp corrections in 2019 and 2020, the non-residential property markets generally improved, with prices and rentals of industrial properties generally rising to their pre-pandemic peaks, whereas those of retail and office spaces remained below their respective peaks.\n\nSee Table B: Major Economic Indicators on pages 326 to 327 for more details, including their trends during 2017–2021.\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nIn early 2022, the fifth wave of local COVID-19 infections has exerted pressures on domestic economic activities. In response, the Government introduced the fifth and the sixth rounds of the Anti-epidemic Fund and additional countercyclical measures under the 2022–23 Budget to help support the economy.  The HKMA, together with the banking sector, also extended the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme to the end of October 2022.\n\nFor 2022 as a whole, economic recovery is expected to continue, albeit at a more moderate pace compared to 2021, partly reflecting the impact of the fifth wave of COVID-19, slower global economic growth, a less favourable base effect and US monetary policy normalisation.  The Government forecasts real GDP growth for 2022 to be in the range of 1–2% and the latest growth estimates by international organisations and private sector analysts averaged 1.1%.  That said, the strength and pace of the recovery are subject to a host of uncertainties and risks, especially those surrounding the pandemic, the Ukraine situation, and the path of US monetary policy normalisation.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nAlongside rising import prices and pandemic-induced logistics disruptions, inflationary pressures are expected to edge up in the near term, but should stay broadly in check owing to soft rentals and mild local labour cost pressures. Market consensus forecasts a headline inflation rate of 2.4% in 2022, while the Government projects the headline and underlying inflation rates to be 2.1% and 2.0% respectively. The fifth wave of local COVID-19 infections has exerted pressures on the labour market in early 2022, especially for contact-intensive sectors.  Further out, labour market conditions will depend on the pandemic developments and the pace of the domestic economic recovery.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector continued to be stable in 2021.  Total banking assets expanded moderately as both loans and deposits increased.  The capital and liquidity positions of the banking sector remained robust. Asset quality stayed at a healthy level by both historical and international standards.\n\n# Balance sheet trends\n\nThe banking sector’s balance sheet grew by 1.9% in 2021. Driven by the economic recovery, total loans recorded a growth of 3.8% during the year, compared with 1.2% in 2020.  Among the total, loans for use in Hong Kong grew by 4.4%, loans for use outside Hong Kong grew by 1.1% and trade finance increased by 14.2%.  Mainland-related lending expanded by 3.6% in 2021, after remaining largely stable in 2020.\n\nOn the liability side, total deposits rose by 4.6% in 2021, compared with 5.4% in 2020.  As total deposits increased at a faster pace than total loans, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio edged down to 71.8% at the end of 2021 from 72.3% a year ago (Chart 5).\n\nChart 5 Loans and deposits of the banking sector\nSource: HKMA.\n\n# Capital adequacy\n\nThe banking sector remained well capitalised. The consolidated total capital ratio of locally incorporated authorized institutions (AIs) stood at 20.2% at the end of 2021.  The Tier 1 capital ratio was 18.2% (Chart 6). Both ratios were well above their respective international minimum requirements of 8% and 6%.\n\nThe Basel III leverage ratio was 7.9% at the end of 2021, well above the statutory minimum requirement of 3% (Chart 7).\n\n# Liquidity\n\nThe liquidity position of the banking sector was sound.  The quarterly average Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) of category 1 institutions8 was 151.9% in the fourth quarter of 2021, well\n\nabove the statutory minimum requirement of 100%. The quarterly average Liquidity Maintenance Ratio (LMR) of category 2 institutions was 59.1%, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 25% (Chart 8).\n\nChart 8 Liquidity ratios of designated AIs\nSource: HKMA.\n\nThe sources of funding of the banking sector remained stable.  The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) of category 1 institutions was 135.3% at the end of 2021, well above the statutory minimum requirement of 100%.  The Core Funding\n\nRatio (CFR) of category 2A institutions9 was 150.3% at the end of 2021, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 75% (Chart 9).\n\nChart 9 Funding ratios of designated AIs\nSource: HKMA.\n\n# Asset quality\n\nAsset quality remained stable during the year and stayed at a healthy level by both historical and international standards. The classified loan ratio was 0.88% at the end of 2021 as compared to 0.90% at the end of 2020, with the overdue and rescheduled loan ratio edging down to 0.56% from 0.57% during the period (Chart 10).  The classified loan ratio for Mainland-related lending was 0.86% at the end of 2021 as compared to 0.96% at the end of 2020.  The delinquency ratios of residential mortgage lending and credit card lending remained low at 0.04% and 0.20% respectively (Chart 11). The HKMA will continue to closely monitor the change in the asset quality of the banking sector.\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe low interest rate environment continued to weigh on the profitability of the banking sector.  The aggregate pre-tax operating profit of retail banks declined by 19.8% in 2021 (Chart 12), mainly attributable to a decrease in net interest income (-13.6%) and an increase in total operating expenses (+7.1%).  These were partly offset by an increase in income from fees and commissions (+9.6%) and a drop in loan impairment charges (-25.1%).  The net interest margin further narrowed to 0.98% in 2021 from 1.18% in 2020 (Chart 13).\n\nRetail banks’ cost-to-income ratio rose to 54.7% in 2021 from 47.0% in 2020 (Chart 14).\n","terms":{"12-month expected credit losses":["12個月預期信用虧損"],"2022–23 Budget":["2022至23年度財政預算案"],"24\/7 operations":["每日24小時無間斷運作"],"80% and 90% Guarantee Products":["八成及九成信貸擔保產品"],"A hub for

經濟與金融環境\n\n在強勁的貨物出口、本地需求復甦以及政府相關政策措施的推動下，香港經濟於2021年恢復正增長，扭轉了2019年和2020年所面臨的經濟收縮情況。勞工市場亦有所改善，雖然通脹略有上升，但整體仍處於溫和水平。儘管預計第五波新冠病毒疫情緩和後經濟復甦將持續，但其強度和速度仍受不確定因素和風險影響，特別是與疫情及美國貨幣政策正常化的路徑相關的風險。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 實體經濟活動\n\n受強勁貨物出口及本地需求改善的推動，香港經濟在2021年增長6.3%，結束了2019年和2020年的經濟收縮（見表1及圖1）。私人消費因勞工市場狀況改善及政府消費補貼計劃的推動而恢復增長。整體投資支出亦因營商環境及前景改善而出現反彈。在外貿方面，香港全年貨物出口錄得強勁增長，部分得益於全球經濟持續復甦。服務輸出則錄得溫和增長，反映區內貿易及貨運活躍，以及跨境商業及金融活動增加。總進口額顯著上升，主要是由於本地需求及轉口需求增加。淨額計算，2021年總出口增長快過進口，因此對實質本地生產總值（GDP）增長作出正面貢獻（見圖1）。\n\n表1 實質本地生產總值按開支項目環比增長\n\n注意：本地固定資本形成總額的經季節性調整的按季增減幅度尚未有可供參考的數據。資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 物價上漲\n\n通脹壓力在當年小幅上升，但整體保持溫和。扣除政府一次性紓困措施的影響後，核心通脹率逐漸上揚，至12月達到輕微的1.4%（見圖表2）。隨著本地消費需求改善，外出用餐、交通、服裝及鞋履等消費項目價格重新恢復上漲動能。同時，全球供應鏈瓶頸及國際能源和商品價格上升，也導致進口價格明顯增加。相比之下，租金項目對整體通脹構成拖累，反映早前新簽訂的私人住宅租金下跌的傳導效應（見圖表2）。更廣泛而言，名義工資及商業樓宇租金的緩慢增長有助於控制國內企業成本壓力。整體而言，2021年核心通脹率與整體通脹率分別為0.6%及1.6%，均保持溫和水平。\n\n圖2 基本消費者物價通脹  \n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 勞工市場\n\n與國內經濟復甦同步，2021年勞工市場有所改善。失業率在二月達到17年高點的7.2%後，於十二月顯著下降至4.0%（圖表3），且降幅涵蓋大部分行業。總就業人數增加（圖表3）和私營機構職位空缺的增長反映出整體勞動需求逐漸增強，儘管仍低於疫情前的峰值。另一方面，勞動人口在十二月較去年同期略微減少1.3%，部分原因是勞動人口參與率溫和下降。名義工資和勞工收入的按年增長雖然溫和，但在2021年前三季顯示出加速跡象，扭轉了2019–2020年期間的減速趨勢。\n\n圖3 勞工市場狀況\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 股市\n\n本地股市全年表現普遍疲弱，儘管一些主要海外股票市場持續上漲（圖4）。在2020年底延續反彈後，恆生指數於2021年2月17日一度升至31,085點，但自那之後，市場氣氛因多項因素而急劇轉為負面，包括對新冠病毒新變異株的擔憂、主要央行可能收緊貨幣政策，以及透過南向通的資金流入減少。恆生指數全年以23,398點收市，較去年同期明顯下跌14.1%。\n\n圖表 4 資產價格\n資料來源：差餉物業估價署和香港交易及結算所有限公司。\n\n#物業市場\n\n2021年上半年，住宅物業市場在經濟前景改善的情況下恢復上升動力，但隨後在資產市場情緒受挫的情況下出現盤整（圖4）。整體而言，樓價及成交量分別錄得3.7%及24.1%的升幅。置業負擔能力亦變得更加吃力，部分反映家庭住戶入息減少。另一方面，經歷2019及2020年的顯著調整後，非住宅物業市場普遍改善，工業物業價格及租金普遍回升至疫情前高峰，而零售及寫字樓物業價格則仍低於各自高峰。\n\n如需了解更多詳情，包括 2017 至 2021 年的趨勢，請參閱第 326 至 327 頁的表 B：主要經濟指標。\n\n# 經濟前景\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n在二零二二年年初，本地 新冠病毒 疫情的第五波已對本地經濟活動造成壓力。 應對此情況，政府在 2022至23年度財政預算案下，推出了第五輪及第六輪 防疫抗疫基金，並採取了額外的 逆周期措施，以支持經濟。 金管局與銀行界同時將 預先批核還息不還本計劃 延至二零二二年十月尾。\n\n整體而言，2022年經濟復甦預計將持續，但步伐較2021年更加溫和，部分反映第五波新冠病毒疫情的影響、全球經濟增長放緩、較不利的基數效應以及美國貨幣政策正常化。政府預計2022年實質本地生產總值增長將介於1至2%之間，而國際組織及私人機構分析師的最新增長預測平均為1.1%。然而，復甦的強度和速度將取決於眾多不確定因素和風險，特別是疫情、烏克蘭局勢以及美國貨幣政策正常化的路徑。\n\n# 通貨膨脹與勞工市場\n\n除進口價格上漲及疫情引發的物流中斷外，通脹壓力預期在短期內將略微上升，但由於租金疲軟及本地勞工成本壓力溫和，應能維持大致受控。市場共識預測2022年的整體通脹率為2.4%，而政府預測整體及基礎通脹率分別為2.1%及2.0%。本地新型冠狀病毒第五波感染在2022年初對勞工市場造成壓力，尤其是面對面接觸的行業。就更長遠而言，勞工市場狀況將取決於疫情發展及國內經濟復甦的速度。\n\n# 銀行體系表現\n\n香港銀行業在2021年繼續保持穩定。總銀行體系資產以貸款及存款增加為主導，穩步擴張。銀行業的資本及流動性水平依然強健。資產質素按歷史標準及國際標準而言均維持健康水平。\n\n# 資產負債表走勢\n\n銀行業的資產負債表於2021年增長了1.9%。 受到經濟復甦的推動，貸款總額在當年錄得3.8%的增長，較2020年的1.2%有所提升。 其中，用於香港的貸款增長了4.4%，用於香港以外的貸款增長了1.1%，而貿易融資則增長了14.2%。 與內地相關的貸款在2021年擴大3.6%，此前在2020年基本保持穩定。\n\n就負債方面而言，2021年存款總額上漲了4.6%，與2020年的5.4%相比。由於存款總額的增長速度超過貸款總額，整體貸存比率從去年同期的72.3%小幅下降至2021年底的71.8%（圖表5）。\n\n圖5 銀行業貸款及存款情況\n資料來源：金管局。\n\n# 資本充足水平\n\n銀行業維持穩健的資本水平。截至2021年底，本地註冊認可機構的合併總資本比率為20.2%。一級資本比率為18.2%（圖6）。兩項比率均遠高於各自的國際最低要求，分別為8%和6%。\n\n《巴塞爾協定三》槓桿比率在2021年底為7.9%，遠高於3%的法定最低要求（圖表7）。\n\n# 流動性\n\n銀行業的流動性狀況穩健。第一類機構在2021年第四季的平均流動性覆蓋比率（流動性覆蓋比率）為151.9%，遠高於預期。\n\n高於法定最低要求的100%。第2類機構的季度平均流動性維持比率（LMR）為59.1%，亦遠高於法定最低要求的25%（圖表8）。\n\n圖8

盈利走勢\n\n低息環境持續影響銀行業的盈利能力。 零售銀行 的除稅前經營溢利在2021年下降了19.8%（圖12），主要歸因於淨利息收入減少（-13.6%）和總經營開支增加（+7.1%）。 費用及佣金收入的增加（+9.6%）和貸款減值撥備的下降（-25.1%）部分抵消了這些影響。 淨息差進一步縮小至2021年的0.98%，較2020年的1.18%（圖13）。\n\n零售銀行的成本與收入比率從2020年的47.0%上升至2021年的54.7%（圖表14）。\n"}
{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nDespite the lingering uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and increased concerns about the pace of US monetary tightening, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to trade in a smooth and orderly manner.  As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability since it was implemented in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System has shown its strength and resilience to external shocks.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability.  This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\n# The Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n\nCertificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks; Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation; the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of clearing account balances kept with the HKMA; and Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs).  With the HKMA standing ready to sell (or buy) Hong Kong dollars to (or from) banks in exchange for US dollars upon request at 7.75 (or 7.85) per US dollar, when the strong-side (or weak-side) CU is triggered, the Aggregate Balance will expand (or contract) to push down (or up) Hong Kong dollar interest rates that would help move the Hong Kong dollar back to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2021\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nDriven by equity-related demand arising from fundraising activities and the southbound Stock Connects1, the Hong Kong dollar traded close to the strong-side CU at the beginning of the year.  Thereafter, the Hong Kong dollar weakened amid stock market correction and repatriation of initial public offering (IPO) proceeds by some newly listed firms before rebounding slightly in the second quarter due to corporates’ dividend payment needs and net inflows from the southbound Stock Connects.  Stepping into the second half of the year, while the Hong Kong dollar drifted lower amid softened equity market sentiment, it stayed mostly at the strong side of the Convertibility Zone and continued to trade in a smooth and orderly manner (Chart 1).  Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market functioned normally throughout 2021.\n\nChart 1 Market exchange rate in 2021\n\nAs the CUs were not triggered, the total of the Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs remained virtually unchanged at around HK$1,526.3 billion in 2021 (Chart 2). During the year, the HKMA issued a total of HK$80 billion additional Exchange Fund Bills to meet the ongoing demand for Exchange Fund paper by banks amid the abundance of liquidity in the banking system, which led to a contraction of the Aggregate Balance from HK$457.5 billion at the end of 2020 to HK$377.5 billion at the end of 2021.\n\nReflecting the additional issuance of Exchange Fund Bills and the issuance of EFBNs to absorb EFBNs’ interest payments according to the established practice, the outstanding EFBNs increased from HK$1,069.2 billion to HK$1,148.8 billion during the year.  The Monetary Base as a whole remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\n# HK$1,526.3 billion\n\nTotal Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs\n\nChart 2 Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding Exchange Fund papers in 2021\n\n# Money market\n\nWith the sizeable Aggregate Balance, the Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained largely stable at low levels throughout the year (Chart 3).  While the demand for the Hong Kong dollar increased along with the IPO activities during the first quarter, Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs) of various tenors saw little fluctuations.  Thereafter, HIBORs remained largely stable despite concerns about the pace of US monetary tightening.  Towards the end of 2021, HIBORs witnessed mild pick-ups, partly reflecting anticipated funding needs towards the year end.  On the retail front, banks kept their Best Lending Rates unchanged.  Overall, Hong Kong’s money markets continued to function normally.  Discount Window borrowing decreased to HK$6.8 billion in 2021 from HK$9.1 billion in 2020.\n\nChart 3 Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates in 2021\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nThe Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has been a strong anchor of Hong Kong’s financial system for more than three decades and has shown its strength and resilience to challenges.  Despite lingering uncertainties surrounding global economic recovery, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to function in an orderly manner, reflecting the robustness of the LERS.  The Government is firmly committed to the LERS.  In its 2021 External Sector Report, the International Monetary Fund once again reiterated that the credibility of the LERS has been assured by a transparent set of rules, ample fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nA robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS.  Hong Kong’s banking sector continued to operate smoothly with liquidity positions and capitalisation faring very well by international standards.  To ensure resilience of the banking sector, the HKMA has been closely monitoring banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and has maintained its supervisory efforts on bank lending.\n\nTo improve transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998.  The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) moved within a range of 109.8–110.5% during 2021, without touching the Upper or the Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 110.2% on 31 December (Chart 4). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate.  The ample financial resources of the Exchange Fund, together with the sound banking system, provide a powerful backstop to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nChart 4 Daily movement of the Backing Ratio in 2021\n\n# Currency Board Sub-Committee\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong.  In 2021, the CBC considered issues, including an assessment of inflation in the US, implications of the US dollar depreciation on Hong Kong, assessment of the taper tantrum risk and its impact on Hong Kong, and understanding the influence of Mainland-related fund flows on monetary conditions in Hong Kong.  Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and reports on the Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Notes and coins\n\nAt the end of 2021, the total value of banknotes issued by note-issuing banks in circulation was HK$592.6 billion, an increase of 5.9% from a year earlier (Charts 5, 6 and 7). The total value of Government-issued notes and coins in circulation amounted to HK$12.9 billion at the end of 2021, up 1.7% year on year (Charts 8 and 9).\n\n# HK$592.6 billion, +5.9%\n\nTotal value of banknotes issued by note-issuing banks\n\n# HK$12.9 billion, +1.7%\n\nTotal value of notes and coins issued by Government\n\n# Chart 5\n\nBanknotes in circulation by note-issuing banks at the end of 2021\n\n# Chart 6 \n\nDistribution of banknotes in circulation at the end of 2021\n\n# Hong Kong banknotes\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA arranged 14 seminars for more than 4,000 participants, including professionals in the banking and retail industries as well as students, to help enhance their knowledge and skills in differentiating between authentic and counterfeit banknotes.  These public education programmes on the design and security features of Hong Kong banknotes are well received.\n\n# Coin Collection Programme\n\nThe Coin Collection Programme continued to be well received by the public.  More information about the Programme can be found in the Sustainability chapter on page 198.\n\n# Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\n\nThe EFBN Programme continued to operate smoothly. To meet the ongoing demand for Exchange Fund paper by banks amid the abundance of liquidity in the banking system, the HKMA issued a total of HK$80 billion additional Exchange Fund Bills in the second half of 2021.  The additional issuance resulted in a corresponding reduction of the Aggregate Balance.  At the end of 2021, the nominal amount of outstanding Exchange Fund papers stood at HK$1,148.6 billion (Table 2).\n\nTable 2 Outstanding issues of Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\n\n# Monetary research\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMR)  maintained a steady research output in 2021 despite the ongoing pandemic.  During the year, the HKIMR released 30 working papers and held nine webinars, which encompassed a wide range of topics including monetary policy, banking stability, market microstructure and financial technology (fintech) development.  The HKIMR also organised an international conference and a webinar in hybrid format.\n\nThe webinar, titled RMB Exchange Rate Formation Mechanism and Exchange Rate Outlook, was co-organised with the Hong Kong Academy of Finance on 17 August.  It was live-streamed on a number of online platforms and attracted a total of over 1.16 million real-time views.\n\nThe 11th Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy, titled On the Path to Common Prosperity: China’s Economic Development in Dual Circulation, was held on 11 November.  The conference discussed recent policy developments related to common prosperity, dual circulation, anti-monopoly regulations, property market, Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect and financial developments in the Greater Bay Area5.  Expert speakers also presented in-depth analyses on the impact of population ageing and the sustainability of social security funds, as well as China’s contribution to global financial stability and world economy.  The six different sessions of the conference attracted over 3,200 online and on-site viewers, totaling 5,900 views.\n\n","terms":{"12-month expected credit losses":["12個月預期信用虧損"],"2022–23

目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的首要目標是維持貨幣穩定。貨幣穩定被定義為港元在國際外匯市場上對美元的匯率維持在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的波動範圍內。香港的貨幣體系結構以貨幣發行局制度為特徵，要求貨幣基礎至少有100%由外匯基金持有的美元儲備作為支持，並要求貨幣基礎的任何變動必須與美元儲備的相應變動完全匹配。\n\n# 貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n\n負債證明書，為三家發鈔銀行所發行銀行紙幣提供十足擔保；政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣；總結餘，即存放在金管局的結算戶口結餘；以及金管局代表政府發行的外匯基金票據及債券。\n\n港元匯率的穩定性透過自動利率調節機制，以及金管局堅定履行兌換保證的承諾來維持。當強方（或弱方）兌換保證被觸發時，金管局隨時準備以每美元7.75（或7.85）港元的匯率，向銀行買入（或賣出）港元，總結餘將擴張（或收縮），以壓低（或推高）港元利率，從而將港元匯率推回至7.75至7.85的兌換範圍內。\n\n# 2021年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定性\n\n受集資活動及南向「港股通」所引發的股票相關需求推動，年初港元匯率接近強方兌換率。其後，由於股市調整及部分新上市公司的新股集資資金回流，港元匯率一度走弱，但於第二季因公司派息需求及南向「港股通」淨流入資金而小幅反彈。踏入年中，雖然市場氣氛趨弱令港元匯率走低，但匯率仍大致維持於兌換範圍的強方，並持續以平穩有序的方式交易（圖1）。整體而言，2021年港元匯率市場運作平穩。\n\n圖表 1：2021年市場匯率\n\n由於未有觸發兌換保證，總結餘及未償還的外匯基金票據及債券總額在2021年幾乎維持不變，約為港元1,526.3億元（圖2）。年內，金管局共發行額外港元800億元外匯基金票據，以滿足銀行體系充裕的流動資金對外匯基金票據的持續需求，導致總結餘由2020年末的港元457.5億元減少至2021年末的港元377.5億元。\n\n反映根據既定慣例發行外匯基金票據及債券以吸納外匯基金票據的利息支付，以及額外發行外匯基金票據，外匯基金票據及債券的未償餘額在年內由港元1,069.2億元增加至港元1,148.8億元。整體貨幣基礎完全由外匯儲備支持。\n\n# 港元一千五百二十六點三億元\n\n總結餘及未償還的外匯基金票據及債券\n\n圖表 2 總結餘（未計貼現窗）及 2021 年未償餘額外匯基金票據\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n憑藉龐大的總結餘，港元銀行同業拆息全年在低水平上大致保持穩定（圖表3）。雖然第一季首次公開招股活動帶動了對港元的需求增加，但各期限的香港銀行同業拆息並未出現大幅波動。此後，儘管市場對美國收緊貨幣政策的速度感到擔憂，香港銀行同業拆息仍大致保持穩定。在2021年末，香港銀行同業拆息略有上升，部分反映了對年底資金需求的預期。在零售方面，銀行維持最優惠貸款利率不變。總體而言，香港的貨幣市場持續正常運作。貼現窗借貸在2021年減少至68億港元，較2020年的91億港元減少。\n\n圖表3 2021年港元銀行同業拆息\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）已是香港金融體系逾三十年來的堅實支柱，並在應對挑戰中展現其抗震能力。儘管全球經濟復甦仍存在不確定性，港元外匯及貨幣市場仍持續有序運作，反映聯匯制度的穩健性。政府堅定支持聯匯制度。在2021年對外部門報告中，國際貨幣基金組織再次指出，聯匯制度的可信度源於一套透明的規則、充足的財政及外匯儲備、強大的金融監管與監督、靈活的經濟以及審慎的財政架構。\n\n穩健的銀行體系對聯匯制度的正常運作至關重要。香港銀行業持續穩步運作，流動性水平及資本充足情況在國際標準下表現優異。為確保銀行體系的抗震能力，金管局一直密切監察銀行對信用、流動性及利率風險的管理情況及壓力測試結果，並持續加強對銀行貸款的監管工作。\n\n為提高貨幣發行局帳目的透明度，自一九九八年十月起，已將特定部分的外匯基金資產撥作支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（定義為支持資產除以貨幣基礎）在2021年期間在109.8–110.5%的範圍內波動，未觸及上限或下限。截至十二月三十一日，該比率報110.2%（圖4）。在聯匯制度下，雖然已指定特定外匯基金資產作為支持組合，但所有外匯基金資產均可支持香港的匯率。外匯基金充裕的財政資源，以及穩健的銀行體系，為香港的貨幣和金融穩定提供了強大的後盾。\n\n圖表4 2021年支持比率的每日變動\n\n# 貨幣發行委員會\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會的貨幣發行委員會（貨幣發行委員會）監察及審視與香港貨幣及金融穩定相關的議題。於2021年，貨幣發行委員會審議了多項議題，包括評估美國的通貨膨脹、美元貶值對香港的影響、評估「縮減恐慌」風險及其對香港的影響，以及了解內地相關的資金流對香港貨幣狀況的影響。貨幣發行委員會就這些議題的討論記錄，以及提交予貨幣發行委員會的貨幣發行局運作報告，均已於金管局網站發佈。\n\n# 紙鈔與硬幣\n\n截至2021年底，發鈔銀行發行的銀行紙幣總值為港元592.6億，較一年前上升5.9%（見圖表5、6及7）。截至2021年底，政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣總值為港元12.9億，按年上升1.7%（見圖表8及9）。\n\n# 港元五千九百二十六億，上升百分之五點九。\n\n發鈔銀行所發行的銀行紙幣總價值\n\n# 港元129億, +1.7%\n\n政府發行的紙幣和硬幣的總價值\n\n#

硬幣收集計劃\n\n硬幣收集計劃繼續受到公眾的歡迎。更多關於該計劃的資訊，請參閱第198頁的「可持續發展」章節。\n\n# 外匯基金票據及債券\n\n「外匯基金票據及債券計劃」繼續順利運作。鑒於銀行體系流動性充裕，為應對銀行對外匯基金票據的持續需求，金管局於2021年下半年發行額外總值港元800億元的外匯基金票據。額外發行導致總結餘相應減少。截至2021年底，未償還外匯基金票據的名義總值為港元1,1486億元（見表2）。\n\n表 2 外匯基金票據及債券的未償餘額\n\n#

{"en":"# Banking Stability\n\nThe banking sector in Hong Kong remained sound and stable in 2021, despite the emergence of more contagious COVID-19 variants, causing uncertainty to global economic recovery.  During the year, the HKMA remained focused on the supervision of authorized institutions’ risk management.  Supervision of authorized institutions’ operational and cyber resilience was also stepped up in light of escalating cyber threats and accelerating digitalisation in the banking sector.\n\nOn conduct supervision, the HKMA provided guidance to banks to facilitate the use of non-face-to-face channels for distributing investment and insurance products, and worked with fellow regulators to formulate supervisory requirements on new products in the market such as insurance-linked securities and virtual assets.  The Code of Banking Practice was also revised to enhance consumer protection in digital financial services.\n\nIn the area of anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT), the HKMA’s priority has been to further strengthen banks’ gatekeeper role in the ecosystem and their ability to prevent and detect illicit fund flows associated with increases in online fraud, mule account networks and other financial crimes during the pandemic.  To increase protection for customer accounts against fraud and financial crimes, the HKMA scaled up collaboration and information sharing with other stakeholders via public-private partnerships.  While supporting remote customer on-boarding, the HKMA also encouraged adoption of other technologies including network analytics through the launch of the first AML Regtech Lab in November.  Internationally, proactive engagement has kept the HKMA at the forefront of global AML\/CFT efforts in the Financial Action Task Force.\n\nOn the development front, the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Pilot Scheme in the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area was launched smoothly in September.  During the year, the HKMA continued to execute its two-year roadmap for promoting Regtech adoption in Hong Kong.  Several initiatives were rolled out to lay the foundation for banks’ climate risk management and promote green and sustainable banking more broadly, as discussed in the Sustainability chapter. Further efforts were also made in the area of soft infrastructure, including promoting a customercentric corporate culture, as well as working with the banking industry to roll out capacity-building initiatives to facilitate talent development.\n\nMeanwhile, the HKMA has worked closely with the banking industry in optimising supervisory policies and processes. Good progress was made on implementing international supervisory standards locally, including those on capital adequacy and disclosure.  The HKMA continued to advance its work to ensure a credible resolution regime for authorized institutions, including developing new resolution standards and implementing rules on loss-absorbing capacity requirements to enhance authorized institutions’ resolvability.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system.  Achieving this objective is contingent upon a highly resilient financial system that is capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their businesses and, in extreme cases, by failing in a disorderly manner.  The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring that banks are resilient to shocks and able to recover their positions in crises, ultimately helping to prevent failures.  The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks and is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs).\n\nHowever, the Monetary Authority cannot ensure, nor is the Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework designed to ensure, a zero-risk financial system.  Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that, in the event of an AI becoming non-viable, its failure can be managed in an orderly manner.  To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong has been established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs, among other types of institutions.  To operationalise the resolution regime in Hong Kong, it is important to lay down resolution rules and policy standards, undertake resolution planning to remove impediments to AIs’ resolvability and develop the HKMA’s operational capability to resolve a failing AI.  In order to carry out these tasks effectively, the HKMA adopts an internationally harmonised and co-ordinated approach.\n\nThe Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs). In overseeing FMIs, the HKMA aims to promote their general safety and efficiency, limit systemic risk and foster transparency.  Making FMIs more resilient to financial crises protects the monetary and financial systems in Hong Kong from possible destabilising effects arising from disruption to the FMIs.  Information regarding the HKMA’s oversight approach is available on the HKMA website.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2021\n\n# Licensing\n\nAt the end of 2021, Hong Kong had:\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA granted two banking licences and one restricted bank licence to three non-local banks. The HKMA also granted a money broker approval to a foreign trading platform operator.  The authorizations of three licensed banks and two restricted licence banks were revoked during the year.\n\nMore information about the AIs and local representative offices in Hong Kong can be found in the Annex and Tables D to F on pages 321 to 324, and 330 to 333 respectively.\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nThe HKMA conducted 189 off-site reviews covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL rating assessment1, corporate governance, risk management and financial technology (fintech) strategies.  As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance, 40 meetings were held with the AIs’ boards of directors, independent non-executive directors or board-level committees.  A further 38 tripartite meetings were held among the HKMA, AIs and their external auditors.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA conducted regular on-site examinations supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk.  A total of 679 on-site examinations and thematic reviews were carried out during the year with credit risk management as a key focus. Amid growing adoption of technology by banks, management of operational risk and technology risk was another major area of attention.  The HKMA also increased the number of on-site examinations and thematic reviews targeting liquidity and market risk management.  In addition, specialist teams performed on-site examinations and thematic reviews of AIs’ activities in securities, investment products, insurance and mandatory provident fund (MPF)- related businesses, as well as their anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT) controls. Table 1 contains a summary of the HKMA’s supervisory activities in 2021.\n\n# Credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nTotal loans increased by 3.8% in 2021, compared with a growth of 1.2% in 2020.  Table 2 shows the breakdown of growth in loans and advances.\n\nMainland-related lending increased by 3.6% to HK$4,725 billion in 2021 (Table 3).\n\nThe asset quality of the banking sector remained largely stable during the year and stayed at a healthy level by both historical and international standards.  The classified loan ratio of the industry was 0.88% at the end of 2021, down from 0.90% at the end of 2020, well below the long-run historical average of 1.8% since 2000.  The ratio for Mainland-related lending also decreased to 0.86% from 0.96% a year ago.\n\nDuring the year, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to weigh on some sectors of the economy, while credit events in the Mainland property sector caught the attention of the market.  The HKMA enhanced the breadth and depth of its surveillance, with deep-dive reviews focused on banks’ exposures to highly leveraged borrowers. Close communication with banks has been maintained to facilitate up-to-date assessment of the impact of economic and market developments as well as the adequacy of banks’ risk management measures.  The overall credit risk facing the banking sector is assessed to be manageable.  The latest results of the HKMA’s solvency stress tests confirm that the banking sector continues to maintain sufficient capital buffers to withstand extreme stress.\n\nTargeted and thematic examinations were conducted during the year to evaluate AIs’ systems and controls over loan classification and loan loss provisioning, overseas lending operations, and collateralised lending to private banking and wealth management customers.\n\n# Alleviating cash-flow pressure faced by customers\n\nIn September, the HKMA and the Banking Sector Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) Lending Coordination Mechanism announced a six-month extension of the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme until the end of April 2022.  This scheme was first launched in May 2020 to defer loan principal payments of eligible corporate customers by six months.  In light of a resurgence of local coronavirus infections, in February 2022, the scheme was further extended until the end of October 2022.  In addition, the scheme was enhanced to offer a one-year partial principal repayment option to those customers who are financially capable and willing to resume principal repayment gradually.\n\nBy the end of December 2021, banks had approved loan tenor extensions and other forms of relief in over 83,000 cases, involving an aggregate amount of over HK$920 billion. For personal customers, banks had approved more than 52,000 cases of principal payment holidays for residential mortgages and other personal relief loans, amounting to over HK$53 billion.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nThe successive rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures introduced by the HKMA since 2009 have strengthened banks’ risk management and the banking sector’s resilience to a possible abrupt downturn in the local property market.  The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of new residential mortgage loans (RMLs) approved in December 2021 was 53%, compared with 64% in September 2009 before the countercyclical measures were first introduced.  The average debt servicing ratio (DSR) of new mortgages remained low at 36% in December 2021, compared with 41% in August 2010, when a cap on DSR was first applied (Chart 1).\n\n# Operational and technology risks\n\nIn light of banks’ increasing reliance on technology to support their operations, the HKMA stepped up supervision of operational and technology risks.  Key supervisory focuses during the year included controls over cloud outsourcing and remote working arrangements.  The HKMA launched an industry consultation in December on a draft new Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module on “Operational Resilience”. The new SPM module seeks to provide guidance to banks on developing a holistic and integrated operational resilience framework.\n\nThe HKMA introduced the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 in January to reflect the latest sound practices on cyber security risk management.  During the year, the HKMA monitored AIs’ implementation of the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 and reviewed their cyber resilience capabilities.  In view of the growing risk of destructive cyber-attacks, in May, the HKMA requested all AIs to critically assess the need for a secure tertiary data backup, taking reference from the Secure Tertiary Data Backup Guideline issued by the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB).\n\nIn response to heightened risks and rising numbers of phishing attacks, the HKMA worked closely with the industry to strengthen the security of internet and mobile banking services.  A large-scale joint HKMA-HKAB public awareness campaign, themed “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!” began in July (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 Raising public awareness of phishing attacks\n\nSlogan icon for the public awareness campaign themed “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!”\n\n# Liquidity and market risks\n\nTo enhance monitoring of AIs’ liquidity risk exposures, the HKMA introduced additional scenarios into its liquidity stress testing framework to evaluate AIs’ ability to cope with liquidity shocks over a prolonged period.\n\nDuring the year, thematic reviews were conducted to assess the adequacy of AIs’ liquidity stress testing programmes and evaluate the sufficiency of their monitoring metrics and control limits for managing liquidity risk.  The HKMA also carried out reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of AIs’ market risk management frameworks for debt securities investments and operational controls over treasury activities.\n\nThe HKMA closely monitored AIs’ progress in preparing for the transition away from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR).  It collaborated with industry associations and developed tools to assist AIs in supporting their customers’ migration to alternative reference rates, including a leaflet to raise corporates’ awareness of the transition and an information note on options available in the loan markets to replace US dollar LIBOR.  AIs have substantially remediated contracts referencing LIBOR settings which ceased to be published after the end of 2021.  They were reminded not to enter into new LIBOR contracts from 1 January 2022 onwards.\n","terms":{"12-month expected credit losses":["12個月預期信用虧損"],"2022–23 Budget":["2022至23年度財政預算案"],"24\/7

銀行體系穩定\n\n儘管出現更具傳播力的新冠病毒變異株，導致全球經濟復甦不確定性增加，香港銀行業在2021年仍保持穩健及穩定。當年，金管局持續關注對認可機構風險管理的監管。鑒於網絡威脅加劇及銀行業數碼化加速，對認可機構運作穩健性及網絡防衛能力的監管亦進一步加強。\n\n在操守監管方面，金管局向銀行提供指引，以促進透過非面對面方式發放投資及保險產品，並與其他監管機構合作，制定針對市場上新產品（例如保險相連證券及虛擬資產）的監管規定。同時，銀行業行為守則亦經修訂，以加強數碼金融服務中的消費者保障。\n\n在打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集方面，金管局的首要任務是進一步加強銀行在生態系統中的守門人角色，以及它們防止和偵測與疫情期間網上騙案、傀儡戶口網絡和其他金融犯罪相關的不法資金流動的能力。為了提高客戶帳戶免受詐騙和金融犯罪的保護，金管局透過公私營夥伴關係，加強了與其他利益相關者的合作和訊息共享。在支持遙距開戶的同時，金管局也鼓勵採用其他技術，包括網絡分析，並於十一月推出首個反洗錢合規科技實驗室。在國際層面，積極參與使金管局在財務行動特別組織的全球打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集工作方面保持領先地位。\n\n在發展方面，粵港澳大灣區的粵港澳大灣區跨境理財通業務試點於九月順利啟動。當年，金管局繼續執行推動香港合規科技的採用的兩年計劃。推出多項措施，為銀行的氣候風險管理奠定基礎，並更廣泛地推動綠色及可持續銀行業，詳見可持續發展一章。在軟實力方面也作出了進一步努力，包括推動以客戶為本的企業文化，以及與銀行業合作推出措施培訓人才，以促進人才發展。\n\n金管局同時與銀行業密切合作，優化監管政策和流程。 在本地實施國際監管標準方面取得了良好進展，包括資本充足水平和披露方面的標準。 金管局繼續推進其工作，以確保為認可機構建立可信的處置機制，包括制定新的處置標準，並實施有關吸收虧損能力的規定，從而提升認可機構的處置可行性。\n\n# 目標\n\n金管局的總體目標是促進銀行體系的安全與穩定。要實現此目標，需要一個高度穩健的金融體系，為香港經濟提供關鍵金融服務。\n\n銀行透過其業務運作方式，甚至在極端情況下通過混亂倒閉，可能影響系統的穩定性。金融管理專員作為監管機構，在維護金融穩定方面發揮著關鍵作用，透過確保銀行能夠抵禦衝擊並在危機中恢復其地位，最終有助於防止破產。金融管理專員負責對銀行進行審慎監管，並負責授權香港的持牌銀行、有限制牌照銀行和接受存款公司，這些機構統稱為認可機構。\n\n然而，金融管理專員不能保證，亦非香港的審慎監管框架旨在保證一個零風險的金融體系。相反，金融管理專員作為處置機制當局，致力於確保，倘若認可機構出現非可行情況，其破產可以有秩序地處理。為此，香港已建立適用於金融機構的處置機制，其中金融管理專員是認可機構等不同類型機構的處置機制當局。為了有效實施香港的處置機制，制定處置規則和政策標準、進行處置規劃以消除影響認可機構處置可行性的障礙，以及發展金管局的運作能力以處置陷入困境的認可機構至關重要。為了有效執行這些任務，金管局採取國際協調一致的方法。\n\n金管局亦負責指定及監管若干金融市場基建。在監管金融市場基建時，金管局旨在促進其整體安全及效率，限制系統性風險，並提升透明度。增強金融市場基建對金融危機的韌性，有助保護香港的貨幣及金融體系免受金融市場基建中斷可能造成的不穩定影響。有關金管局監管方法的資料，可於金管局網站上查閱。\n\n# 2021年回顧\n\n# 發牌\n\n截至2021年底，香港擁有：\n\n本年，金管局向三家非本地銀行發出兩張銀行牌照及一張有限制牌照銀行牌照。金管局亦向一家外資交易平台營運機構發出貨幣經紀批准。金管局於本年撤銷三家持牌銀行及兩家有限制牌照銀行的牌照。\n\n有關認可機構及香港本地代表辦事處的更多資料，可在附錄及表D至F（第321至324頁）和第330至333頁分別找到。\n\n# 監督活動概覽\n\n金管局進行了涵蓋廣泛議題的189項離地審查，包括CAMEL評估、企業管治、風險管理以及金融科技（金融科技）策略。作為金管局持續加強風險管治的努力的一部分，與認可機構的董事局、獨立非執行董事或董事層級委員會舉行了40次會議。此外，金管局、認可機構及其外聘核數師之間還舉行了38次三方會議。\n\n除了場外活動外，金管局還定期進行現場審查，並針對評估為較高風險的範疇進行專題評估。年內共進行了679次現場審查和專題評估，重點關注信用風險管理。 隨著銀行採用科技日益普及，業務操作風險和科技風險的管理成為另一個主要關注領域。金管局亦增加了針對流動性及市場風險管理的現場審查和專題評估次數。此外，專項審查小組對認可機構在證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（強積金）相關業務中的活動，以及其打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集控制措施進行了現場審查和專題評估。表1載列了金管局於2021年的監理活動摘要。\n\n# 信用風險\n\n#信貸增長與資產質素\n\n貸款總額在2021年較2020年增長3.8%，而2020年的貸款增長率為1.2%。表2顯示了貸款和信貸增長的細節。\n\n內地相關貸款額在2021年增加3.6%，達到4,7250億港元（表3）。\n\n銀行業的資產質素在年內大致保持穩定，並在長期平均水平及國際標準下維持健康水平。截至2021年底，業界的特定分類貸款比率為0.88%，較2020年底的0.90%有所下降，遠低於自2000年以來的長期平均水平1.8%。與內地相關的貸款比率也從一年前的0.96%下降至0.86%。\n\n年內，新冠病毒疫情持續對經濟的某些領域造成壓力，同時內地房地產行業的信貸事件也引起市場關注。金管局擴展了監察的廣度和深度，重點深入審視銀行對高槓桿借款人的信用風險。金管局與銀行保持密切溝通，以協助進行經濟和市場發展影響的最新評估，以及銀行風險管理的充分性。整體而言，銀行業面臨的信用風險被評估為可控。金管局最新償債壓力測試的結果確認，銀行業持續保持足夠的資本緩衝，以應對極端壓力。\n\n本年度針對特定主題進行審查，以評估認可機構對貸款分類及貸款虧損準備金、海外貸款業務及對私人銀行及財富管理客戶的有抵押貸款所實施的系統與控制。\n\n# 緩解客戶面臨的現金流壓力\n\n九月份，金管局與銀行業中小企貸款協調機制宣布將預先批核還息不還本計劃延長六個月，至二零二二年四月底。此計劃於二零二零年五月首次推出，旨在為合資格的企業客戶延期六個月的貸款本金。鑑於本地新冠病毒感染再次反覆，於二零二二年二月，該計劃進一步延長至二零二二年十月底。此外，該計劃亦已優化，為有財政能力並願意逐步恢復貸款本金償還的客戶提供一年期的部分本金償還選項。\n\n截至2021年12月底，銀行已批准逾83,000宗個案的貸款展期及其他形式的紓困措施，涉及總額超過港幣9200億元。就個人客戶而言，銀行已批准逾52,000宗住宅按揭貸款及其他個人應急貸款的本金寬限期，總額超過港幣530億元。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n金管局自2009年起引入的幾輪逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施，已加強了銀行業的風險管理，以及銀行體系對本地物業市場可能出現突如其來的下滑的抗震能力。截至2021年12月批准的新住宅按揭貸款（住宅按揭貸款）的平均按揭成數為53%，與2009年9月首次引入逆周期措施前的64%相比，已大幅降低。截至2021年12月的新按揭的平均供款與入息比率仍然維持在36%的低水平，與2010年8月首次應用供款與入息比率市值上限時的41%相比（圖1）。\n\n# 業務操作及科技風險\n\n鑒於銀行對科技日益依賴以支持其運作，金管局加強了對業務操作及科技風險的監管。今年的重點監管範疇包括對外判予雲端服務及遙距工作安排的控制。金管局於十二月就一份擬議的「運作穩健性」監管政策手冊（SPM）新模塊展開業界諮詢。新SPM模塊旨在為銀行提供指引，協助其建立一個全面且整合的運作穩健性綜合架構。\n\n金管局於一月推出《網絡防衛評估框架2.0》，以反映最新的良好做法於網絡風險管理。期間，金管局監察認可機構實施《網絡防衛評估框架2.0》，並審閱其網絡防衛能力。鑒於破壞性網絡攻擊的風險日益增加，金管局於五月要求所有認可機構嚴格評估三重數據備份的需求，並參考香港銀行公會發布的《穩固三重數據備份指引》。\n\n鑑於風險升高及網絡釣魚攻擊數目不斷上升，金管局與業界緊密合作，加強網上及流動銀行服務的安全性。一項大型的金管局與香港銀行公會聯合公眾意識宣傳活動，主題為「保護您的個人數碼鎖匙；謹防詐騙連結！」，於七月展開（圖1）。\n\n圖一 提高公眾對網絡釣魚攻擊的認識\n\n保護您的個人數碼鎖匙；謹防詐騙連結！公眾意識宣傳活動標語圖示\n\n# 流動性及市場風險\n\n為加強對認可機構流動性風險敞口的監測，金管局在其流動性壓力測試框架中引入額外情景，以評估認可機構應對長期流動性衝擊的能力。\n\n當年，金管局進行了專題評估，以評估認可機構流動性壓力測試計劃的充足性，並評估其監控指標及控制限額在管理流動性風險方面的充分性。金管局亦進行審查，以評估認可機構針對債券投資的市場風險管理架構，以及財資業務營運控制的有效性。\n\n金管局密切監察認可機構為準備轉離倫敦銀行同業拆息的進度。金管局與業內公會合作，並開發工具協助認可機構支持其客戶轉移至備用參考利率，包括一份旨在提高企業意識的簡介，以及一份關於可用於取代美元倫敦銀行同業拆息的貸款市場選項的資訊備忘錄。認可機構已大幅修訂參考倫敦銀行同業拆息的合約，而這些利率在2021年底停止發佈。 認可機構被提醒自2022年1月1日起，不得再簽訂新的倫敦銀行同業拆息合約。\n"}
{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nDuring 2021, the HKMA achieved good progress in strengthening Hong Kong’s status as a globally competitive international financial centre through a multi-pronged approach.\n\nThe HKMA unveiled “Fintech 2025” strategy to promote the wide adoption of fintech by the financial sector and bolster Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub more broadly.  On the Faster Payment System, it has seen a surge in turnover during the year amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOn enhancing connectivity, significant progress was made during the year with the addition of the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect and Southbound Trading under Bond Connect to the suite of Connect schemes.  Thanks to its world-class market infrastructure and the Connect schemes, Hong Kong is the favoured platform for Mainland funds to tap into global markets and for international investors to access the fast-growing Mainland markets.\n\nAlso during 2021, the HKMA devoted significant efforts in creating new business opportunities to strengthen the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, in areas including bond issuance, asset and wealth management, corporate treasury centres, and green and sustainable finance.  To promote Hong Kong’s financial services, the HKMA stepped up market outreach to overseas and Mainland stakeholders to keep them informed about the resilience of Hong Kong’s financial system and the prospects it presents.\n\nMeanwhile, the HKMA is active in international and regional central banking and regulatory forums, contributing to global efforts in maintaining financial stability and promoting financial market developments.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nThe HKMA announced its “Fintech 2025” strategy, covering a series of initiatives to promote wide adoption of financial technology (fintech) and strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia.  The HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO), together with the banking departments, played a pivotal role in driving various key initiatives during the year including the following:\n\n- Promoting regulatory technology (Regtech) adoption\n- Rolling out the Tech Baseline Assessment to understand banks' adoption of fintech\n\nHong Kong’s position as an offshore renminbi hub remained firm, with offshore renminbi businesses registering robust growth during the year.  Inflows into renminbi assets continued to gather pace as the inclusion of onshore securities in major financial market indices continued. Hong Kong plays an indispensable role in facilitating international investors’ increased allocation to renminbi assets, with the Mainland–Hong Kong Connect schemes being widely accepted as the channels of choice for international investors to access onshore capital markets. In 2021, daily turnover under Northbound Bond Connect increased 34% to around RMB25.8 billion.\n\nFollowing the success of Northbound Bond Connect, Southbound Bond Connect was launched in September, completing the two-way connection between the Mainland and international bond markets.  In the same month, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), the HKMA and the Monetary Authority of Macao promulgated the implementation details for the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Crossboundary WMC) Scheme in the Guangdong–Hong Kong– Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA).  In October, eligible banks in Hong Kong started providing Cross-boundary WMC services together with their Mainland partner banks.\n\n\n\nTo enhance Hong Kong’s role as a key offshore renminbi centre, a working group comprising the HKMA, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) was formed to conduct a feasibility study on promoting trading of renminbi-denominated equity securities in Hong Kong.  A joint seminar was also co-organised by the PBoC and the HKMA in December, showcasing Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre and a leading renminbi business hub.\n\nThe HKMA continues to make progress towards strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform.  In particular, to increase Hong Kong’s appeal as a preferred fund domicile, the HKMA worked closely with the Government and the financial industry to provide a more facilitating tax and regulatory environment for fund formation.  Significant strides were also made in further elevating Hong Kong’s position as a regional green and sustainable finance hub, and as a bond issuance centre. At the same time, the HKMA stepped up market outreach to promote Hong Kong’s financial services to overseas and Mainland stakeholders.\n\nSafe and efficient operation of financial infrastructure is fundamental for reinforcing Hong Kong’s position as a leading international financial centre.  In 2021, the four interbank Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) and the Hong Kong Trade Repository achieved 100%1 system availability, outperforming the target of 99.95%.  Following the launch of Southbound Bond Connect in September, the CMU became the settlement and custodian service provider for transactions conducted under both Northbound and Southbound Bond Connect.\n\nAdoption of the FPS continued to expand in 2021. The number of registrations grew to 9.6 million at the end of 2021 and the average daily turnover for the year rose by 90% from 2020.  Increased use of the FPS for settling Government bills, making merchant payments and topping up stored value facility (SVF) e-wallets or bank accounts were the key drivers for the continued rise in transaction volume, on top of a steady growth in person-to-person and business payments.\n\nTo promote the safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA oversees six designated retail payment systems (RPSs) and supervises 15 licensed SVFs under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO).  During the year, the HKMA facilitated the smooth implementation of the Government’s Consumption Voucher Scheme by co-ordinating and promoting dialogues and co-operation between the relevant Government parties and the SVF licensees appointed for the scheme.\n\nIn January 2022, the HKMA issued a discussion paper on crypto-assets and stablecoins, setting out the HKMA’s thinking on the relevant regulatory approach and inviting views from stakeholders.  Relevant factors, including feedback to this discussion paper and recommendations of relevant international bodies, will be taken into account when drawing up the appropriate regulatory regime.\n\nInternationally, the HKMA is an active member of the central banking community and plays a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees.  For example, the HKMA chairs the Working Group on Financial Markets (WGFM) established under the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP)2.  The HKMA also co-chairs the Policy and Standards Group of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), the Non-Bank Monitoring Experts Group and the Financial Innovation Network of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), and leads a team that looks into supervisory issues associated with financial benchmark transition.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2021\n\n# Hong Kong as a fintech hub in Asia\n\n# Fintech 2025\n\nIn June, the HKMA unveiled its “Fintech 2025” strategy to drive fintech development in Hong Kong.  The strategy aims to encourage the financial sector to adopt technology comprehensively by 2025, as well as to promote the provision of fair and efficient financial services for the benefit of Hong Kong citizens and the economy.  The five focus areas of the strategy are:\n\n- All banks go fintech\n- Future-proofing Hong Kong for CBDCs\n- Creating the next-generation data infrastructure\n- Expanding the fintech-savvy workforce\n- Nurturing the ecosystem with funding and policies\n\nThe HKMA’s “Fintech 2025” strategy drives fintech development in Hong Kong\n\n# Fintech Adoption in the Banking Sector\n\nTo support the “All banks go fintech” initiative of the “Fintech 2025” strategy, the HKMA rolled out the Tech Baseline Assessment in June 2021.  The assessment aims to help the HKMA develop a better understanding of the current fintech landscape in the banking sector, and identify which fintech areas may warrant the HKMA’s support.  All licensed banks with significant operations in Hong Kong were requested to develop a three-year plan for fintech adoption by the end of 2021.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA also continued to implement its two-year roadmap to promote Regtech adoption by banks in Hong Kong, and incorporate technology in its own supervisory processes to improve efficiency and effectiveness.  See page 98 of the Banking Stability chapter for more details.\n\n# Wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency\n\nThe HKMA and the Bank of Thailand expanded the scope of their joint research project with the joining of the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates and the Digital Currency Institute of the PBoC in February 2021.  Renamed as “Multiple Central Bank Digital Currency Bridge (mBridge)” and strongly supported by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Innovation Hub Centre in Hong Kong, the project further explores the capabilities of distributed ledger technology to facilitate real-time cross-border foreign exchange payment-versus-payment (PvP) transactions in a multi-jurisdictional context and on a 24\/7 basis.  A joint report was published in September to deliver the interim findings, followed by the publication of potential use cases and a future roadmap in November.\n\n# Retail Central Bank Digital Currency\n\nTo future-proof Hong Kong in terms of CBDC readiness, the HKMA started a study on the prospect of issuing retail CBDC in Hong Kong, i.e. e-HKD, covering both technical and policy considerations.  In collaboration with the BIS Innovation Hub Centre in Hong Kong, the HKMA embarked on a study called Project Aurum to explore the technical aspect of issuing retail CBDC.  Separately, an internal cross-departmental working group was set up to study the relevant technical, policy and legal issues.  In October, the HKMA released a technical white paper titled e-HKD: A technical perspective to explore and invite comments on potential technical design options for issuing and distributing retail CBDC.\n\nFurthermore, the HKMA supports the Digital Currency Institute of the PBoC on the technical pilot testing of using e-CNY for cross-boundary payments.  This will help promote interconnection in the GBA and bring greater convenience to Hong Kong and Mainland tourists by enhancing the efficiency and user experience of cross-boundary payments.\n\n# Commercial Data Interchange\n\nIn July, the HKMA hosted a virtual symposium to encourage banks and SVF operators to join the CDI, a next-generation financial data infrastructure that aims to enable more efficient financial intermediation in the banking system.  To further facilitate development and adoption, the launch of the CDI Innovation Hub was announced during the symposium. To facilitate small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) financing, the HKMA completed two phases of proof-of-concept study examining the technical feasibility of the CDI.  Applying alternative data to facilitate credit assessment and the underwriting of loans, more than 550 SME loans exceeding HK$900 million in total were approved by the participating banks during the study.  Based on the encouraging results, the HKMA announced the pilot launch of the CDI in November.\n\nSME owners commend the CDI for streamlining their loan applications\n\n# Talent development\n\nTo expand the fintech talent pool, the HKMA continued to run the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme 2.0 in collaboration with its strategic partners3 to nurture young talent at various stages of their career development. More than 180 students benefitted from the scheme in 2021. Separately, the Industry Project Masters Network scheme was piloted in September to provide opportunities for master’s degree students majoring in fintech to work on real-life fintech projects.  To form strategic partnerships and foster collaboration in areas including fintech talent development, the HKMA entered into memorandums of understanding (MoUs) with four local universities in October.\n\nMr Colin Pou (middle), Executive Director (Financial Infrastructure) of HKMA, at the MoU signing ceremony with four local universities\n\n# Fintech Supervisory Sandbox\n\nThe use of Fintech Supervisory Sandbox (FSS) continued to rise during the year.  As of end-December 2021, a total of 234 pilot trials of fintech initiatives had been allowed in the FSS since its launch in 2016, compared with 193 as of end-2020.  As of end-December 2021, the HKMA had also received in total 666 requests to access the FSS Chatroom for supervisory feedback at the early stage of fintech projects since the introduction of the Chatroom in 2017.  Over 63% of the Chatroom requests were made by technology firms (tech firms) .\n","terms":{"12-month expected credit losses":["12個月預期信用虧損"],"2022–23 Budget":["2022至23年度財政預算案"],"24\/7

的地位方面取得了良好進展。\n\n香港金融管理局（金管局）推出了「金融科技2025」策略，以推動金融界廣泛採用金融科技，並進一步鞏固香港作為金融科技樞紐的地位。在轉數快系統方面，儘管受到新冠病毒疫情的影響，今年的交易量仍出現顯著增長。\n\n在提升連通性方面，今年取得了重大進展，包括在債券通框架下新增跨境財富管理通和南向通，進一步豐富了連通機制的體系。得益於其世界一流的市場基礎設施和連通機制，香港成為內地資金投資全球市場的首選平台，也是國際投資者進入快速發展的內地市場的首選渠道。\n\n此外，在2021年，金管局致力於創造新的商業機會，以加強香港金融平台的競爭力，重點領域包括債券發行、資產及財富管理、企業財資中心以及綠色和可持續金融。為推動香港的金融服務，金管局加大了對海外及內地利益相關方的市場推廣力度，讓他們了解香港金融體系的抗震能力及其發展前景。\n\n在此同時，金管局積極參與國際和區域中央銀行及監管組織的工作，為維持金融穩定和促進市場發展貢獻力量。\n\n# 概覽\n\n金管局宣布其「金融科技2025」策略，涵蓋一系列舉措以促進金融科技的廣泛採用，並鞏固香港在亞洲作為金融科技樞紐的地位。 金管局金融科技促進辦公室，與銀行部門共同推動本年度多項關鍵舉措，包括以下內容：\n\n推動合規科技的應用\n推行金融科技應用評估，以了解銀行對金融科技的應用情況。\n\n香港作為離岸人民幣樞紐的地位依然穩固，離岸人民幣業務在當年實現了強勁增長。隨著在岸證券持續被納入主要金融市場指數，資金流入人民幣資產的速度不斷加快。香港在協助國際投資者增加配置人民幣資產方面發揮不可或缺的作用，內地與香港之間各個互聯互通平台被廣泛視為國際投資者進入在岸資本市場的首選渠道。2021年，北向債券通的日均交易量增加34%，達到約人民幣258億元。\n\n繼北向債券通成功運作後，南向債券通於九月啟動，完成了內地與國際債市的雙向連通。同年同月，中國人民銀行（人民銀行）、金管局及澳門金融管理局聯合公布在廣東–香港–澳門大灣區（大灣區）推行跨境理財通（跨境理財通）計劃的實施細則。十月，香港符合資格的銀行與其內地合作銀行一同開始提供跨境理財通服務。\n\n\n\n為提升香港作為離岸人民幣中心的地位，金管局、證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）及香港交易及結算所有限公司（港交所）組成工作小組，就於香港推廣人民幣計價股票交易的可行性進行研究。人民銀行與金管局亦於十二月合辦了一場研討會，展示香港作為國際金融中心及領先人民幣業務樞紐的地位。\n\n金管局持續推動強化香港金融平台競爭力的工作。特別是為提升香港作為優先基金註冊地的吸引力，金管局與政府及金融業密切合作，為基金設立提供更有利的稅務及監管環境。同時，香港在提升其作為區內綠色和可持續金融樞紐及發債中心的定位方面亦取得顯著進展。同時，金管局加強市場拓展，向海外及內地利益相關方推廣香港的金融服務。\n\n確保金融基建的安全及高效運作，對強化香港作為國際金融中心的地位至關重要。2021年，四個銀行間即時支付結算（RTGS系統）、債務工具中央結算系統（CMU系統）及香港交易資料儲存庫達成100%系統可供使用率，超越99.95%的目標。隨着南向債券通於9月推出，CMU系統成為北向及南向債券通交易的結算及託管服務提供者。\n\n轉數快的使用於2021年持續擴展。截至2021年底，登記數目增至960萬，全年平均每日交易量較2020年上升90%。 轉數快用於支付政府帳單、商戶支付以及為儲值支付工具電子錢包或銀行帳戶充值，加上個人對個人及商業支付的穩定增長，共同推動了成交量持續上升。\n\n為促進本地零售支付業的安全及效率，金管局監察六個指定零售支付系統（零售支付系統）並根據支付系統及儲值支付工具條例（支付條例）對十五個儲值支付工具持牌人進行監察。 於本年度，金管局協調各相關政府部門，並促進行業與政府電子消費券計劃指定的儲值支付工具持牌人之間的對話及合作，以確保政府電子消費券計劃的順利推行。\n\n於2022年1月，金管局發佈《加密資產及穩定幣討論文件》，闡述金管局對相關監管制度的看法，並邀請利益相關者提出意見。在制定適當的監管制度時，將充分考慮相關因素，包括對此討論文件的回饋以及國際組織的建議。\n\n國際上，金管局是中央銀行界積極的成員，並在多個地區和國際委員會中發揮領導作用。例如，金管局主持由東亞及太平洋地區中央銀行會議 (EMEAP) 轄下的金融市場工作小組 (WGFM) 。金管局同時亦共同主持巴塞爾銀行監管委員會 (巴塞爾委員會) 的政策及標準小組、非銀行監察專家小組以及金融穩定理事會 (金融穩定理事會) 的金融創新網絡，並領導一個團隊研究與金融基準過渡相關的監管問題。\n\n# 2021年回顧\n\n# 香港作為亞洲的金融科技樞紐\n\n# 金融科技2025\n\n六月，金管局公布其「金融科技2025」策略，以推動香港的金融科技發展。該策略旨在於2025年前鼓勵金融業全面採用科技，並促進提供公平及高效的金融服務，以造福香港市民及經濟。該策略的五大重點領域為：\n\n- 所有銀行投入金融科技  \n- 未雨綢繆，為香港應對央行數碼貨幣做好準備  \n- 打造下一代數據基建  \n- 擴大金融科技人才庫  \n- 以資金和政策培育生態系統\n\n金管局的「金融科技2025」戰略推動香港的金融科技發展。\n\n# 金融科技應用於銀行業\n\n為支持「金融科技2025」策略中的「所有銀行都邁向金融科技」倡議，金管局於2021年6月推出了金融科技應用評估。該評估旨在幫助金管局更深入了解銀行業目前的金融科技應用情況，並識別哪些金融科技領域可能需要金管局的支持。所有在香港有重要業務的持牌銀行均被要求於2021年底前制定應用金融科技的3年計劃。\n\n在本年度期間，金管局亦持續推行其兩年計劃，以推廣銀行界對合規科技的採用，並將科技融入自身監管程序以提升效率及成效。詳見「銀行體系穩定」章節第98頁以獲取更多細節。\n\n# 批發層面央行數碼貨幣\n\n金管局與泰國央行於2021年2月擴展了聯合研究項目，並納入阿聯酋中央銀行與人民銀行數碼貨幣研究院。該項目其後更名為「多央行數碼貨幣橋（mBridge）」，並獲得國際結算銀行（國際結算銀行）香港創新樞紐中心的大力支持，進一步探索分布式賬本技術在多司法管轄區環境下，促進全天候實時跨境外匯交易同步交收（外匯交易同步交收）交易的能力。 2021年9月公布了一份聯合報告，呈現階段性成果，隨後於11月發布潛在應用案例與未來發展藍圖。\n\n# 零售央行數碼貨幣\n\n為在香港央行數碼貨幣準備方面做好未來防備，金管局已開始研究在香港發行零售層面央行數碼貨幣（即數碼港元）的可行性，涵蓋技術及政策考慮。金管局與國際結算銀行創新樞紐中心（香港）合作，展開名為 Project Aurum 的研究，以探討發行零售層面央行數碼貨幣的技術層面。 另外，成立了一個內部跨部門工作小組，研究相關的技術、政策及法律問題。十月份，金管局發布了一份名為《數碼港元：技術視角》的白皮書，旨在探討並邀請對發行及分發零售層面央行數碼貨幣潛在技術設計方案的意見。\n\n此外，金管局支持人民銀行數字貨幣研究所進行使用數字人民幣進行跨境支付的技術測試。這將有助於推進大灣區的互聯互通，並通過提升跨境支付的效率和用戶體驗，為香港和內地遊客帶來更大便利。\n\n#商業數據通\n\n七月，金管局舉辦了一場虛擬研討會，鼓勵銀行和儲值支付工具營運商加入商業數據通，這是一個旨在提高銀行體系內金融中介效率的下一代金融數據基礎設施。為進一步促進發展和採用，研討會期間宣布啟動商業數據通創新樞紐。為促進中小企業融資，金管局完成了兩階段的概念驗證研究，檢驗商業數據通的技術可行性。在研究期間，參與銀行利用替代數據來協助信貸評估和貸款承銷，共批准了超過550筆中小企業貸款，總金額超過9億港元。基於令人鼓舞的結果，金管局於十一月宣布啟動商業數據通的試驗階段。\n\n中小企業主稱讚商業數據通簡化了他們的貸款申請流程。\n\n# 人才發展\n\n為擴展金融科技人才庫，金管局繼續與其戰略夥伴合作推行「金融科技人才培育計劃升級版」，以培育不同職業發展階段的年輕人才。2021年，超過180名學生受惠於該計劃。另外，金融科技先鋒聯網計劃於9月開始試辦，為主修金融科技的碩士學位學生提供參與真實金融科技專案的機會。為建立戰略合作夥伴關係，並促進包括金融科技人才培育等領域的協作，金管局於10月與四所本地大學簽訂諒解備忘錄。\n\n鮑嘉麟先生（中），金管局助理總裁（金融基建），與四所本地大學簽署備忘錄。\n\n# 金融科技監管沙盒\n\n金融科技監管沙盒（FSS）的使用量在本年度持續上升。截至2021年12月底，自2016年推出以來，金融科技創新試驗計劃在FSS內共獲批准234項，較2020年底的193項有所增加。截至2021年12月底，金管局自2017年推出FSS聊天室以來，共收到666宗申請，希望在金融科技項目的初期階段透過聊天室取得監管意見反饋。其中超過63%的聊天室申請來自科技公司（科技公司）。\n"}
{"en":"# Reserves Management\n\nThe global financial markets embarked on a recovery path in 2021.  Although the global economy continued to be affected by the evolving COVID-19 pandemic situation, a number of factors, including an increasing vaccination rate as well as accommodative monetary policies and fiscal measures around the world, have contributed to notable recovery in the global economy and financial markets.  Against this background, a number of overseas equity markets achieved record highs during the year, and the Exchange Fund’s overall equity holdings were able to achieve a decent return despite the sluggish performance in Hong Kong equities. During 2021, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$191.9 billion, representing an investment return of 4.1%.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong.  The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre.  The HKMA, under the delegated authority of the Financial Secretary and within the terms of the delegation, is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(i) to preserve capital;\n(ii) to ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(iii) to ensure that sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(iv) subject to (i)–(iii), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Exchange Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 Portfolio Segregation of the Exchange Fund\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP).  The BP holds highly liquid US dollardenominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The IP invests primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member economies of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of its assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA diversifies part of the Exchange Fund’s investments in a prudent and incremental manner into a wider variety of asset classes.  This includes emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate.  Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP).  The HKMA has put in place a cap1 to guide the pace of diversification into the LTGP since its inception.  As the LTGP has become increasingly mature in investment scale and asset diversity, the EFAC decided in January 2022 to replace the cap by a target asset allocation that is determined concurrently with that of other asset classes, subject to prudent risk management principles.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007, holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that have been acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes.  The Strategic Portfolio is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of its unique nature.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by Fiscal Reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP2, with the major exception of the Future Fund3, which links its interest rate to the return of both the IP and the LTGP in accordance with the portfolio mix.  The portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 40:60 in 2021.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation.  The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents long-term asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund.  Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark.  This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark (or strategic) allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”.  While the benchmark and tracking error4 limit are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with the EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority.  Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may assume positions to take advantage of short-term market movements (Figure 2).\n\nFigure 2 Asset allocation of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nThe HKMA’s Exchange Fund Investment Office houses its investment and related risk management functions. Exchange Fund Investment Office staff members directly manage about 71% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, comprising the entire BP and part of the IP.  This part of the IP includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 29% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes.  The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to realise sustainable returns, draw on diverse and complementary investment styles, and gain market insights and technical expertise in investment.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes.  The expenditure is determined primarily by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe growing complexity of the investment environment underlines the importance of risk management.  The HKMA sets stringent controls and investment guidelines for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and ensures a proper risk monitoring and compliance system is in place. Three lines of defence are in place to implement effective risk management and governance of investment-related activities.  Key risk categories (including credit, market, liquidity and operational risks) are regularly monitored, and the risk management process provides a robust framework to support strategic planning and investment diversification.\n\n# RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT\n\nThe HKMA believes that, by putting an appropriate emphasis on responsible investment and sustainable long-term economic performance, it can better achieve the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund and reduce risks associated with environmental, social and governance (ESG)- related matters of its underlying investments.  The HKMA supports responsible investment by integrating ESG factors into the investment processes for both public and private market investments of the Exchange Fund, underpinned by the guiding principle that priority will generally be given to ESG investments if the long-term risk-adjusted return is comparable with other investments.  For more details about the HKMA’s responsible investment framework and implementation, see the Sustainability chapter on pages 184 to 191.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2021\n\nGlobal equity markets rose sharply and hit new record highs on the back of ultra-loose monetary policies and fiscal measures, driving an accelerated recovery of the global economy and financial markets.  However, Hong Kong and Mainland equity markets underperformed amid market reforms.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index in the US rose by 27%, while the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong dropped by 14%.\n\nFor the bond markets, rising inflation expectations and tapering of asset purchases by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) led to a rise in US Treasury yields and falling bond prices during 2021.  Ten-year US Treasury yields increased by about 60 basis points from 0.9% at the beginning of the year to 1.5% at the end of the year.\n\nIn the currency markets, the US dollar strengthened against other major currencies, particularly towards the end of 2021, on the back of expectations about the Fed’s tapering pace. In particular, the euro and the yen depreciated by 7.1% and 10.3% against the US dollar respectively.\n\nThe performance of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2021 is shown in Table 1.\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$191.9 billion in 2021.  This comprised gains on bonds of HK$12.6 billion, net gains on equities of HK$47.8 billion (with gains of HK$68.8 billion from foreign equities, and losses of HK$21.0 billion from Hong Kong equities), a positive currency translation effect of HK$16.8 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets and gains of HK$114.7 billion on other investments held by the investment-holding subsidiaries of the Fund. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$3.1 billion.\n\nTotal assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,570.2 billion at the end of the year.  The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$515.3 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$392.5 billion and real estate HK$122.8 billion.  Outstanding investment commitments of the LTGP amounted to HK$225.7 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund in 2021, excluding the Strategic Portfolio, was 4.1%.  Specifically, the IP achieved a rate of return of 3.7%, while the BP gained 0.4%.  The LTGP has recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 15.4% since its inception in 2009.\n\nThe annual returns of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2021 are set out in Chart 1.  Table 2 shows the 2021 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over several different time horizons.  The average return was 5.3% during 2019–2021, 4.7% during 2017–2021, 3.3% during 2012–2021 and 4.8% since 1994.  Table 3 shows the currency mix of the Fund’s assets on 31 December 2021.\n\nSee pages 211 to 319 for the audited 2021 financial statements of the Exchange Fund.\n","terms":{"12-month expected credit

儲備管理\n\n環球金融市場在2021年展開了復甦之路。儘管全球經濟持續受到不斷演變的新冠病毒疫情影響，但多項因素，包括疫苗接種率的上升以及全球各地的貨幣政策和財政措施，都有助於全球經濟和金融市場的顯著復甦。在此背景下，多個海外股票市場在當年創下歷史新高，而外匯基金的整體股票持有量即使在港股表現疲弱的情況下，也能實現可觀的回報。2021年，外匯基金錄得投資收入191.9 港元，投資回報率為4.1%。\n\n#外匯基金\n\n外匯基金的主要目標，正如《外匯基金條例》所訂明，是直接或間接地影響港元匯價。該基金亦可被用來維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定，以協助保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。金管局在財政司司長委任權限下，並在委任條款範圍內，就外匯基金的管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標及組合架構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會（外匯基金）已設定以下投資目標：\n\n(i) 以保本為首要目標；\n(ii) 確保貨幣基礎在任何時候均以高度流通的美元計值資產充分支持；\n(iii) 確保有足夠的流動性以維持貨幣和金融穩定；以及\n(iv) 在符合(i)至(iii)的前提下，實現投資回報，以幫助維持外匯基金的長期購買力。\n\n這些目標完全顧及《外匯基金》的法定宗旨，並納入基金的組合架構和目標資產配置（圖1）。\n\n圖1 外匯基金投資組合類別\n\n廣義而言，外匯基金擁有兩個主要資產組合：支持組合（BP）及投資組合（IP）。支持組合持有高流動性以美元計值的資產，根據貨幣發行局制度的要求，為貨幣基礎提供充分支持。投資組合則主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員經濟體的債市及股市，以維持資產價值及長期購買力。\n\n為更好地管理風險並提升中長期回報，金管局以謹慎且漸進的方式，將外匯基金的部分投資多元化至更廣泛的資產類別。這包括新興巿場及內地債券與股票、私募股權（包括基礎設施）以及房地產投資。新興巿場及內地債券與股票由投資組合持有，而私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合（LTGP）持有。金管局自開展投資以來，已設有市值上限以指導對長期增長組合的多元化進度。隨著長期增長組合在投資規模及資產多元性方面日益成熟，外匯基金諮詢委員會於2022年1月決定以目標資產配置取代市值上限，該目標資產配置將與其他資產類別同時確定，並受審慎風險管理原則約束。\n\n策略性資產組合於二零零七年成立，持有香港交易及結算所有限公司股份，這些股份由政府為外匯基金的策略性目的而購入。 由於其獨特性質，策略性資產組合並未納入對基金投資表現的評估之中。\n\n# 於外匯基金的存款\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備存款、政府基金及法定組織的存款。利率一般與投資組合的表現掛鉤，未來基金則為主要例外，其利率根據組合比重與投資組合及長期增長組合的回報掛鉤。二零二一年，未來基金的組合比重約為投資組合與長期增長組合四比六。\n\n# 投資過程\n\n外匯基金的投資過程基於兩種資產配置的決策：策略性資產配置和戰略性資產配置。策略性資產配置反映在投資基準中，代表根據外匯基金的投資目標所進行的長期資產配置。在策略性配置的指導下，資產會戰略性地配置，以試圖實現超越基準的回報。這意味著實際配置通常與基準（或策略性）配置有所不同。實際配置與基準配置之間的差異被稱為「戰略性偏離」。雖然基準和跟蹤誤差4的限制是由財政司司長與外匯基金諮詢委員會磋商後決定的，但戰略性決策和戰略性偏離的允許範圍則是由金管局根據授權來制定和設置的。在戰略性偏離允許的範圍內，投資組合經理可以持有頭寸以利用短期市場波動（圖2）。\n\n圖二 外匯基金的資產配置\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局的外匯基金投資辦公室負責其投資及相關風險管理功能。外匯基金投資辦公室的員工直接管理約71%的外匯基金投資，包括整個支持組合及部分投資組合。該部分投資組合包括投資於全球定息市場的一組資產組合，以及實施宏觀風險管理策略的多種衍生工具資產組合。\n\n# 外聘投資經理\n\n除了內部管理資產外，金管局亦聘請外聘投資經理管理外匯基金約29%的資產，包括其所有上市股票組合及其他專門資產類別。聘請外聘投資經理的目的是善用市場上最佳的投資專業知識，以實現可持續回報，汲取多元且互補的投資風格，並獲取市場洞察力及投資技術專長。\n\n與使用外聘投資經理有關的支出包括基金管理、託管費、交易費以及扣繳稅和其他稅項。此支出主要由市場因素決定，並可能每年有所波動。\n\n# 風險管理及監察\n\n投資環境日益複雜，凸顯了風險管理的重要性。金管局為內部及外部管理的資產組合設立嚴格的控制措施及投資指引，並確保風險監察及合規制度完善。為有效實施與投資活動相關的風險管理及治理，已建立三重防線。主要風險類別（包括信貸風險、市場風險、流動性風險及業務操作風險）會定期監測，而風險管理程序則提供穩健的框架，以支持戰略規劃及投資多元化。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n金管局認為，透過適當重視負責任投資及可持續長期表現，可更有效地實現外匯基金的投資目標，並降低其基礎投資與環境、社會及管治(ESG)相關事項所涉及的風險。金管局支持負責任投資，方法是將ESG因素納入外匯基金公眾及私募市場投資的投資過程，其指導原則為：若ESG投資的長期經風險調整收益與其他投資相若，則一般會優先考慮ESG投資。如欲了解更多有關金管局負責任投資框架及實施細節，請參閱第184至191頁的「可持續發展」章節。\n\n#外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2021年金融市場\n\n全球股市在超寬鬆的貨幣政策和財政措施帶動下，大幅上漲並創下新高，推動全球經濟和金融市場加速復甦。然而，香港和內地股市在市場改革期間表現相對較弱。美國標準普爾500指數上漲27%，而香港恒生指數則下跌14%。\n\n對債市而言，通貨膨脹預期上升及美國聯邦儲備局（美聯儲）縮減資產購買規模，導致2021年美國國債收益率上漲、債券價格下跌。十年期美國國債收益率從年初的0.9%上漲至年底的1.5%，增幅約為60基點。\n\n在貨幣市場中，美元在2021年末，特別是在對美聯儲縮減量化寬鬆政策步伐的預期影響下，兌其他主要貨幣走強。特別是，歐元和日圓分別對美元貶值了7.1%和10.3%。\n\n表

{"en":"# Corporate Functions\n\nCorporate functions support the operation of the HKMA with a high level of transparency, accountability, efficiency and professionalism.  To facilitate public understanding about its policies and operations, the HKMA maintains effective communication with the community and the market through traditional and social media, its website, the Information Centre and other channels. Within the institution, the HKMA conscientiously builds an agile and sustainable workforce, institutes rigorous financial discipline and upgrades information technology capabilities to adapt to changes and ensure effective implementation of its policies and initiatives.\n\n# TRANSPARENCY\n\n# Media relations and social media\n\nThe HKMA works closely with the media to enhance transparency and promote public understanding of its policies and operations.  In 2021, the HKMA held or participated in 169 physical and virtual events, comprising eight press conferences, eight stand-up interviews and 153 other public functions. A further 27 media interviews were arranged.  A total of 632 bilingual press releases were issued over the course of the year and a large number of media enquiries were handled on a daily basis.\n\nTo raise awareness of the HKMA’s key functions, press conferences and media briefings were organised for local, Mainland and foreign media.  Topics included the Connect schemes, financial technology (fintech) and the reform of interest rate benchmarks.\n\nTo engage and interact with the public in a timely manner, the HKMA maintains five social media channels (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter and YouTube) with over 80,000 followers.  The HKMA utilises its social media channels to raise public awareness on a wide range of topics notably phishing scams, which increased significantly during the pandemic.  In addition, extensive promotion campaigns on green finance, fintech and the Connect schemes were conducted via social media to keep the public abreast of the latest development trends.\n\nMr Eddie Yue, Chief Executive of HKMA, moderates a virtual panel discussion at the Hong Kong FinTech Week 2021\n\nMr Howard Lee, Deputy Chief Executive of HKMA, hosts a media briefing on the HKMA’s “Fintech 2025” strategy\n\nMr Arthur Yuen, Deputy Chief Executive of HKMA, hosts a media briefing on the Hong Kong banking sector’s preparation for London Interbank Offered Rate transition\n\nMr Edmond Lau, Deputy Chief Executive of HKMA, conducts an interview with an international news channel\n\n# Public enquiries\n\nThe Public Enquiry Service provides an effective means for the public to better understand key HKMA functions and operations.  During 2021, it handled 9,781 enquiries. About half of them were related to banking policies and regulations, consumer banking issues, notes and coins, as well as financial infrastructure and debt market development. Some of the notable enquiries were about the Coin Collection Programme, banking products and services, banking-related guidelines and circulars and the Retail Bond Issuance Programme.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received since 2018 and Chart 2 provides a breakdown by enquiry nature in 2021.\n\nChart 1 Total number of public enquiries\n\nChart 2 Nature of enquiries received in 2021\n\n# Publications\n\nApart from the HKMA Annual Report, the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report, and four issues of the Quarterly Bulletin, and it regularly updated the Monthly Statistical Bulletin to provide up-to-date and thematic information and analyses on monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. The HKMA also published 11 inSight1 articles to introduce its major new initiatives and policies and discuss topical issues of interest.\n\nThe HKMA Annual Report 2020 received a Silver Award in the “Non-profit Making and Charitable Organisations” category, and an Excellence Award in Environmental, Social and Governance Reporting at the Hong Kong Management Association’s 2021 Best Annual Reports Awards.\n\n# Corporate website\n\nThe corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk) presents more than 44,000 pages of content in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, and is the public gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It contains the register of authorized institutions (AIs) and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the register of stored value facility licensees under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance.\n\nThe HKMA has been releasing financial data and important information on its website via Open Application Programming Interface (API) in phases since 2018. By end-2021, the HKMA had opened up 148 sets of Open APIs on its website, in line with the targeted schedule.\n\n# Information Centre\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre, located on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre, is an important facility introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters.  It consists of an exhibition area and a library. The exhibition area presents an overview of the HKMA’s work and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong in an interactive manner.  It also contains information and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.  The library, situated next to the exhibition area, houses more than 26,000 books, journals and other publications on Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs as well as central banking topics.  It also maintains the register of AIs and local representative offices, as well as the register of securities staff of AIs, for public access as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nTo safeguard public health and safety during the COVID-19 pandemic, special operational arrangements were put in place at the Information Centre.  Cleansing and disinfection were stepped up, and facilities and exhibits were sanitised regularly with anti-microbial coating.\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre’s exhibition area comprises the Policy Section, the Currency Section and the Historical Timeline\n\n# Community engagement and public education\n\nTo reach out to the community and raise public awareness of the HKMA’s work, a public education programme has been running since 1998.  In 2021, a webinar was organised for over 2,300 students and teachers from 84 secondary schools.  The webinar covered an overview of the HKMA’s work, the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, protection of personal digital keys, the Deposit Protection Scheme and career opportunities in the banking industry.  To date, more than 63,000 people have participated in the public education programme.\n\nThe HKMA educates and engages the public on how to be smart and responsible financial consumers.  In view of the increase in phishing scams, the HKMA conducted a public awareness campaign themed “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!” with cross-media promotion to urge the public to stay vigilant against fraudulent hyperlinks embedded in SMS messages and emails purportedly from banks.\n\nCross-media promotion reminding the public to beware of fraudulent hyperlinks\n\nThe HKMA also seeks to enhance the public’s understanding of the financial industry and raise the young generation’s interest in pursuing a career in the industry.  Following positive feedback to the online drama series “STEPS” in 2020, the HKMA launched a new series titled “Four Faces of Talents in Central” featuring four growing areas of the financial industry: data science, fintech, green and sustainable finance, and wealth management.  In the video series, the characters of the market practitioners were portrayed in a humorous manner, and seasoned industry players and young talents shared first-hand information on the nature and requirements of jobs, career opportunities and prospects across the above four growing areas.\n\n“Four Faces of Talents in Central” series keeps the young generation abreast of career opportunities in the financial market\n\nThe “Online Parenting and Educational Campaign” launched in 2020 was recognised with a Silver Award in the “Best Event — Corporate Social Responsibility” category of the MarketingInteractive’s Marketing Events Awards 2021.  Building on the campaign’s success and to sustain momentum, the HKMA rolled out additional initiatives, including a parenting financial education workshop where child education experts shared tips on how to teach kids good money sense and demonstrated a DIY (do-it-yourself) financial educational toy, as well as an animated virtual tour of the HKMA Information Centre.\n\nThe “Online Parenting and Educational Campaign” wins an award at the Marketing Events Awards 2021.  The campaign promotes money management concept and skills to let parents and kids learn in an amusing and entertaining way.\n\nTo enhance financial literacy among secondary school students, the HKMA and various stakeholders co-organised the “Hong Kong Financial Literacy Championship”, which featured a fintech theme.  Apart from an online quiz, a new financial design thinking workshop on personal financial management was added to train the participating students to develop innovative proposals on money management tools.  This initiative won the “Highest Student Participation Award” offered by the Business-School Partnership Programme under the Education Bureau, and the “Investor and Financial Education Award (Corporate) — Gold Award” offered by the Investor and Financial Education Council2 (IFEC).\n\nThe “Hong Kong Financial Literacy Championship” educates students on fintech and design thinking concepts and achieves record-high participation\n\nOther community engagement initiatives included talks or webinars for students and retirees.  The HKMA also participated in a teacher training webinar on economic security organised by the Education Bureau.  Online educational materials offering smart tips on using automated teller machines (ATMs) are available in eight languages3 to cater for people of different backgrounds living in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA supports the IFEC in promoting financial literacy and capacity in Hong Kong, and will explore further collaboration with stakeholders to maximise the impact of community engagement.\n\n# Financial disclosure\n\nTo maintain a high level of transparency, the HKMA adopts international standards in financial disclosure insofar as these are applicable to central banking operations.  These include the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and other applicable reporting requirements, for example, the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard.  The Finance Division works with external auditors and other accounting professionals to prepare and present the Exchange Fund’s financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards.  The HKMA also provides detailed disclosures and thorough analyses of a wide range of expense items and budgetary information in its Annual Report.\n\n# ACCOUNTABILITY AND CONTROLS\n\n# Risk management\n\nOne of the HKMA’s most important tasks is to manage risks to the monetary and banking systems.  Risk management is undertaken both at a working level in the day-to-day operations and at a higher level through strategic planning. Under the HKMA’s risk management framework, there are two high-level committees — the Macro Surveillance Committee and the Risk Committee — both of which are chaired by the Chief Executive of the HKMA.\n\nThe terms of reference of the Macro Surveillance Committee are:\n\n- to identify potential risks and threats to the monetary and financial system in Hong Kong and discuss possible measures to address such risks;\n- to review existing measures for managing risks in the monetary and financial system to identify possible gaps and ensure the adequacy of these measures; and\n- to encourage cross-departmental sharing of relevant information on macro surveillance with a view to enhancing the macro surveillance capability of the HKMA.\n\nThe terms of reference of the Risk Committee are:\n\n- to identify potential risks and threats to the organisation and devise strategies to reduce the impact of such events;\n- to review the existing system for managing risks across different departments to identify possible gaps and significant risks and ensure the adequacy of measures to address them;\n- to harmonise the criteria and methods of risk measurement and prioritise the resources management of risks identified; and\n- to encourage a stronger risk management culture institutionally which promotes the proper levels of authorisation and controls.\n\nA robust operational risk management framework is in place covering organisational risks at two levels: the entity level and the department level.  Entity-level risks refer mainly to those which concern the entire organisation in the medium term, or which might call for a cross-departmental response. Potential and emerging risks identified by business units, and the adequacy of the control measures and mitigating strategies they devise, are reviewed and reported every quarter.  This is supplemented by a top-down approach to manage entity-level risks, in which senior colleagues heading different business units actively identify risks of wider impact and propose mitigating measures.  The Risk Committee discusses these assessments and decides on appropriate follow-up actions.\n","terms":{"12-month expected credit losses":["12個月預期信用虧損"],"2022–23 Budget":["2022至23年度財政預算案"],"24\/7

傳媒關係與社交媒體\n\n金管局緊密與傳媒合作，以提升透明度及促進公眾對其政策及運作的了解。2021年，金管局舉辦或參與了169場實體及虛擬活動，包括八場記者會、八場即場訪問及153場其他公眾活動。另外安排了27場傳媒訪問。全年共發佈632份雙語通訊稿，並每日處理大量傳媒查詢。\n\n為提高公眾對金管局主要職能的認識，已為本地、內地及外國媒體舉辦記者會及簡報。主題包括互聯互通機制、金融科技及利率基準改革。\n\n為及時與公眾溝通互動，金管局維持五個社交媒體平台（Facebook、Instagram、LinkedIn、Twitter

名關注者。金管局利用其社交媒體平台提高公眾對多個主題的認識，特別是網絡釣魚騙案，此類騙案在疫情期間顯著增加。此外，金管局亦透過社交媒體進行廣泛的推廣活動，宣傳綠色金融、金融科技及滬港通等計劃，讓公眾掌握最新發展趨勢。\n\n金管局總裁余偉文在香港金融科技周2021主持虛擬座談會。\n\n香港金融管理局副總裁李浩然主持一場關於「金融科技2025」策略的媒體簡報會。\n\n金管局副總裁袁家禮主持媒體簡報會，介紹香港銀行業為倫敦銀行同業拆息轉換所做的準備。\n\n香港金融管理局副總裁劉怡銘接受國際新聞頻道訪問\n\n#

{"en":"# Sustainability\n\nThe HKMA is publishing its first sustainability report, as an integral part of its Annual Report 2021, to set out its strategy on sustainability and document its own efforts, as well as its joint efforts with the financial industry, to support the Government’s climate strategies and contribute to a more climate resilient and sustainable world.\n\nThe HKMA embeds sustainability considerations across its main roles and functions, whether as a banking supervisor, a market facilitator, a responsible investor, or in maintaining financial and monetary stability.  Moreover, the HKMA collaborates with local and overseas counterparts in strengthening the management and disclosures of climate risks, as well as the development of the green and sustainable finance market.\n\nIn addition, the HKMA is committed to fulfilling its corporate social responsibility, and aims to be a responsible and sustainable organisation. This commitment is manifested in various areas, including promoting a sustainable, financially inclusive and environmentally friendly marketplace, supporting the wider community, protecting the environment and nurturing a caring workplace.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nClimate change is one of the most pressing challenges facing the world today.  To combat climate change, countries agreed, under the Paris Agreement1, to take actions to cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and eventually achieve carbon neutrality within this century.  Meeting the Paris Agreement climate change target will require investments of an estimated US$1–2 trillion a year globally2, making sustainability one of the biggest drivers of capital flows in the decades ahead.\n\nHong Kong is determined to be at the forefront of this transition.  The Government announced that it will strive to achieve carbon neutrality before 2050, in line with developed economies globally.  Hong Kong is also the first Asian jurisdiction that has committed to specifically aligning disclosure requirements with recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) by 2025 across relevant sectors.\n\nTo the financial sector, climate change is both a source of risk and opportunity.  While the financial sector cannot be spared from the threats posed by climate change, it has a key role to play in the transition by channelling more financing to activities that are consistent with a pathway towards lower GHG emissions and climate-resilient developments.\n\nThe HKMA is committed to strengthening Hong Kong’s financial system to support a greener and more sustainable future, driving actions to support the Government’s climate goal and contributing to the global agenda.  In doing so, the HKMA incorporates sustainability considerations in carrying out its main functions and in running its operations.\n\nFirst, as a banking supervisor, the HKMA aims to strengthen resilience of the banking system against climate risks and to accelerate banks’ efforts in supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy.  To accomplish this, the HKMA has formulated a regulatory framework setting out supervisory requirements for banks to manage and disclose climate risks.  A pilot exercise on climate risk stress test to assess the resilience of the banking sector was also concluded successfully in 2021.  Meanwhile, on an ongoing basis, the HKMA takes into account climate change in monitoring financial stability risks.\n\nSecondly, in its market development role, the HKMA is focusing its efforts in enhancing Hong Kong’s role as a green and sustainable finance hub in the region, including the Greater Bay Area (GBA).  Hong Kong, being Mainland’s offshore financial centre, is well-positioned to channel global investments into Mainland’s plans to achieve peak carbon emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060.  The HKMA is also working through the Green and Sustainable Finance Cross-Agency Steering Group (CASG)3, which the HKMA co-chairs, to build industry capacity, address data gaps and explore the development of a local green classification framework.\n\nIn fact, Hong Kong is a leader in green finance solutions, having established the world’s first government Global Medium Term Note Programme dedicated to green bond issuances under the Government Green Bond Programme, and increased gradually the diversity of its issuances since 2019, both in terms of currencies and tenors.  To support the issuance of green and sustainable bonds and loans in the private sector, the Government set up the Green and Sustainable Finance Grant Scheme in May 2021. Administered by the HKMA, this scheme has incentivised more corporates to seek green and sustainable financing in Hong Kong, and encouraged more green advisers and external reviewers to establish or expand their presence here.\n\nThirdly, as the manager of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA has ensured that environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations are an integral part of its investment process and asset allocation decisions.  In the latter part of this report, the HKMA makes its inaugural disclosures on its climate scenario analysis and carbon footprint metrics of the Exchange Fund’s portfolios.\n\nFourthly, the HKMA is stepping up its own green office initiatives to ensure its own operations conform to best practices in the management and mitigation of climate risks.  As a start, the HKMA has established its carbon profile across Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions4, and made corresponding disclosures.  At the same time, the HKMA has implemented measures to enhance industry-wide operational efficiency and minimise resource consumption.  In addition, the HKMA holds itself to high standards of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and works with its stakeholders to promote financial inclusion and financial literacy.\n\nGreening the financial system requires close collaboration amongst central banks and supervisors.  The HKMA is an active member of the international community in global policymaking and alignment of sustainability standards. The HKMA has also issued a statement to support the Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) Glasgow Declaration5, reaffirming its commitment to delivering on the NGFS recommendations in taking the necessary measures to foster a greener financial system.\n\nIn driving these sustainability initiatives and assessing climaterelated opportunities and risks, sustainability and green considerations are embedded in the HKMA’s governance and risk management frameworks, in which the leadership is actively involved in setting the overarching objectives and guiding principles, in consultation with the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) and its sub-committees. The HKMA’s CSR and Sustainability Committee (CSC) also assesses the potential impacts of sustainability and climate-related issues on the organisation, and devises strategies to reduce the impacts.  Execution of the relevant strategies and initiatives is closely monitored and reported to the top management regularly.  In addition, external consultants have been engaged to advise the HKMA in selected areas of work.\n\nThe subsequent sections of this chapter will delve into the HKMA’s governance, strategies and risk management measures in undertaking green finance and sustainability work in each of its roles.\n\nThis report is prepared with reference to the disclosure elements recommended in the NGFS’s Guide on Climaterelated Disclosure for Central Banks, published in December 2021.  In addition, information in relation to the HKMA’s office operations makes broad reference to the reporting principles under the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards6 and the ESG Reporting Guide promulgated by the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited.\n\n# Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System\n\nThe NGFS provides a platform for central banks and prudential supervisory authorities to exchange experiences, share best practices, contribute to the development of environmental and climate risk management in the financial sector, and mobilise mainstream finance to support the transition towards a sustainable economy.  Its purpose is to define and promote best practices to be implemented within and outside of the membership of the NGFS, and to conduct or commission analytical work on green finance.\n\n# Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures\n\nIn December 2015, the Financial Stability Board created the TCFD to develop recommendations for more effective climate-related disclosures by companies to investors, lenders and insurance underwriters that could promote more informed decisions.  The TCFD’s recommendations are structured around four thematic areas that represent the core elements of how organisations operate: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets.\n\n# BANKING SUPERVISOR\n\nAs the core part of the financial system, banks should be proactive in managing climate risks, and support channelling more capital to green and sustainable activities.  As a banking supervisor, the HKMA focuses on building banks’ resilience against climate risks and accelerating banks’ efforts in supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\n# Overview of the HKMA’s three-phased approach\n\nSince May 2019, the HKMA has been promoting green and sustainable banking in three phases:\n\n# Phase I\n\nDeveloping a common framework to assess the “greenness baseline” of individual banks, and collaborating with international bodies to provide technical support to banks in Hong Kong.\n\n# Phase II\n\nConsulting the industry and other stakeholders on the supervisory expectations and requirements of green and sustainable banking.\n\n# Phase III\n\nFocusing on the implementation of supervisory requirements, monitoring and evaluation of banks’ progress in green and sustainable banking.\n\n# Guidance\n\n# Supervisory requirements on climate risk management\n\nIn 2020, the HKMA developed a common framework for assessing the “greenness baseline” of individual banks in collaboration with the industry.  The HKMA also conducted the first greenness assessment of banks, which marked the completion of Phase I.  To help banks prepare for the new supervisory requirements, a white paper was published in June 2020, which outlined the HKMA’s initial thinking on supervisory expectations for climate risk management.\n\nIn December 2021, following an industry consultation, the HKMA issued the supervisory requirements for banks to incorporate climate considerations into governance, strategy, risk management and disclosure.  In particular, specific requirements and concrete timeline were set out in mandating climate-related disclosures based on the recommendations of the TCFD before 2025. The requirements will set a benchmark to help banks upgrade their risk management capability.\n\nThe next step is for the HKMA to monitor banks’ implementation of the relevant requirements.  In this regard, the HKMA has stepped up its supervisory capacity by setting up a new dedicated team within its Banking Supervision Department to carry out climate risk supervision.\n\nThis three-phased approach is an iterative and evolving process.  Further to the first round of greenness assessment conducted in 2020, the HKMA is reviewing the framework to encompass the new supervisory requirements on climate risk management and potentially cover a wider scope, such as other environmental risks and measures for supporting the net zero transition.   The HKMA intends to launch an updated framework in the second half of 2022.\n\n# Sound practices supporting the transition to carbon neutrality\n\nApart from incorporating climate risk considerations into the risk management framework, some banks have devoted resources and taken measures to support the goals of the Paris Agreement and contribute to achieving global net zero emissions.  The HKMA issued a circular in December 2021 to share with the industry the sound practices of these banks which would be of reference value to other banks in the industry in formulating their climate strategies.  These sound practices are grouped into four areas: reducing GHG emissions of the banks’ own operations, reducing financed emissions through portfolio alignment, assisting clients to transition, and promoting collective efforts to assist the economy to achieve a net-zero transition.\n\n# Green classification framework to facilitate green finance flows\n\nTo increase transparency across the financial markets and enable consistent policy making on green finance, the HKMA has been working with other financial regulators to explore a local green classification framework, which will facilitate navigation among the Common Ground Taxonomy (CGT) developed by the International Platform on Sustainable Finance (IPSF)8 and the green definitions adopted by China and European Union, for adoption across different financial sectors.  The work will be guided by the principles of interoperability, comparability and inclusiveness, taking into account other definitions of green, transitional activities and local considerations.  This initiative will reduce the risk of green washing, improve product comparability and ultimately enhance investor protection.\n\n# Assessment: climate risk stress test\n\nTo assess the banking sector’s ability to cope with potential shocks brought about by climate change, the HKMA undertook a pilot exercise on climate risk stress test (CRST), which included the participation of 20 major retail banks and seven branches of international banking groups.  A report summarising the results of the pilot CRST exercise was published in December 2021.  The results showed that the banking sector remained resilient even in the face of extreme climate-related shocks, although these shocks could potentially give rise to significant adverse impacts on banks’ financials.  The CRST exercise helped to enhance banks’ capabilities for measuring and assessing climate risks. In light of the CRST results, the participating banks have devised plans to strengthen their climate strategies and risk governance frameworks.  The HKMA will continue to engage the industry to strengthen banks’ capability and enhance the CRST framework, taking into account the lessons learnt from the pilot exercise.\n","terms":{"12-month

概覽\n\n氣候變化是當今世界面臨的最緊迫挑戰之一。為了應對氣候變化，各國在巴黎協定下同意採取行動以減少溫室氣體排放，並在本世紀內最終實現碳中和。實現巴黎協定氣候變化目標，預計每年全球將需要投資 1 至 2 兆美元，使可持續發展成為未來幾十年資本流動的最大驅動力之一。\n\n香港堅定不移地處於這一轉型的前沿。政府宣布將努力在2050年前實現碳中和，與全球先進經濟體系保持一致。香港也是亞洲第一個承諾到2025年在相關行業中將披露要求與氣候相關財務披露工作小組建議對齊的司法管轄區。\n\n對金融界而言，氣候變化既是風險也是機會。 雖然金融界無法倖免於氣候變化帶來的威脅，但它在轉型過程中扮演著關鍵角色，透過將更多資金導向與降低溫室氣體排放及具備氣候韌性的發展相符的活動。\n\n金管局致力加強香港金融體系，以支持更綠色及可持續的未來，推動行動支持特區政府的氣候目標，並貢獻於全球議程。為此，金管局在履行其主要職能及運作過程中，納入可持續發展的因素。\n\n首先，作為銀行業監管機構，金管局旨在強化銀行體系對氣候風險的抗震能力，並加速銀行支持轉型至低碳經濟的努力。為此，金管局已制定監管框架，其中載明銀行管理和披露氣候風險的監管規定。二零二一年，關於氣候風險壓力測試試驗計劃的試點演練亦已成功完成。同時，金管局會持續將氣候變化納入監測金融穩定風險的考量之中。\n\n其次，在市場發展方面，金管局正著力提升香港作為區域內綠色和可持續金融樞紐的地位，包括大灣區。香港作為內地的離岸金融中心，具備良好條件，可引導全球投資支持內地於2030年碳達峰及2060年碳中和的目標。金管局亦透過綠色和可持續金融跨機構督導小組，該督導小組由金管局共同主持，以提升業界能力、解決數據缺口，並探討本地綠色分類框架的發展。\n\n事實上，香港在綠色金融方案方面處於領先地位，已建立全球首個由政府推行的「全球中期票據發行計劃」，專門用於發行綠色債券，屬於「政府綠色債券計劃」的一部分。自2019年起，香港逐步增加發行綠色債券的多元化組成，包括貨幣種類及期限。為支持私人部門發行綠色及可持續債券和貸款，政府於2021年5月設立「綠色和可持續金融資助計劃」。該計劃由金管局管理，鼓勵更多企業在香港尋求綠色及可持續融資，並促進更多綠色顧問公司及外部評審機構在此設立或擴大業務。\n\n第三，作為外匯基金的管理機構，金管局已確保環境、社會及管治(ESG)因素成為其投資過程及資產配置決策的重要組成部分。本報告後半部分，金管局首次披露有關外匯基金資產組合的氣候情境分析及碳足跡指標。\n\n第四，金管局正加強其自身的綠色辦公室措施，以確保其運作符合管理和減緩氣候風險的最佳做法。作為開端，金管局已確立其涵蓋第一級和第二級排放量的碳分布，並作出相應披露。與此同時，金管局已實施措施以提升行業範圍內的運作效率，並盡量減少資源消耗。此外，金管局致力於高度的機構社會責任，並與其利益相關者合作促進普及金融和金融素養。\n\n使金融體系更綠色需要央行與監管機構密切合作。金管局是國際社會在制定全球政策及協調可持續發展標準方面的積極成員。金管局亦發佈聲明支持央行與監管機構綠色金融網絡（NGFS）的格拉斯哥宣言5，重申其承諾落實NGFS的建議，採取必要措施推動建立更綠色的金融體系。\n\n在推動這些可持續發展倡議並評估與氣候相關的機會與風險時，可持續發展及綠色考量已融入金管局的治理及風險管理框架中。領導層積極參與制定總體目標與指導原則，並與外匯基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）及其轄下委員會進行磋商。金管局的機構社會責任及可持續發展委員會（CSC）亦評估可持續發展及與氣候相關問題對機構的潛在影響，並制定策略以減輕這些影響。相關策略及倡議的執行情況會受到密切監測，並定期向高層管理層報告。此外，亦已聘請外部顧問就金管局特定工作範疇提供意見。\n\n本章後續內容將深入探討金管局在擔任各項角色時，推動綠色金融及可持續發展工作的治理架構、策略及風險管理措施。\n\n本報告參考了於2021年12月發佈的央行與監管機構綠色金融網絡《氣候相關披露指引》中建議的披露要素。此外，有關金管局辦事處運作的資訊廣泛參考了全球報告倡議組織（GRI）標準6及香港聯合交易所有限公司頒佈的《環境、社會及管治報告指引》。\n\n# 央行與監管機構綠色金融網絡\n\n央行與監管機構綠色金融網絡提供了一個平台，讓央行與審慎監管機構交流經驗、分享最佳做法、促進金融部門環境及氣候風險管理發展，並動員主流融資以支持向可持續經濟轉型。 其目的旨在定義並推廣央行與監管機構綠色金融網絡成員內部及外部應採取的最佳做法，並開展或委託綠色金融的分析工作。\n\n#氣候相關財務披露工作小組\n\n二零一五年十二月，金融穩定理事會成立了氣候相關財務披露工作小組，旨在制定更有效的氣候相關披露建議，供公司向投資者、貸款機構及承保公司提供，以促進更明智的決策。氣候相關財務披露工作小組的建議圍繞四個主題領域展開，這些領域代表了組織運作的核心要素：管治、策略、風險管理，以及指標及目標。\n\n# 銀行業監管機構\n\n作為金融體系的核心，銀行應積極應對氣候風險，並支持更多資金投入綠色及可持續發展的活動。作為銀行業監管機構，金管局著重於提升銀行抵禦能力，以應對氣候風險，並加速銀行在支持轉型至低碳經濟方面的努力。\n\n# 金管局三階段模式概述\n\n自二零一九年五月起，金管局已分三個階段推廣綠色及可持續銀行業：\n\n# 第一階段\n\n制定評估個別銀行「綠色基準」的通用框架，並與國際組織合作向香港的銀行提供技術支援。\n\n# 第二階段\n\n向業界及其他利益相關者諮詢關於綠色及可持續銀行業的監管期望和要求。\n\n# 第三階段\n\n著重於落實監管規定，監測和評估銀行在綠色及可持續銀行業方面的進展。\n\n# 使用說明\n\n# 關於氣候風險管理的監管規定\n\n於二零二零年，金管局與業界合作，制定了一個評估各銀行「綠色基準」的通用框架。金管局亦進行了首次的綠色評估，標誌著第一階段的完成。為協助銀行為新的監管規定做準備，於二零二零年六月發布了一份白皮書，闡述了金管局在氣候風險管理方面的監管期望的初步構想。\n\n於二零二一年十二月，經行業諮詢後，金管局發布了針對銀行將氣候因素納入公司治理、策略、風險管理及披露的監管規定。 尤其，在要求銀行於二零二五年之前，按照氣候相關財務披露工作小組的建議，進行氣候相關披露，並制定了具體要求和時間表。 這些規定將設定一個基準，以協助銀行提升其風險管理能力。\n\n下一步是金管局監督銀行落實相關要求。為此，金管局已在銀行監理部內成立一個新的專責團隊，以加強其監管能力，從事氣候風險監管工作。\n\n此三階段模式是一項迭代且持續演進的過程。繼2020年進行的第一輪綠色評估後，金管局正檢視框架，以納入有關氣候風險管理的新監管規定，並可能涵蓋更廣泛的範疇，例如其他環境風險及支持淨零排放轉型的措施。金管局預計於2022年下半年推出更新後的框架。\n\n# 良好做法支持向碳中和的過渡。\n\n除了將氣候風險考慮納入風險管理框架外，部分銀行已投入資源並採取措施，以支持巴黎協定目標，並為實現全球淨零排放做出貢獻。金管局於2021年12月發佈通函，與業界分享這些銀行的良好做法，供業界其他銀行制定氣候策略時參考。這些良好做法可歸納為四大範疇：減少銀行內部營運的溫室氣體排放、透過調整融資組合減少所融資的溫室氣體排放、協助客戶轉型，以及推動業界合作以協助經濟實現淨零轉型。\n\n# 綠色分類框架以促進綠色金融的資金流動。\n\n為提升金融市場的透明度，並實現綠色金融政策的一致性，金管局已與其他金融監管機構合作，探討建立本地綠色分類框架，以協助在國際可持續金融平台（IPSF）所制定的共通綠色分類目錄（CGT）與中國及歐盟採用的綠色定義之間進行協調，並於不同金融領域推行應用。此項工作將以互換性、可比性及兼容性為原則，考慮其他綠色定義、過渡性活動及本地因素。此舉將降低漂綠風險，提升產品的可比性，並最終加強投資者的保障。\n\n# 評估：氣候風險壓力測試試驗計劃\n\n為評估銀行界應對氣候變化帶來的潛在衝擊能力，金管局進行了一項氣候風險壓力測試試驗計劃（CRST），包括20家主要零售銀行和七家國際銀行集團的分支機構參與。一份總結試驗計劃結果的報告於2021年12月發布。結果顯示，即使面對極端的氣候變化衝擊，銀行界仍然具有韌性，儘管這些衝擊可能對銀行財務造成重大的不利影響。該氣候風險壓力測試試驗計劃有助於提升銀行衡量和評估氣候風險的能力。鑒於氣候風險壓力測試試驗計劃的結果，參與銀行已制定計劃以加強其氣候策略和風險管治框架。金管局將繼續與業界合作，加強銀行的能力並完善氣候風險壓力測試試驗計劃框架，並吸取試驗計劃的經驗教訓。\n"}
{"en":"# The Exchange Fund\n\nReport of the Director of Audit Exchange Fund Financial Statements\n\n# Audit Commission The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 217 to 319, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2021, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2021, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards.  My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report.  I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards.  I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021.  These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.5, 2.6 and 38.1 to the financial statements.\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, the Group had financial assets totalling HK$4,502,475 million and financial liabilities totalling HK$1,150,861 million valued at fair value.\n\nFor 89% of these financial assets and all these financial liabilities, their fair values were quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 inputs) or were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data (Level 2 inputs).\n\nFor the remaining 11% of these financial assets, their fair values were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data (Level 3 inputs).  Such financial assets totalled HK$517,316 million, including mainly unlisted investment funds.\n\nGiven the substantial amount and the estimations involved, valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value was a key audit matter.\n\nThe audit procedures on valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value included:\n\n- obtaining an understanding of the procedures, including relevant controls, for valuing different categories of financial assets and financial liabilities;\n- evaluating and testing the controls, including relevant application controls of the computer systems;\n- obtaining external confirmations on the valuation, existence, rights and obligations and completeness of the financial assets and financial liabilities;\n- where quoted market prices were used, verifying the prices to independent sources;\n- where valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions, and verifying the inputs to independent sources; and\n- where valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Valuation of investment properties at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.11, 18 and 19 to the financial statements.\n\nThe Group’s investment properties were stated at their fair values, totalling HK$27,089 million as at 31 December 2021. The Group also had interests in one associate and twenty one joint ventures totalling HK$45,172 million, whose principal activities were holding overseas investment properties.  The fair values of these investment properties, whether held by the Group directly or by associate or joint ventures, were mainly determined based on valuations by independent professional valuers.  Such valuations involved significant judgments and estimates, including the valuation methodologies and the assumptions used.\n\nThe audit procedures on valuation of investment properties at fair value included:\n\n- obtaining and reviewing the valuation reports of investment properties held by the Group directly or by associate or joint ventures, and verifying that the fair values were based on the valuations stated in the valuation reports;\n- assessing the independence and qualifications of the valuers; and\n- evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information.  The other information comprises all the information included in the 2021 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.  If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact.  I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.  I also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.  The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.  If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion.  My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report.  However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and\n- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements.  I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit.  I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.  I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nJohn Chu Director of

觀點\n\n本人謹此證明，我已審核《外匯基金》及其附屬機構（「本集團」）刊載於第217至319頁的《財務報表》，該《財務報表》包括《外匯基金》及本集團於2021年12月31日的資產負債表，以及截至該日止年度的收入及支出表、全面收益表、權益變動表及現金流量表，以及對《財務報表》的附註，其中包括重要的《會計政策》概要。\n\n我認為，截至二零二一年十二月三十一日，該基金及本集團的財務報表真實及公允地反映了其財務狀況，並按照香港會計師公會（「香港會計師公會」）發佈的香港財務報告準則（「香港財務報告準則」）呈報了該年度的財務表現及現金流量，並已根據外匯基金條例第七條行政長官指示妥善編製（第66章）。\n\n# 意見的依據\n\n我根據行政長官根據《外匯基金條例》第7條頒佈的指示以及審計署的審計準則進行審計。根據這些準則，我在審計財務報表方面的責任進一步載於我的報告中「審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任」一節。根據這些準則，我與該集團保持獨立性，並已按照這些準則履行其他道德責任。我相信我所取得的審計憑證已足夠且恰當，足以作為我發表意見的基礎。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項為我在審計截至二零二一年十二月三十一日止年度的財務報表時，根據我的專業判斷認為最為重要的事項。 這些事項已在我的財務報表整體審計範圍內加以處理，並在形成我對此的意見時予以考慮，我不會就這些事項提供獨立意見。\n\n# 金融資產及金融負債按公平值計價。\n\n請參閱財務報表的附註 2.5、2.6 及 38.1。\n\n截至2021年12月31日，集團的金融資產總額為港元4,502,475億元，金融負債總額為港元1,150,861億元，按公平值計。\n\n對於這些金融資產中的89%以及所有這些金融負債，其公允價值係以活躍市場的報價（第1級參數）為基礎，或係以可觀察市場數據為基礎的估值方法（第2級參數）所估算。\n\n對於這些金融資產中剩餘的11%，其公允價值係採用估值方法估算，該方法所用的輸入數據並非基於可觀察市場數據（第3層輸入數據）。此類金融資產總計港元5173.16億，主要包括非上市投資基金。\n\n鑑於涉及的金額龐大且所涉及的估計複雜，按公平值計量金融資產和金融負債的評估是關鍵審計事項。\n\n有關以公平值計價之金融資產及金融負債之評估審計程序包括：\n\n取得對用以評估不同類別金融資產及金融負債之程序（包括相關控制措施）之了解；評估及測試控制措施，包括電腦系統之相關應用控制措施；取得有關金融資產及金融負債之評估、存在、權利與義務及完整性之外部確認；若使用報價市場價格，則驗證價格是否來自獨立來源；若使用以可觀察市場數據為基礎之輸入資料之估值方法，則評估估值方法之適當性及假設之合理性，並驗證輸入資料是否來自獨立來源；若使用以非可觀察市場數據為基礎之輸入資料之估值方法，則評估估值方法之適當性及假設與輸入資料之合理性。\n\n# 投資物業按公平值計價\n\n請參閱財務報表的附註 2.11、18 及 19。\n\n本集團的投資物業按其公允價值列賬，於二零二一年十二月三十一日達港元二萬七千零八十九百萬港元。本集團亦於一家聯營公司及二十一家合營企業中持有權益，總額為港元四萬五千一百七十二百萬港元，其主要業務為持有海外投資物業。 這些投資物業的公允價值，無論是由本集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營企業持有，主要根據獨立專業估值師的估值確定。 該等估值涉及重大的判斷和估計，包括估值方法和所用假設。\n\n對投資物業以公平值作估值的審計程序包括：\n\n取得並審閱集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合資企業持有的投資物業的估值報告，並核實公允價值是否基於估值報告中所述的估值；評估估值師的獨立性及資格；以及評估估值方法的適當性及假設和輸入數據的合理性。\n\n# 其他資訊\n\n金融管理專員對其他資訊負有責任。 該等其他資訊包括金管局二零二一年年報內所載的所有資訊，除財務報表及其隨附的審計報告外。\n\n我對財務報表的意見並不涵蓋其他資訊，我亦不會就該等資訊表達任何形式的鑒證結論。\n\n與我審計財務報表有關，我的責任是閱讀其他資訊，並在此過程中評估該等資訊是否與財務報表或我在審計過程中或以其他方式所獲得的知識存在重大不一致，或是否有重大錯誤陳述的跡象。如果根據我所進行的工作，我得出結論認為此其他資訊存在重大錯誤陳述，我需要報告該事實。 在此方面，我沒有任何事項需要報告。\n\n# 金融管理專員及外匯基金諮詢委員會審核委員會關於財務報表的職責\n\n金融管理專員須根據香港會計師公會頒佈的香港財務報告準則及行政長官根據《外匯基金條例》第7條發出的指示，負責編製財務報表，以反映真實及公允的觀點，並制定必要的內部控制措施，以確保財務報表免受重大錯誤陳述的影響，無論該等錯誤是因欺詐還是錯誤所致。\n\n在編製財務報表時，金融管理專員須評估集團持續經營的能力，根據適用情況披露與持續經營相關的事項，並採用持續經營作為會計基礎。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會的審核委員會負責監督本集團的財務報告過程。\n\n# 審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任\n\n我的目標是取得合理保證，以確認財務報表整體是否不存在重大錯誤陳述，無論是因舞弊或錯誤所致，並出具包含我意見的審計報告。合理保證是一種高水平的保證，但並不能保證根據審計署的審計準則進行的審計始終能發現存在的重大錯誤陳述。錯誤陳述可能來自舞弊或錯誤，若個別或合併起來，合理預期會影響使用者基於這些財務報表所做出的經濟決策，則視為重大。\n\n作為根據審計署的審計準則進行審計的一部分，我會在整個審計過程中運用專業判斷力並保持專業懷疑態度。我亦：\n\n- 識別及評估財務報表存在重大錯誤陳述的風險，無論是因欺詐或錯誤造成，設計並執行適當的審計程序，並取得足夠且適當的審計憑證，以作為我意見的依據。因欺詐可能涉及勾結、偽造、故意遺漏、虛偽或凌駕內部控制，未發現因欺詐導致的重大錯誤陳述的風險高於未發現因錯誤導致的重大錯誤陳述的風險；\n- 為了設計在情況下適當的審計程序，我需要了解與審計相關的內部控制，但此目的並非為了對該集團的內部控制的有效性表示意見；\n- 評估所使用的會計政策的恰當性以及金融管理專員所做的會計估計及相關披露的合理性；\n- 得出結論關於金融管理專員使用持續經營作為會計基礎的恰當性，並根據取得的審計憑證，判斷是否存在與可能對該集團持續經營的能力產生重大疑慮的事件或情況相關的重大不確定性。如果我得出結論認為存在重大不確定性，我必須在我的審計報告中對財務報表中的相關披露事項加以提示，或者如果這些披露事項不足，則修改我的意見。我的結論是基於在我的審計報告日之前取得的審計憑證。然而，未來事件或情況可能導致該集團無法持續經營；\n- 評估財務報表的整體呈現、結構和內容，包括披露事項，以及財務報表是否以實現公允表達的方式反映了基礎交易和事件；以及\n- 取得關於集團內實體或業務活動的財務信息足夠且適當的審計憑證，以對財務報表表示意見。我對集團審計的指導、監督和執行負責。我對我的審計意見負有單獨的責任。\n\n我會與外匯基金諮詢委員會的審核委員會就審計的計劃範圍和時間安排，以及重要的審計發現（包括我在審計過程中發現的任何內部控制重大缺陷）等事項進行溝通。\n\n我亦向外匯基金諮詢委員會的審核委員會提供聲明，確認我已遵守有關獨立性的相關倫理要求，並向他們通報所有可能與我的獨立性存在關聯的關係及其他事項，以及在適用情況下，提供相關保障措施。\n\n從與外匯基金諮詢委員會審核委員會溝通的事項中，我確定那些在本期財務報表審計中具有最重大意義的事項，因此這些即為關鍵審計事項。除非法律或法規禁止公開披露有關事項，或在極少數情況下，我認為披露該事項的不利後果將合理地超過披露該事項的公共利益效益，否則我會在審計師報告中說明這些事項。\n\n朱約翰 審計署署長\n"}

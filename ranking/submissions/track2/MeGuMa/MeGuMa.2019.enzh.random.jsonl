{"en":"The year of 2019 has been anything but uneventful.\n\nUS-China trade tensions remained a big wild card. Lingering uncertainties over trade talks between the world’s two largest economies rattled investor confidence and undermined international trade, manufacturing, investment and even consumption. Gone are the days when global economic expansion was a given. The global economy entered a synchronised slowdown during the year. In response to the slower growth, major central banks around the world have reversed course on their monetary policy normalisation.\n\nLocally, social incidents happening in the second half of the year dealt a further blow to the Hong Kong economy. The retail, tourism and catering sectors were among the hardest hit. For 2019 as a whole, the Hong Kong economy contracted by 1.2%, the first annual decline in a decade, while the unemployment rate rose to 3.3% from a multi-year low of 2.8% at the beginning of the year. As 2020 dawned, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak posed yet another significant threat to both global and local economies.\n\nIn the face of such an uncertain and challenging environment, it is of paramount importance to maintain monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong, as I made clear when taking over as Chief Executive of the HKMA on 1 October 2019.\n\n# Monetary and financial stability: the bedrock of an international financial centre\n\nThe Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) in place since 1983 has helped Hong Kong weather numerous challenges and shocks, demonstrating its important role as an anchor of Hong Kong’s economic prosperity and status as an international financial centre. Notwithstanding the challenging external and domestic environment during the year, the LERS continued to operate in a smooth and orderly manner, once again proving its resilience in times of uncertainty. Hong Kong’s banking system also remained sound and robust. The facts speak for themselves: the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained stable and has strengthened to the strong side of the Convertibility Zone in recent months, while bank deposits continued to grow during the year. In a nutshell, no noticeable outflow of funds from the Hong Kong dollar or the banking system was observed.\n\nThe stability of Hong Kong’s monetary and banking systems reflects not only the robustness of, but also strong confidence in, our systems. This did not happen overnight, but through years of efforts to build up buffers and strengthen surveillance, complemented by our swift response to rumours on social media platforms.\n\nOur preparations over the years for rainy days have built a solid foundation and strong buffers for Hong Kong’s monetary and banking systems. In addition to the vast foreign exchange reserves in our public coffers, our banking system has strong capital buffers, robust liquidity and very good asset quality, whether by international or historical standards. The eight rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures on property mortgages implemented since 2009 have also greatly enhanced banks’ resilience against a property market downturn.\n\nMarket surveillance and banking supervision make up the core part of our work in maintaining monetary and banking stability, and we have been strengthening our surveillance and supervisory framework from time to time. Apart from close monitoring of the credit and liquidity risks of banks, one of our new endeavours in the year was to make use of technology and granular data collected from banks to enhance our capability to monitor Hong Kong dollar funding and financial market activities in a more in-depth and timely manner. Stress tests and contingency planning have also been augmented in the light of the fast evolving economic and operating environment.\n\nIndeed, our robust regulatory regime has won strong endorsements internationally. During the year, the International Monetary Fund reaffirmed that Hong Kong was well placed to address both cyclical and structural changes, given its significant buffers. Hong Kong’s effective legal and institutional framework for combatting money laundering and terrorist financing also obtained a positive assessment from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), making Hong Kong the first in the Asia-pacific region to achieve an overall compliant result in the FATF’s Mutual Evaluation.\n\nConfidence is the foundation for the proper functioning of markets and is crucial to the safeguarding of monetary and financial stability. To maintain market confidence, we have to be on high alert for, and respond swiftly to, any malicious rumours that may potentially cast doubt on Hong Kong’s monetary or banking systems. This is particularly important given the prevalent use of social media and instant messaging nowadays. While a variety of rumours were spread on social media platforms by fearmongers during the outbreak of social unrest, our quick and clear rebuttals to these rumours through social media, in addition to traditional media, proved useful and effective in clearing the air, quelling false rumours from spreading further, and upholding international and public confidence in our systems.\n\n# Banking system: an important pillar of economic activity\n\nThe banking sector, as an essential pillar of economic activity, plays a fundamental role in ensuring the smooth running of society and the economy. Despite the challenging operating environment since the latter half of the year, banks have been working hard alongside others and doing their utmost to maintain normal operation of their core functions and continue serving businesses and the public.\n\nIn addition to basic banking services like deposits and transfers, an important function of banks is in extending credit to borrowers in support of the real economy. We are well aware of, and concerned about, the cash-flow problem facing businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), under the difficult economic conditions. While safeguarding banking stability, we have launched a number of initiatives to ensure continued funding support to SMEs. In particular, the Countercyclical Capital Buffer ratio of banks was reduced on two occasions, in October 2019 and March 2020, by a total of 150 basis points to 1.0%; the level of regulatory reserve requirement on banks was also reduced by half in April 2020. These measures release a total of around HK$1 trillion in lending capacity, providing banks with more room for lending to enterprises including SMEs. We have also set up a platform – the Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism – bringing together major banks in Hong Kong to explore and discuss specific measures to strengthen funding support for SMEs. I am pleased to see that many banks have responded proactively to our call and introduced relief measures such as principal moratorium for customers in need to ride out the storm.\n\nIn view of some SMEs’ feedback about difficulties in opening bank accounts, which is the very first step in accessing various banking services, we have made dedicated efforts to address this issue over the past few years. Our work is bearing fruit, as improvement in account opening for businesses is visible. As a further step to promote financial inclusion, the HKMA spearheaded the launch of tiered account services – Simple Bank Accounts (SBAs) with a streamlined customer due diligence process – to provide start-ups and SMEs with an alternative to traditional bank accounts. More than 2,800 SBAs have been opened so far.\n\n# International financial centre: from strength to strength\n\nWe have always been mindful of the need to strike a reasonable balance between regulation and development. Given the intense competition among financial centres, we have to work hard to strengthen Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre and thereby ensure its longer term stability. There are four key areas of work: technology, green finance, financial connectivity with the Mainland, and talent development.\n\n# Embracing technology in the digital era\n\nHong Kong has been moving fast in promoting financial technology (fintech) since the establishment of the HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office in 2016 and the introduction of the Smart Banking initiatives in 2017.\n\nOn the payment front, the vibrancy of the fintech ecosystem is evident in the strong momentum in the adoption of the Faster Payment System (FPS), the world’s first multi-currency, cross-banks and e-wallets, real-time retail payment platform. FPS registrations reached four million within a short span of 15 months, representing a high rate of penetration in a population of 7.5 million people. The Government has also adopted the FPS to provide the public with greater convenience in paying taxes, rates and water charges. More and more businesses are expected to use this fast, safe and convenient means of receiving and making payment to enhance operational efficiency.\n\nIn the banking sector, significant progress was seen in applying fintech to their banking services and business operations. According to a study conducted by the HKMA, almost 90% of the surveyed retail banks have adopted, or are planning to adopt, artificial intelligence in their business applications. With the HKMA’s facilitation, banks have been applying big data and consumer behavioural analytics in their personal credit products. They have also launched over 800 Open Application programming Interfaces in the first two phases, covering a range of banking products and services. While encouraging banks to use fintech, we did not lose sight of the need for enhanced technology risk management and consumer protection in digital banking services. Timely supervisory guidance has been provided to banks in these areas.\n\nRegulatory technology (Regtech) is another area of great interest to banks, for its potential of enabling banks to conduct regulatory compliance and risk management, particularly in anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT), more efficiently and cost-effectively. To facilitate greater industry adoption of Regtech and the building of a wider Regtech ecosystem, the HKMA organised the inaugural AML\/CFT Regtech Forum and issued its first Regtech newsletter in November to discuss possible use cases of Regtech. At the same time, the HKMA, as a banking supervisor, is exploring the use of supervisory technology (Suptech), including new data science and analytics, to enhance work effectiveness and efficiency. We have embarked on a series of studies and developed a road map for the implementation of Suptech in the next few years.\n\nFrom a broader perspective, this is only the start of the fintech journey in the banking sector. The HKMA granted eight licences to virtual banks during the year. One of the virtual banks officially launched its services in March 2020, while some other virtual banks have commenced pilot trials through the HKMA’s Fintech Supervisory Sandbox. I look forward to the launch of the other virtual banks and the introduction of more innovative and diversified banking services to the people of Hong Kong that would help raise the global competitiveness of our banking sector.\n\nMore exciting developments are also expected at the international level. After successfully completing a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) trial to connect our blockchain-based trade finance platform, eTradeConnect, with its European counterpart, we are conducting another PoC trial with the platform of the people’s Bank of China, paving the way for the digitalisation of cross-border trades. We have begun a joint research project with the Bank of Thailand to study the application of Central Bank Digital Currency to cross-border payments. The Bank for International Settlements also put its first Innovation Hub Centre into operation in Hong Kong in November to foster fintech collaboration within the central banking community. All these developments present clear evidence of Hong Kong’s leading global position in fintech development.\n\n# Promoting green and sustainable finance for a better future\n\nClimate-related risks have drawn increasing global attention in recent years. To contribute to the global efforts in addressing this challenge, the HKMA unveiled three key measures in May to promote green finance development in Hong Kong in different capacities.\n\nAs a banking supervisor, the HKMA is undertaking a three-phased approach to promoting green and sustainable banking. A framework for assessing the “greenness” of banks has been developed for industry consultation under phase I, paving the way for the formulation of supervisory expectations and requirements for the banking industry under phase II and implementation under phase III.\n\nAs the manager of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA actively advances responsible investment by integrating environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into its investment activities. Specifically, we have adopted the principle of giving priority to green and ESG investments if their long-term return is comparable to other investments on a risk-adjusted basis. After venturing into the green bond market in 2015 as one of the early investors, we will continue to grow our green bond portfolio and invest in other ESG assets. We will also join hands with like-minded investors and regulators to promote best practices on ESG through our participation in international organisations in the ESG community.\n","terms":{"achievements":["成果"],"strengthened":["加強"],"enhanced":["加強"],"need":["需要"],"COVID-19":["新型冠狀病毒"],"cast":["造成"],"merchants":["商戶"],"established":["設立"],"challenges":["挑戰"],"corporates":["企業"],"must":["必須"],"work":["工作"],"historical":["歷史"],"orderly":["有序"],"world":["全球"],"15":["15"],"enhance":["提升"],"areas":["範疇"],"span":["短短"],"economy":["經濟"],"sight":["忽略"],"people":["市民"],"rest":["其餘"],"800,000":["80萬"],"June":["6月"],"including":["包括"],"’":["’"],"facing":["面對"],"borrowers":["借款人"],"half":["一半"],"anything":["跌宕起伏"],"2009":["2009年"],"environmentfriendly":["具環保意識"],"happen":["發生"],"November":["11月"],"granular":["細緻"],"800":["800"],"provide":["提供"],"record":["紀錄"],"make":["制定"],"support":["支持"],"new":["新"],"applied":["應用"],"year":["年"],"evolving":["變化"],"applying":["應用"],"face":["面對"],"launch":["推出"],"principle":["原則"],"phases":["階段"],"According":["根據"],"thereby":["從而"],"stable":["穩定"],"achieve":["取得"],"economies":["經濟體"],"foot":["步伐"],"greatly":["大大"],"billion":["億"],"almost":["接近"],"particularly":["特別"],"fulfil":["履行"],"society":["社會"],"providing":["提供"],"put":["投入"],"rumours":["謠言"],"bearing":["顯著"],"opportunities":["機遇"],"doubt":["懷疑"],"Apart":["除了"],"set":["設立"],"major":["重大"],"rounds":["輪"],"operation":["運作"],"also":["亦"],"regard":["顧及"],"hard":["困難"],"promoting":["推動"],"1.0":["1.0%"],"addressing":["應對"],"would":["將"],"applications":["應用"],"like":["例如"],"sound":["穩健"],"talks":["研討會"],"weather":["抵禦"],"years":["年"],"experienced":["經歷"],"2014":["2014年"],"journey":["旅程"],"challenge":["挑戰"],"broader":["更廣"],"eight":["8"],"sharing":["分享"],"paving":["鋪路"],"latter":["下半年"],"efficiency":["效率"],"cross-banks":["跨行"],"release":["釋放"],"perspective":["角度"],"2.8":["2.8%"],"calm":["冷靜"],"advances":["推進"],"specific":["具體"],"since":["自"],"accessing":["使用"],"opportunity":["機會"],"begun":["開始"],"anchor":["基石"],"step":["步驟"],"uncertainty":["不確定性"],"complemented":["輔以"],"nutshell":["簡單而言"],"address":["應對"],"dedication":["全力"],"worst":["最大"],"fears":["憂慮"],"tensions":["摩擦"],"1983":["1983年"],"activity":["活動"],"fruit":["成效"],"capabilities":["能力"],"SMEs":["中小企"],"discuss":["討論"],"functioning":["運作"],"monitor":["監察"],"challenging":["困難"],"150":["150"],"strengthening":["加強"],"launched":["推出"],"completing":["完成"],"–":["—"],"breakthrough":["突破"],"another":["另一"],"1987":["1987年"],"crises":["危機"],"90":["九成"],"first":["首個"],"capability":["能力"],"strike":["取得"],"businesses":["企業"],"spearheaded":["推動"],"air":["疑慮（釋除疑慮）"],"60":["六成"],"strong":["強大"],"paying":["繳交"],"media":["媒體"],"upgrading":["提升"],"number":["數目"],"well":["良好"],"vital":["重要"],"ahead":["前路"],"numerous":["多次"],"significant":["重大"],"grow":["增長"],"II":["第二階段"],"confidence":["信心"],"rebuttals":["澄清"],"science":["科學"],"light":["因應"],"comparable":["相若"],"structural":["結構性"],"clear":["明確"],"Lingering":["持續"],"firm":["堅定"],"power":["實力"],"swiftly":["迅速"],"us":["我們"],"three":["三"],"trial":["試驗"],"overnight":["一夜之間"],"Consolidating":["鞏固"],"unique":["獨特"],"reached":["達到"],"regulation":["監管"],"within":["內"],"responded":["響應"],"terrorist":["恐怖分子"],"representing":["相當於"],"2016":["2016年"],"May":["5月"],"contracted":["收縮"],"big":["大"],"downturn":["逆轉"],"decent":["理想"],"time":["時"],"months":["個月"],"well-entrenched":["難以取代"],"invest":["投資"],"plays":["發揮"],"help":["幫助"],"smooth":["暢順"],"past":["過去"],"good":["良好"],"Upgrading":["提升"],"gain":["爭取"],"continued":["繼續"],"hit":["打擊"],"cyclical":["周期性"],"greenness":["綠色基準"],"whole":["整體"],"intelligence":["智能（人工智能）"],"drawn":["備受"],"together":["一同"],"encouraging":["鼓勵"],"penetration":["滲透率"],"million":["百萬"],"AoF":["金融學院（Academy

貨幣與金融穩定：國際金融中心的基石\n\n自1983年實施的聯繫匯率制度（LERS）幫助香港抵禦了多次挑戰和衝擊，展現了其作為香港經濟繁榮基石及國際金融中心地位的重要作用。儘管當年面對困難的內外環境，聯繫匯率制度仍繼續以暢順有序的方式運作，再一次證明其在不確定性時期的韌性。香港的銀行體系亦仍然穩健強大。港元匯率在近月保持穩定，並加強至兌換範圍的強大範圍內，而銀行存款在當年持續增長。簡單而言，未觀察到香港元或銀行體系出現明顯資金外流。\n\n香港的貨幣和銀行體系的穩定性，不僅反映我們體系的穩健，亦反映我們對體系的強大信心。這並非一夜之間發生，而是經過多年的努力，建立緩衝機制並加強監測，輔以我們對社交媒體平台上謠言的迅速回應。\n\n多年來為雨天所做的準備已為香港的貨幣及銀行體系建立穩固根基及強大緩衝。除我們公共資金內龐大外匯儲備外，銀行體系亦具強大資本緩衝、強健流動性及非常良好的資產質素，無論按國際或歷史標準均屬優異。自2009年起實施的八輪針對物業按揭的逆周期宏觀審慎措施亦大大加強銀行體系對物業市場逆轉的抗風險能力。\n\n市場監察及銀行監督構成我們維持貨幣及銀行體系穩定工作的核心部分，我們亦不時加強監察及監督架構。除了緊密監察銀行的信貸及流動性風險外，我們今年的新舉措之一，是運用從銀行收集的科技及細緻資料，以更深入及適時的方式提升監察港元融資及金融市場活動的能力。同時，亦因應經濟及營運環境快速變化，加強壓力測試及應變計劃。\n\n事實上，我們強大而完善的監管制度已獲得國際社會的廣泛認可。今年，國際貨幣基金組織再次肯定香港具有良好條件應對周期性及結構性變動，鑒於其具備重大緩衝能力。香港在打擊洗錢及恐怖分子融資方面的有效法律及制度架構亦獲得金融行動特別任務組（FATF）正面評估，使香港成為亞太區內首個在FATF互認評估中取得整體合規結果的地區。\n\n信心是市場正常運作的根基，對於保障貨幣和金融穩定至關重要。為了維持市場信心，我們必須對任何可能造成對香港貨幣或銀行系統懷疑的惡意謠言保持高警覺，並迅速回應。鑒於現今社交媒體和即時通訊的普及，這點特別重要。儘管在社會事件爆發期間，恐慌製造者透過社交媒體平台傳播了不同謠言，但我們透過社交媒體以及傳統媒體對這些謠言所做的迅速且明確澄清，證明了其有用性及有效性，有助於釋除疑慮，制止不實謠言進一步傳播，並維持國際及公眾對我們系統的信心。\n\n# 銀行體系：經濟活動的重要支柱\n\n銀行業作為經濟活動的重要支柱，發揮著基本作用，確保社會和經濟的暢順運作。儘管自下半年以來經營環境困難，銀行業仍與其他各方一同工作，竭盡全力維持其核心功能的正常運作，並繼續服務企業和公眾。\n\n此外，除了存款和轉帳等基本銀行服務外，銀行的重要功能是向借款人提供信貸，以支持實體經濟。我們良好明白並關切企業，尤其中小企，在困難經濟環境下所面對的資金周轉問題。在保障銀行穩定的同時，我們已推出數目眾多的措施，以確保對中小企的持續資金支持。特別是，銀行的逆周期資本緩衝比率在2019年10月及2020年3月兩次下調，總共下調150個基點至1.0%；銀行的監管存款準備金率亦在2020年4月下調一半。這些措施釋放約一萬億港元的貸款空間，為銀行提供更多空間向企業，包括中小企，提供貸款。我們亦設立了一個平台——銀行業中小企貸款協調機制，匯聚香港的重大銀行，一同探索及討論具體措施，以加強對中小企的資金支持。我樂見不少銀行積極響應我們的呼籲，並為有需要的客戶引入例如還息不還本等紓困措施，以克服難關。\n\n鑒於部分中小企反映開立銀行帳戶存在困難，而這正是使用各項銀行服務的首個步驟，我們在過去數年來致力應對這個問題。我們的努力已作出成效，企業開戶的改善情況可見。為進一步推動金融普及，香港金融管理局推動推出分級帳戶服務——簡易帳戶，並精簡客戶盡職審查流程，為初創企業和中小企提供傳統銀行帳戶的替代方案。至今已有超過2,800個簡易帳戶開立。\n\n# 國際金融中心：實力不斷提升\n\n我們一直留意到需要在監管與發展之間取得合理平衡。鑒於金融中心當中激烈的競爭，我們必須努力工作以加強香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力，從而確保其更長期的穩定。有四大重點工作範疇：科技、綠色金融、與內地的金融聯通以及人才發展。\n\n# 迎向科技於數碼時代\n\n香港自2016年設立香港金融管理局金融科技促進辦公室，以及2017年引入智慧銀行計劃以來，在推動金融科技發展方面一直快速發展。\n\n在支付方面，金融科技生態系統的活力於快速支付系統（轉數快）的強大勢頭中可見，它是全球首個多幣、跨行及電子錢包，實時零售支付平台。轉數快登記數目在短短15個月內達到四百萬，相當於人口750萬市民的高滲透率。政府亦採用轉數快為市民提供繳交稅款、差餉和水費的更大方便。預期越來越多企業會使用這種快速、安全和方便的方式收取及付款，以提升效率。\n\n在銀行業，應用金融科技於銀行服務及營運方面已取得重大進展。根據香港金融管理局進行的一項研究，接近九成受訪的零售銀行已採用，或正計劃採用人工（智能）於其業務應用中。在香港金融管理局的協助下，銀行已開始在其個人信貸產品中應用大數據及消費者行為（分析）。他們亦已在首兩個階段推出逾800個開放應用程式介面，涵蓋一系列銀行產品及服務。雖然我們鼓勵銀行使用金融科技，但我們亦沒有忽略在數碼銀行服務中加強科技風險管理及消費者保障的需要。我們已適時向銀行提供監管指引，以處理這些範疇的問題。\n\n監管科技（Regtech）是銀行備受關注的另一個領域，因其潛在能力可支持銀行更有效且有效益地進行合規管理和風險控制，特別是在反洗錢及反恐融資（AML\/CFT）方面。為促進業界更廣泛採用Regtech並建立更廣的Regtech生態系統，香港金融管理局（HKMA）於11月舉辦了首屆AML\/CFT Regtech論壇，並發佈了首份Regtech通訊，以探討Regtech的可能應用情況。同時，作為銀行監管機構，HKMA正探討應用監管科技（Suptech），包括新興的數據科學與分析技術，以提升工作成效與效率。我們已開展一系列研究，並制定了未來幾年落實Suptech的藍圖。\n\n從更廣的角度來看，這僅是銀行業金融科技旅程的開始。香港金融管理局於今年批出8個虛擬銀行牌照。其中一家虛擬銀行於2020年3月正式推出服務，而其他一些虛擬銀行已透過香港金融管理局的金融科技監管沙盒開始先導試驗。我期待其他虛擬銀行的推出，以及向香港市民引入更多創新和多元的銀行服務，將幫助提高我們銀行業的全球競爭力。\n\n更多精彩發展亦預期在國際層面出現。在成功完成一個連接我們區塊鏈貿易融資平台eTradeConnect與其歐洲對接夥伴的試驗後，我們正在進行另一試驗，與中國人民銀行平台合作，為跨境貿易的數碼化鋪路。我們已開始與泰國銀行合作進行一項聯合研究項目，以研究中央銀行數碼貨幣在跨境支付中的應用。國際清算銀行亦於11月在香港投入首個創新樞紐中心運作，以促進中央銀行界別內的金融科技合作。所有這些發展都明確顯示了香港在金融科技發展方面的領先全球地位。\n\n# 推動綠色與可持續金融，邁向更好未來\n\n氣候相關風險近月年備受增加的全球關注。為貢獻於全球應對這項挑戰的努力，香港金融管理局於5月公布三項關鍵措施，以在不同領域推動香港的綠色金融發展。\n\n作為銀行監管機構，香港金融管理局正推動一個三個階段的途徑，以推動綠色及可持續銀行業發展。已於第一階段為行業諮詢而制定評估銀行的「綠色基準」框架，為制定銀行業的監管預期及要求於第二階段及落實於第三階段鋪路。\n\n作為交易所基金的管理機構，香港金融管理局積極推進負責任投資，將環境、社會及管治（ESG）因素納入其投資活動中。具體而言，我們已採用「優先考慮」綠色及ESG投資的原則，若其長線回報在風險調整後與其他投資相若。自2015年作為首批投資者之一進軍綠色債券市場後，我們將繼續擴大綠色債券投資組合，並投資其他ESG資產。我們亦會攜手理念相近的投資者及監管機構，透過參與ESG社群的國際組織，推動ESG最佳實踐。\n"}
{"en":"# Highlights of 2019\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nThe Hong Kong economy softens in 2019 amid global economic slowdown, lingering US-China trade tensions and local social incidents, while the labour market faces increasing pressures.\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector remains sound and resilient, with strong capital positions, robust liquidity and healthy asset quality.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nDespite the challenging external and internal environment, Hong Kong’s monetary system is firmly intact, as evidenced by the stable Hong Kong dollar exchange rate and the smooth functioning of the foreign exchange and money markets. This reflects not only the robustness of but also strong confidence in Hong Kong’s monetary system. \n\nA new Resolution Facility is introduced and a number of refinements are made within the HKMA’s updated Liquidity Facilities Framework.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA puts great effort in monitoring the credit and liquidity risk management of banks to maintain banking stability. Good progress is also made on promoting smart banking, including the granting of eight virtual bank licences and encouraging the adoption of regulatory technology. These efforts are complemented by strengthened supervision of banks’ technology risk management and enhanced consumer protection in digital financial services.\n\nThe HKMA streamlines investor protection measures to enhance customer experience while taking further steps to promote a customer-centric bank culture.\n\nHong Kong’s anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism regime earns positive assessment from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), making it the first FATF-member jurisdiction in the Asia-pacific region to achieve an overall compliant result in FATF’s fourth-round Mutual Evaluation.\n\nNew rules and regulations are rolled out to enhance the banking regulatory regime in line with the latest international standards. A three-phased approach is announced to promote green and sustainable banking in Hong Kong, contributing to global efforts in addressing climate change.\n\nAt the same time, the HKMA makes significant progress in operationalising the resolution regime for banks, in particular driving the build-up of a new layer of loss-absorbing capacity at domestic systemically important banks to promote financial stability.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\nThe fintech ecosystem in Hong Kong is gaining strong momentum, with good progress in the implementation of the Open Application programming Interface Framework in the banking sector, establishment of the world’s first Bank for International Settlements Innovation Hub Centre, and continued increase in the use of the Faster payment System for e-payments.\n\nHong Kong maintains a firm foothold as the global hub for offshore renminbi business. In the context of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area development, financial connectivity with the Mainland is being enhanced, and access to financial services by Hong Kong residents is made more convenient.\n\nMuch effort is made to open up new opportunities to further enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, particularly in infrastructure investment and financing, green finance and private equity funds.\n\nThe Hong Kong Academy of Finance is set up to serve as a centre of excellence for developing financial leadership and a repository of knowledge in monetary and financial research, including applied research.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\nBenefiting from a favourable investment environment, the Exchange Fund achieves the second highest investment income on record, of HK$262.2 billion, representing an investment return of 6.6%.\n\nThe HKMA deepens its effort in investment diversification, especially into the LongTerm Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The LTGP records an annualised internal rate of return of 12.6% since its inception in 2009. There is also encouraging progress in advancing responsible investment.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communication with the community and the market through traditional and social media, website, Information Centre and various other channels to facilitate public understanding of its policies and operations.\n\nWithin the institution, the HKMA attaches great importance to upholding corporate governance by supporting professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline and enhancing IT security to cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives and the increasing complexity of

回軟，勞工市場 面臨 增加 的 壓力。\n\n香港銀行業保持穩健且有韌性，擁有強大資本基礎、充足的流動性及健康的資產質素。\n\n# 貨幣穩定性\n\n儘管面對困難的外部及內部環境，香港的貨幣制度穩固且穩健，這反映在穩定的港元匯率及外匯和貨幣市場的暢順運作。這不僅反映香港貨幣制度的穩健，亦反映對香港貨幣制度的強大信心。\n\n一個新的解決方案機制被引入，並在金管局修訂的流動性設施框架內作出數目優化措施。\n\n# 銀行業穩定性\n\n香港金融管理局投放巨大努力，監測銀行的信貸及流動性風險管理，以維持銀行體系穩定。在推動智慧銀行方面亦作出良好進展，包括授予8間虛擬銀行牌照，以及鼓勵採用監管科技。這些努力亦輔以加強對銀行科技風險管理的監督，以及加強數碼金融服務的消費者保障。\n\n金管局理順投資者保護措施，以提升客戶經驗，並在舉措上進一步推動以客戶為中心的銀行文化。\n\n香港的反洗錢及反恐融資制度獲得金融行動特別小組（FATF）給予正面評估，使其成為亞太區首個在FATF第四輪互認評估中取得整體合規結果的FATF成員司法管轄區。\n\n新規則及規範被推出，以符合最新國際標準，並提升銀行監管體系。三個階段的方案被公布，以推動香港的綠色及可持續銀行業，並成為應對氣候變化的全球努力的一部分。\n\n與此同時，香港金融管理局作出重大進展，以具體化銀行解決機制，特別是推動本地系統重要銀行建立一層新的吸納虧損能力，以推動金融穩定。\n\n# 國際金融中心\n\n香港的金融科技生態系統正增強勢頭，在銀行業落實開放應用程式介面框架方面取得良好進展，設立了全球首個國際結算銀行創新中心，並繼續增加使用更快支付系統進行電子支付。\n\n香港保持堅定立足點，作為全球離岸人民幣業務中心。在廣東港澳珠澳大灣區發展的背景下，與內地的金融聯通被加強，並作出香港居民接觸金融服務更方便。\n\n大量努力已作出，以開放新的機遇，進一步提升香港金融平台的競爭力，特別是在基礎設施投資融資、綠色金融和私人股權基金方面。\n\n香港財務學院設立旨在服務於培育財務領導才能及成為貨幣及財務研究，包括應用研究的知識庫之卓越中心。\n\n# 備付金管理\n\n受益於利好的投資環境，投資基金錄得創紀錄的第二高投資收益，達至2,622億港元，相當於6.6%的投資回報。\n\n香港金融管理局深化其在投資多元化方面的努力，尤其著重於長期增長投資組合（LTGP）。自2009年成立以來，LTGP錄得年化內部回報率12.6%。在推動責任投資方面亦有鼓勵的進展。\n\n# 公司職能\n\n香港金管局透過傳統及社交媒體、網站、資訊中心及各項其他渠道，與社會和市場保持有效溝通，以促進公眾對其政策和營運的了解。\n\n在機構內，香港金融管理局重視維持公司治理的重要性，透過支持員工專業發展、訂立嚴格的財務紀律及提升資訊科技保安，以應對來自落實新舉措及工作日益增加的複雜度所帶來的挑戰。\n"}

{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nThe Hong Kong economy contracted in 2019, reflecting global economic slowdown, lingering US-China trade conflicts and local social incidents. As economic conditions deteriorated rapidly in the second half of the year, the labour market faced increasing pressures. Inflation also increased due to a sharp rise in pork prices. Economic performance for 2020 is expected to remain challenging as the novel coronavirus outbreak hits the already weakening economy. Given the difficult economic environment, the Government and the HKMA have rolled out measures to support the economy, especially households and small and medium-sized enterprises.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Real activities\n\nFollowing a 2.9% expansion in 2018, the Hong Kong economy contracted by 1.2% in 2019, marking the first annual contraction since 2009. In particular, the economy entered into a recession in the second half of the year, with the seasonally adjusted real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) shrinking consecutively in the second, third and fourth quarters (Table 1). The decline in economic activities reflected a notable reduction in domestic demand (Chart 1). As the local social incidents weighed significantly on consumption activities and sentiments in the latter part of the year, private consumption expenditure recorded the first annual decline since 2003. Overall investment spending also dropped amid dampened business sentiments. On the external front, slowing global economic growth and additional tariffs levied amid the US-China trade tensions led to a decline in Hong Kong’s exports of goods. Exports of services also saw the largest annual decline on record because the social incidents led to a severe deterioration in inbound tourism. With smaller domestic and re-export-induced demand, imports of goods and services also worsened. On a net basis, net trade contributed positively to GDP in 2019 (Chart 1) because total imports declined even faster than total exports.\n\nIn view of the strong economic headwinds, the Government introduced several rounds of measures between August and December 2019 to alleviate the financial burden of residents, safeguard jobs and support enterprises, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as well as those in the hard-hit sectors, such as retail, food services, transport and tourism. To allow banks to be more supportive to the domestic economy and help mitigate the economic cycle, the HKMA announced on 14 October a reduction in the Countercyclical Capital Buffer ratio of banks from 2.5% to 2.0%, thereby providing banks with more flexibility to release HK$200–300 billion in bank credit to enterprises including SMEs, and also established a Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism. A new relief measure for the 80% Guarantee product of the SME Financing Guarantee Scheme (SFGS) was introduced in September, allowing SME borrowers facing weakening cash flows to apply for principal moratorium to get immediate support. Further, a new 90% loan guarantee product under the SFGS was introduced in December to provide additional support to SMEs, businesses with relatively less operating experience, as well as professionals seeking to set up their own practices, to obtain financing.\n\n# Monetary conditions\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate and money markets functioned in a smooth and orderly manner in 2019. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained broadly stable throughout the year. As the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking was triggered in March, the HKMA purchased Hong Kong dollars from, and sold US dollars to, banks at the rate of HK$7.85\/US$1, leading to a decline in the Aggregate Balance in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System. The Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained largely steady at the longer end, while short-term rates generally picked up. At the retail level, several retail banks lowered their Best Lending Rates by 12.5 basis points in late October following the decreases in the target range for the US federal funds rate. As for monetary aggregates, total bank loans increased by 6.7% in 2019, up from 4.4% in 2018, and total deposits grew by 2.9% during the year.\n\n# Inflation\n\nThe underlying inflation rate, which nets out the effects of the Government’s one-off relief measures, rose slightly to 3.0% in 2019, from 2.6% in 2018. The mild increase in inflation was mainly driven by the elevated pork prices due to the disrupted supply of fresh pork since May (Chart 2). Excluding basic food items, price pressures were held at moderate levels throughout the year. In particular, the housing component of consumer price inflation softened in tandem with an earlier consolidation of fresh-letting private residential rentals. More broadly, the mild growth in nominal wages and the slower increase in commercial rentals1 helped keep local business costs in check. Externally, import price inflation moderated, in line with lower inflation in some of Hong Kong’s major import sources amid slower global economic growth.\n\n# Labour market\n\nThe labour market remained broadly resilient in the first half of 2019 but faced mounting pressures in the second half (Chart 3). After staying at a multi-year low of 2.8% in the first two quarters, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose to 2.9% in the third quarter and 3.3% in the final quarter, with those for the consumption and tourism-related sectors recording even more visible rises amid the social incidents. Overall labour demand also shrank visibly in the latter part of the year as total employment and the number of privatesector vacancies fell. The reduction in labour demand was particularly prominent in the retail, accommodation and food services sectors, as well as import\/export trade and construction sectors. On the supply side, the labour force participation rate edged down, partly due to a cyclical response to the economic recession. As the labour market came under increasing pressures, growth in nominal wage and earnings showed signs of a slowdown towards the end of the year.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe local stock market experienced sharp fluctuations during 2019. After a market rally in the first four months, the Hang Seng Index plunged in May due in part to concerns about the re-escalation of the US-China trade tensions (Chart 4). While recouping some lost ground in June in response to major central banks’ signals of a more accommodative monetary stance, stock prices came under pressure again amid slowing global economic growth and local social incidents. Towards the end of the year, stock prices regained some upward momentum following the announcement of a “phase one” trade agreement between the US and Mainland China. The Hang Seng Index finished the year at 28,190, registering an overall gain of 9.1% for the year. By contrast, the average daily turnover declined by about 19% from a year earlier. The listings of a major Mainland tech company and a leading beer manufacturer helped expand equity funds raised through initial public offerings (IpOs) to HK$314.2 billion in 2019. Hong Kong ranked first globally in terms of funds raised through IpOs for a second straight year in 2019.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market staged a strong rebound in the first five months of 2019 but generally softened in the remainder of the year. Market sentiment improved in early 2019 partly because concerns over US-China trade tensions temporarily eased, but the sentiment was dampened afterwards by the re-escalated US-China trade tensions, prolonged social incidents and weakened domestic economic conditions. Overall housing prices moderated by 5% from the peak in May through December, though still recording an annual growth of 5% due to a 10% rebound in the first five months (Chart 4). Transaction volume in 2019 increased by 4% to 59,797 units from a year earlier, reflecting the strong trading activities in the early part of the year. Housing affordability remained stretched, with the price-toincome ratio and the income-gearing ratio staying high at 17.9 and 80.9 respectively, far above their long-term averages.2 To assist home buyers with immediate housing needs, the Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation (HKMC) in mid-October raised the cap on the value of completed residential properties eligible for a mortgage loan under the Mortgage Insurance programme.3 On the other hand, the non-residential property market faced stronger downward pressures in 2019. In particular, both prices and rentals for retail premises registered the largest declines since the global financial crisis in 2008, reflecting the worsening business conditions during the year.\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nHong Kong’s economic performance for 2020 is expected to be very challenging, with significant near-term downside risks associated with the coronavirus outbreak. Some sectors, such as retail, accommodation, food services, tourism and transport, which have yet to recover from the disruptions caused by the social incidents, will be doubly hit. However, the countercyclical fiscal measures announced in the 2020\/21 Budget, which include a one-off cash handout and a new concessionary low-interest loan under the SFGS with 100% Government guarantee, are expected to provide some support to the economy, especially households and SMEs. On 16 March 2020, the HKMA further reduced the Countercyclical Capital Buffer ratio of banks from 2.0% to 1.0%, which will allow banks to be more supportive to the domestic economy, in particular those sectors and individuals that are expected to experience additional short-term stress due to the impact arising from the coronavirus outbreak. Analysed by GDP component, private consumption and investment are likely to remain weak because of the fragile consumer and business confidence. While government consumption will contribute to economic growth, public investment expenditure is anticipated to be relatively sluggish following the completion of some major infrastructure projects. On the external front, the “phase one” trade deal between the US and Mainland China is assessed to be slightly positive for the local economy in the short term. However, Hong Kong’s external trade performance will continue to be weighed down by weak global economic growth and trade flows. In particular, the coronavirus outbreak may lead to regional supply chain disruptions and slower cross-border economic activities, in tourism for example, thereby restraining Hong Kong’s exports. The Government forecasts real GDP growth for 2020 in the range of -1.5% to 0.5%, while growth forecasts by international organisations and privatesector analysts averaged -3.3%.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nInflationary pressures are expected to moderate in 2020 because of the sub-par economic conditions, the consolidation of private residential rentals and mild imported inflation. Market consensus forecasts a headline inflation rate for 2020 of 1.8%, and the Government projects the headline and underlying inflation rates to be 1.7% and 2.5% respectively. In the labour market, the unemployment rate is likely to rise further in the near term, given the weakened economic prospects and the coronavirus outbreak. privatesector analysts expect the unemployment rate to rise to about 4.0% in 2020.\n\n# Uncertainties and risks\n\nThe subdued economic outlook for 2020 is subject to a number of uncertainties and risks, including those stemming from the slowing global economy, US-China trade relations, Mainland’s economic performance, local social incidents and the persistence of the coronavirus outbreak. In particular, a prolonged coronavirus outbreak could trigger a more visible global economic slowdown and a repricing of assets, with the resulting unfavourable macroeconomic environment and tighter financial conditions posing further downward pressures on domestic real activities. However, the more concerted effort by major central banks to ease their monetary policies may provide a cushion against the negative economic impact inflicted by the outbreak.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector was resilient in 2019 despite the challenging environment with the global economic slowdown, US-China trade tensions and local social incidents.

經濟與金融環境\n\n香港經濟在二零一九年收縮，反映全球經濟放緩、持續的中美貿易衝突以及本地社會事件。隨著經濟狀況在當年下半年急升惡化，勞工市場面對增加的壓力。通脹亦因豬肉價格急升而增加。預計二零二零年的經濟表現將持續困難，因為新型冠狀病毒爆發雪上加霜，對已經轉弱的經濟造成影響。鑒於困難的經濟環境，政府和香港金管局推出措施支持經濟，尤其惠及家庭和中小企業。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 實際活動\n\n在2018年實現2.9%的增長後，香港經濟於2019年收縮1.2%，標誌着自2009年以來首個年度收縮。特別是，經濟在下半年進入衰退，經季節性調整後的實質國內生產總值（GDP）在第二、第三及第四季度連續收縮（表1）。經濟活動的下跌反映國內需求出現顯著減少（圖1）。由於本地社會事件在年內後期對消費活動和情緒造成顯著影響，私人消費支出記錄自2003年以來首個年度下跌。整體投資開支亦因企業情緒低迷而下降。在外部因素方面，全球經濟增長放緩，以及中美貿易摩擦下加徵的額外關稅，導致香港貨物出口下跌。服務出口亦出現歷來最大年度下跌，因社會事件導致入境旅遊嚴重轉差。在本地及轉口貿易引致的需求較少下，貨物及服務進口亦轉差。從淨出口角度計算，淨貿易在2019年對GDP帶來支持（圖1），因總進口下跌速度甚至快於總出口。\n\n基於強大經濟逆風，政府於2019年8月至12月期間引入多輪措施，以減輕居民財務負擔、保障就業及支持企業，特別是中小企以及受重創行業，如零售、食品服務、運輸及旅遊業。為讓銀行對本地經濟更具支持性，並幫助緩和經濟週期，金管局於10月14日宣布將銀行逆周期資本緩衝比率由2.5%減至2.0%，從而讓銀行有更多靈活性，釋放港幣200至300億的銀行信貸予企業，包括中小企，並設立銀行業中小企貸款協調機制。9月，中小企融資擔保計劃（SFGS）的80%擔保產品推出新纾困措施，讓面對資金流轉弱的中小企借款人可申請還息不還本安排，以獲得即時支援。此外，12月亦推出SFGS的新90%貸款擔保產品，以提供額外支援予中小企、經營經驗相對較少的企業，以及欲設立個人實踐的專業人士，協助其取得融資。\n\n# 貨幣條件\n\n2019年，港元匯率和貨幣市場運作暢順且有序。港元匯率在該年內仍然大致穩定。隨着3月觸發弱方兌換承諾，金管局以每1港元兌1美元7.85的價格向銀行購買港元，並出售美元，導致根據掛鈎匯率制度的設計，綜合結餘下跌。港元銀行同業拆息在更長期方面仍然大致穩定，而短期利率則普遍上升。在零售層面，多家零售銀行在10月接近年底，隨着美國聯邦基金利率目標區間下調，將最佳貸款利率調低了12.5個基點。至於貨幣總量方面，2019年銀行總貸款增加6.7%，較2018年的4.4%有所增加，而全年的總存款增長了2.9%。\n\n# 物價上漲\n\n基礎通脹率扣除政府一次性纾困措施的影響，於2019年輕微上升至3.0%，較2018年的2.6%上升。通脹的輕微上升主要由自5月起新鮮豬肉供應受阻所導致的豬肉價格上漲帶動（圖2）。排除基本食品項目後，價格壓力全年維持在溫和水平。特別是，消費者價格通脹中的住宅租金成分與較早前私人住宅新鮮出租租金的整固同步放緩。更廣泛而言，名義工資的輕微增長及商業租金的放緩增長幫助控制本地商業成本。從外部看，進口價格通脹放緩，與香港部分主要進口來源的較低通脹及較慢的全球經濟增長一致。\n\n# 勞動市場\n\n2019年上半年，勞動市場大致保持有韌性，但下半年則面臨日益增加的壓力（圖3）。經過首兩個季度維持在多年低點2.8%後，季節性調整後的失業率在第三季度上升至2.9%，第四季度則上升至3.3%，其中消費及旅遊相關行業的失業率在社會事件之下更見可見上升。整體勞動需求在下半年亦明顯收縮，總就業人數和私人部門職位空缺數目均下降。勞動需求的減少特別明顯於零售、住宿及食品服務行業，以及進出口貿易和建築行業。在供給範圍內，勞動力參與率輕微下降，部分原因是對經濟衰退的周期性回應。隨著勞動市場壓力不斷增加，名義工資和收入的增長在年底顯示出放緩的跡象。\n\n#股市\n\n本地股市在2019年經歷了急劇波動。在首個四個月市場攀升後，恒生指數因對中美貿易摩擦升溫的擔憂而在5月暴跌（圖4）。雖然在6月回應主要央行寬鬆貨幣政策的信號而收復部分失地，但股市價格再次受到壓力，因全球經濟增長放緩及本地社會事件。年底，股市價格在美國與內地簽署第一階段貿易協議後重拾升勢。恒生指數以28,190點收市，全年整體升幅達9.1%。相反，平均每日成交額較去年同期下跌約19%。一家重大內地科技公司及一家領先啤酒製造商的上市幫助擴展了通過首次公開招股（IpOs）籌集的股本資金至2019年的3,142億港元。香港在通過IpOs籌集資金方面高踞世界各地榜首，連續第二年成為全球最大集資地。\n\n# 物業市場\n\n住宅物業市場在2019年首個五個月呈現強大反彈，但其後全年整體有所回落。年初氣氛因對中美貿易摩擦的擔憂暫時緩解而提升，部分原因在於此，但其後中美貿易摩擦再升級、持續的社會事件以及本地經濟狀況轉差，又令氣氛受挫。從5月到12月，整體房屋價格從峰值下調了5%，但由於首個五個月錄得10%的反彈，全年仍錄得5%的增長（圖4）。2019年成交量較較早前增加4%，達到59,797宗，反映了年初強勁的交易活動。房屋可負擔性仍然偏緊，價格收入比和收入負擔比分別維持在17.9和80.9的高位，遠高於長線平均。為了協助購房者應付即時的房屋需要，香港按揭證券公司（HKMC）於10月期間調高了根據按揭保險計劃獲得按揭貸款的已落成住宅物業的價值上限。另一方面，非住宅物業市場在2019年面臨更強大的下調壓力。特別是，零售物業的價格和租金自2008年全球金融危機以來錄得最大下調，反映了當年惡化的經營狀況。\n\n# 前景：經濟\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n香港2020年的經濟表現預料將面臨重大挑戰，與新型冠狀病毒爆發相關的接近短期下行風險顯著。一些行業，例如零售、住宿、食品服務、旅遊和交通，尚未從社會事件造成的擾亂中恢復，將會再次受到打擊。然而，於2020\/21年度預算案中公布的逆周期財政措施，包括一次性現金派發以及SFGS下的新優惠低息貸款，並提供100%政府擔保，預料將為經濟提供一些支持，尤其對家庭和中小企而言。於2020年3月16日，金管局進一步下調銀行逆周期資本緩衝比率，由2.0%降至1.0%，這將讓銀行更能支持本地經濟，特別是那些預料因新型冠狀病毒爆發帶來影響而經歷額外短期壓力的行業和個人。按GDP組成部分分析，由於脆弱的消費者和企業信心，私人消費和投資可能維持疲弱。雖然政府消費將貢獻經濟增長，但公共投資支出預料將在一些重大基礎設施項目完成後相對放緩。在外部方面，美國與中國大陸之間的「第一階段」貿易協議被評估對本地經濟在短期內有輕微正面影響。然而，香港的對外貿易表現將繼續受到全球經濟增長和貿易流量疲弱的影響。特別是，新型冠狀病毒爆發可能導致區域供應鏈中斷和跨境經濟活動放緩，例如在旅遊業，從而抑制香港的出口。政府預測2020年實際GDP增長範圍為-1.5%至0.5%，而國際組織和私人分析師的增長預測平均為-3.3%。\n\n# 物價與勞動市場\n\n通貨膨脹壓力預計在2020年會趨於溫和，原因在於經濟狀況不佳、私人住宅租賃市場整合以及輕微的進口通膨。市場共識預測2020年的整體通膨率為1.8%，而政府則預測整體和基礎通膨率將分別為1.7%和2.5%。在勞動力市場方面，鑒於經濟前景疲弱和冠狀病毒疫情爆發，失業率在接近未來一段時間內可能進一步上升。私營部門分析師預計2020年的失業率將上升至約4%。\n\n# 不確定性與風險\n\n2020年經濟前景低迷，受到多項不確定性及風險的影響，包括全球經濟放緩、中美貿易關係、內地經濟表現、本地事件以及新型冠狀病毒爆發的持續。特別是，持續的新型冠狀病毒爆發可導致更可見的全球經濟放緩及資產重新定價，並導致不利的宏觀經濟環境及更緊縮的金融條件，進一步對國內實體經濟活動帶來壓力。然而，重大央行更共同的努力提供緩衝，以抵消疫情帶來的負面經濟影響。\n\n# 銀行業的表現\n\n儘管2019年面對全球經濟放緩、中美貿易摩擦及本地社會事件等困難環境，香港銀行業仍表現出韌性。銀行資產負債表趨勢穩定，貸款和存款均適度增長。銀行業的資本及流動性狀況仍然穩固，資產品質維持良好。銀行業持續錄得盈利，平均資產回報率保持穩定。\n"}
{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate and money markets functioned in a smooth and orderly manner in 2019. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained stable throughout the year and strengthened to the strong side of the Convertibility Zone towards the end of the year. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, the Linked Exchange Rate System has shown its resilience to shocks time after time.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability. This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n\n- Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks\n\n- Government-issued notes and coins in circulation the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of the clearing account balances of banks kept with the HKMA\n\n- Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs). When the demand for Hong Kong dollars is greater than the supply and the market exchange rate strengthens to the strong-side CU of HK$7.75 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to sell Hong Kong dollars to banks for US dollars upon request. The Aggregate Balance will then expand to push down Hong Kong dollar interest rates, creating monetary conditions that move the Hong Kong dollar away from the strong-side limit to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if the supply of Hong Kong dollars is greater than demand and the market exchange rate weakens to the weak-side CU of HK$7.85 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to buy Hong Kong dollars from banks upon request. The Aggregate Balance will then contract to drive Hong Kong dollar interest rates up, pushing the Hong Kong dollar away from the weak-side limit to stay within the Convertibility Zone.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2019\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nDespite uncertainties in the external environment and a slowdown in the domestic economy, the Hong Kong dollar remained stable and traded in a smooth and orderly manner in 2019. In the beginning of the year, the widening negative Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads attracted carry trade activities of selling Hong Kong dollars for US dollars, pushing the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate towards the weak-side CU of 7.85 (Chart 1). As the weakening of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate continued, the weak-side CU was eventually triggered eight times in March. Thereafter, the Hong Kong dollar continued to stay near the weak-side CU rate of 7.85. Since late May, the strong Hong Kong dollar demand arising from sizeable initial public offering (IPO) activities, corporates’ demand for dividend payment and the half-year closing had led the Hong Kong dollar to strengthen. While the Hong Kong dollar drifted lower after the half-year mark, it regained momentum from late October and stayed in the strong side of the Convertibility Zone towards the end of the year. This reflected partly equity-related demand including IPOs, and partly the unwinding of short Hong Kong dollar positions due to tightened liquidity near the year end. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market functioned normally throughout 2019.\n\nDue to the triggering of the weak-side CU, the total of the Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding EFBNs declined from HK$1,136.2 billion at the end of 2018 to HK$1,133.0 billion at the end of 2019 (Chart 2). During the year, the HKMA purchased a total of HK$22.1 billion at the request of banks at the weak-side CU of 7.85 in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), leading to a contraction of the Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) from HK$76.4 billion at the end of 2018 to HK$54.3 billion at the end of 2019. The outstanding EFBNs increased slightly from HK$1,059.8 billion to HK$1,078.7 billion during the year, reflecting the issuance of EFBNs to absorb EFBNs’ interest payments according to the established practice. The Monetary Base as a whole remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves. Total Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and Notes at HK$1,133 billion at end-2019.\n\n# Money market\n\nDuring 2019, the Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained largely steady at the longer end, while short-term rates broadly picked up (Chart 3). Short-term rates also experienced more fluctuations driven by IpO-related funding demand and seasonal liquidity needs. The reduction in the Aggregate Balance since April 2018 may have led to a higher sensitivity of the Hong Kong dollar interbank rates to changes in the supply and demand of Hong Kong dollar funding in the local market.\n\nThe Base Rate was adjusted downwards on 1 August, 19 September and 31 October by a total of 75 basis points, from 2.75% at the end of 2018 to 2.00% in early November, as the target range for the US federal funds rate moved downward three times by a total of 75 basis points from 2.25–2.50% to 1.50–1.75% during the year. On 18–26 November and 19–31 December, the Base Rate was set higher than 2.00%, reflecting a marked upward trend of the overnight and one-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs) in the last two months of the year. As such, the Base Rate closed at 2.49% at the end of 2019. The adjustment of the Base Rate was in accordance with the revised formula announced on 26 March 2009, which sets the Base Rate at either 50 basis points above the lower bound of the prevailing target range for the US federal funds rate or the average of the five-day moving averages of the overnight and one-month HIBORs, whichever is the higher. On the retail front, several retail banks lowered their Best Lending Rates by 12.5 basis points following the decrease in the target range for the US federal funds rate in late October.\n\nThe discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points widened during the first two months, broadly tracking the movements of the Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads, with the 12-month Hong Kong dollar forward points reaching about -708 pips in mid-February (Chart 4). Thereafter, along with the narrowing of the negative Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads, the discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points narrowed gradually and turned to premiums towards the end of the year. Overall, Hong Kong’s money markets operated in an orderly manner. Discount Window borrowing decreased to HK$38.3 billion in 2019 from HK$40.2 billion in 2018.\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nThe LERS has contributed significantly to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability for more than three decades and has shown its resilience in multiple regional and global financial crises. Against the backdrop of social incidents happening during the year, a number of unfounded rumours casting doubt on the LERS and financial stability of Hong Kong circulated in the social media. The HKMA acted promptly and vigorously to rebut the rumours and reassure the public through the use of both traditional and social media, reiterating that the LERS would remain in place and Hong Kong would not impose foreign exchange or capital controls. In addition, the HKMA issued a number of articles to help the public understand the LERS operation, the flow of funds and the interest rate outlook. These efforts were effective in maintaining public confidence in the LERS, as evidenced by the orderly functioning of the markets throughout the year. The Government is also firmly committed to the LERS. public confidence in the Government’s commitment and the use of the Hong Kong dollar as a means of payment and storage of value were further reinforced by the stability in the foreign exchange and money markets. In its 2019 Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund reaffirmed its long-standing support for the LERS as an anchor of Hong Kong’s financial stability, and commented that the LERS remained the appropriate exchange rate arrangement for Hong Kong underpinned by Hong Kong’s transparent rules, ample fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy, and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nA robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS. Hong Kong’s banking system is highly liquid and sound, with liquidity positions and capitalisation being well above the minimum international standards. To ensure the resilience of the banking sector, the HKMA has been closely monitoring banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and has maintained its supervisory efforts on corporate, propertyrelated and Mainland-related lending. With a smaller Aggregate Balance relative to previous years, banks have in general strengthened their liquidity management arrangements and have been more proactive in managing their day-to-day funding positions. Furthermore, the HKMA has maintained close dialogue with banks to ensure smooth recycling of liquidity in the market, especially ahead of and during the subscription periods of large IPOs. No settlement gridlocks were noted during the year, with the Discount Window continuing to function effectively and efficiently.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) moved within a range of 109.9–112.1% during 2019, without touching the Upper or Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 111.2% on 31 December (Chart 5). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. In the event of abrupt shocks, the sizeable amount of financial resources of the Exchange Fund, together with Hong Kong’s robust banking system, will provide powerful support to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\n# Other activities\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong. In 2019, the CBC considered issues including an event study on the LERS operations, the relationship between the Aggregate Balance and interest rates in Hong Kong, an improved and more flexible approach to options markets’ views about the LERS, and the impact of future IPOs on HIBORs. Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Research\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMR), formerly the Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research, pursues research studies on topics in monetary policy, banking and finance that are policy relevant. This is reflected in the wide array of topics explored by HKIMR researchers and overseas visitors and in its conferences and events. The HKIMR collaborates with major central banks and policy institutions to jointly organise policy-focused conferences. Its research visiting programmes support research projects on policy issues that are of importance to the HKMA, Hong Kong and the region.\n\nIn 2019, the HKIMR hosted 14 research scholars, published 17 working papers, and held 11 public seminars covering a broad range of economic, monetary and financial issues. It also organised three international conferences:\n\n- The Tenth Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy, titled “China’s Financial Reforms and Economic Transformation”, was held on 10–11 January in Hong Kong, organised jointly by the HKIMR, the Financial Research Institute of the people’s Bank of China and the Research Institute of Finance of the Development Research Centre of the State Council. The conference provided a world-class forum for economic experts from central banks, international institutions, academia and the financial industry to discuss issues related to the risks that Mainland’s financial sector faced in the light of changes introduced by financial reforms and Mainland’s economic development.\n","terms":{"achievements":["成果"],"strengthened":["加強"],"enhanced":["加強"],"need":["需要"],"COVID-19":["新型冠狀病毒"],"cast":["造成"],"merchants":["商戶"],"established":["設立"],"challenges":["挑戰"],"corporates":["企業"],"must":["必須"],"work":["工作"],"historical":["歷史"],"orderly":["有序"],"world":["全球"],"15":["15"],"enhance":["提升"],"areas":["範疇"],"span":["短短"],"economy":["經濟"],"sight":["忽略"],"people":["市民"],"rest":["其餘"],"800,000":["80萬"],"June":["6月"],"including":["包括"],"’":["’"],"facing":["面對"],"borrowers":["借款人"],"half":["一半"],"anything":["跌宕起伏"],"2009":["2009年"],"environmentfriendly":["具環保意識"],"happen":["發生"],"November":["11月"],"granular":["細緻"],"800":["800"],"provide":["提供"],"record":["紀錄"],"make":["制定"],"support":["支持"],"new":["新"],"applied":["應用"],"year":["年"],"evolving":["變化"],"applying":["應用"],"face":["面對"],"launch":["推出"],"principle":["原則"],"phases":["階段"],"According":["根據"],"thereby":["從而"],"stable":["穩定"],"achieve":["取得"],"economies":["經濟體"],"foot":["步伐"],"greatly":["大大"],"billion":["億"],"almost":["接近"],"particularly":["特別"],"fulfil":["履行"],"society":["社會"],"providing":["提供"],"put":["投入"],"rumours":["謠言"],"bearing":["顯著"],"opportunities":["機遇"],"doubt":["懷疑"],"Apart":["除了"],"set":["設立"],"major":["重大"],"rounds":["輪"],"operation":["運作"],"also":["亦"],"regard":["顧及"],"hard":["困難"],"promoting":["推動"],"1.0":["1.0%"],"addressing":["應對"],"would":["將"],"applications":["應用"],"like":["例如"],"sound":["穩健"],"talks":["研討會"],"weather":["抵禦"],"years":["年"],"experienced":["經歷"],"2014":["2014年"],"journey":["旅程"],"challenge":["挑戰"],"broader":["更廣"],"eight":["8"],"sharing":["分享"],"paving":["鋪路"],"latter":["下半年"],"efficiency":["效率"],"cross-banks":["跨行"],"release":["釋放"],"perspective":["角度"],"2.8":["2.8%"],"calm":["冷靜"],"advances":["推進"],"specific":["具體"],"since":["自"],"accessing":["使用"],"opportunity":["機會"],"begun":["開始"],"anchor":["基石"],"step":["步驟"],"uncertainty":["不確定性"],"complemented":["輔以"],"nutshell":["簡單而言"],"address":["應對"],"dedication":["全力"],"worst":["最大"],"fears":["憂慮"],"tensions":["摩擦"],"1983":["1983年"],"activity":["活動"],"fruit":["成效"],"capabilities":["能力"],"SMEs":["中小企"],"discuss":["討論"],"functioning":["運作"],"monitor":["監察"],"challenging":["困難"],"150":["150"],"strengthening":["加強"],"launched":["推出"],"completing":["完成"],"–":["—"],"breakthrough":["突破"],"another":["另一"],"1987":["1987年"],"crises":["危機"],"90":["九成"],"first":["首個"],"capability":["能力"],"strike":["取得"],"businesses":["企業"],"spearheaded":["推動"],"air":["疑慮（釋除疑慮）"],"60":["六成"],"strong":["強大"],"paying":["繳交"],"media":["媒體"],"upgrading":["提升"],"number":["數目"],"well":["良好"],"vital":["重要"],"ahead":["前路"],"numerous":["多次"],"significant":["重大"],"grow":["增長"],"II":["第二階段"],"confidence":["信心"],"rebuttals":["澄清"],"science":["科學"],"light":["因應"],"comparable":["相若"],"structural":["結構性"],"clear":["明確"],"Lingering":["持續"],"firm":["堅定"],"power":["實力"],"swiftly":["迅速"],"us":["我們"],"three":["三"],"trial":["試驗"],"overnight":["一夜之間"],"Consolidating":["鞏固"],"unique":["獨特"],"reached":["達到"],"regulation":["監管"],"within":["內"],"responded":["響應"],"terrorist":["恐怖分子"],"representing":["相當於"],"2016":["2016年"],"May":["5月"],"contracted":["收縮"],"big":["大"],"downturn":["逆轉"],"decent":["理想"],"time":["時"],"months":["個月"],"well-entrenched":["難以取代"],"invest":["投資"],"plays":["發揮"],"help":["幫助"],"smooth":["暢順"],"past":["過去"],"good":["良好"],"Upgrading":["提升"],"gain":["爭取"],"continued":["繼續"],"hit":["打擊"],"cyclical":["周期性"],"greenness":["綠色基準"],"whole":["整體"],"intelligence":["智能（人工智能）"],"drawn":["備受"],"together":["一同"],"encouraging":["鼓勵"],"penetration":["滲透率"],"million":["百萬"],"AoF":["金融學院（Academy

貨幣穩定性\n\n港元匯率及貨幣市場於二零一九年以暢順及有序的方式運作。港元匯率全年維持穩定，並於年底加強至兌換範圍的強方。作為香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石，聯繫匯率制度屢次展現其對衝擊的韌性。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的首要目標是貨幣穩定。貨幣穩定被定義為香港貨幣在外汇市場上對美元的匯率維持穩定，匯率維持在 HK$7.75 至 HK$7.85 區間內。貨幣體系的結構特徵是貨幣發行局制度，要求貨幣基礎至少 100% 由存放在發行基金內的美元儲備所支持，並要求貨幣基礎的變動與美元儲備的相應變動完全匹配。\n\n貨幣基礎 (表 1) 包括：\n\n債務憑證，為三家發行紙幣銀行所發行的紙幣提供十足支持。\n\n政府發行的紙幣和硬幣在流通中的總餘額，即銀行在香港金融管理局持有的清算賬戶餘額合共。\n\n香港金管局代表政府發行的交換基金票據及票息憑證。\n\n金管局透過自動利率調整機制及金管局堅定 履行 兌換範圍承諾（CUs），以 保持 港元 兌換 匯率的穩定。當 對 港元 的需求 大於 供應，且 市場 匯率 轉強 至 兌換範圍 的 強勢 兌換範圍 7.75 港元兌一 美元 時，金管局 準備好 在 …後 根據 要求 出售 港元 給 銀行，以 換取 美元。集體結餘 將 會 擴展，推動 港元 利率 下降，創造 貨幣 狀況，將 港元 回復 至 兌換範圍 內，範圍 介於 7.75 至 7.85。相反，如果 港元 供應 大於 需求，且 市場 匯率 疲弱 至 兌換範圍 的 弱勢 兌換範圍 7.85 港元兌一 美元 時，金管局 準備好 根據 要求 從 銀行 買入 港元。集體結餘 將 會 收縮，推動 港元 利率 上升，將 港元 回復 至 兌換範圍 內。\n\n# 檢討 2019\n\n# 匯率穩定性\n\n儘管外部環境存在不確定性，且國內經濟增長放緩，港元在2019年仍然保持穩定，並在整體上以暢順和有序的方式交易。在年初，負的港元兌美元息差吸引了沽出港元以換取美元的套利交易活動，推動港元匯率接近疲弱範圍內的7.85（圖1）。隨著港元匯率的轉弱持續，疲弱範圍內在3月被觸發八次。其後，港元繼續維持在疲弱範圍內的7.85匯率附近。自5月接近年底以來，大量首次公開招股集資活動帶來的強大港元需求、企業股息支付需求以及年底結算，帶動港元加強。儘管港元在年中標誌過後一度下跌，但從10月接近年底開始重新獲得勢頭，並保持在兌換範圍的強大範圍內。這反映了部分與股權相關的需求，包括首次公開招股，以及部分由於年底接近時的流動性收緊而導致的平倉港元空頭頭寸。總體而言，港元外匯市場在2019年全年正常運作。\n\n由於弱方貨幣單位（CU）被觸發，總體結餘（扣除貼現窗前）及未償還的外匯基金債券（EFBNs）由2018年底的1,1362億港元下跌至2019年底的1,1330億港元（圖2）。在這一年內，金管局根據聯繫匯率制度（LERS）的設計，在弱方貨幣單位7.85的水平，應銀行的要求購入總額221億港元，導致總體結餘（扣除貼現窗前）由2018年底的764億港元下跌至2019年底的543億港元。未償還的外匯基金債券（EFBNs）在這一年內輕微上升，由1,0598億港元增至1,0787億港元，反映根據既定做法發行EFBNs以吸收EFBNs的利息支付。整體貨幣基礎仍然十足由外匯儲備支持。截至2019年底，總體結餘（扣除貼現窗前）及未償還的外匯基金債券和票据總額為1,1330億港元。\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n2019年期間，香港美元銀行同業利率在更長期端仍然大致維持穩定，而短期利率則大致回升（圖3）。短期利率亦經歷更多波動，帶動因素是與新股集資相關的資金需要及季節性流動性需要。自5月以來，總結餘的減少可能帶來香港美元銀行同業利率對本地市場港元資金供求變動的更高敏感度。\n\n基準利率於2018年底為2.75%，在2019年8月1日、9月19日及10月31日共下調75個基點，至11月初降至2.00%，因美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍在當年三次共下調75個基點，由2.25–2.50%降至1.50–1.75%。11月18至26日及12月19至31日，基準利率設於高於2.00%的水平，反映當年最後兩個月隔夜及一個月期香港銀行同業拆息（HIBORs）顯著上漲的趨勢。因此，基準利率於2019年底收報2.49%。基準利率的調整根據2009年3月26日公布的修訂公式進行，該公式將基準利率設為美國聯邦基金利率現行目標範圍下限之上50個基點，或隔夜及一個月期HIBORs五日移動平均值的平均數，以較高者為準。零售方面，多間零售銀行在10月接近年底美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍下調後，將其最佳貸款利率調低12.5個基點。\n\n港元遠期點數的折讓在首兩個月擴闊，大致跟隨港元與美元利率息差的變化，12個月期港元遠期點數在2月中達到約-708點（圖4）。其後，隨著負的港元與美元利率息差收窄，港元遠期點數的折讓逐漸收窄，並在年底轉為保費。整體而言，香港的貨幣市場以有序方式運作。貼現窗貸款從2018年的402億港元減少至2019年的383億港元。\n\n# 連結匯率制度\n\n聯匯制度在過去數十年內為香港的貨幣及金融穩定貢獻了大幅力量，並在多次區域及全球金融危機中展現其韌性。在今年發生社會事件的背景下，大量無根據的謠言在社交媒體上流通，對聯匯制度和香港的金融穩定產生懷疑。金管局果斷且積極地駁斥這些謠言，並透過傳統媒體和社交媒體釋除公眾疑慮，重申聯匯制度將維持，香港不會實行外匯或資本管制。此外，金管局發布了數目文章，幫助公眾了解聯匯制度的運作、資金流向以及利率前景。這些努力有效地維持了公眾對聯匯制度的信心，正如全年市場的有序運作所反映。政府亦穩固地支持聯匯制度。外匯和貨幣市場的穩定進一步鞏固了公眾對政府承諾以及使用港元作為支付方式和保值的信心。在2019年第四條諮詢中，國際貨幣基金組織再次肯定了聯匯制度作為香港金融穩定基石的一向支持，並評論聯匯制度仍然是香港適當的匯率安排，其背後有香港透明的規則、充足的財政及外匯儲備、強大的金融監管和監督、靈活的經濟以及審慎的財政框架支持。\n\n穩健的銀行體系對LERS的正常運作至關重要。香港的銀行體系具有高度流動性及穩健性，其流動性水平和資本充足率均遠高於國際最低標準。為確保銀行業的韌性，香港金融管理局一直緊密監測銀行對信貸、流動性及利率風險的管理情況，以及壓力測試結果，並持續加強對企業貸款、物業相關貸款及內地相關貸款的監管努力。與上一年相比，銀行總體流動性餘額較少，銀行普遍已加強流動性管理安排，並在日常資金頭寸管理方面更加積極。此外，香港金融管理局持續與銀行保持緊密溝通，以確保市場流動性能暢順地循環，尤其在大型首次公開招股的認購期前後及期間。本年度未見到結算阻塞的情況，貼現窗口繼續有效且高效地運作。\n\n為改善貨幣發行局帳戶的透明度，自1998年10月起，已分配具體部分外匯基金資產以支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（定義為支持資產除以貨幣基礎）於2019年內升至109.9—112.1%的涵蓋範圍，而未觸及上限或下跌觸發水平。該比率於12月31日收報111.2%（圖5）。在聯繫匯率制度下，雖然已指定特定外匯基金資產用於支持投資組合，但所有外匯基金資產均可提供支持，以維持港元匯率。若發生突如其來的衝擊，外匯基金龐大的財政資源，一同與香港穩健的銀行體系，將為香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供強大的支持。\n\n# 其他活動\n\n貨幣發行委員會（貨幣發行委員會）轄下的外匯基金諮詢委員會監察及檢討與香港貨幣及金融穩定相關的發出事項。於2019年，貨幣發行委員會考慮了包括一份關於即時結算系統營運的事件研究、總結餘與香港利率之間的關係、對期權市場關於即時結算系統的看法採取更提升及靈活的做法，以及未來首次公開招股對HIBOR的影響等發出事項。貨幣發行委員會就這些發出事項的討論錄得，以及提交予貨幣發行委員會的貨幣板營運報告均會刊登於香港金融管理局網站。\n\n# 研究\n\n香港貨幣及金融研究所以前稱為香港貨幣研究所以來，一直致力於進行與政策相關的貨幣政策、銀行及金融等主題的研究。這一點反映在香港研究人員及海外訪問學者所探討的廣泛主題，以及該會舉辦的會議和活動之中。香港貨幣及金融研究所與各主要中央銀行及政策機構合作，聯合舉辦以政策為重點的會議。其研究訪問計劃支持與香港金融管理局、香港及區內相關的重要政策問題有關的研究項目。\n\n2019年，香港國際金融研究中心接待了14位研究學者，刊登了17篇研究論文，並舉辦了11場公開研討會，內容涵蓋廣泛的經濟、貨幣及金融議題。該中心亦舉辦了三場國際會議：\n\n第十屆國際中國經濟學術年會，題為「中國的金融改革與經濟轉型」，於一月十日至十一日在香港舉辦，由香港經濟研究中心、中國人民銀行金融研究所在聯合舉辦。會議提供了一個全球級別的論壇，讓來自中央銀行、國際機構、學術界和金融業的經濟專家們討論與中國內地金融體系面對的風險相關發出，這些風險是因應金融改革引入的變化以及中國內地經濟發展所致。\n"}
{"en":"# Banking Stability\n\nThe banking sector in Hong Kong remained sound and stable in 2019, notwithstanding the headwinds brought by the weakening global and local economies. Thanks to the concerted efforts of the industry, the banking sector continued to operate normally amidst the social events. Efforts were taken to ensure that inconvenience caused to the public was kept to a minimum. During the year, the HKMA focused its supervision on the credit and liquidity risk management of authorized institutions. In view of escalating cyber threats and the industry’s growing dependency on technology, the HKMA stepped up the supervision of authorized institutions’ technology risk management. On conduct supervision, the HKMA streamlined its investor protection measures to enhance customer experience while according protection to customers. We also enhanced consumer protection in digital financial services and continued to promote a customer-centric corporate culture.\n\nOn anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT), 2019 marked the conclusion of the Financial Action Task Force’s Fourth Round Mutual Evaluation of Hong Kong’s AML\/CFT regime, which was assessed as compliant and effective overall, and earned positive recognition particularly for the banking sector’s good understanding of risks and the HKMA’s risk-based supervisory work in AML\/CFT. The HKMA has continued to participate in the public-private partnership for intelligence sharing on fraud and money laundering, and its active support for the adoption of AML\/CFT regulatory technology in the banking sector.\n\nOn banking development, the HKMA granted banking licences to eight virtual banks in 2019 and announced a three-phased approach to facilitate the development of green and sustainable banking in Hong Kong. The HKMA has been in close collaboration with the banking industry to optimise supervisory policies and processes and to carry out capacity-building initiatives that facilitate talent development.\n\nMeanwhile, substantial progress was made on the local implementation of international supervisory standards, including capital adequacy standards, disclosure standards, liquidity standards and large exposure standards. The HKMA also continued its work to ensure there would be a credible resolution regime for authorized institutions, including implementing rules on loss-absorbing capacity requirements to enhance the resolvability of authorized institutions.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this objective is contingent upon the financial system being highly resilient and capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their businesses and, in extremis, by failing in a disorderly manner. The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring banks are resilient to shocks and are able to recover their positions in response to crises, ultimately helping to prevent failures. The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks in Hong Kong. It is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs). The Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs).\n\nHowever, the Monetary Authority cannot ensure, nor is the Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework designed to ensure, a zero-risk financial system. Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that, in the event of an AI becoming non-viable, its failure can be managed in an orderly manner. To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong has been established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs. To ensure that the resolution regime in Hong Kong is operational, it is important to lay down resolution legislation and policy standards, undertake resolution planning to remove impediments to AIs’ resolvability and develop the HKMA’s operational capability to resolve a failing AI. In order to carry out these tasks effectively, the HKMA adopts an internationally harmonised and co-ordinated approach.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2019\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nIn 2019, 196 off-site reviews were conducted covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL rating assessment, corporate governance, risk management and fintech strategies. As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance, 26 meetings were held with the boards of directors or board-level committees of AIs. Furthermore, 32 tripartite meetings were held among the HKMA, the AIs and their external auditors.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA conducts regular on-site examinations supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk. A total of 405 on-site examinations and thematic reviews were conducted during the year. Credit risk management remained a key focus of these examinations and reviews. Another major focus was in technology risk and operational risk management. The HKMA also increased the number of on-site examinations and thematic reviews targeted at liquidity and market risk management as well as the implementation of the Basel capital adequacy framework. At the same time, specialist teams performed on-site examinations and thematic reviews of AIs’ activities in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses.\n\nTable 1 contains an overall summary of the HKMA’s supervisory activities in 2019.\n\n# Supervision of credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nBank lending increased moderately in 2019. Total loans grew by 6.7%, compared with 4.4% in 2018. As shown in Table 2, loans for use in Hong Kong and loans for use outside Hong Kong registered growth of 7.7% and 5.8% respectively.\n\nMainland-related lending grew by 7.4% to HK$4,564 billion as at the end of 2019 (Table 3).\n\nThe asset quality of AIs remained healthy. Retail banks’ classified loan ratio edged down from 0.51% at the end of 2018 to 0.48% at the end of 2019, well below the long-run historical average of 2% since 2000. For the banking industry as a whole, the classified loan ratio increased slightly from 0.55% to 0.57%. Specifically in terms of Mainland-related lending, retail banks’ classified loan ratio increased from 0.63% in 2018 to 0.79% in 2019, which was still low by historical standard. For the banking industry as a whole, the ratio increased to 0.75% from 0.55% a year ago.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA devoted increased supervisory efforts in ensuring that AIs continued to adopt prudent credit risk management standards amid the uncertain economic environment. Solvency stress tests were enhanced to incorporate more comprehensive risk coverage and more severe stress assumptions. The results of the enhanced stress tests continued to indicate that banks generally had sufficient capital buffers to withstand extreme shocks. Targeted and thematic examinations were conducted to evaluate the credit risk management practices of AIs in different areas, such as lending to corporates engaged in high-risk business, complex financing arrangements, and collateralised lending to private banking and wealth management customers. Recognising that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) would more likely face greater challenges during economic downturns, the HKMA established a Banking Sector SME Lending Co-ordination Mechanism in October, with a view to encouraging banks to continue to support SMEs’ financing needs to the extent permitted by prudent risk management principles.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nThe resilience of the Hong Kong banking sector to withstand a downturn in the property market has been strengthened significantly by the eight rounds of countercyclical macro-prudential measures introduced by the HKMA since 2009. The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of new residential mortgage loans fell to 53% in December 2019 from 64% in September 2009, before the countercyclical measures were first introduced. The average debt servicing ratio (DSR) of new mortgages also decreased to 36% in December 2019 from 41% in August 2010, when a cap on DSR was first applied (Chart 1).\n\n# Supervision of operational and technology risk\n\nThe HKMA adopts a three-phased approach to implement the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework under the Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative (CFI). phase One assessment, involving all the major banks, was completed in 2018. The remaining AIs covered in the second and third phases have substantially completed the assessment as scheduled. The HKMA has also embarked on a comprehensive review of the CFI to fine-tune the initiative given the experience gained in the past years.\n\nIn October, the HKMA issued a revised Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module on “Risk Management of E-banking”. The revision sought to provide the industry with greater flexibility to meet changing customer expectations on electronic banking services. The HKMA also published a set of high-level principles on the use of artificial intelligence in order to provide guidance for the industry.\n\nSince the social events started in June, the HKMA have maintained close dialogue with the industry to monitor the impact on banking operations and services. Banks were requested to replenish automated teller machines (ATMs) more frequently and repair vandalised facilities as soon as practicable. The HKMA also acted quickly to refute malicious rumours that sought to undermine the public’s confidence in the banking system. Thanks to concerted efforts by the banking industry, the affected bank branches and facilities quickly resumed normal services and the inconvenience caused to the public was kept to a minimum. In view of the rising operational risk posed by the social events, banks were asked to take additional precautionary measures to strengthen their operational resilience.\n\n# Supervision of liquidity and market risk management\n\nDuring the year, a round of thematic reviews was conducted to assess AIs’ capability to cope with liquidity shocks. The reviews focused on the robustness of AIs’ liquidity stress testing programmes and contingency funding management. The HKMA also assessed AIs’ compliance with the regulatory requirements on the calculation of the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) to ensure the prudence and accuracy of the inputs used for the calculation.\n\nAs algorithmic trading gained popularity in the banking industry, the HKMA conducted a round of thematic reviews to evaluate AIs’ risk management practices in this area. Considering that the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) might cease to be published after end-2021, the HKMA reminded AIs to get prepared for the transition to alternative reference rates and conducted a survey to monitor their preparedness for the transition.\n\n# Combating money laundering and terrorist financing (ML\/TF)\n\nThe HKMA carries out risk-based supervision of AIs’ AML\/CFT systems. During the year, 18 on-site examinations and 61 off-site reviews were conducted, including targeted thematic reviews on private banking and the governance of the use of new technology. The HKMA shared with the industry the observations and best practices drawn from a thematic review of AIs’ application of risk-based AML\/CFT controls for SMEs, in order to assist AIs to adopt appropriate account opening processes and delivery of services for SMEs.\n\n# Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Mutual Evaluation (ME) Report on Hong Kong\n\nA highlight of 2019 for the HKMA and Hong Kong’s overall AML\/CFT regime was the publication of the FATF ME Report on Hong Kong in September. The Report represents one of the best overall results to date in the FATF’s fourth-round ME of its member jurisdictions. Hong Kong scored six “Substantial” ratings out of 11 “Immediate Outcomes” in the assessment of the effectiveness of its AML\/CFT regime, and a high mark for the technical compliance aspect of the ME.\n\nThe Report favourably assessed the HKMA’s risk-based approach to AML\/CFT supervision, noting that the HKMA had a good understanding of ML\/TF risks in the banking sector and a reasonable understanding of risks in the stored value facility (SVF) sector. The Report also positively assessed the collective AML\/CFT efforts of the banking sector, such as the increased use of data analytics by larger AIs, the fact that the great majority of suspicious transaction reports were filed by AIs, and the sector’s proactive participation in the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce (FMLIT).\n\nThe Report recommended several areas for improvement, including the understanding of some higher-risk areas, such as foreign corruption and tax crimes, and developing sectors such as SVFs. Work has already started to address these recommendations; the HKMA published an updated ML\/TF Risk Assessment on the SVF sector in July and has commenced thematic on-site examinations on private banking and the governance of the use of new

採納措施確保對公眾造成的不便降至最低。當年，香港金融管理局將監管重點放在授權機構的信貸及流動性風險管理上。 根據日益增加的網絡威脅及業界對科技日益增長的依賴，香港金融管理局加強了對授權機構科技風險管理的監管。在行為監管方面，香港金融管理局精簡投資者保護措施，以提升客戶體驗，同時保障客戶權益。我們亦加強了數字金融服務中的消費者保護，並繼續推動以客戶為中心的企業文化。\n\n在反洗錢及打擊恐怖主義融資（反洗錢\/打擊恐怖主義融資）方面，2019年標誌著金融行動專案組對香港反洗錢\/打擊恐怖主義融資制度的第4季互認評估的結果，該評估被評估為整體合規且有效，並特別獲得正面肯定，尤其是在銀行業對風險的良好了解以及金管局在反洗錢\/打擊恐怖主義融資領域的根據風險的監管工作方面。金管局繼續參與公共私營合作夥伴關係，以分享有關訛騙和洗錢的智能（人工智能），並積極支持銀行業採用反洗錢\/打擊恐怖主義融資監管科技。\n\n在銀行發展方面，香港金融管理局（金管局）於2019年批出（牌照）8間虛擬銀行，並公布一個三個階段的方案，以促進香港綠色及可持續銀行的發展。金管局一直與銀行業界緊密合作，優化監管政策和流程，並推行能力建立計劃，促進人才發展。\n\n同時，國際監管標準的本地落實工作取得實質進展，包括資本充足率標準、資訊披露標準、流動性標準及大額風險敞口標準。香港金融管理局亦繼續其工作，確保將有一套可信的解決機制，以應對持牌機構的風險，包括實施有關吸收損失能力要求的規則，以提升持牌機構的處置可行性。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港金融管理局有一般目標，即推動銀行體系的安全與穩定。實現這個目標取決於金融系統高度有韌性且能夠提供香港經濟需要的關鍵金融服務。\n\n銀行透過其企業的經營方式，以及在極端情況下以不整頓的方式倒閉，可能影響系統的穩定性。貨幣當局作為監察當局，發揮關鍵作用，透過確保銀行對衝擊有韌性，並能在危機時恢復其地位，以回應危機，最終有助於防止破產，從而保障金融穩定。貨幣當局負責香港銀行的審慎監理。其職責是授權在香港的持牌銀行、受限制牌照銀行和接受存款公司，這些機構統稱為認可機構。貨幣當局亦負責指定和監察某些金融市場基礎設施。\n\n然而，當局無法確保，香港的審慎監管框架亦非為確保零風險的金融體系而設計。相反，當局作為處置當局，致力確保在認可機構出現不可行情況時，其失敗能夠以有序方式處理。為此，已在香港設立了針對金融機構的處置制度，根據該制度，當局是認可機構的處置當局。為確保香港的處置制度能夠運作，制定處置相關的法律及政策標準，並進行處置規劃以移除對認可機構處置可行性的阻礙，以及提升認可機構處理失敗認可機構的能力至關重要。為了有效執行這些任務，認可機構採取國際協調一致的方式。\n\n# 檢討 2019\n\n# 監督活動概覽\n\n於2019年，進行了196項非現場覆核，涵蓋了廣泛的發出問題，包括CAMEL評級評估、公司治理、風險管理和金融科技策略。作為香港金融管理局繼續努力推動更強風險治理的其中一部分，與認可機構的董事會或董事級委員會舉辦了26日會議。此外，香港金融管理局、認可機構及其外部審計師之間舉辦了32項三方會議。\n\n除了非現場活動，香港金融管理局進行定期現場檢查，並輔以對評估為更高風險的範疇進行主題審查。本年共進行了405次現場檢查和主題審查。信貸風險管理仍然是這些檢查和審查的重點。另一重大重點在於科技風險和營運風險管理。香港金融管理局亦增加了針對流動性及市場風險管理，以及落實巴塞爾資本充足率框架的現場檢查和主題審查數目。與此同時，專業團隊表現了對人工智能在證券、投資產品、保險及強積金相關企業的活動進行現場檢查和主題審查。\n\n表 1 包含香港金管局 2019 年監管活動的整體概要。\n\n# 信用風險監管\n\n# 信用成長與資產品質\n\n銀行貸款在2019年 moderate 增加。總貸款增長6.7%，相比2018年的4.4%。如表2所示，用於香港的貸款和用於香港以外的貸款分別增長7.7%和5.8%。\n\n截至2019年底，內地相關貸款增至4,564億港元，增長7.4%（表3）。\n\n人工智能的資產品質仍然健康。零售銀行不良貸款比率輕微下降，從2018年底的0.51%降至2019年底的0.48%，遠低於自2000年以來的長期歷史平均值2%。整體銀行業的不良貸款比率輕微增加，從0.55%增至0.57%。具體而言，在與大陸相關的貸款方面，零售銀行不良貸款比率從2018年的0.63%上升至2019年的0.79%，仍低於歷史標準。整體銀行業的比率則從一年前的0.55%上升至0.75%。\n\n在該年，金管局投入了增加的監管努力，確保認可金融機構繼續採用審慎的信貸風險管理標準，在不確定的經濟環境之下。壓力測試已加強，以納入更全面的風險覆蓋範圍和更嚴重的壓力假設。加強後的壓力測試結果繼續顯示，銀行普遍擁有足夠的資本緩衝，以抵禦極為衝擊。針對性和主題性的檢查已進行，以評估認可金融機構在不同範疇的信貸風險管理實務，例如向從事高風險業務的企業、複雜融資安排以及為私人銀行和財富管理客戶提供的抵押貸款。鑑於中小企可能在經濟衰退期間面對更大挑戰，金管局於10月設立了銀行業中小企貸款協調機制，期望鼓勵銀行在符合審慎風險管理原則的範圍內，繼續支持中小企的融資需要。\n\n# 房屋抵押貸款\n\n香港銀行界抵禦房地產市場逆轉的能力，自2009年以來，已因香港金融管理局引入的八輪逆周期宏觀審慎措施而大幅加強。新的住宅按揭貸款平均貸款與價值比率（LTV）由2009年9月的64%下降至2019年12月的53%，在首次引入逆周期措施之前。新的按揭貸款平均供款與入息比率（DSR）亦從2010年8月的41%下降至2019年12月的36%，當時首次應用供款與入息比率（DSR）上限（圖1）。\n\n# 營運及科技風險之監控\n\n香港金融管理局採用三個階段的方法來實施網絡安全強化計劃（CFI）下的網絡韌性評估框架。第一階段評估，涵蓋所有重大銀行，已於2018年落成。其餘涵蓋第二和三分之一階段的評估，已按計劃實質性完成。鑒於過去幾年所獲得的經驗，香港金融管理局亦開展了對CFI的全面檢討，以完善該計劃。\n\n10月，香港金融管理局發佈修訂版監管政策手冊（SPM）模組，主題為「網上銀行風險管理」。此次修訂旨在為業界提供更大靈活性，以滿足客戶對網上銀行服務的變革期望。香港金融管理局亦刊登一套高層原則，說明人工智能的應用，以提供指引給業界。\n\n自6月社會事件開始以來，金管局一直與業界保持緊密對話，以監察對銀行營運及服務的影響。銀行被要求更頻繁地補充自動櫃員機（ATM），並盡快維修被破壞的設施。金管局亦迅速行動反駁惡意謠言，這些謠言試圖破壞公眾對銀行體系的信心。 感謝銀行業界共同努力，受影響的銀行分行及設施很快恢復正常服務，對公眾造成的困擾亦維持在最低程度。 鑒於社會事件帶來的上升營運風險，銀行被要求選持倉盤額外預防措施，以加強其營運韌性。\n\n# 流動性與市場風險管理之監督\n\n在本年度內，進行了一輪主題審查，以評估銀行機構應對流動性衝擊的能力。審查重點為銀行機構流動性壓力測試計劃及應急融資管理的穩健性。香港金融管理局亦評估銀行機構在計算流動性覆蓋比率（LCR）方面是否符合監管要求，以確保計算所用輸入數據的謹慎性和準確性。\n\n隨著算法交易在銀行業日益普及，香港金融管理局進行了一輪主題審查，以評估此領域內人工智慧的風險管理實踐。考慮到倫敦銀行同業拆借利率（LIBOR）可能在2021年底後停止刊登，香港金融管理局提醒人工智慧機構獲得準備，以應對轉向替代參考利率的過渡，並進行了調查以監察其對過渡的準備情況。\n\n# 反洗錢及反恐融資（ML\/TF）\n\n香港金管局根據風險進行人工智能反洗錢及打擊恐怖主義融資系統的監管。在過去一年，進行了18次現場檢查和61次非現場檢討，包括針對私人銀行以及新技術使用的治理主題檢討。香港金管局與業界分享了從中小企風險為基礎的反洗錢及打擊恐怖主義融資控制應用主題檢討中備受矚目的觀察結果和最佳實務，以協助人工智能採用適當的開戶流程和為中小企提供服務。\n\n# 金融行動工作群組（FATF）香港的互認評估報告\n\n香港金管局及香港的整體洗錢及恐怖融資防制制度在2019年的亮點，是金融行動小組（FATF）於9月發布有關香港的ME報告。該報告代表金融行動小組對其成員司法管轄區進行第四輪ME評估中，至今最佳的整體結果之一。香港在對其洗錢及恐怖融資防制制度的成效評估中，獲得了11項“即時結果”中的六項“實質”評級，並且在ME的技術合規方面獲得了高標誌。\n\n報告對香港金融管理局以風險為基礎的反洗錢及打擊恐怖主義融資監管方法作出了良好評估，並指出香港金融管理局對銀行業的洗錢及恐怖主義融資風險有良好了解，對儲值設施（SVF）行業的風險亦有合理了解。報告亦肯定了銀行業在反洗錢及打擊恐怖主義融資方面的共同努力，例如較大的智能（人工智能）增加使用數據分析，大部分可疑交易報告是由智能（人工智能）提交，以及該行業積極參與打擊訛騙及洗錢智能（人工智能）專案組（FMLIT）。\n\n報告建議多項改善範疇，包括對更高風險範疇的了解，例如外國貪腐及逃稅犯罪，以及培育如特殊目的實體（SVF）等行業。工作已開始應對這些建議；香港金融管理局於七月刊登了修訂後的洗錢／恐怖融資風險評估，並已開始針對私人銀行業務及新技術應用治理進行主題式實地檢查。\n"}
{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nHong Kong is a globally competitive international financial centre. The implementation of the Smart Banking initiatives has been in good progress to further develop Hong Kong as a fintech hub. Capitalising on opportunities arising from the opening up of the Mainland financial markets, much headway has been made to promote financial collaboration in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, especially in easing Hong Kong residents’ cross-border access to financial and banking services in the Area.\n\nAt the same time, much effort has been made to open up new opportunities to further strengthen the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, including infrastructure investment and financing, green finance and private equity funds. The Hong Kong Academy of Finance was set up to enhance Hong Kong’s soft power in a sustainable manner.\n\nIn the central banking and regulatory community, the HKMA plays a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees, which is a clear recognition of Hong Kong’s expertise and commitment to international work.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nTo strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia, the HKMA puts great effort into implementing the seven Smart Banking initiatives that were announced in September 2017, with an aim to facilitate the development and use of fintech in the banking and payment industries. The key progress of these initiatives during the year included:\n\n- expanding the adoption of the Faster Payment System (FPS);\n- facilitating the implementation of phases I and II of the Open Application programming Interface (Open API) Framework in the banking sector;\n- further enhancing fintech research and talent\ndevelopment;\n- stepping up cross-border collaboration in fintech; granting eight virtual bank licences;\n- facilitating the industry’s increasing use of Fintech Supervisory Sandbox (FSS) 2.0 for launching fintech initiatives; and\n- further facilitating the adoption of regulatory technology (Regtech) through the Banking Made Easy initiative.\n\nThe HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO), together with the banking departments of the HKMA, plays a pivotal role in driving the implementation of these initiatives.\n\nHong Kong plays an indispensable role in facilitating international investors’ allocation of renminbi assets, with its unparalleled access to the onshore markets through the Stock Connect and Bond Connect schemes. This was evident by the tripling of the number of registered investors and daily turnover under Bond Connect over the past year. Further enhancements have been introduced to both Bond Connect and Stock Connect, providing more convenience and flexibility for international investors to invest in onshore securities in the Mainland. The HKMA also worked closely with Mainland authorities to explore and implement a series of financial facilitation measures for Hong Kong residents to access financial and banking services across the border in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), including a prospective, two-way wealth management connect scheme. Hong Kong maintains a firm foothold as the global hub for offshore renminbi business. According to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Triennial Survey of Foreign Exchange (FX) and Derivatives Market Turnover, Hong Kong continued to be the largest offshore renminbi FX centre in the world.\n\nContinuous efforts were put into opening up new opportunities to further enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. To promote the development of the fund business in Hong Kong, the HKMA worked closely with the Government and industry to provide a more favourable tax and regulatory environment for fund formation. A number of large-scale events and targeted outreach activities were organised to promote Hong Kong as a hub for green finance, infrastructure investment and financing and corporate treasury centres (CTCs). In an effort to enhance Hong Kong’s soft power, the Hong Kong Academy of Finance (AoF) was set up in June to develop financial leadership and promote research collaboration.\n\nIn the central banking and regulatory community, the HKMA plays a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees. The HKMA chaired the Standing Committee on Supervisory and Regulatory Cooperation (SRC) of the Financial Stability Board (FSB) until 31 August 2019. Currently, the HKMA is chairing the Supervision and Implementation Group (SIG) of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), and the Working Group on Financial Markets (WGFM) established under the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP). The HKMA is also co-chairing the Non-Bank Monitoring Experts Group (NMEG) of the FSB with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure lays a solid foundation for Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre. The four interbank Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) and the Hong Kong Trade Repository (HKTR) achieved 100% system availability in 2019, beating the target of 99.95%. Through its accounts set up with the two Mainland central securities depositories, the CMU facilitates the settlement of transactions conducted under Bond Connect Northbound Trading and the holding of Mainland debt securities on behalf of relevant CMU members.\n\nThe FPS, which serves as an extension of Hong Kong dollar RTGS system to enable the public to make instant retail fund transfers and payments across different banks and stored value facilities (SVFs) on a round-the-clock basis, ran smoothly in its first year of operation. Users’ adoption of the facility had increased steadily, as manifested in the four million registrations and tripling of transaction volumes by the end of 2019. The FPS brings new opportunities to the retail payment industry and promotes fintech innovation.\n\nTo ensure the general safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA has designated and is overseeing a total of six retail payment systems (RPSs) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO). The HKMA also issued two new SVF licences in May, bringing the total number of SVF licensees to 18. SVF licensees continued to launch new products and services actively during the year to diversify customer choices and enhance user experience.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2019\n\n# Hong Kong as a Fintech Hub in Asia\n\n# Smart Banking initiatives\n\nThe seven Smart Banking initiatives were announced by the HKMA in September 2017 with the aim of helping the banking sector achieve higher standards of operation and embrace the enormous opportunities brought about by the convergence of banking and technology. During the year, considerable progress was made in implementing these initiatives and transforming the fintech ecosystem of Hong Kong.\n\n# Faster Payment System\n\nThe launch of the FPS in September 2018 was a major milestone in the financial infrastructure development of Hong Kong in the digital era. The FPS further promotes the adoption of e-payment in Hong Kong by providing efficient and convenient payment services to the general public and corporates. Since the launch of the FPS, the number of participating service providers had increased to 30 banks and 11 SVFs, with the addition of nine banks and one SVF, by the end of 2019.\n\nUsage of the FPS has also grown steadily. As of 31 December 2019, the FPS recorded four million registrations (Chart 1) and processed 44 million transactions involving an aggregate amount of HK$748.5 billion and RMB17 billion. In December 2019, average daily turnover reached 168,000 transactions worth HK$2.4 billion and RMB38 million (Chart 2), as compared with 51,000 transactions during its first full month of operation in October 2018.\n\nFaster payment System recorded: \n- 4 million registrations as of 31 December 2019\n- 44 million transactions as of 31 December 2019\n- 168,000 transactions worth HK$2.4 billion and RMB38 million of average daily turnover in December 2019\n\nThe HKMA works with the industry to extend FPS usage from person-to-person payments to bill payments and other merchant payments. For example, enhancements were made to enable merchants to use a variety of proxy identifiers and accept partial or over-payments via a QR code. A technical specification was developed to facilitate the invocation of a mobile banking or SVF e-wallet mobile application (app) from a business mobile app for FPS payment. This would greatly improve customer experience in making merchant and business payments via the FPS using mobile devices.\n\nThe HKMA also works closely with relevant Government departments to assist them in using the FPS to accept bill payments from the public. From 1 November, bills issued by the Inland Revenue Department, the Rating and Valuation Department and the Water Supplies Department were printed with an FPS QR code so that the public could scan the QR code easily with supporting mobile banking or SVF e-wallet apps to make payment. The HKMA will continue working with various Government departments and public bodies to explore other potential use cases which can make it convenient for the public to make payment via the FPS.\n\nTo raise public awareness of the FPS, the HKMA has developed a new series of education and publicity materials, such as Announcements in the public Interest for broadcast on television and radio, as well as videos and electronic banners for digital platforms. The HKMA also participated in trade fairs to promote the FPS to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and corporates. Various FPS participating banks and SVFs launched promotion campaigns and offered incentives to encourage customers to register with the FPS and to use it for fund transfer and bill payment.\n\nIn addition, the HKMA engaged a number of industry organisations and institutions to provide briefings on the FPS so as to introduce its functionalities and the potential benefits it may bring to different businesses in collecting and making payment.\n\nThe Government has adopted FPS for bill payments on taxes, rates and Government rent and water charges.\n\n# Open Application Programming Interface\n\nThe HKMA continued to facilitate the banking sector’s development and adoption of Open API in accordance with the four-phase approach of the Open API Framework. Under phase I, 20 retail banks opened up over 500 Open API endpoints in January, covering information of banking products and services. Under phase II, the banks opened up in October over 300 APIs to support applications for banking products and services.\n\n# Research and talent development\n\nOn trade finance, a proof-of-concept (PoC) study on linking up eTradeConnect and we.trade was completed in the first quarter of the year. In November, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between the subsidiaries of Hong Kong Interbank Clearing Limited and the Institute of Digital Currency of the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) to conduct a PoC study on linking up eTradeConnect and the PBoC Trade Finance platform to provide firms in both Hong Kong and Mainland China with more convenient trade finance services.\n\nOn Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), the HKMA and the Bank of Thailand embarked on a joint research project named project Inthanon-LionRock to study the application of CBDC to cross-border payments, with a view to facilitating HKD-THB payment-versus-payment (pvp) among banks in Hong Kong and Thailand.\n\nHKMA Executive Director (Financial Infrastructure), Mr Colin Pou (first from left), together with Director-General of the Institute of Digital Currency of the PBoC, Mr Mu Changchun (first from right), witness the signing ceremony of an MoU to conduct a PoC trial on linking up eTradeConnect and the PBoC Trade Finance Platform. The MoU is signed between Chief Executive Officer of the Hong Kong Trade Finance Platform Company Limited, Ms Haster Tang (second from left), and Deputy Director-General of the Institute of Digital Currency of the PBoC and Director of the Shenzhen Fintech Institute, Mr Di Gang (second from right).\n\nOn artificial intelligence (AI), the HKMA carried out a study on the application of AI technology in the Hong Kong banking industry. Key findings of an industry-wide AI survey were published in November, followed by the issuance of the full report, titled “Reshaping Banking with Artificial Intelligence”, in December.\n\nThe report “Reshaping Banking with Artificial Intelligence” is published in December.\n\nA fact sheet is published to highlight the key facts and figures derived from a survey on the use of AI in the Hong Kong banking industry.\n\nIn an effort to enlarge the fintech talent pool, the HKMA continued to run the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme 2.0 in collaboration with its strategic partners to nurture young talent at various stages of their career development. Over 220 students benefited from the programme last

國際金融中心\n\n香港是一個世界各地具有競爭力的國際金融中心。落實智慧銀行措施已取得良好進展，以進一步推動香港作為金融科技樞紐。藉著利用內地金融市場開放所帶來嘅機遇，已作出大量進展以推動粵港澳大灣區的金融合作，尤其是在便利香港居民於該領域跨境使用金融和銀行服務方面。\n\n同時，已作出大量努力，以開放新機遇進一步加強香港金融平台的競爭力，包括基礎設施投資融資、綠色金融及私人股權基金。香港金融學院已設立，以可持續的方式提升香港的軟實力。\n\n在中央銀行及監管界別中，香港金融管理局在數目區域及國際委員會中發揮領導作用，這明確肯定了香港在國際工作方面的專業知識和承諾。\n\n# 概覽\n\n為加強香港作為亞洲金融科技中心的地位，香港金融管理局（HKMA）大力推動實施於2017年9月公布的七項智慧銀行措施，旨在促進銀行及支付行業內金融科技的發展與應用。這些措施在本年度的關鍵進展包括：\n\n- 擴展更快支付系統（FpS）的應用；  \n- 促進銀行業開放應用程式介面（open ApI）架構第一階段和第二階段（II）的落實；  \n- 進一步提升金融科技研究與人才發展；  \n- 加強金融科技領域的跨境合作；授予八間虛擬銀行牌照；  \n- 促進業界日益增加地使用金融科技監管沙盒（FSS）2.0來推出金融科技計劃；以及  \n- 透過「 Banking Made Easy 」計劃進一步促進監管科技（Regtech）的應用。\n\n香港金融管理局金融科技促進辦公室（FFO）與香港金融管理局銀行部共同發揮推動落實這些計劃的關鍵作用。\n\n香港在全球範圍內發揮不可或缺的作用，促進國際投資者配置人民幣資產，憑藉滬港通和債券通計劃，擁有無與倫比的內地市場準入渠道。 過去一年，債券通註冊投資者數目增長兩倍，每日成交額亦可見一斑。 債券通和滬港通進一步引入了多項優化措施，為國際投資者投資內地證券提供更多便利和靈活性。 香港金管局亦與內地當局緊密合作，探索和實施一系列金融便利措施，方便香港居民在粵港澳大灣區全方位地獲取金融和銀行服務，包括具前景的兩方式財富管理互聯互通計劃。 香港保持堅定不移的立足點，作為離岸人民幣業務的全球中心。 根據國際清算銀行（BIS）三年一次的《外匯及衍生品市場成交額調查》，香港繼續是全球最大的人民幣離岸外匯中心。\n\n持續投入努力以開拓新機遇，進一步提升香港金融平台的競爭力。為推動香港的基金業務發展，香港金融管理局與政府及業界緊密合作，提供更為利好的稅務及監管環境，以促進基金設立。為推廣香港作為綠色金融、基礎設施投資與融資及企業財務中心（CTCs）的樞紐，舉辦了一系列大型活動及針對性宣傳推廣行動。為提升香港的軟實力，香港金融學院（AoF）於6月設立，以培育金融領導人才並推動研究合作。\n\n在中央銀行及監管機構中，香港金管局在數目眾多的區域及國際委員會中發揮領導作用。香港金管局領導金融穩定理事會（FSB）的監管與合作常設委員會（SRC），直至2019年8月31日。現時，香港金管局擔任巴塞爾銀行監理委員會（Basel Committee）的監管與落實小組（SIG）主席，以及東亞及太平洋區中央銀行高級管理人員會議（EMEAP）下設立的金融市場工作小組（WGFM）主席。香港金管局亦與美國證券交易委員會共同擔任金融穩定理事會（FSB）的非銀行監測專家小組（NMEG）主席。\n\n香港金融基礎設施的安全高效運作，為香港作為國際金融中心奠定了穩固的根基。四個銀行間即時全額結算系統（RTGS）、中央結算及交收系統（CMU）及香港儲存庫（HKTR）在2019年取得100%的系統可用率，超越了99.95%的目標。透過與兩家內地中央證券存管機構設立的賬戶，中央結算及交收系統協助進行北向債券通交易的結算，並代表相關會員持有內地債務證券。\n\n轉數快作為港元即時支付系統的延伸，使公眾能全天候跨不同銀行及儲值設施（SVFs）進行即時零售資金轉帳及付款，其在首個運作年順暢。用戶對該設施的採用率持續增加，截至年底已達四百萬登記數目及交易量增長兩倍。轉數快為零售支付行業帶來新機遇，並推動金融科技創新。\n\n為確保本地零售支付行業的整體安全及效率，金管局已指定並監察《支付系統及儲值設施條例》（PSSVFO）下的六個零售支付系統（RPS）。金管局亦於5月發出兩張新的儲值設施牌照，使儲值設施牌照持有人的數目增至18。儲值設施牌照持牌人於該年繼續推出新產品及服務，積極多元化客戶選擇，並提升使用者經驗。\n\n# 檢討 2019\n\n# 香港作為亞洲金融科技樞紐\n\n# 智慧銀行創新方案\n\n香港金管局於2017年9月公布了七項智慧銀行業倡議，旨在協助銀行業**取得****更高**的**運作**水平，並把握銀行與科技匯聚所帶來的**龐大****機遇**。在該**年**，在**實施**這些倡議和轉型香港的金融科技生態系統方面**作出**了**大量**的**進展**。\n\n# 更快付款系統\n\n2018年9月推出轉數快是香港在數碼時代金融基礎設施發展的里程碑。轉數快進一步推動香港採用電子支付，透過向公眾及企業提供高效及方便的支付服務。自轉數快推出以來，參與服務供應商的數目已增加至30間銀行及11間SVF，此外，新增了九間銀行及一間SVF，至2019年底。\n\n轉數快的使用量亦穩定增長。截至2019年12月31日，轉數快記錄了首個四百萬登記數目（圖1），並處理了總額為港幣748.5億元及人民幣17億元的44百萬宗交易。12月，每日成交額達到168,000宗，價值港幣2.4億元及人民幣38百萬（圖2），相比其2018年10月首個十足運作每月，當時的交易宗數為51,000宗。\n\n更快支付系統記錄：\n-

{"en":"# Reserves Management\n\nGlobal financial markets performed better than expected in 2019 as the effect of accommodative monetary policies from major central banks outweighed concerns about the global growth slowdown and US-China trade tensions. Global equity markets rebounded following a significant correction in the fourth quarter of 2018, while major government bond yields declined and bond prices went up. Under such a favourable environment, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$262.2 billion in 2019, representing an investment return of 6.6%.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The HKMA, under the delegated authority of the Financial Secretary (FS) and within the terms of the delegation, is responsible to the FS for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(a) to preserve capital;\n(b) to ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(c) to ensure that sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) subject to (a)–(c), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund.\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP). The BP holds highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under Currency Board arrangements. The IP invests primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of its assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA diversifies part of the Exchange Fund’s investments in a prudent and incremental manner into a wider variety of asset classes. This includes emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The cap for the market value of investments under the LTGP is set at the aggregate of one-third of the accumulated surplus of the Exchange Fund and the portion of the Future Fund and placements by subsidiaries of the Exchange Fund linked to the LTGP.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007, holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that have been acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes. This Portfolio is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of its unique nature.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by fiscal reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP, with the major exception of the Future Fund, which links its interest rate to both the IP and the LTGP with reference to the portfolio mix. As at the end of 2019, the portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 40:60.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation. The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents long-term asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark (or strategic) allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and tracking error limit are determined by the FS in consultation with the EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may assume positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nThe HKMA set up the Exchange Fund Investment Office (EFIO) in August 2018 to house its investment and related risk management functions. Staff members of the EFIO directly manage about 71% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, comprising the entire BP and part of the IP. This part of the IP includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 29% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes. The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to realise sustainable returns, draw on diverse and complementary investment styles, and gain their market insights and technical expertise in investment.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is determined primarily by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe growing complexity of the investment environment underlines the importance of risk management. Stringent controls and investment guidelines are in place for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and compliance with guidelines and regulations is closely monitored. As the investment environment has become more complex, risk assessment has been strengthened to support the Exchange Fund’s increased level of investment diversification. Risk-control tools are deployed to assess market risks under both normal and adverse market conditions. Detailed performance attribution analyses are also conducted to identify sources of performance, enabling the HKMA to assess how to make the best use of the investment skills of both internal and external managers.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nThe HKMA is supportive of responsible investment (RI) by weaving environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into the investment process for both public and private market investments of the Exchange Fund.\n\nIn terms of public market investments, the HKMA implements both process-related and investment-related measures. One process-related measure taken by the HKMA is the adoption of the Principles of Responsible Ownership (PRO) issued by the Securities and Futures Commission in 2016, which help investors determine how best to meet their ownership responsibilities in relation to their investments in Hong Kong-listed companies. In managing the Exchange Fund, the HKMA has developed internal guidelines on ESG factors covering the process of selection, appointment and monitoring of external fund managers. The appointed external fund managers for the HKMA’s Hong Kong equities and Mainland active equities portfolios are required to adhere to the pRO in managing the investments on a “comply-or-explain” basis, and external fund managers appointed to manage the HKMA’s portfolios in developed market equities need to adhere to internationally recognised ESG standards. Apart from externally managed funds, ESG factors are also incorporated into the credit risk analysis of the HKMA’s internally managed bond investment.\n\nAs for ESG investments in the public market, the HKMA has invested in green bonds since 2015 as one of the early investors in this market, and participates in the Managed Co-Lending Portfolio Programme, which is run by the International Finance Corporation with a focus on sustainable investments across emerging markets. Going forward, the HKMA will continue to grow its green bond portfolio by either direct investment or investing in green bond funds. The HKMA also plans to construct ESGthemed mandates in equities investment by adopting an ESG equities index as a benchmark for passive portfolios and engaging active equities managers who apply ESG factors in their investment decisions.\n\nWith respect to private market investments, the HKMA examines the ESG policies and practices of general partners as part of its due diligence process. In particular, ESG risk evaluation is conducted as a mandatory part of due diligence in all LTGP investments. For the LTGP, the HKMA invests in projects with sustainable features; for instance, the HKMA has invested in renewables since 2013 in direct and co-investments in the energy sector, as well as green buildings and warehouses with green and sustainable features in its real estate portfolio. Going forward, the HKMA will continue to source projects with sustainable features and include green accreditation as a predominant factor in real estate investment.\n\nThe HKMA will monitor the development of ESG standards closely and assess how these standards can be further integrated into its investment process. The process is facilitated by its collaboration with like-minded investors and relevant international organisations. In particular, being a signatory of the UN-supported principles for Responsible Investment, which is the world’s leading proponent of RI, the HKMA expects to participate in the formulation of ESG best practices and to motivate other investors in adopting RI. Besides, the HKMA is also a member of FCLTGlobal, a not-for-profit organisation that works to encourage a longer-term focus in business and investment decision-making through workshops and research studies. In 2019, the HKMA also became a supporter of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures.\n\nFor more details about the HKMA’s RI policy framework, see the Corporate Social Responsibility chapter.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2019\n\nDespite concerns about the global growth slowdown and US-China trade tensions, global financial markets performed well in 2019 on the back of accommodative monetary policies from major central banks. Following a significant correction in the fourth quarter of 2018, global equity markets rallied in 2019. In the bond markets, major government bond yields declined markedly while bond prices went up in the first three quarters of 2019 as a result of monetary easing. Although bond prices retreated in the fourth quarter amid a slight rebound in yields, the overall gains in the bond markets were still satisfactory in 2019.\n\nIn the currency markets, major currencies performed differently against the US dollar. After declining by 3.8% in the third quarter due to an escalation of US-China trade tensions, the renminbi recovered part of its earlier losses in the fourth quarter given easing trade tensions. Overall, the renminbi depreciated by 1.4% against the US dollar. While the pound fell by 3.2% in the third quarter due to the heightened risk of a no-deal Brexit, it had since rebounded significantly as more clarity on Brexit emerged in the fourth quarter, eventually gaining 4.0% against the US dollar.\n\nThe performances of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2019 are shown in Table 1.\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$262.2 billion in 2019. This comprised gains on bonds of HK$114.5 billion, gains on Hong Kong equities of HK$22.1 billion, gains on other equities of HK$100.7 billion, a negative currency translation effect of HK$13.0 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets, and gains of HK$37.9 billion on other investments held by the investment holding subsidiaries of the Fund. Separately, the Strategic portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$2.5 billion.\n\nThe total assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,206.7 billion at the year end. The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$335.1 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$233.4 billion and real estate at HK$101.7 billion. Outstanding investment commitments reached HK$219.3 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund in 2019, excluding the Strategic portfolio, was 6.6%. Specifically, the IP achieved a rate of return of 9.7%, while the Bp gained 2.5%. The LTGP has recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 12.6% since its inception in

的擔憂。全球股票市場在2018年 第4季 的 重大 調整 後 反彈，而主要政府債券收益率 下跌 ，債券價格上漲。在如此 利好 的環境下，金管局 記錄 了2,622 億 港幣的投資收入，相當於 6.6% 的投資回報。\n\n# 交易所基金\n\n匯生銀行基金的目標，按照《匯生銀行基金條例》所制定，是直接或間接影響香港的貨幣匯率。基金亦可運用以維持香港貨幣及金融系統的穩定與健全，幫助維持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。金管局在財政司長的授權下，並在轉授的條款內，對匯生銀行基金的使用和投資管理負責於財政司長。\n\n# 外匯基金管理\n\n# 投資目標與投資組合架構\n\n聯匯基金諮詢委員會（聯匯諮詢委員會）已為聯匯基金設立了以下投資目標：\n\n(a) 保本；  \n(b) 確保整個貨幣基礎在任何時候都由高度流動性的美元計價資產十足支持；  \n(c) 確保有足夠的流動性，以維持貨幣和金融穩定；  \n(d) 在符合(a)至(c)的前提下，取得投資回報，以幫助維持基金的長期購買力。\n\n這些目標選持倉盤十足地考慮了交易基金的法定目的，並註冊於基金的投資組合架構和目標資產配置中。\n\n大致上，外匯基金擁有兩大主要組合：支持組合（BP）及投資組合（IP）。支持組合持有高度流動性的美元計價資產，以根據貨幣發行局制度的規定，為貨幣基礎提供十足支持。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作及發展組織成員國的債券及股票市場，以保本並維持其資產的長線購買力。\n\n為更好地管理風險並提升中長線回報，香港金管局以審慎且循序漸進的方式，將部分投資基金的資產分散至更廣的資產類別。這包括新興市場及內地債券和股票、私募股權（包括基礎設施）以及房地產。新興市場及內地的債券和股票在投資框架下進行，而私募股權和房地產投資則在長線增長投資組合（LTGP）下進行。長線增長投資組合（LTGP）下投資的市值上限，以投資基金累計盈餘的三分之一以及與長線增長投資組合掛鈎的未來基金及投資基金附屬機構的存款總和為上限。\n\n策略投資組合於二零零七年設立，持有香港交易所及結算所有限公司的股份，該等股份由政府為外匯基金的策略性目的而購得。由於其獨特性質，此投資組合並未包括在基金投資表現的評估中。\n\n# 投資於交易所基金\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定機構的存款。利率一般與投資組合表現掛鈎，但未來基金為重大例外，其利率則同時參考投資組合配置，與投資組合及長期增值基金掛鈎。截至2019年底，未來基金投資組合中投資組合及長期增值基金的配置比例約為40:60。\n\n#投資流程\n\n交易所基金的投資過程以兩類資產配置的決定為支持：策略性資產配置和戰略性資產配置。策略性資產配置反映在投資基準中，代表鑒於交易所基金的投資目標所作出的長線資產配置。以策略性配置作指引，資產會被戰略性分配，以爭取超越基準的超額回報。這表示實際配置往往不同於基準（或策略性）配置。實際配置與基準配置之間的差距稱為「戰略性偏離」。基準和追蹤錯誤上限由金管局與基金諮詢委員會共同決定，而戰略性決定以及戰略性偏離的允許範圍則由金管局在授權的當局下作出並設立。在允許的戰略性偏離範圍內，投資組合經理可以選持倉盤，以獲利於短期市場變化。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）於2018年8月設立了外匯基金投資辦公室（EFIO），以管理其投資及相關風險管理職能。EFIO的員工直接管理外匯基金約71%的投資，包括整個BP及IP的一部分。IP的這部分包括投資於全球定息市場的一系列投資組合，以及各項衍生工具疊加組合，用以實施為基金制定的宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 使用外部管理人員\n\n此外，除了內部管理資產外，香港金管局聘請外部基金經理管理約29日匯生基金的資產，包括其所有上市股本投資組合及其他專業資產類別。聘用外部經理的目的是爭取市場上可用的最佳投資專業知識，以實現可持續的回報，汲取多元且互補的投資風格，以及獲得他們在投資方面的市場洞察力和技術專業知識。\n\n與使用外部經理相關的支出包括基金管理費及託管費用、交易成本以及扣繳及其他稅項。此支出主要由市場因素決定，並可能每年有所變動。\n\n# 風險管理與合規\n\n投資環境的增長複雜度強調了風險管理的重要性。嚴格的控制和投資指引已制定於內部和外部管理的投資組合，並且對遵守指引和法規的情況進行緊密監察。隨著投資環境成為更複雜，風險評估已加強以支持外匯基金增加的投資多元化程度。風險控制工具被部署以評估在正常和不利市場條件下的市場風險。詳細的績效歸因分析亦進行以物色績效來源，支持金管局評估如何制定最佳運用內部和外部經理的技巧。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n香港金融管理局支持將環境、社會及管治因素併入交易所基金的公眾及私人市場投資。\n\n就公開市場投資而言，金管局實施了流程相關及投資相關的措施。金管局採納的一項流程相關措施是採用證券及期貨事務監察委員會於2016年發佈的《責任投資原則》（PRO），這有助於投資者決定如何最佳滿足其與其在香港上市公司的投資相關的責任。在管理外匯基金方面，金管局已制定內部指引，涵蓋外部基金經理的甄選、委任和監察流程，以評估環境、社會及管治因素。獲委任管理金管局香港股票及內地主動股票投資組合的外部基金經理規定恪守《責任投資原則》，並以「遵守或解釋」的方式管理投資；而獲委任管理金管局於發達市場股票投資組合的外部基金經理則需要恪守國際公認的環境、社會及管治標準。除了外部管理的基金外，環境、社會及管治因素亦已註冊到金管局內部管理的債券投資的信用風險分析中。\n\n至於公共市場的環境、社會及管治投資，香港金融管理局早於2015年便已投資於綠色債券，成為該市場最早的投資者之一，並參與由國際金融公司主導、重點關注新興市場可持續投資的共同貸款投資組合計劃。展望未來，香港金融管理局將繼續增長其綠色債券投資組合，或直接投資，或投資於綠色債券基金。香港金融管理局亦計劃在股權投資中構建以ESG為主題的授權，採納環境、社會及管治股權指數作為被動投資組合的基準，並聘用將環境、社會及管治因素應用於其投資決定的主動股權經理。\n\n就私募市場投資方面而言，金管局在盡職審查過程中檢視普通合夥人的環境、社會及管治政策和實務。特別是，環境、社會及管治風險評估是所有長遠策略投資組合投資的強制性盡職審查部分。對於長遠策略投資組合，金管局投資具有可持續發展特點的項目；例如，自2013年起，金管局已直接及共同投資能源行業的可再生能源，以及其房地產投資組合中的綠色建築和具有綠色及可持續發展特點的倉庫。展望未來，金管局將繼續尋找具有可持續發展特點的項目，並將綠色認證納入房地產投資的重要因素。\n\n香港金融管理局會緊密監察環境、社會及管治標準的發展，並評估這些標準如何能進一步融入其投資過程。此過程有賴其與理念相近的投資者及相關國際組織的合作。特別地，作為聯合國支持的責任投資原則的簽署方，而該原則是全球領先的責任投資倡議平台，香港金融管理局預期會參與制定環境、社會及管治的最佳實踐，並鼓勵其他投資者採納責任投資。此外，香港金融管理局亦為FCLTGlobal的成員，該組織為非牟利機構，透過研討會及研究工作，致力於鼓勵企業及投資決策中融入長遠觀點。2019年，香港金融管理局亦成為氣候相關財務披露任務小組的支持者。\n\n為更多關於香港金管局的責任投資政策框架的細則，請見企業社會責任章節。\n\n# 基金績效\n\n# 2019年金融市場\n\n儘管對全球經濟成長減速及中美貿易摩擦的擔憂，全球金融市場在2019年仍表現良好，這得益於主要央行寬鬆的貨幣政策。在2018年第4季經歷重大調整後，全球股市在2019年出現反彈。在債券市場方面，主要國家政府債券收益率顯著下跌，而債券價格在2019年首三個季度因貨幣寬鬆而上漲。儘管第4季債券價格因收益率略為反彈而回落，但債券市場整體表現仍屬滿意。\n\n在貨幣市場中，重大貨幣對美元的表現各異。在較早前的第三季度，由於美中貿易摩擦升溫，人民幣下跌了 3.8%，但在第四季度鑒於貿易摩擦緩和，人民幣反彈了部分之前的損失。整體而言，人民幣對美元貶值了 1.4%。雖然英鎊在第三季度因脫歐無協議的風險增加而下跌了 3.2%，但自此大幅反彈，隨著第四季度脫歐情況明朗化，最終增強了 4.0% 的美元價值。\n\n二零一九年主要貨幣、債券和股票市場的表現見表一。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n金管局在2019年記錄了HK$2,622億的投資收益。此收益包括債券收益HK$1,145億、香港股票收益HK$221億、其他股票收益HK$1,007億、非港元資產的負匯率影響HK$130億，以及基金投資持倉子公司持有的其他投資收益HK$379億。另一方面，戰略投資組合記錄了HK$2.5%的評值收益。\n\n交易所基金的總資產在年底達到4,206.7億港元。長期資產管理計劃（LTGP）下的投資總值為335.1億港元，其中私人股權為233.4億港元，不動產為101.7億港元。未償還的投資承諾達到219.3億港元。\n\n2019年，聯匯基金（不包括策略投資組合）的投資回報為6.6%。具體而言，IP 取得 9.7% 的回報率，而 Bp 則增長了 2.5%。自 2009 年成立以來，LTGP 記錄了年化內部回報率為 12.6%。\n"}
{"en":"# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communication with the community and the market through the traditional media, social media platforms, its website, the Information Centre and various other channels to facilitate public understanding about its policies and operations. Within the institution, conscientious efforts are made to improve the HKMA’s corporate governance by supporting the professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline, enhancing information technology security, and promoting a culture of innovation to cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives and the increasing complexity of work.\n\n# ENGAGING THE COMMUNITY\n\n# Media relations and social media\n\nThe HKMA works closely with the media to enhance transparency and promote public understanding about its policies and work. During the year, 125 open press events were held, comprising 10 press conferences, 12 stand-up interviews and 103 other public functions. A further 25 media interviews were arranged. A total of 466 bilingual press releases were issued and a large number of media enquiries were handled every day.\n\nTo raise awareness of the HKMA’s key functions, the HKMA organised media briefings and educational workshops for local and overseas media as well as key opinion leaders in the community to facilitate understanding on a wide range of topics, such as the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), virtual banking, green finance, and Hong Kong as a competitive international financial centre.\n\nSince July 2018, the HKMA has launched various social media channels to strengthen public education and communication. Five social media channels are currently in operation: Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter and YouTube, reaching out to a total of over 45,000 followers as at end-December 2019. Amid the social incidents in the second half of 2019, the HKMA made use of social media to rebut unfounded rumours regarding banking operations and financial stability, a move which proved to be highly effective in disseminating facts and preventing the rumours from spreading further.\n\n# Public enquiries\n\nThe Public Enquiry Service provides an effective means for the public to better understand the key functions and operations of the HKMA. A total of 9,742 enquiries were handled in 2019, about half of which were related to banking policies and regulations, consumer banking, and notes and coins. Some of the notable enquiries raised were about the Coin Collection programme, banking products and services, banking-related guidelines and circulars, the Faster Payment System (FPS), and monetary and economic statistics.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received since 2016 and Chart 2 provides a breakdown by enquiry nature in 2019.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Eddie Yue, speaks at the Hong Kong Association of Banks Distinguished Speaker Luncheon.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Eddie Yue (left), and HKMA's then Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan, meet with media after the announcement of the appointment of Mr Eddie Yue as the next Chief Executive of the HKMA.\n\n# Publications\n\nApart from the HKMA Annual Report, in 2019 the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report, four issues of the Quarterly Bulletin, and regular updates of the Monthly Statistical Bulletin to provide up-to-date and thematic information and analyses on monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. In addition, the HKMA published 19 inSight articles, covering various topics related to its work. The inSight articles provide a useful channel for the HKMA to elucidate the rationale behind its major new initiatives or policies, and provide timely response to topical issues which are of interest to the public.\n\n# HKMA website\n\nThe HKMA official website (www.hkma.gov.hk) presents more than 40,000 pages of content in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, and is the public access gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It also contains the register of authorized institutions (AIs) and local representative offices and the register of the securities staff of AIs, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the register of stored value facility (SVF) licensees under the payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance. The HKMA official website underwent a major revamp and was relaunched in September with a new design layout, enriched content, an enhanced navigation structure, and more convenient search functions. The revamped website enables users to search information more easily and conveniently based on their own preferences. In particular, the revamped website carries a new section on “Smart Consumers”, where the public can find useful information and smart tips on a wide range of banking and related products or services. This is in line with the HKMA’s long-standing efforts to promote “smart and responsible” use of banking services.\n\nThe HKMA launches its revamped website.\n\nThe revamped HKMA website carries a new section on “Smart Consumers”.\n\nThe HKMA has been opening up financial data and important information published on its website via Open Application Programming Interface (Open API) by phases since 2018. By 2019, the HKMA has opened up 130 sets of Open ApIs on the HKMA’s website as originally planned. The HKMA embraces the development and application of Open API.\n\n# HKMA Information Centre\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre is an important resource introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters. It consists of an exhibition area and a library, and is open to the public six days a week. The exhibition area describes the HKMA’s work and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong. It also contains reading materials and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nThe HKMA completed the last phase of revamp of its Information Centre — the Historical Timeline — during the year. The revamped Historical Timeline, featuring multimedia and digital display panels for visitors to review the major monetary and financial events in Hong Kong and globally in a more interactive manner, was re-opened to the public in October.\n\nThe first section of the Historical Timeline is made up of a multimedia display panel presenting major events from 1842 to 1993.\n\nThe second section of the Historical Timeline is a digital display panel presenting major events from 1993, when the HKMA was established, to the present.\n\nThe Information Centre organises guided tours for visitors. During the year, it received more than 48,000 visitors and hosted over 480 guided tours for schools and other groups (Chart 3). More than 753,000 people have visited the Information Centre since it opened in December 2003.\n\nGuided tours of the Information Centre are organised for schools and other group visitors.\n\nThe library, situated next to the exhibition area, houses more than 26,000 books, journals and other publications for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs and central banking topics. It also maintains the register of AIs and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\n# Public and consumer education\n\nTo reach out to the community and raise public awareness of the HKMA’s work, the HKMA organised a public education seminar for over 400 secondary school students and teachers in 2019. Topics covered in the seminar included an introduction to the work of the HKMA, Hong Kong’s banknotes, the FPS, SVFs, fintech and the Deposit Protection Scheme. More than 60,000 teachers and students have participated in this programme since its launch in 1998.\n\nStudents and teachers from secondary schools in different districts attend the 2019 public education seminar.\n\nThe focus of the HKMA’s consumer education initiatives during the year was on educating the public to protect their “personal digital keys”, a concept introduced to help the public visualise the significance of safeguarding information for accessing their online accounts. The central message was that in the digital world, account login details and personal information related to internet banking and other digital financial services were as important as the keys to their home, and should be well protected. Extensive promotion was arranged across different media, including the TV, radio, mobile applications, social media, and other digital and out-of-home platforms, to highlight smart tips on how to protect personal digital keys.\n\nThe Flagship Campaign on Personal Digital Keys is conducted via extensive cross-media promotion.\n\nSustained initiatives were also carried out to educate the public to be smart and responsible financial consumers. For example, members of the public were urged to stay vigilant of bogus phone calls purportedly from banks, and of investment scams promoted on social media. Issues to note when handling personal credit products, in particular personal loans taken out during the tax season, were also promoted.\n\nTo enhance financial literacy among secondary school students, the HKMA co-organised the “Hong Kong Liberal Studies Financial Literacy Championship” with various stakeholders for the fifth year. Infographics were newly used in the Championship this year to help students better understand sophisticated financial concepts. An online quiz was conducted, attracting 10,450 submissions and culminating in the grand final competition, which was held at the HKMA for the first time. \n\nThe Championship, attracting over 10,000 online submissions, ends with a live competition at the HKMA.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA kicked off the Second phase of its Cross-generation Outreach Educational programme, which was organised jointly with an education institution. The programme comprised bank simulation games, parents’ talks and train-the-trainer workshops, targeting kindergarten pupils, their parents and teachers, as well as young adults. Other initiatives on youth education included producing comic storybooks for primary school students and parents jointly with a professional association, as well as delivering talks to tertiary school students.\n\nThe HKMA continued to support the Investor and Financial Education Council in promoting financial literacy and capacity in Hong Kong, and will explore further collaboration with different stakeholders to maximise the impact of consumer education.\n\nThe Achievement Ceremony for the First Phase of the Crossgeneration Outreach Programme is held alongside the launch of the Second Phase.\n\nKindergarten pupils participate in the bank simulation game.\n\nComic storybooks are produced jointly with a professional association to disseminate smart tips on using banking and financial services to primary school students and their parents.\n\n# OUR PEOPLE\n\nWhile the HKMA is an integral part of the Government, it employs staff on terms different from those of the civil service to attract people with the right experience and expertise. The HKMA recruits, develops and maintains a highly professional workforce to support its policy objectives and respond flexibly to changing work priorities.\n\nThe establishment of the HKMA in 2019 was 1,005. During the year, the HKMA conducted a cross-departmental re-engineering exercise to enhance the efficiency of various work processes and redeploy existing resources to support new initiatives. As a result of this rigorous exercise, the overall establishment of the HKMA in 2020 remains unchanged at 1,005. Resources have been redeployed to undertake the following new tasks:\n\n# Banking and Financial Stability\n- Develop and implement a supervisory regime for virtual banks and cope with the increasingly complex prudential supervision standards\n- Enhance supervisory capacity for the new regulatory regime for insurance intermediaries\n- Step up ongoing monitoring of banks’ culture reform, and conduct ongoing supervision of banks and other relevant entities providing trust services\n\n# Reserves Management\n- Strengthen investment and risk management and other necessary support for the further expansion and diversification of the Exchange Fund’s investment activities\n\n# Hong Kong as an International Financial Centre\n- Support reforms that enhance the international competitiveness of Hong Kong’s tax regime regarding different financial services sectors\n- Enhance the daily qualitative market surveillance and analyses of Trade Repository data\n\nTable 1 gives a breakdown of the establishment and strength of the HKMA.\n\n# Remuneration policies and pay review mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary (FS) determines the pay and conditions of service for HKMA staff on the advice of the Governance Sub-Committee (GSC) through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC), taking into account the prevailing market rates and practices. Remuneration comprises a total cash package and a provident fund scheme, with minimal benefits in kind. the cash package consists of monthly fixed pay (or basic pay) and variable pay that may be awarded to individual staff members as a lump sum once a year, depending on performance.\n\nPay for HKMA staff is reviewed annually by the FS in the light of recommendations made to him by the GSC through the eFAC, taking into account the GSC’s assessment of the performance of the HKMA in the preceding year, the pay-survey findings of the financial sector conducted by independent human resources consultants, and any other relevant factors. Special pay adjustments may be made from time to time to reward individual meritorious staff members and to maintain the competitiveness of their pay.\n","terms":{"achievements":["成果"],"strengthened":["加強"],"enhanced":["加強"],"need":["需要"],"COVID-19":["新型冠狀病毒"],"cast":["造成"],"merchants":["商戶"],"established":["設立"],"challenges":["挑戰"],"corporates":["企業"],"must":["必須"],"work":["工作"],"historical":["歷史"],"orderly":["有序"],"world":["全球"],"15":["15"],"enhance":["提升"],"areas":["範疇"],"span":["短短"],"economy":["經濟"],"sight":["忽略"],"people":["市民"],"rest":["其餘"],"800,000":["80萬"],"June":["6月"],"including":["包括"],"’":["’"],"facing":["面對"],"borrowers":["借款人"],"half":["一半"],"anything":["跌宕起伏"],"2009":["2009年"],"environmentfriendly":["具環保意識"],"happen":["發生"],"November":["11月"],"granular":["細緻"],"800":["800"],"provide":["提供"],"record":["紀錄"],"make":["制定"],"support":["支持"],"new":["新"],"applied":["應用"],"year":["年"],"evolving":["變化"],"applying":["應用"],"face":["面對"],"launch":["推出"],"principle":["原則"],"phases":["階段"],"According":["根據"],"thereby":["從而"],"stable":["穩定"],"achieve":["取得"],"economies":["經濟體"],"foot":["步伐"],"greatly":["大大"],"billion":["億"],"almost":["接近"],"particularly":["特別"],"fulfil":["履行"],"society":["社會"],"providing":["提供"],"put":["投入"],"rumours":["謠言"],"bearing":["顯著"],"opportunities":["機遇"],"doubt":["懷疑"],"Apart":["除了"],"set":["設立"],"major":["重大"],"rounds":["輪"],"operation":["運作"],"also":["亦"],"regard":["顧及"],"hard":["困難"],"promoting":["推動"],"1.0":["1.0%"],"addressing":["應對"],"would":["將"],"applications":["應用"],"like":["例如"],"sound":["穩健"],"talks":["研討會"],"weather":["抵禦"],"years":["年"],"experienced":["經歷"],"2014":["2014年"],"journey":["旅程"],"challenge":["挑戰"],"broader":["更廣"],"eight":["8"],"sharing":["分享"],"paving":["鋪路"],"latter":["下半年"],"efficiency":["效率"],"cross-banks":["跨行"],"release":["釋放"],"perspective":["角度"],"2.8":["2.8%"],"calm":["冷靜"],"advances":["推進"],"specific":["具體"],"since":["自"],"accessing":["使用"],"opportunity":["機會"],"begun":["開始"],"anchor":["基石"],"step":["步驟"],"uncertainty":["不確定性"],"complemented":["輔以"],"nutshell":["簡單而言"],"address":["應對"],"dedication":["全力"],"worst":["最大"],"fears":["憂慮"],"tensions":["摩擦"],"1983":["1983年"],"activity":["活動"],"fruit":["成效"],"capabilities":["能力"],"SMEs":["中小企"],"discuss":["討論"],"functioning":["運作"],"monitor":["監察"],"challenging":["困難"],"150":["150"],"strengthening":["加強"],"launched":["推出"],"completing":["完成"],"–":["—"],"breakthrough":["突破"],"another":["另一"],"1987":["1987年"],"crises":["危機"],"90":["九成"],"first":["首個"],"capability":["能力"],"strike":["取得"],"businesses":["企業"],"spearheaded":["推動"],"air":["疑慮（釋除疑慮）"],"60":["六成"],"strong":["強大"],"paying":["繳交"],"media":["媒體"],"upgrading":["提升"],"number":["數目"],"well":["良好"],"vital":["重要"],"ahead":["前路"],"numerous":["多次"],"significant":["重大"],"grow":["增長"],"II":["第二階段"],"confidence":["信心"],"rebuttals":["澄清"],"science":["科學"],"light":["因應"],"comparable":["相若"],"structural":["結構性"],"clear":["明確"],"Lingering":["持續"],"firm":["堅定"],"power":["實力"],"swiftly":["迅速"],"us":["我們"],"three":["三"],"trial":["試驗"],"overnight":["一夜之間"],"Consolidating":["鞏固"],"unique":["獨特"],"reached":["達到"],"regulation":["監管"],"within":["內"],"responded":["響應"],"terrorist":["恐怖分子"],"representing":["相當於"],"2016":["2016年"],"May":["5月"],"contracted":["收縮"],"big":["大"],"downturn":["逆轉"],"decent":["理想"],"time":["時"],"months":["個月"],"well-entrenched":["難以取代"],"invest":["投資"],"plays":["發揮"],"help":["幫助"],"smooth":["暢順"],"past":["過去"],"good":["良好"],"Upgrading":["提升"],"gain":["爭取"],"continued":["繼續"],"hit":["打擊"],"cyclical":["周期性"],"greenness":["綠色基準"],"whole":["整體"],"intelligence":["智能（人工智能）"],"drawn":["備受"],"together":["一同"],"encouraging":["鼓勵"],"penetration":["滲透率"],"million":["百萬"],"AoF":["金融學院（Academy

企業職能\n\n香港金融管理局透過傳統媒體、社交媒體平台、其網站、資訊中心及各項其他渠道，與社區及市場保持有效溝通，以促進公眾對其政策及營運的了解。在機構內，作出認真努力以改善公司治理，包括支持員工專業發展、訂立嚴格的財務紀律、提升資訊科技安全，以及推動創新文化，以應對因落實新措施及工作複雜度增加而帶來的挑戰。\n\n# 紹聘社區\n\n# 媒體關係與社交媒體\n\n香港金融管理局與媒體緊密工作，以提升透明度並推動公眾對其政策及工作之了解。本年共舉辦125場開放記者會，包括10場會議、12場即場訪問及103場其他公開活動。另安排25場媒體訪問。共發佈466份雙語新聞稿，每 日處理大量媒體查詢。\n\n為提高公眾對香港金融管理局主要職能的認識，香港金融管理局舉辦了針對本地及海外媒體以及社區內關鍵意見領袖的媒體簡介會及教育研討會，以促進對掛鈎匯率制度（LERS）、虛擬銀行、綠色金融及香港作為一個競爭力強的國際金融中心等廣泛主題的了解。\n\n自2018年7月以來，香港金融管理局已推出各項社交媒體渠道，以加強公眾教育和溝通。現時共有5個社交媒體渠道正在運作：Facebook、Instagram、LinkedIn、Twitter及YouTube，截至2019年12月底，總共有超過45,000名用戶。在2019年第二半年的社會事件之下，香港金融管理局利用社交媒體反駁有關銀行營運及金融穩定的不實謠言，此舉證明在傳播事實及防止謠言進一步散播方面高度有效。\n\n# 公共查詢\n\n公共查詢服務提供了一個有效的方式，讓公眾更好地了解金管局的主要職能和營運。 2019 年共處理了 9,742 宗查詢，其中約一半與銀行政策和法規、消費銀行以及紙幣和硬幣相關。 一些顯著的查詢涉及金幣收藏計劃、銀行產品及服務、銀行相關指引和通函、快速支付系統 (FpS) 以及貨幣和經濟統計。\n\n圖 1 顯示自 2016年 接獲的公眾查詢數目，而圖 2 提供 2019

研究報告\n\n除了香港金融管理局年度報告外，2019年香港金融管理局亦刊登了兩份半年度貨幣及金融穩定報告、四份季度通訊及定期更新的月度統計通訊，以提供有關香港貨幣、銀行及經濟事宜的最新資料及主題分析。此外，香港金融管理局亦刊登了19篇inSight文章，涵蓋與其工作相關的各項主題。inSight文章為香港金融管理局提供一個有用的渠道，以闡釋其重大新舉措或政策的理據，並對公眾關注的時事問題作出適時回應。\n\n# 香港金管局網站\n\n金管局官方網站（www.hkma.gov.hk）提供超過4萬頁的內容，以英文、傳統及簡體中文呈現，是公眾獲取金管局最新資訊的門戶。網站亦包含根據《銀行條例》第20條維護的獲授權機構（AIs）及本地代表辦事處的紀錄冊，以及獲授權機構的證券人員紀錄冊，以及根據《支付系統及儲值易設施條例》維護的儲值易設施（SVF）牌照持有人的紀錄冊。金管局官方網站經歷一向的重大改進，並於9月推出新設計佈局、豐富的內容、加強的導航結構及更方便的搜尋功能。改進後的網站使用戶更容易、更方便地根據自己的偏好搜尋資訊。特別是，改進後的網站設有「明智消費者」的新版塊，公眾可以在此找到涵蓋廣泛的銀行及相關產品或服務的有用資訊及明智提示。這符合金管局一向的努力，以推動「明智及負責任」地使用銀行服務。\n\n金管局推出全新網站。\n\n翻新後的香港金融管理局網站新增了一個名為「聰明消費者」的專欄。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）自2018年起，透過開放應用程式介面（Open API），分階段開立其網站上刊登的財務數據及重要資訊。至2019年，香港金融管理局（HKMA）已按原計劃在其網站上開立130套Open APIs。香港金融管理局（HKMA）支持開放應用程式介面（Open API）的發展與應用。\n\n# 香港金融管理局資訊中心\n\n香港金融管理局資訊中心位於兩國際金融中心55樓，是向社區引入香港金融管理局工作，並推動公眾對貨幣及銀行事務認識的重要資源。資訊中心包括展覽領域及圖書館，並對公眾開放六天。展覽領域描述香港金融管理局的工作，以及香港貨幣和銀行的發展歷程。展覽領域亦包含閱讀材料和展品，以研究香港的貨幣、銀行和金融事務。\n\n香港金融管理局於本年已落成資訊中心翻新工程的最後階段—歷史時間軸。翻新的歷史時間軸主題為多媒體和數碼顯示屏，讓訪問學者以更互動的方式檢討香港及世界各地重大的貨幣和金融事件，並於10月重新開立。\n\n歷史時間軸的首個部分由一個多媒體顯示面板組成，介紹1842年至1993年間的重大事件。\n\n歷史時間軸的第二部分是一個數字顯示板，介紹從1993年香港金融管理局設立至今的重大事件。\n\n資訊中心為訪問學者舉辦導賞服務。在過去一年，中心接獲超過48,000名訪問學者，並為學校及其他團體舉辦超過480場導賞服務（圖3）。自2003年12月資訊中心設立以來，已有超過753,000名市民參觀了資訊中心。\n\n以導賞服務形式舉辦資訊中心的參觀活動，供學校及其他團體訪問學者使用。\n\n圖書館毗鄰展覽領域，藏有超過26日書籍、期刊及其他研究報告，供研究香港貨幣、銀行及金融事務和中央銀行主題之用。它亦保持人工智能及本地代表辦事處的紀錄冊，以及根據銀行條例第20條規定的人工智能的證券人員紀錄冊。\n\n#公眾及消費者教育\n\n為向社會宣傳及提高公眾對金管局工作的認識，金管局於一九九八年推出一項計劃，自此便舉辦了多個公眾教育研討會，邀請超過四○○名中學學生及教師參與。研討會的 主題 涵蓋了金管局的工作 介紹、香港的紙幣、 轉數快 、虛擬銀行發牌、金融科技及存款保障計劃。 至今已有超過六成 的教師及學生 參與了此計劃。\n\n學生和教師來自不同區的各級中學參加了2019年公共教育研討會。\n\n香港金管局的消費者教育倡議活動的重點，在於教育公眾保護他們的“個人數字密碼”，這是一個引入的概念，旨在幫助公眾可視化保障資訊以使用其網上戶口的重要性。 核心訊息是，在數字全球，與網上銀行和其他數字金融服務相關的戶口登入細則和個人資訊，與保護自己住宅的鑰匙一樣重要，應得到良好保障。 為了強調保護個人數字密碼的智慧提示，在不同媒體上安排了廣泛的推廣，包括電視、收音機、手機應用程式、社交媒體以及其他數字和戶外平台。\n\n旗艦個人數位金鑰推廣活動透過廣泛的跨媒體進行。\n\n持續的倡議亦已展開，以教育公眾成為精明且負責任的金融消費者。例如，敦促公眾保持警覺，提防冒充銀行來電的詐騙電話，以及在媒體上宣傳的投資詐騙。關於處理個人信貸產品時需要發出的附註，特別是報稅期間辦理的個人貸款，亦已廣泛宣傳。\n\n為提升中學生當中的財務素養，香港金管局與各項持份者共同舉辦「香港通識教育財務素養錦標賽」，今年已是第五年。今年賽事首次運用資訊圖表，幫助學生更好了解複雜的財務概念。一個網上測驗進行，吸引10,450份參與，最終進入決賽，並首個於香港金管局舉辦。\n\n冠軍賽吸引了超過一萬份網上報名，最後將在香港會議展覽中心舉行現場比賽。\n\n在該年，香港金融管理局展開了其跨代別推廣教育計劃的第二階段，該計劃與一所教育機構聯合舉辦。計劃包括銀行模擬遊戲、家長研討會及培訓講師工作坊，目標對象為幼稚園學生、他們的家長和教師，以及年青人。其他年青人教育的舉措包括與一間專業團體聯合製作小學學生和家長的漫畫故事書，以及向大專學生提供研討會。\n\n香港金融管理局繼續支持投資者及財務教育委員會推動香港的財務素養及能力，並將探索與不同持份者進一步合作，以最大化消費者教育的影響。\n\n跨世代接觸計劃首個階段的成就發布會將與第二階段的推出一同舉辦。\n\n幼稚園學生參與銀行模擬遊戲。\n\n漫畫故事書由專業團體聯合製作，以散佈利用銀行及金融服務的智慧建議給首要學校學生及其家長。\n\n# 我們的市民\n\n雖然香港貨幣管理局是政府的重要部分，但其聘請的員工所訂立的條款與文職人員不同，以吸引具備適當經驗及專業知識的市民。香港貨幣管理局招募、培訓及保持一支高度專業的工作人員隊伍，以支持其政策目標，並靈活回應變動的工作優先事項。\n\n2019年香港金融管理局的設立為1,005。當年，香港金融管理局進行了一項跨部門的再造行動，以提升各項工作流程的效率，並重新調配現有資源以支持新任務。由於這項嚴格的行動，香港金融管理局2020年的整體設立保持不變，仍為1,005。資源已重新調配以執行隨着設立的新任務。\n\n# 銀行及金融穩定性\n- 制定及實施針對虛擬銀行的監管制度，並應對日益複雜的審慎監管標準。\n- 提升針對保險中介人新監管制度的監管能力。\n- 加強持續監控銀行文化改革，並對銀行及其他提供信託服務的相關實體進行持續監管。\n\n# 儲備管理\n- 加強投資及風險管理及其他必要支持，以促進交易所基金投資活動的進一步增長和多元化。\n\n香港作為國際金融中心\n- 支持改革，提升香港稅制在不同金融服務領域的競爭力，有關其國際競爭力。\n- 提升貿易倉儲數據的每日定性市場監察及分析。\n\n表一列出了香港金管局的設立和實力細節。\n\n# 薪酬政策與薪酬檢討機制\n\n財政司司長（FS）根據治理小組委員會（GSC）透過匯率基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）的意見，考慮現行市場薪酬水平及慣例，決定香港金管局（HKMA）員工的薪酬及服務條件。薪酬包括總現金方案及公積金計劃，福利方面則基本。現金方案包括每月固定薪酬（或基本薪酬）及浮動薪酬，該浮動薪酬可能根據表現，每年以合共形式頒發給個別職員。\n\n香港金融管理局員工薪酬每年由金融服務事務委員會根據香港特別行政區政府人事委員會透過eFAC作出的建議進行檢視，並考量香港特別行政區政府人事委員會對香港金融管理局前一年表現的評估、由獨立人力資源顧問進行的金融業薪酬調查的發現，以及任何其他相關因素。有需要時，可不時作出特別薪酬調整，以獎勵個別表現優異的員工，並維持其薪酬的競爭力。\n"}
{"en":"# Corporate Social Responsibility\n\nThe HKMA is committed to fulfilling its corporate social responsibility, and aims to be a responsible and sustainable organisation. This commitment is manifested in various areas, including promoting a sustainable and environment-friendly marketplace, supporting the wider community, protecting the environment and nurturing a caring workplace.\n\n# MARKETPLACE\n\n# Green and sustainable banking\n\nClimate change is one of the major risks threatening the well-being of mankind and the sustainability of the world economy. The financial sector in which banks operate, being an integral part of the society, will also be impacted and hence should be more proactive in managing climate risks. The HKMA is committed to exploring ways to address this challenge. Against this background, the HKMA unveiled in May a number of measures for promoting the development of green finance in Hong Kong, including the adoption of a three-phased approach to promote green and sustainable banking.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nAs the investment manager of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA believes that the concept of responsible investment (RI) is highly relevant to its investment work. As the HKMA is one of the world’s largest asset owners, it will have a major impact on how fund managers pick assets.\n\n# Our Beliefs\n\nThe HKMA sees RI as an investment approach that takes into account the impact of various environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors on long-term investment returns and their sustainability. The HKMA believes that, by putting an appropriate emphasis on RI and sustainable long-term economic performance, it can better achieve the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund and reduce risks associated with the ESG-related matters of its underlying investments.\n\n# Our Principles\n\nThe HKMA’s guiding principle is that priority will generally be given to ESG investments if the long-term risk-adjusted return is comparable with other investments. Where appropriate, the HKMA adopts in its investment process the following RI principles that underpin its beliefs as a responsible long-term investor:\n\n# Integration\n\nThe HKMA incorporates ESG factors into its investment analysis processes to identify risks and opportunities, as it believes that these factors can materially affect the long-term value of its investments. Specifically, the HKMA has been integrating ESG factors into its investment process for both public and private market investments. For public market investments, the HKMA incorporates ESG factors in its credit risk analysis of bond investment. External managers that share the HKMA’s RI beliefs are selected and appointed. The HKMA communicates its RI beliefs to all its external managers and expects them to align in such a way that the overall sustainable long-term economic performance target is attainable. For private market investments, the ESG policies and practices of the HKMA’s general partners are examined as part of its due diligence process.\n\n# Active ownership\n\nThe HKMA exercises shareholder rights in its public equity holding in a manner that helps safeguard the long-term value of its investments. The HKMA believes that responsible corporate behaviour guided by ESG factors will help create shareholder value in the long term. The HKMA’s asset managers are expected to help the HKMA discharge its ownership responsibilities in the underlying investments by adopting active ownership through exercising voting rights and engaging with the corporates concerned.\n\n# Collaboration\n\nThe HKMA seeks to join hands with like-minded investors and regulators to promote good practices for the long-term management of investments. It participates in and speaks at public events to share views and encourage the investment community to adopt RI.\n\nSee the Reserves Management chapter for more details about the HKMA’s work on RI during the year.\n\n# Promoting financial inclusion\n\nThe HKMA attaches great importance to financial inclusion and has been making significant effort in promoting access to basic banking services by different segments of the society to meet the basic daily needs of the general public and the operational needs of legitimate businesses. In particular, the HKMA has been working closely with the banking industry on the following priority areas:\n\n- Encouraging banks to launch more physical banking facilities and develop digital and innovative channels for the delivery of basic banking services to serve the general public, particularly residents of remote areas and public housing estates, and the elderly;\n\n- Facilitating and monitoring the accessibility of bank accounts to individuals and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs);\n\n- Enhancing the accessibility of banking services to specific customer groups, for example, customers with disabilities and ethnic minorities;\n\n- Facilitating and monitoring the accessibility of bank credit to SMEs; and\n\n- Granting authorization to eight virtual banks, which will play an active role in promoting financial inclusion in delivering their banking services.\n\n# COMMUNITY\n\n# Promoting financial literacy\n\nThe HKMA promotes financial literacy through various channels. Apart from running educational programmes to promote smart and responsible use of banking and financial services by the public, the HKMA features on its revamped official website a new dedicated section on “Smart Consumers”, where the public can find useful information and smart tips on a wide range of banking and related products and services. Social media platforms such as Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube, Instagram and Twitter are used in addition to the HKMA official website and publications to provide up-to-date information on banking and financial affairs.\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre, serving as the HKMA’s major public education and research resource since 2003, introduces the work of the HKMA to the community and promotes public awareness of monetary and banking matters. Educational guided tours are offered daily for group visitors from schools and non-profit making organisations. public education seminars and other activities are also organised for students to enhance their financial knowledge and literacy. In addition, the HKMA works closely with the Investor and Financial Education Council to promote financial literacy in Hong Kong via its financial education platform, The Chin Family.\n\nSee the Corporate Functions chapter for more details about the HKMA’s work on promoting financial literacy during the year. See the Banking Stability chapter for more details about the HKMA’s work on promoting financial inclusion during the year.\n\n# Addressing the needs of special groups \n\n# Accessibility of Hong Kong banknotes\n\nThe 2018 Series of Banknotes retains accessibility features used in the previous series of banknotes to help the visually impaired differentiate between the denominations. These accessibility features include Braille, tactile lines and high-tactility numerals.\n\nTo help the visually impaired differentiate between the denomination of the banknotes, a mobile app, sponsored by the HKMA and developed by the Hong Kong Society for the Blind, uses the phone’s camera to scan the banknote patterns for the denomination. The app is available for download from Apple App Store and Google play Store for free. A note-measuring template sponsored by the HKMA and the three note-issuing banks has also been introduced to measure the length of the note. It can measure both the 2018 Series and the notes currently in circulation. The template is embossed with Braille on one side and symbols on the other. It is freely distributed at voluntary agencies serving the visually impaired community.\n\n# Coin Collection Programme\n\nUnder the Coin Collection programme, the HKMA collaborates with the Hong Kong Council of Social Service to deploy the Coin Carts to collect coins on flag days for non-governmental organisations.\n\n# Accessibility of public information\n\nThe revamped HKMA official website was launched in September. The revamped website has enhanced navigation structure to facilitate easy and convenient search by users based on their own preferences. In particular, the website contains a dedicated webpage “Information in Other Languages” under the “Smart Consumers” section, which provides useful information on banking services in seven languages commonly used by the ethnic minority community, namely Bahasa Indonesia, Hindi, Nepali, Punjabi, Tagalog, Thai and Urdu.\n\nThe HKMA is committed to ensuring that its website conforms to the maximum extent possible to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 Level AA standard, to facilitate barrier-free access to its online information by people with special needs.\n\n# volunteer and charitable activities\n\nThe HKMA supports community services by taking part in volunteer and charitable activities. The Senior Citizen Home Safety Association awarded the Community Engagement Crystal Award to the HKMA for participating in the 2018 Love & Peace of Mind Corporate Engagement Programme.\n\nCharitable events participated in by the HKMA Volunteer Team in 2019\n\n“Yo! Let’s Walk the Road” by the Youth Outreach.\n\nArtists and representatives from the social enterprise, Arts with the Disabled Association Hong Kong, visit the HKMA office, where its artworks are displayed.\n\nHKMA staff members take part actively in Blood Donation Day, Territory-Wide Flag Day, Community Chest’s Green Day, Love Teeth Day, Skip Lunch Day, Dress Casual Day and regular campaigns that collect clothes, toys and other reusable items for donation to charities.\n\nHKMA staff members take part actively in Blood Donation Day, organised by the Hong Kong Red Cross.\n\n# Caring organisation\n\nIn recognition of its commitment to care for the community, the HKMA was accredited with the “10 Years Plus Caring Organisation Logo” by the Hong Kong Council of Social Service for the 13th consecutive year.\n\n# ENVIRONMENT\n\n# Green office measures\n\nThe HKMA has an established environmental policy to protect and preserve the environment. The policy and implementation measures are promulgated among its staff regularly. Green office measures include:\n\n# Paper\/Photocopying\/Printing\n\n- Encouraging the use of recycled paper and envelopes;\nDistributing electronic copies instead of hard copies of documents;\n- printing on both sides of the paper;\n- Using colour printing and copying only when necessary;\n- Avoiding the use of paper cups; and \n- Using environmentally friendly paper and ink for the HKMA’s Annual Report.\n\n# Electricity\n\n- Switching off PCs, printers, lights, audio-visual systems and other electrical appliances when these devices are not in use. Reactivating the preset power-saving mode installed in most equipment, such as water dispensers, electric punching machines and shredders, after use outside their preset operating hours; and \n- Reviewing regularly the need for additional air-conditioning beyond normal business hours.\n\n# Recycling\n\n- Making good use of recycled bins to collect different categories of waste, including paper, cans, bottles, batteries, CDs and ink cartridges.\n\n# WORKPLACE\n\n# Diversity and inclusion\n\n# Equal Opportunities Policy\n\nThe HKMA is an equal opportunities employer. It believes that everyone should be able to work in an environment free of discrimination, harassment, vilification and victimisation. The equal opportunities policy applies to job advertisements, recruitment, terms and conditions of employment, performance assessment, promotion, transfer, training, dismissal, grievance procedures and general conduct.\n\n# Key statistics on diversity\n\npeople are central to the work of the HKMA. We value the diversity of our workforce, which has a balanced gender representation and a spectrum of different age groups.\n\nFemale representation at the senior management levels, that is, Executive Director and above, made up 31% as of February 2020.\n\n# Human capital key statistics on 1 January 2020\n\n# Quality workplace\n\nTo cater for projected operational needs, the HKMA renovated the offices during the year to create an open layout, increase capacity and allow for more efficient use of space. Breakout areas and ergonomic furniture are part of the new office design. To enhance the staff’s physical health, height-adjustable desks were offered to staff members, allowing them to change their postures easily throughout the day between sitting and standing.\n\nHeight-adjustable desks improve office ergonomics.\n\n# Staff well-being\n\nThe HKMA promotes work-life balance and cares about the health and work safety of the staff. Regular talks on healthy lifestyles, stress management and workplace safety are organised and indoor air quality is monitored. Annual on-site medical check-ups and flu vaccinations are arranged. The HKMA also sponsors a professional counselling service comprising experienced psychologists and social workers.\n\nThroughout the year, different activities are organised to enhance the staff’s physical wellness, promote their sense of belonging, and foster co-operation and team spirit. Interest classes are held for staff members and their families. Inter-organisational and cross-divisional activities such as basketball and football competitions with fellow regulators provide opportunities to

企業社會責任\n\n香港金融管理局致力履行其企業社會責任，並力求成為負責任且可持續發展的組織。這項承諾體現在各項範疇，包括推動可持續及環保的市場、支持更廣泛的社區、保護環境及培育友善的工作環境。\n\n# 市場\n\n# 綠色與永續的銀行業\n\n氣候變化是影響人類福祉和全球經濟永續發展的重大風險之一。銀行運作的金融部門，作為社會的重要部分，亦將受到影響，因此應更積極地管理氣候風險。香港金管局致力於探討應對此挑戰的方法。在此背景下，香港金管局於5月公布了一數目措施，以推動香港綠色金融的發展，包括採用三個階段的方法來推動綠色和永續銀行業。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n作為交易所基金的投資管理人，香港金融管理局認為，負責任投資（RI）的概念與其投資工作高度相關。由於香港金融管理局是全球最大的資產所有者之一，因此其對基金經理選擇資產的方式將產生重大影響。\n\n# 我們的理念\n\n香港金管局視RI為一種投資方法，該方法考慮各項環境、社會及管治（環境、社會及管治）因素對長線投資回報及其可持續性的影響。香港金管局認為，強調適當的RI及可持續長線經濟表現，可以更好取得交換基金的投資目標，並減少與其基礎投資相關的環境、社會及管治相關事宜所帶來的風險。\n\n# 我們的原則\n\n香港金融管理局的指導原則是，鑒於長線風險調整後的回報與其他投資相若，一般會優先考慮環境、社會及管治投資。適當情況下，香港金融管理局在其投資過程中採用以下原則，這些原則體現了其作為負責任長線投資者的理念。\n\n# 整合\n\n香港金融管理局將環境、社會及管治因素納入其投資分析程序中，以物色風險及機遇，因其秉持理念認為這些因素可對其投資的長線價值產生重大影響。具體而言，香港金融管理局已將環境、社會及管治因素納入其投資程序，用於公眾及私人市場投資。對於公眾市場投資，香港金融管理局將環境、社會及管治因素納入其債券投資的債務風險分析中。分享香港金融管理局理念的外部管理人會被物色及委任。香港金融管理局會向所有外部管理人傳達其理念，並預期他們以配合的方式，使整體可持續長線經濟表現目標得以實現。對於私人市場投資，香港金融管理局會將其一般合伙人環境、社會及管治政策及實踐作為其調查程序的一部分進行檢視。\n\n# 主動所有權\n\n金管局以一種方式行使於其公共股權持有中的股東權利，以幫助保障其投資的長線價值。金管局相信，以環境、社會及管治因素作指引的負責任的企業行為將有助於長期創造股東價值。金管局的資產經理預期將幫助金管局在相關投資中履行其所有權責任，透過行使投票權及與企業關切，採納積極的股東參與方式。\n\n# 合作\n\n香港金融管理局致力與理念相近的投資者和監管機構攜手，推動投資的長線良好管理。它參與並在公開活動上發言，分享觀點，鼓勵投資界採用責任投資。\n\n請參考儲備資產管理章節，以了解香港金管局在年內就風險投資所進行的工作的細則。\n\n# 推動金融普惠\n\n香港金融管理局非常重視金融普及，並已付出重大努力，以推動社會不同群體獲得基本的銀行服務，以滿足大眾的每日基本需要以及合法企業的營運需要。特別是，香港金融管理局一直與銀行業緊密工作於以下優先考慮的範疇：\n\n鼓勵銀行推出更多體格銀行設施，並制定數碼及創新渠道，以提供基本銀行服務，服務一般公眾，特別是偏遠範疇及公共房屋居民和長者；\n\n促進及監測銀行賬戶對個人和中小企的可及性；\n\n提升銀行服務對具體客戶群體的可及性，例如，殘障客戶和少數民族客戶；\n\n促進並監控中小企獲得銀行信貸的可及性；以及\n\n授予8間虛擬銀行許可證，這些銀行在提供銀行服務時將積極推動金融包容性。\n\n# 社區\n\n# 推動金融知識普及\n\n香港金融管理局透過各項渠道推動財務素養。除了運作教育計劃，推動公眾明智及負責任地運用銀行及金融服務外，香港金融管理局在其重組後的官方網站上設有專頁「精明消費者」，讓公眾可發現涵蓋廣泛的銀行及相關產品和服務的有用資訊和精明提示。此外，亦透過Facebook、LinkedIn、YouTube、Instagram及Twitter等媒體平台，以及香港金融管理局官方網站和研究報告，提供最新的銀行及金融事務資訊。\n\n香港金融管理局資訊中心自2003年起，作為香港金融管理局的重大公眾教育及研究資源，向社區介紹香港金融管理局的工作，並推動公眾對貨幣及銀行事務的認識。資訊中心每日為來自學校及非營利機構的團體訪問學者提供導賞服務。此外，亦為學生舉辦公眾教育研討會及其他活動，以提升他們的財務知識及素養。同時，香港金融管理局亦與投資者及財務教育委員會緊密合作，透過其財務教育平台「陳家駿財經教育基金」推動香港的財務素養。\n\n看到公司功能章節以取得更多關於香港金融管理局於本年期間推動財務素養工作的細則。看到銀行穩定章節以取得更多關於香港金融管理局於本年期間推動財務包容工作的細則。\n\n# 應對特殊群體需要\n\n# 香港紙幣的可及性\n\n2018年紙幣系列保留了前一系列紙幣中用以幫助視障人士區分面額的可及性特點。這些可及性特點包括點字、觸覺線條和高觸覺數字。\n\n為幫助視障人士分辨紙幣的面額，一款由香港按揭證券有限公司贊助、香港盲人社會開發的行動應用程式，會利用手機的相機掃描紙幣圖案以辨識面額。該應用程式可從蘋果應用商店和谷歌應用商店免費下載。另外，由香港按揭證券有限公司及三間發行紙幣銀行贊助的紙幣測量模板亦已推出，用以測量紙幣的長度。該模板可測量2018系列紙幣及現時流通的紙幣。模板一面為點字，另一面為符號。該模板會免費分發予服務視障人士的志願機構。\n\n# 硬幣收藏計劃\n\n在香港硬幣收集計劃下，香港金融管理局與香港社會服務聯會合作，採取硬幣推車在節日當天為非政府組織收集硬幣。\n\n# 公共資訊的可及性\n\n香港金管局推出的全新官方網站於9月正式推出。全新網站加強了導航結構，以促進用戶根據個人喜好進行方便、容易的搜尋。特別是，該網站於「智慧消費者」版塊下設有「其他語言資訊」專頁，提供七種少數族裔社群普遍運用之語言的銀行服務有用資訊，包括印尼語、印地語、尼泊爾語、旁遮普語、塔加拉語、泰語及烏爾都語。\n\n香港金融管理局致力於確保其網站盡最大可能符合萬維網聯盟（W3C）網頁內容可存取性指南（WCAG）2.0第AA級標準，以促進有特殊需要的市民無障礙地接觸其網上資訊。\n\n# 志願服務及慈善活動\n\n香港金融管理局透過擔任義工及慈善活動的**部分**，支持社區服務。**高級**公民家居安全**團體**向香港金融管理局**頒發**社區參與水晶獎，以表彰其參與2018年**愛**心與安心企業參與計劃。\n\n二零一九年香港醫療輔助隊團隊參與的慈善活動\n\n「喂！與年青人同行」由青年外展部主辦。\n\n藝術家及來自社會企業香港殘疾人士藝術團體的代表參觀香港金融管理局辦公室，其藝術作品於此展示。\n\n金管局員工選持倉盤積極參與捐血日、全港地區旗日、社區胸口基金綠色日、愛牙日、午餐跳過日、著裝休閒日以及定期宣傳活動，收集衣物、玩具和其他可重用項目捐贈給慈善團體。\n\n香港金融管理局會員積極選持倉盤參與香港紅十字會舉辦的獻血日活動。\n\n#友善組織\n\n為表彰其致力關懷社區的承諾，香港金融管理局（HKMA）連續第13年獲香港社會服務聯會頒發「10年加友善機構標誌」。\n\n#環境\n\n# 綠色辦公措施\n\n香港金融管理局已設立環境政策，以保護及保本環境。該政策及落實措施定期向其員工當中公布。綠色辦公室措施包括：\n\n# 紙張\/影印\/列印\n\n- 鼓勵使用再生紙張及信封；\n- 以電子副本取代文件的實體副本；\n- 在紙張兩面印製；\n- 僅在必要時使用彩色印製及複印；\n- 避免使用紙杯；以及\n- 以環保紙張及油墨印製香港金融管理局年報。\n\n# 耗電量\n\n-

{"en":"# The Exchange Fund\n\n- Report of the Director of Audit\n- Exchange Fund Financial Statements\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 187 to 293, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2019, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2019, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards. My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report. I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2019. These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.5, 2.6 and 38.1 to the financial statements.\n\nAs at 31 December 2019, the Group had financial assets totalling HK$3,874,223 million and financial liabilities totalling HK$1,158,686 million valued at fair value.\n\nFor 91% of these financial assets and all these financial liabilities, their fair values were quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 inputs) or were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data (Level 2 inputs).\n\nFor the remaining 9% of these financial assets, their fair values were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data (Level 3 inputs). Such financial assets totalled HK$338,758 million, including mainly unlisted investment funds.\n\nGiven the substantial amount and the estimations involved, valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value was a key audit matter.\n\nThe audit procedures on valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value included:\n\n- obtaining an understanding of the procedures, including relevant controls, for valuing different categories of financial assets and financial liabilities;\n\n- evaluating and testing the controls, including relevant application controls of the computer systems;\n\n- obtaining external confirmations on the valuation, existence, rights and obligations and completeness of the financial assets and financial liabilities;\n\n- where quoted market prices were used, verifying the prices to independent sources;\n\n- where valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions, and verifying the inputs to independent sources; and\n\n- where valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Valuation of investment properties at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.11, 18 and 19 to the financial statements.\n\nThe Group’s investment properties were stated at their fair values, totalling HK$22,481 million as at 31 December 2019. The Group also had interests in twenty two joint ventures totalling HK$44,506 million, whose principal activities were holding overseas investment properties. The fair values of these investment properties, whether held by the Group directly or by joint ventures, were mainly determined based on valuations by independent professional valuers. Such valuations involved significant judgments and estimates, including the valuation methodologies and the assumptions used.\n\nThe audit procedures on valuation of investment properties at fair value included:\n\n- obtaining and reviewing the valuation reports of investment properties held by the Group directly or by joint ventures, and verifying that the fair values were based on the valuations stated in the valuation reports;\n\n- assessing the independence and qualifications of the valuers; and\n\n- evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises all the information included in the 2019 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICpA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. I also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nJohn Chu\nDirector of

觀點\n\n我證明我已審核了外匯基金及其附屬公司（「本集團」）於第187至293頁所列的財務報表，其中包括外匯基金及本集團於2019年12月31日的資產負債表，以及截至該年止的收益及支出帳戶、綜合收益表、權益變動表和現金流量表，並附有財務報表附註，包括重大會計政策的概要。\n\n依我之見，截至2019年12月31日，基金及集團的財務狀況，以及該年度的財務表現和現金流量，均在財務報表中真實而公正地反映，且根據香港會計師公會（「HKICPA」）頒佈的香港財務報告準則（「HKFRSs」）編製，並根據《儲備基金條例》（第66章）第7條所頒佈的行政長官指令正確編製。\n\n# 意見的依據\n\n我根據《發鈔兌換基金條例》第7條所頒佈的行政長官批示及審計委員會的審計準則進行了審計。根據這些準則，我的責任已在我的報告中「審計財務報表的會計師責任」部分進一步說明。我根據這些準則保持獨立性，並已根據這些準則履行了我的其他道德責任。我相信我所取得的審計證據足夠且適當，足以作為我意見的基礎。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審核事項是指，在我專業判斷下，於截至2019年12月31日止**年**度，我對財務報表審核中最重要的事項。這些事項是在我對財務報表**整體**審核的**背景**下討論的，並且在形成我的意見時考慮到，我不會就這些事項**提供**單獨的意見。\n\n# 按公允價值評估金融資產及金融負債\n\n請參閱財務報表中的附註2.5、2.6及38.1。\n\n於2019年12月31日，本集團的金融資產總額為3,874,223百萬港元，金融負債總額為1,158,686百萬港元，並按公允價值估值。\n\n對於這些金融資產的 91% 及所有金融負債，其公允價值為活躍市場中相同資產或負債的報價（第一層輸入值），或利用估值技術，根據可觀察市場數據估算（第二層輸入值）。\n\n對於這些財務資產餘下的9%，其公允價值是利用估值技術估算的，而這些技術所使用的輸入數據並非基於可觀察的市場數據（第三層輸入數據）。此類財務資產總計為338,758百萬港元，主要包括未上市投資基金。\n\n鑒於涉及的數量龐大且估計繁複，以公允價值評估金融資產及金融負債乃為關鍵審核事項。\n\n關於金融資產及金融負債公允價值評估的審計程序包括以下內容：\n\n取得對評價不同類別金融資產及金融負債所涉及程序（包括相關控制）的了解；\n\n評估及測試控制措施，包括電腦系統相關的應用控制措施；\n\n取得有關金融資產及金融負債之估值、存在性、權利與義務及完整性之外部確認。\n\n在引用市場價格的情況下，應運用獨立來源核對價格；\n\n在運用以可觀察市場數據為根據的估值技術時，評估估值方法的適合性及假設的合理性，並驗證輸入數據的獨立來源；以及\n\n在運用未根據可觀察市場數據的估值技術時，評估估值方法的適合性以及假設和輸入資料的合理性。\n\n# 投資性不動產以公允價值計價\n\n請參閱財務報表中的附註 2.11、18 和 19。\n\n集團的投資物業按其公允價值列示，截至2019年12月31日總值為HK$22,481百萬。集團亦持有涉及二十兩合資企業，總值為HK$44,506百萬，其主要業務為持有海外投資物業。這些投資物業的公允價值，無論是由集團直接持有或由合資企業持有，主要根據獨立專業估值師的估值確定。有關估值涉及重大判斷及估計，包括所採用的估值方法及所運用的假設。\n\n對按公允價值計量的投資性不動產估值的審計程序包括：\n\n取得並審閱由集團直接或透過合營企業舉辦的投資物業的估值報告，並驗證公允價值是否根據估值報告中列示的估值進行計算；\n\n評估估價師的獨立性及資格；以及\n\n評估估值方法的適合性及假設與輸入資料的合理性。\n\n# 其他資訊\n\n貨幣當局負責其他資訊。其他資訊包括香港貨幣當局二零一九年年度報告中所載的所有資訊，但不包括財務報表及我的審計師對該等財務報表的報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見並不涵蓋其他資訊，我亦不會就該等資訊表達任何形式的保證結果。\n\n與我審計財務報表有關，我的責任是閱讀其他資訊，並在此過程中顧及其他資訊是否與財務報表或我在審計中取得的知識存在重大不符，或以其他方式顯著錯誤陳述。根據我所表現的工作，如果我認為此其他資訊存在重大錯誤陳述，我規定要報告該事實。在這方面，我沒有任何事項需要報告。\n\n# 當局及外匯基金諮詢委員會審計小組委員會的財務報表責任\n\n貨幣當局負責根據香港會計師公會發佈的香港財務報告準則及行政長官根據《儲備基金條例》第7日作出的指令，準備真實和公允的期望財務報表，並建立貨幣當局認為必要的內部控制，以使財務報表免受重大錯誤陳述的影響，無論是因訛騙或錯誤所致。\n\n在編製財務報表時，貨幣當局負責評估本集團繼續作為展望未來的能力，並根據適用情況披露與展望未來相關的事項，以及利用展望未來為基礎的會計準則。\n\n發行基金顧問委員會的審計小組負責監察集團’的財務報告程序。\n\n# 會計師對財務報表審計的責任\n\n我的目標是取得合理保證，以確認財務報表整體而言是否不存在重大不正確陳述，無論是由於訛騙或錯誤所致，並發行一份包括我意見的審計報告。合理保證是高水準的保證，但並非保證根據審計委員會審計準則進行的審計，一直可發現存在的重大不正確陳述。不正確陳述可來自訛騙或錯誤，如果單獨或整體而言，它們可合理預期會影響用戶根據這些財務報表所採納的經濟決定，則被考慮為重大。\n\n作為根據審計委員會審計標準進行的審計的一部分，我在整個審計過程中行動專業判斷並維持專業懷疑態度。我亦：\n\n物色並評估財務報表重大錯報的風險，無論是因為訛騙還是錯誤，設計並執行回應這些風險的審計程序，並取得足夠且適當的審計證據，以作為我意見的基礎。未能檢測到由訛騙導致的重大錯報的風險，比由錯誤導致的風險更高，因為訛騙可能涉及串通、偽造、故意省略、誤導性陳述或繞過內部控制；\n\n取得與審計相關的內部控制之了解，以便設計適當的審計程序，但並非用於對集團內部控制之成效發表意見；\n\n評估當局所運用的會計政策的適合性及所作出的會計估計及其相關披露的合理性；\n\n就當局採用持續經營基礎進行會計的適當性作出結論，並根據取得的審計證據，判斷是否存在與可能對集團持續經營能力造成重大懷疑的事件或情況相關的重大不確定性。如果我結論認為存在重大不確定性，我規定需要在我的審計報告中關注財務報表中相關的披露，如果這些披露不充分，則需修改我的意見。我的結論是根據截至我審計報告日期所取得的審計證據作出的。然而，未來的事件或情況可能造成集團無法繼續持續經營。\n\n評估財務報表的整體呈報、結構及內容，包括披露內容，以及財務報表是否以錄得公平呈報的方式反映底層交易及事項；並取得足夠適當的審計證據，有關集團內實體或業務活動的財務資訊，以對財務報表發表意見。我負責集團審計的指揮、監督及執行。我維持對我的審計意見負有唯一責任。\n\n我聯繫交易所基金顧問委員會的審計小組委員會，有關當中包括審計的預計範圍及時間安排，以及重大審計發現，包括我在審計過程中物色到的任何重大內部控制缺陷。\n\n我亦向財政儲備基金諮詢委員會審計小組提供一份報告，說明我已遵守有關獨立性的相關道德要求，並與他們聯繫所有可能影響我獨立性的關係及其他事項，以及在適用情況下，採取相關保障措施。\n\n根據與發行基金顧問委員會審計小組溝通的事項，我決定哪些事項在審計現行期間財務報表時最具重要性，因此為關鍵審計事項。我會在審計師報告中說明這些事項，除非法律或監管不允許公開披露有關事項，或在極為罕見的情況下，我決定不應在報告中說明某事項，因為這樣做的不利後果將合理預期會超過此類溝通所帶來的公共利益福利。\n\n朱約翰\n審計總監\n\n審計委員會\n26樓\n移民大樓\n7日

{"en":"# Highlights of 2015\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nEconomic growth in Hong Kong moderates, reflecting weaker domestic demand and subdued export performance. Local stock market sees large swings amid heightened volatility in global financial markets. The residential property market starts to soften after the announcement of the seventh round of prudential measures in February.\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector remains resilient. Locally incorporated authorized institutions (AIs) are well capitalised, and the liquidity positions of AIs continue to be sound. The asset quality of retail banks deteriorates slightly, but stays at healthy levels.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchang rate remains broadly stable against the US dollar, with the strong-side Convertibility Undertaking triggered repeatedly in April, September and October. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate market continues to operate in an orderly manner despite turbulent global financial market conditions, reflecting resilience of the Linked Exchange Rate System to external shocks.\n\nThe money market continues to function normally with ample interbank liquidity. Following the decision of the US Federal Reserve to raise the target range for the Federal Funds Rate, the Base Rate in Hong Kong is adjusted upwards by 25 basis points to 0.75% in December.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nSupervisory efforts on AIs’ risk governance, including credit and liquidity risk management systems, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing controls, and selling practices for investment and insurance products, have been stepped up.\n\nThe HKMA announces a countercyclical capital buffer for Hong Kong and designates five authorized institutions as domestic systemically important banks. Legislative proposals to establish a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong and enhance the Deposit Protection Scheme by achieving faster payouts are respectively introduced into the Legislative Council.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\nThe HKMA continues to actively participate in international and regional forums while sparing no effort in raising Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre. Legislative proposal to improve the tax environment for promoting Hong Kong as a hub for corporate treasury centres is introduced into the Legislative Council in December.\n\nHong Kong remains the global offshore renminbi business hub with a market of considerable depth and breadth. The Mainland-Hong Kong Mutual Recognition of Funds initiative is implemented in July, further expanding Hong Kong’s renminbi product offering.\n\nHong Kong’s financial infrastructure is further enhanced by the successful launch of the e-Cheque service in December, allowing customers to issue and deposit cheques online. A new regulatory regime which provides for licensing of multipurpose stored value facilities and designation of important retail payment systems commences operation in November.\n\n# Reserves Management\nAmid the challenging and difficult investment environment, the Exchange Fund records an overall investment return of -0.6%. Total assets of the Fund reach HK$3,422.9 billion at the end of 2015.\n\nthe HKMA quickens the pace of investment diversification, especially through investments under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). At the end of 2015, the market value of investments under the LTGP totals HK$142.1 billion, made up of HK$91.3 billion in private equity and HK$50.8 billion in real estate, with outstanding investment commitments amounting to HK$122.4 billion.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communications with the community and the market through the media, public education programmes, and various other channels to facilitate understanding of its policies and operations. Corporate governance is further improved by supporting professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline, enhancing it security, and realigning duties among senior management to help cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives and the increasing complexity of work.","terms":{"\"too big to fail\" problem":["大至不能倒問題"],"10 years plus

{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nThe Hong Kong economy experienced slower growth in 2015 reflecting weaker domestic demand and poor export performance. Economic growth for 2016 is expected to remain soft amid stiff external headwinds and fragile financial market conditions.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Overview\n\nEconomic growth in Hong Kong moderated during the year, with real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth slowing to 2.4% from 2.6% in 2014 (Table 1). This reflected milder expansion in domestic demand, although net exports reverted to a positive contributor to GDP growth as total imports declined faster than total exports (Chart 1). Despite the modest economic performance, the labour market held broadly stable, with the unemployment rate staying low at about 3.3%. Inflation eased further due to subsiding pressures on domestic costs and import prices. Local stock prices saw large swings amid heightened volatility in global financial markets. The residential property market started to soften after the announcement of the seventh round of prudential measures in February, with housing prices showing further signs of consolidation towards the end of the year.\n\nChart 1 Real GDP growth by contribution\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\nTable 1 Real GDP growth by expenditure component (period-over-period)\n\nNote: The seasonally-adjusted quarter-on-quarter rates of change in the gross domestic fixed capital formation are not available.\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nOn the monetary front, exchange-rate stability was maintained in 2015, with the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate hovering near 7.75 against the US dollar. The strong-side Convertibility Undertaking was triggered in April due to equity-related inflows, and again in September and October reflecting conversions of the offshore renminbi into Hong Kong dollars and some commercial demand for Hong Kong dollars. With the enlarged Aggregate Balance, local interest rates continued to stay low, while the HKMA Base Rate was adjusted upwards from 0.5% to 0.75% following the US interest rate lift-off in mid-December. Because of softer credit demand, total loan growth in the banking sector slowed further to 3.5% in 2015 from 12.7% in 2014. The banking industry's overall loan quality weakened slightly, but the classified loan ratios remained at low levels.\n\n# Domestic demand\n\nDomestic demand grew at a slower pace in 2015. While broadly stable job and income conditions continued to provide support, weak consumer confidence and corrections in asset prices weighed on private consumption growth in the second half of the year. However, due to the relatively strong growth momentum in the first half, the full-year growth in private consumption increased to 4.8% from 3.3% in 2014. Government consumption increased slightly faster by 3.4%. In fact, the slower growth in domestic demand was mainly due to the 2.2% decline in gross domestic fixed capital formation (Chart 2). Private-sector machinery and equipment acquisition contracted for the second consecutive year amid deteriorating business sentiment, and building and construction activities also showed weaker growth momentum alongside slower progress in public projects.\n\n# External demand\n\nHong Kong’s export performance deteriorated in 2015 (Chart 3). Exports of goods recorded a broad-based 1.7% decline, the first time since 2009. Exports to Japan and the European Union declined, while those to the US recorded little growth. The feeble final demand from these advanced markets also weighed on regional industrial activities and intra-regional trade. As a result, Hong Kong’s exports to Mainland China, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan also decreased amid weak intermediate and final demand from these economies. Hong Kong’s exports of services continued to moderate from a high growth path in earlier years, which culminated in a 0.6% decline in 2015, mainly due to the slowdown in inbound tourism. Imports of goods also fell back alongside weaker domestic and export-induced demand. In contrast, growth in imports of services accelerated due to strong travel interest among local residents. On a net basis, the overall trade surplus improved slightly in 2015, leading to a modest positive contribution to GDP growth.\n\nChart 2 Domestic demand\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Inflation\n\nUnderlying inflation eased further in 2015 amid moderated domestic cost pressures and reduced import price inflation. After netting out the effects of the Government's one-off relief measures, the underlying inflation rate dropped to 2.5% from 3.5% in 2014 (Chart 4). With subdued economic activity, labour cost pressures remained steady, while commercial and industrial rental cost pressures eased, particularly in the second half. Thanks to softened global commodity prices and the strong Hong Kong dollar, import price pressures abated, while food inflation also stayed low. As the feed-through of fresh-letting housing rentals in earlier quarters had been moderate, the rental component of inflation remained contained.\n\nChart 3 Exports of goods and services\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\nChart 4 Underlying consumer price inflation\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\n# Labour market\n\nLabour market conditions remained stable in 2015. Labour demand held up, with the decline in employment in trade and tourism-related sectors being largely offset by the steady pace of hiring in other business sectors, resulting in an increase in total employment of 1.3% from a year earlier. With labour supply also picking up by 1.3%, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate stayed at around 3.3% throughout the year (Chart 5). Given the still-tight labour market, labour earnings in nominal terms rose by 4.7% in the first three quarters of the year, compared with 4.3% in 2014. With inflationary pressures easing, real labour earnings increased by 1.3% in the first three quarters, compared with a decline of 0.1% in 2014.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe Hong Kong stock market experienced a volatile year due to drastic changes in the external environment. After a flat first quarter, the local stock market was buoyant in the second quarter amid the bullish sentiment in the Mainland A-share market and capital inflows. The Hang Seng Index surged to a seven-year high in April, with the Southbound Daily Quota under the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect being exhausted for the first time since its inception in November 2014 (Chart 6). However, the local market reversed course starting from late June, with the Hang Seng Index plunging 28% to a year-low in September amid the sell-offs in the Mainland A-share market and global stock markets, the heightened volatility in the global foreign exchange market, and weaknesses in international commodity prices. The Hong Kong stock market recovered some ground in the last quarter as global and Mainland financial markets stabilised. For 2015 as a whole, the Hang Seng index recorded a decline of 7.2%, the worst performance since 2011, while the average daily turnover rose to HK$105.6 billion from HK$69.5 billion in 2014. Although fund-raising activities moderated in the second half, the overall equity funds raised from the local stock market increased to HK$1,115.6 billion from HK$942.7 billion a year earlier.\n\n# Property market\n\nSigns of consolidation emerged in the residential property market. After experiencing a buoyant period in early 2015, the residential property market softened following the announcement of the seventh round of prudential measures in February. With housing prices picking up at a slower pace before declining in the last quarter, the cumulative increase in housing prices in 2015 was 2.5%, smaller than the 13.5% increase in 2014 (Chart 6). Meanwhile, the transaction volume decreased by 12.3% from a year ago to 55,982 units as trading activities in the secondary market fell noticeably in the second half. Speculative transactions, including confirmor transactions and short-term flipping trades, continued to stay low. Despite this, household affordability remained stretched, with the price-to-income ratio reaching 15.7 and the income-gearing ratio remaining far above its long-term average. The commercial and industrial property markets were buoyant in the first half, but trading activities then softened, with both prices and rents registering declines in the last quarter. Rental yields remained broadly the same from a year earlier and stayed near their historical lows.\n\nChart 6 Asset prices\nSources: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nHong Kong’s economic growth for 2016 is expected to remain soft. Private-sector analysts project the economy to expand at a slower average rate of 1.7% while the Government forecasts growth in the range of 1–2%. More specifically, the lacklustre global growth prospects, sustained weakness in inbound tourism, and the negative spillovers from turbulent global financial market conditions will continue to restrain the performance of Hong Kong’s exports. Domestically, private consumption is anticipated to grow moderately, as labour market conditions will likely face some pressures amid weaker economic momentum, and local asset price adjustments may dent consumer confidence and induce negative wealth effects. Building and construction activities may hold up, but weak business sentiment and interest rate rises will weigh on private capital investment.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nInflationary pressures are expected to remain contained in 2016. Import price pressures will likely stay soft, while domestic cost pressures are expected to be modest amid moderate economic growth momentum. The rental component of inflation may also ease due to diminishing pressures in fresh-letting housing rentals towards the end of 2015. Market consensus predicts the headline inflation rate at 2.5% in 2016, while the Government projects the underlying inflation rate at 2.0%. The labour market may also soften somewhat due to the slowdown in inbound tourism and continued sluggishness in the export sector. Private-sector analysts now expect the unemployment rate to increase to 3.5% in 2016.\n\n# Uncertainties and risks\n\nThe economic outlook for 2016 is subject to a number of uncertainties and risks. In particular, the pace of further US interest rate rises, the global growth prospects and commodity price movements will continue to be the major sources of uncertainty. Any significant adverse developments could heighten volatilities in global financial markets and international capital flows, thereby tightening domestic monetary and financial conditions and casting a shadow over Hong Kong's growth prospects. The resulting impact of these external factors on the domestic economy will depend crucially on their impact on the property market through the wealth and balance-sheet effects. While the property market is facing increasing downside risks stemming from weakening sentiment in the global and domestic financial markets, the normalisation of US interest rates, and a narrowing housing demand-supply gap, more time is needed to establish whether the property market has entered a down-cycle. Although an abrupt adjustment in the property market could pose significant headwinds to the broader economy, the introduction of counter-cyclical macroprudential measures and other supervisory measures over the past few years has significantly enhanced the resilience of Hong Kong's banking system.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector remained resilient during the year, notwithstanding a further divergence in the monetary policies of advanced economies and the build-up of vulnerabilities in emerging market economies. The liquidity positions of authorized institutions (AIs) continued to be sound, and locally incorporated AIs were well capitalised. The asset quality of retail banks deteriorated slightly, but stayed at a healthy level.\n\n# Interest rate trends\n\nIn line with the US dollar interest rates, Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates were low throughout the year. The Hong Kong dollar funding cost of retail banks declined in the first half of the year as indicated by a downward trend in the composite interest rate, and remained stable in the second half (Chart 7).\n\nChart 7 HIBOR fixings, composite rate and best lending rate (BLR)\nNotes:\n1. HiBoR fixings refer to the Hong Kong Dollar interest Settlement Rates released by the Hong Kong Association of Banks and are monthly averages.\n\n2. BlR refers to the best lending rate quoted by the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (monthly averages).\n\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe profitability of the banking sector moderated in 2015. The aggregate pre-tax operating profits of retail banks' Hong Kong offices declined by 2.8%, as growth in fee and commission income (up 9.7%), foreign exchange and derivatives operation income (up 22.4%), and net interest income (up 1.3%) was offset by an 8.8% increase in operating expenses and a 76% increase in loan impairment charges. However, the post-tax profit of retail banks increased by 14.7%, mainly due to gains from disposals of strategic investments. The post-tax return on average assets of retail banks improved to 1.05% from 0.99% in 2014 (Chart 8).\n","terms":{"\"too big to fail\" problem":["大至不能倒問題"],"10 years plus Caring organisation

概述\n\n香港經濟在本年度增長放緩，實際本地生產總值（本地生產總值）增長由2014年的2.6%降至2.4%（表1）。這反映出本地需求擴張步伐放緩，但淨出口對本地生產總值增長的貢獻轉為正值，因總進口額下降速度較總出口額更快（圖1）。儘管經濟表現相對溫和，勞工市場仍大致穩定，失業率維持在約3.3%的低位。通脹進一步緩和，因本地成本及進口價格的壓力減退。本地股市在環球金融市場波動加劇的背景下出現大幅波動。在二月第七輪審慎監管措施公佈後，住宅物業市場開始放緩，住宅價格在年底進一步顯示出盤整跡象。\n\n圖表 1 實質本地生產總值增長貢獻分析\n資料來源：政府統計處\n\n表 1 支出構成的實際 本地生產總值 增長（按期對期）\n\n注意：本地固定資本形成總額的經季節因素調整的按季增減幅度資料不可用。\n來源：政府統計處。\n\n#經濟及金融環境\n\n在貨幣方面，2015年維持了匯率穩定，港元兌美元匯率徘徊在7.75附近。由於股本相關資金流入，四月份觸發了強邊的兌換保證，九月和十月再次觸發，反映了離岸人民幣兌換成港元以及部分商業對港元的需求。隨著總結餘的增加，本地利率繼續保持在低位，而美國加息後，金管局基本利率於十二月中旬從0.5%調整至0.75%。由於信貸需求疲軟，銀行體系貸款總額增長進一步放緩至2015年的3.5%，較2014年的12.7%有所下降。銀行業的整體貸款質素略有下降，但特定分類貸款比率仍然處於低水平。\n\n# 本地需求\n\n本地需求在二零一五年增長步伐放緩。雖然大致穩定的就業和收入狀況持續提供支持，但疲弱的消費者信心以及資產價格的調整，對下半年私人消費的增長造成拖累。然而，由於上半年相對強勁的增長勢頭，全年的私人消費增長率從二零一四年的3.3% 增加至4.8%。政府消費則增長稍快，為3.4%。事實上，本地需求增長放緩主要由於本地固定資本形成總額下降2.2%（圖表2）。在營商氣氛惡化的情況下，私營部門的機械和設備採購連續第二年萎縮，而樓宇及建造活動的增長勢頭也隨著公共工程項目的進展放緩而減弱。\n\n# 外部需求\n\n香港的出口表現於2015年惡化（圖3）。貨品出口出現廣泛下跌，跌幅為1.7%，為自2009年以來首次出現跌幅。出口至日本及歐盟的貨品均有所下降，而出口至美國則僅有微幅增長。這些先進市場疲弱的最終需求亦對區域工業活動及區內貿易造成壓力。因此，香港對內地、新加坡、南韓及台灣的出口亦因這些經濟體較弱的中間及最終需求而有所下降。香港的服務輸出持續從過去幾年的高速增長路徑放緩，導致2015年出現0.6%的跌幅，主要由於訪港旅遊業放緩。貨品進口亦因較弱的國內及出口引致需求而回落。相對而言，服務輸入的增長加快，這是因本地居民旅遊意欲強勁所致。總體而言，2015年香港的貿易順差略有改善，對本地生產總值增長作出溫和的正面貢獻。\n\n圖表2 本地需求  \n來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 物價上漲\n\n在2015年，由於國內成本壓力減緩以及進口物價通脹下降，基本通脹率進一步下降。扣除政府一次性紓緩措施的影響後，基本通脹率由2014年的3.5%降至2.5%（圖4）。在經濟活動趨緩的情況下，勞工成本壓力保持穩定，而商業及工業租金成本壓力則有所緩和，尤其是在下半年。由於全球商品價格下跌以及港元強勢，進口物價壓力減輕，同時食品通脹也保持在低水平。由於早前季度新租住宅租金對通脹的傳導作用相對溫和，因此通脹的租金組成項目仍處於受控狀態。\n\n圖3

勞工市場\n\n勞工市場情況在2015年保持穩定。勞動需求維持穩定，貿易及旅遊相關行業的就業減少被其他行業穩定的招聘速度所抵消，導致總就業人數較去年同期增加1.3%。勞工供應也增加1.3%，季節性調整後的失業率全年維持在約3.3%（圖5）。由於勞工市場依然緊俏，全年前三個季度的名義工資上漲4.7%，高於2014年的4.3%。通脹壓力緩和後，前三個季度的實質工資上漲1.3%，與2014年的下降0.1%形成對比。\n\n# 股市\n\n香港股市因外部環境劇變而經歷波動的一年。經過首季持平後，受內地A股市場樂觀情緒及資金流入推動，本港股市於第二季表現強勁。4月恒生指數升至七年高位，滬港通下的港股通每日額度自2014年11月啟動以來首次用完（圖6）。然而，自今年6月下旬起，本地市場轉趨下跌，恒生指數在9月下跌28%，創下一年低位，當時內地A股市場及全球股市出現拋售潮，全球外匯市場波動加劇，國際商品價格亦表現疲弱。隨著全球及內地金融市場穩定，香港股市於第四季有所回復。整體而言，2015年恒生指數下跌7.2%，為自2011年以來最差表現，而每日平均成交額則由2014年的695億港元增至1056億港元。雖然下半年集資活動放緩，但來自本地股市的集資總額仍由去年同期的9427億港元增至11156億港元。\n\n# 物業市場\n\n住宅物業市場出現了整固跡象。在2015年初經歷了一段活躍期後，住宅物業市場在二月第七輪審慎監管措施公布後有所放緩。2015年住宅價格在上漲速度放緩後於第四季開始下跌，全年累計上漲2.5%，低於2014年的13.5%（圖6）。同時，交易量較去年同期下降12.3%，達到55,982個單位，因第二半段次級市場交易活動明顯減少。包括確認人交易和短期轉售交易在內的炒賣活動持續保持低水平。儘管如此，置業負擔能力仍然緊張，樓價與收入比率達到15.7，而收入槓桿比率仍遠高於其長期平均水準。工商物業市場在上半年表現活躍，但隨後交易活動放緩，價格和租金在第四季均出現下跌。租金收益率與去年同期大致相同，並維持在歷史低位附近。\n\n圖表

經濟環境\n\n香港2016年的經濟增長預期將維持偏緩。私營機構分析員預測經濟將以較慢的平均增長率1.7%擴張，而政府則預測增長幅度在1%至2%之間。具體而言，全球增長前景不明朗、訪港旅遊業持續疲弱，以及動盪的全球金融市場帶來的負面影響，將繼續制約香港出口的表現。在本地方面，私人消費預期將溫和增長，因勞工市場狀況可能面臨壓力，且本地資產價格調整或將削弱消費者信心，進而引發負面財富效應。樓宇及建造活動或能保持穩定，但營商氣氛低迷和利率上升將對私人資本投資造成拖累。\n\n#通貨膨脹與勞工市場\n\n預期通脹壓力在二零一六年將會受到控制。進口價格壓力可能維持溫和，而本地成本壓力預期在溫和的經濟增長勢頭下保持適度。由於二零一五年底住宅租金的壓力減退，通脹的租金組成項目亦可能有所緩解。市場普遍預測二零一六年的整體通脹率為百分之二點五，而政府預測基本通脹率為百分之二點零。訪港旅遊業放緩和出口行業持續低迷，或會導致勞工市場略為轉弱。私營機構分析員現時預期二零一六年的失業率將上升至百分之三點五。\n\n# 不確定因素與風險\n\n2016年的經濟前景面臨多項不確定因素和風險。特別是美國利率進一步上調的節奏、全球增長前景以及商品價格波動，將繼續是主要的不確定來源。任何重大不利發展都可能加劇環球金融市場和國際資金流動的波動性，進而導致本地貨幣和金融環境趨緊，並對香港的增長前景投下陰影。這些外部因素對本地經濟的影響，將取決於它們通過財富效應和資產負債表效應對物業市場的影響。雖然物業市場正面臨來自全球及本地金融市場情緒轉弱、美國利率正常化以及住房供需缺口收窄等因素所帶來的下行風險，但目前尚需更多時間來判斷物業市場是否已進入下行週期。儘管物業市場的突然調整可能對整體經濟帶來重大阻力，但近年來引入的逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施及其他監管措施，已顯著增強了香港銀行體系的韌性。\n\n# 銀行體系的表現\n\n香港銀行體系在年內保持穩健，儘管先進經濟體的貨幣政策進一步分化，且新興市場經濟體出現的脆弱性不斷增加。認可機構的流動性狀況持續保持良好，本地註冊認可機構的資本充足。零售銀行的資產質素略有下降，但仍維持在良好水平。\n\n# 利率趨勢\n\n與美元利率同步，港元銀行同業拆息全年在低位徘徊。 零售銀行港元資金成本上半年隨著綜合利率向下趨勢而下降，下半年則保持穩定（圖表7）。\n\n圖表7 香港銀行同業拆息、綜合利率及最佳貸款利率（BLR）  \n註釋：  \n1. 香港銀行同業拆息（HiBoR）係由香港銀行公會發佈的港幣利率結算率，為每月平均數。\n\nBlR 指香港上海銀行有限公司所報的最優惠貸款利率（月平均值）。\n\n\n# 盈利趨勢\n\n銀行體系的盈利能力於2015年有所放緩。零售銀行在香港的總體除稅前經營溢利下降2.8%，儘管費用及佣金收入（增長9.7%）、外匯及衍生工具業務收入（增長22.4%）以及淨利息收入（增長1.3%）有所增長，但經營開支增加8.8%及貸款減值準備增加76%抵消了這些增長。然而，零售銀行的除稅後溢利上升14.7%，主要由於出售策略性投資所帶來的收益。零售銀行的除稅後平均資產回報率由2014年的0.99%提升至1.05%（圖表8）。\n"}
{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained broadly stable throughout 2015 despite turbulent financial market conditions and the US interest rate lift-off in December. The money market also continued to function normally with ample interbank liquidity. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability over the past few decades, the Linked Exchange Rate System continued to be hiqhly resilient to external shocks.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong's monetary policy is currency stability. This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong's currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75 - 7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises\n\n* Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks\n* Government-issued notes and coins in circulation \n* the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of clearing account balances of banks kept with the HKMA \n* Exchange Fund Bills and Notes issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs). When the demand for Hong Kong dollars is greater than the supply and the market exchange rate strengthens to the strong-side CU of HK$7.75 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to sell Hong Kong dollars to banks for US dollars. The Aggregate Balance will then expand to push down Hong Kong dollar interest rates, creating monetary conditions that move the Hong Kong dollar away from the strong-side limit to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if the supply of Hong Kong dollars is greater than demand and the market exchange rate weakens to the weak-side CU of HK$7.85 to one US dollar, the HKMA will buy Hong Kong dollars from banks. The Aggregate Balance will then contract to drive Hong Kong dollar interest rates up, pushing the Hong Kong dollar away from the weak-side limit to stay within the Convertibility Zone.\n\nThe Certificates of Indebtedness and the government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation shown here are stated at Hong Kong dollar face values. The corresponding items shown in the balance sheet of the Exchange Fund in this Annual Report are in Hong Kong dollars equivalent to the US dollar amounts required for their redemption at the prevailing exchange rates on the balance sheet date. This arrangement is in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong.\n\nThe amount of EFBN shown here is different from that in the balance sheet of the Exchange Fund in this Annual Report. In accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong, the EFBN held by the HKMA on behalf of the Exchange Fund in relation to its trading of the EFBN in the secondary market are offset against the EFBN issued, and the net amount is recorded in the balance sheet.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\n# REVIEW OF 2015\n\n# Exchange-rate stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained broadly stable in 2015, trading within a narrow range of 7.7500 to 7.7657 against the US dollar (Chart 1). In the early part of 2015, the Hong Kong dollar was under slight weakening pressures amid market concerns about the US interest rate lift-off. However, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate strengthened close to 7.75 during the second quarter, with the strong-side CU being triggered repeatedly in April mainly due to a surge in equity-related demand for the Hong Kong dollar amid buoyant stock market activities. Moving into the second half of the year, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate continued to hover close to 7.75 against the US dollar in August, despite the notable sell-off in Hong Kong and Mainland’s equity markets, and increased volatilities in the global currency markets (including the renminbi). Driven by conversions of the offshore renminbi into the Hong Kong dollar, the strong-side CU was triggered again in September and October. While the US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) raised the target range for the Federal Funds Rate by 25 basis points in mid-December, the Hong Kong dollar continued to move within a tight range against the US dollar without notable outflow pressures. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market operated in an orderly manner throughout 2015, despite the turbulent global financial market conditions.\n\nChart 1 Market exchange rate in 2015\n\nAs the strong-side CU was repeatedly triggered in April, September and October, the HKMA passively purchased a total of US$29.3 billion from banks in exchange for HK$227.2 billion, in accordance with the Currency Board principles. This led to a corresponding expansion in the Aggregate Balance, with part of the expansion being offset by additional issuance of Exchange Fund Bills in response to banks’ strong demand for liquidity management (Chart 2). The additional issuance of Exchange Fund paper is consistent with Currency Board principles, as it represents a change in the composition of the Monetary Base with the Monetary Base fully backed by foreign exchange reserves. The total of Aggregate Balance and outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and notes increased to HK$1,221.0 billion at the end of 2015 from HK$992.5 billion a year earlier.\n\nChart 2 Aggregate Balance and outstanding Exchange Fund paper in 2015\n\n# Money market\n\nWith ample liquidity in the banking system, Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained low throughout 2015. As the target range for the US Federal Funds Rate was adjusted upwards from 0–0.25% to 0.25–0.5% on 16 December (US time), the Base Rate was also adjusted upwards from 0.5% to 0.75% on 17 December according to the pre-set formula. For 2015 as a whole, interbank interest rates for tenors from overnight to three months stayed below the Base Rate (Chart 3), with moderate fluctuations driven by banks’ seasonal liquidity needs and tightened liquidity amid volatile financial market conditions in August. Broadly tracking the spreads between the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) and the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), the Hong Kong dollar forward points turned to notable premiums in August amid tightened market liquidity, and then subsequently dipped into discounts towards the end of the year due to the broad-based increases in the US dollar interest rates (Chart 4). Overall, the money market continued to function normally. Discount Window borrowing was not active, amounting to only HK$2.8 billion in 2015.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nChart 3 Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates in 2015\n\nChart 4 Hong Kong dollar forward points in 2015\n\n# Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nSince its establishment in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has continued to function smoothly and contributed significantly to Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability over the past few decades. Given Hong Kong's small and open economy and its role as an international financial hub, the LERS remains the most suitable exchange rate regime for Hong Kong. The Hong Kong SAR Government is firmly committed to maintaining the LERS. Indeed, stability in the foreign exchange and money markets further reinforces the credibility of the Government's commitment, and the public continues to have strong confidence in the Hong Kong dollar as a means of payment and storage of value. In its 2015 Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) continued to endorse the LERS as the best monetary arrangement for Hong Kong, citing Hong Kong's robust institutional, legal and policy framework, ample fiscal reserves, flexible markets, and sound financial system as key factors supporting the smooth functioning of the LERS.\n\nGiven that a robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS, the HKMA continued to closely monitor banks' management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and stepped up its supervisory efforts on banks' corporate and property-related lending to enhance the resilience of the banking sector. In view of the rise in US interest rates, the HKMA reminded the public to make necessary preparations in managing risks, noting that any triggering of the weak-side CU and outflow of Hong Kong dollars are a natural and necessary step in the process of the normalisation of the Hong Kong dollar interest rates.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) moved within a narrow range of 106.3-107.5% during 2015, without touching the Upper or Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 106.3% on 31 December (Chart 5). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. The large amount of financial resources of the Fund provides a powerful backstop to protect Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability in the event of abrupt shocks.\n\nChart 5 Daily movement of the Backing Ratio in 2015\n\n# Other activities\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) Currency Board Sub-Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong. In 2015, the Sub-Committee considered issues including the supply of international US dollar loans by global banks, the international use of macro-prudential measures, the implications of US interest rate hikes for Hong Kong's property market, the formula for the determination of the Base Rate, macroeconomic implications of the Hong Kong dollar real effective exchange rate rise, and the sovereign risk of emerging market economies. Records of the Sub-Committee’s discussions and the reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the Sub-Committee are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research (HKIMR) continued to sponsor research in the fields of monetary policy, banking and finance. In 2015, the Institute hosted 16 research fellows and published 27 working papers.\n\nThe Institute organised five international conferences and workshops. The main ones included:\n\n* The Sixth Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy in January, under the title \"Leverage and Financial System Efficiency and Stability: Chinese and International Experiences\". 11 high quality research papers were presented at the conference, covering an extensive range of issues such as corporate leverage in China, China's credit boom and business cycle, banking competition and financial stability, as well as banking regulation and credit supply.\n* The HKIMR and the University of Hong Kong joint conference entitled \"HKIMR-HKU International Conference on Finance, Institutions and Economic Growth\" in May. The conference covered many different economic issues, including banking and monetary policy, international financing and cross border mergers and acquisitions, design of financial regulation, as well as macroeconomic environment and capital markets.\n* The HKIMR, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas joint conference in October on \"Diverging Monetary Policies, Global Capital Flows and Financial Stability\". The conference examined a wide range of issues including the relationship between monetary policies, international capital flows and exchange rates, divergent monetary policies and their implications for global financial stability, spillover of major central bank policies to other parts of the world, and the costs and benefits of global policy co-ordination.\n\nThe Institute also hosted its 13th HKIMR Summer Workshop in August, and the 13th HKIMR Conference on the Mainland Economy in September, addressing issues on fiscal reform and local government financing in Mainland China. The conferences and workshops were attended by participants from academia, the financial services industry and global central banks. In addition, the Institute held 24 public seminars during the year covering a broad range of economic, monetary and financial issues.\n\n# Notes and coins\n\nAt the end of 2015, the total value of banknotes in circulation was HK$360.2 billion, an increase of 5.3% from a year earlier (Charts 6, 7 and 8). The total value of government-issued notes and coins in circulation amounted to HK$11.2 billion, up 2.9% (Charts 9 and 10). The value of government-issued HK$10 notes in circulation was HK$4.0 billion, of which 85% were polymer notes.\n","terms":{"\"too big to fail\" problem":["大至不能倒問題"],"10 years plus Caring organisation

貨幣穩定\n\n港元兌美元匯率在2015年全年大致保持穩定，儘管當時的貨幣市場波動劇烈，且在12月出現了美國加息。 銀行同業流動資金也持續充沛，貨幣市場運作正常。 作為過去幾十年香港金融穩定和主管貨幣事務副總裁的基石，聯繫匯率制度持續展現出高度的抗外部衝擊能力。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的首要目標是匯價穩定。這被定義為香港貨幣在對美元的外匯市場匯率維持在港幣7.75至7.85兌1美元的範圍內。貨幣體系的結構特徵是貨幣發行局制度，要求貨幣基礎至少由外匯基金持有的美元儲備100%支持，並要求貨幣基礎的變動與美元儲備的相應變動完全對應。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括\n\n* 負債證明書，為三家發鈔銀行發行的紙幣提供充分擔保  \n* 政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣  \n* 總結餘，即銀行存放於金管局的清算賬戶餘額總和  \n* 金管局代表政府發行的外匯基金票據及債券\n\n港元兌美元匯率的穩定是由自動利率調整機制以及金管局堅定履行兌換保證（CUs）的承諾所維持。當對港元的需求大於供應，市場匯率升至強方兌換保證 HK$7.75 至 1 美元時，金管局會準備向銀行出售港元以換取美元。總結餘將隨之擴張，壓低港元利率，創造貨幣狀況使港元匯率移回 7.75 至 7.85 的兌換範圍。相反，如果港元的供應大於需求，市場匯率跌至弱方兌換保證 HK$7.85 至 1 美元時，金管局會從銀行購入港元。總結餘將隨之收縮，推高港元利率，使港元匯率回落至兌換範圍內。\n\n此處所示的負債證明書和政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣均以港元面值列示。本年報中外匯基金的資產負債表所示相應項目，以等值於其贖回時在資產負債表日適用匯率下之美元金額的港元計算。此安排符合香港公認的會計準則。\n\n本處所示的外匯基金票據及債券金額與本年度報告內外匯基金的資產負債表所列金額有所不同。 根據香港公認的會計準則，金管局代表外匯基金於二級市場買賣外匯基金票據及債券所持有的外匯基金票據及債券，會與已發行的外匯基金票據及債券互相抵銷，而淨額則於資產負債表內記錄。\n\n# 貨幣穩定\n\n# 2015年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n港元兌美元匯率在2015年大致保持穩定，交易區間在7.7500至7.7657之間（圖表1）。2015年初，由於市場對美國加息的擔憂，港元受到輕微的貶值壓力。然而，在第二季度，由於股市活動暢旺，對港元的股票相關需求激增，導致港元匯率升至接近7.75，強方兌換保證在四月份被多次觸發。進入下半年，儘管香港及內地股市大幅拋售，全球貨幣市場（包括人民幣）波動加劇，但港元兌美元匯率在八月份仍持續徘徊在7.75附近。受到離岸人民幣兌換成港元的推動，強方兌換保證在九月和十月再次被觸發。儘管美國聯邦公開市場委員會（FOMC）在十二月中旬將聯邦基金利率目標區間上調了25基點，但港元兌美元匯率仍保持在窄幅區間內波動，沒有明顯的資金外流壓力。總體而言，儘管全球金融市場動盪，但2015年香港港元外匯市場運作井然有序。\n\n圖表 1 2015年市場匯率\n\n由於四月、九月及十月多次觸及強方兌換保證，金管局根據聯繫匯率制度，被動地從銀行手中購入總計293億美元，並交換了2272億港元。這導致總結餘相應增加，部分增加被因應銀行強勁的流動性管理需求而額外發行外匯基金票據所抵銷（圖表2）。額外發行外匯基金票據符合聯繫匯率制度原則，因為這代表貨幣基礎的組成部分發生變化，而貨幣基礎完全由外匯儲備支持。於2015年底，總結餘與未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額增加至12210億港元，較一年前的9925億港元為高。\n\n圖表 2 2015年的總結餘及未償還外匯基金票據及債券\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n在銀行體系流動性充足的情況下，2015年香港銀行同業拆息 (銀行同業拆息) 利率持續維持低位。隨著美國聯邦基金利率的目標範圍 (美國聯邦基金利率的目標範圍) 由12月16日（美國時間）的0–0.25%上調至0.25–0.5%，根據預設公式，基本利率 (基本利率) 亦於12月17日由0.5%上調至0.75%。2015年全年，從隔夜到三個月期的銀行同業拆息利率均低於基本利率（圖表3），並受到銀行季節性資金需求及8月份金融市場波動導致的市場流動性緊縮的影響，出現適度波動。香港銀行同業拆息 (香港銀行同業拆息) 與倫敦銀行同業拆息 (倫敦銀行同業拆息) 之間的利差大致同步變動，港元遠期匯率點子 (遠期匯率點子) 在8月份因市場流動性緊縮而轉為顯著升水，隨後在年末因美元利率普遍上漲而轉為貼水（圖表4）。總體而言，貨幣市場 (貨幣市場) 運作暢通。貼現窗 (貼現窗) 借款活動不踴躍，2015年僅錄得28億港元。\n\n# 貨幣穩定\n\n圖表3 2015年港元銀行同業拆息\n\n圖4 2015年港幣遠期匯率點子\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n自1983年成立以來，聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）一直運作順暢，並在過去數十年間對香港的貨幣及金融穩定作出重大貢獻。鑒於香港小型開放經濟體的特質及其作為國際金融中心的角色，聯繫匯率制度仍然是香港最合適的匯率制度。香港特區政府堅定致力於維持聯繫匯率制度。事實上，外匯市場和貨幣市場的穩定進一步強化了政府承諾的可信度，公眾對港元作為支付手段和價值儲藏工具的信心依然強烈。在2015年與香港的第四條磋商討論中，國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）繼續支持聯繫匯率制度為香港最佳的貨幣安排，並指出香港穩健的制度、法律及政策框架、充足的財政儲備、靈活的市場以及健全的金融體系，是聯繫匯率制度順利運作的關鍵因素。\n\n鑒於穩健的銀行體系對聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）的正常運作至關重要，金管局繼續密切監察銀行管理信用、流動性及利率風險和壓力測試結果的情況，並加強對銀行企業及物業相關貸款的監管力度，以提升銀行體系的韌性。 考慮到美國利率上升，金管局提醒公眾做好風險管理的必要準備，並指出任何觸發弱方兌換保證及港元資金外流，是港元利率正常化過程中的自然且必要步驟。\n\n為提高貨幣發行局帳目的透明度，自一九九八年十月起，已將特定部分外匯基金資產配置為支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（定義為支持資產除以貨幣基礎）在2015年期間在106.3-107.5%的窄幅範圍內波動，未觸及上限或下限。該比率於12月31日收報106.3%（圖5）。在聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）下，雖然已指定特定外匯基金資產為支持組合，但所有外匯基金資產均可支持港元兌美元匯率。該基金龐大的財政資源為保護香港的貨幣和金融穩定提供強有力的後盾，以應對突發衝擊。\n\n圖表5 2015年支持比率每日波動\n\n# 其他活動\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）貨幣發行委員會負責監測和審視與香港貨幣及金融穩定相關的問題。2015年，該委員會考慮的議題包括全球銀行提供的國際美元貸款供應情況、國際上宏觀審慎監管措施的應用、美國加息對香港物業市場的影響、基本利率計算公式、香港美元實質有效匯率上升的宏觀經濟影響，以及新興市場經濟體的主權信貸違約風險。貨幣發行委員會的討論記錄及提交給該委員會的貨幣發行局運作報告，均會在金管局網站上發佈。\n\n# 貨幣穩定\n\n香港金融研究中心繼續資助貨幣政策、銀行業及金融範疇的研究。二零一五年，該中心邀請了十六名學者，並發表了二十七篇工作論文。\n\n該機構舉辦了五場國際會議和研討會。其中主要的包括：\n\n第6屆中國經濟年度國際研討會於一月舉行，主題為「財務槓桿與金融體系效率及穩定：中國及國際經驗」。研討會發表了11篇高質量的研究論文，內容涵蓋企業財務槓桿、中國信貸增長與經濟周期、銀行業競爭情況與金融穩定，以及銀行業監管與信貸供應等議題。\n五月由香港金融研究中心與香港大學合辦「研究中心與香港大學金融、機構及經濟增長聯合研討會」。研討會探討了銀行業與貨幣政策、國際金融與跨境併購、金融規例的設計，以及宏觀經濟環境與資本市場等多項經濟議題。\n十月香港金融研究中心、聯邦儲備局、歐洲中央銀行及達拉斯聯邦儲備銀行共同舉辦題為「路向分歧的貨幣政策、環球資金流向及金融穩定」的研討會。會上探討了貨幣政策與國際資金流動及匯率的關係、路向分歧的貨幣政策及其對全球金融穩定的影響、主要央行政策對世界各地的溢出效應，以及全球貨幣政策協調的成本與效益。\n\n該中心亦於八月舉辦了第十三屆香港金融研究中心年度夏季研討會，並於九月舉辦了第十三屆香港金融研究中心中國內地經濟研討會，探討了中國內地財政改革和地方政府融資等議題。 這些研討會吸引了來自學術界、金融服務界及全球中央銀行的工作人員參與。 此外，該中心在年內還舉辦了二十四場公開小型研討會，涵蓋了廣泛的經濟、主管貨幣事務副總裁及金融議題。\n\n# 紙幣及硬幣\n\n截至2015年底，流通中的紙幣總值為3602億港元，較一年前增長5.3％（圖表6、7和8）。流通中的政府發行紙幣及硬幣總值為112億港元，較前一年上升2.9％（圖表9和10）。流通中的政府發行10元紙幣總值為40億港元，其中85％為塑質鈔票。\n"}

With the build-up of systemic risks, the HKMA announced a 0.625% jurisdictional Countercyclical Capital Buffer for Hong Kong from 1 January 2016 (and 1.25% from 1 January 2017). Five authorized institutions were designated as Domestic Systemically Important Banks which will be subject to a Higher Loss Absorbency capital buffer. Significant progress was made on reforms for recovery and resolution with the introduction of the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Bill into the Legislative Council. The HKMA also stepped up its work with the banking industry on enhancing access to basic banking services, consumer education, and the skills and knowledge development of bank directors and financial practitioners.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2015\n\n# Overview\n\nAmid signs of a divergence in monetary policy stances among the major developed economies, emerging markets faced a higher risk of capital outflows and slower economic growth in 2015. In order to maintain the resilience of the banking sector against a possible abrupt deterioration in the macroeconomic environment, the HKMA continued to closely monitor the effectiveness of authorized institutions’ (AIs) risk governance and their systems for management of credit and liquidity risks.\n\n# Operational supervision\n\nIn 2015, the HKMA continued to adopt the supervisory approach where regular on-site examinations were supplemented by an increased number of thematic reviews. Thematic reviews are in-depth off-site reviews focusing on particular risk areas or specific activities of groups of selected AIs. This approach has allowed the HKMA to prioritise its supervisory resources to focus on emerging and more significant risks of AIs.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA performed a total of 193 on-site examinations. More in-depth thematic on-site examinations on credit risk management and asset quality were conducted, in view of the emerging signs of deterioration in the asset quality of AIs' loan portfolio. The HKMA increased the number of examinations on treasury related activities given market uncertainty amid the divergence of monetary policies in major advanced economies. On-site examinations were also conducted on Mainland-related business, stress testing and liquidity risk management, operational and technology risk management, capital planning, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML\/CFT) controls and internal ratings-based (IRB) models of AIs. AIs' activities in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses were also subject to on-site examinations by specialist teams during the year.\n\nFurthermore, a total of 152 thematic off-site reviews were conducted covering similar areas as the thematic on-site examinations. Table 1 contains details of the operational supervision work.\n\nIn 2015, 196 off-site reviews were conducted to assess AIs’ corporate governance, financial position and business operations. Supervisory attention focused on risk governance, capital planning, corporate sector credit and monitoring of implementation of Basel III standards. The supervisory teams maintained frequent contact with the boards of directors and external auditors of selected AIs. 20 tripartite meetings were held with the senior management and external auditors of AIs, while 23 meetings were held with the full board or board-level committees of selected AIs.\n\nThe Banking Supervision Review Committee considered four cases, all concerning the authorization of AIs.\n\nTo better utilise its supervisory resources to deal with competing priorities, the HKMA continued to invoke powers under section 59(2) of the Banking Ordinance to require AIs to appoint external auditors to follow up on potentially material supervisory issues. The HKMA commissioned six reports under this provision in 2015. Two of the reports covered AML\/CFT controls and another two of the reports covered private banking business, while the remaining were related to areas including securities related activities and loans classification system.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nNo AI breached the requirements of the Banking Ordinance relating to capital adequacy or liquidity ratio in 2015. There were 84 breaches under various sections of the Ordinance, but none affected the interests of depositors and they were rectified promptly by the AIs.\n\nTable 1 Operational supervision\n\n# Powers under section 52 of the Banking Ordinance\n\nMelli Bank Plc continues to be subject to the exercise of powers under section 52 of the Banking Ordinance. The directions imposed by the Monetary Authority on 25 June 2008 under section 52(1)(A) of the Banking Ordinance on the affairs, business and property of the Hong Kong Branch of Melli Bank Plc remained in force during the year. The HKMA will continue to communicate regularly with the relevant authorities to monitor developments related to the branch and its head office in the UK, and will keep in view the supervisory measures taken to protect the interests of the AI’s depositors.\n\n# CAMEL rating review\n\nThe CAMEL Approval Committee reviewed and determined the composite CAMEL ratings of AIs. The AIs were notified of the ratings and given the opportunity to request a review. There was no request for a review during the year.\n\n# Specialised supervisory work\n\n# Supervision of operational and technology risks\n\nThe HKMA continued to issue new or updated guidance on operational and technology risk management in the light of emerging risks and industry developments. In particular, the HKMA completed the revision of the Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module in relation to electronic banking (e-banking), which allows AIs more flexibility in offering new e-banking services. In addition, a circular was issued on cyber security, reiterating the importance for the boards and senior management of AIs to have oversight of effective cyber security risk management. The HKMA also published periodic issues of its “Operational Incidents Watch” highlighting the modus operandi of selected fraud cases or operational incidents and the control weaknesses identified.\n\nThe HKMA conducted risk-based thematic on-site and off-site supervisory reviews to evaluate selected AIs' operational and technology risk management at the enterprise level or in specific business lines. These covered selected areas in relation to AIs' operational risk management framework, cyber security risk management, controls for guarding against rogue trading activities, oversight of important outsourcing service providers, fraud risk management and technology controls for anti-money laundering. These supervisory reviews were supplemented by the annual independent compliance exercises covering operational risk management framework, technology risk management (including protection of customer data) and business continuity planning, where selected AIs were required to appoint independent and qualified assessors to examine the adequacy of their relevant controls and then rectify the weaknesses identified. The HKMA also identified and analysed the trend and key supervisory focus of AIs' operational and technology risks, with particular reference to the AIs that play an important role in the stability and effective functioning of Hong Kong's monetary and banking systems.\n\nThe HKMA monitored the final phase of the banking industry's implementation of the chip-based ATM technology through which AIs completed the card replacement process of pure credit cards by the end of 2015. The HKMA also required card issuing AIs to implement authentication controls to further improve the security over \"card-not-present\" credit card transactions. Separately, after receiving reports that the names of cardholders stored in some contactless credit cards could be accessed stealthily, the HKMA required the AIs concerned to take prompt action to notify and protect the affected cardholders. The HKMA devoted resources to publicise and explain the scale and implications of the incident to address public concern and to monitor AIs' remedial efforts, including the prompt replacement of affected cards.\n\nThe HKMA collaborated with the industry and other stakeholders on a number of initiatives, including public awareness programme on e-banking security precautions, establishing a platform for sharing cyber security intelligence, and providing support and advice to a crisis management exercise organised by the Hong Kong Financial Services Business Continuity Management Forum that involved AIs and other financial firms.\n\n# Supervision of wealth management and MPF-related businesses\n\nThe HKMA co-operated closely with other financial regulators in Hong Kong in providing guidance and supervising AIs’ selling of securities, investment products, insurance products and MPF schemes. Regular contact was maintained with the regulators through bilateral and multilateral meetings, as well as under the auspices of the Council of Financial Regulators. These meetings covered various issues involving financial groups or regulated entities with close business relationships across different sectors in the financial services industry to ensure more co-ordinated and effective supervisory action.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA conducted 25 on-site and offsite thematic examinations and 15 off-site surveillance of AIs. These covered the selling of investment products, handling the settlement of securities transactions and safe custody of client securities, and the selling of non-linked long term insurance (NLTI) products and MPF-related products involving retail, private banking and corporate banking customers.\n\nIn August, the HKMA issued a circular to AIs to provide guidance on suitability assessment and product information disclosure in the selling of NLTI products to customers. The guidance aimed to assist AIs in complying with regulatory standards, including relevant requirements issued in July by the Office of the Commissioner of Insurance and the Hong Kong Federation of Insurers.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA continued to work closely with the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB) in the legislative process for the Insurance Companies (Amendment) Bill 2014, to establish an independent Insurance Authority and a statutory licensing regime for insurance intermediaries. In July, the Insurance Companies (Amendment) ordinance 2015 was enacted by the Legislative Council, which provides, among other things, for the inspection and investigation powers, in respect of AIs’ insurance intermediary activities, of the Monetary Authority through delegation.\n\nThe HKMA processed six applications to become Registered Institutions (RIs) and one application from RIs to engage in additional regulated activities. It granted consent to 204 executive officers responsible for supervising the securities activities of RIs, and conducted background checks on 9,697 individuals whose information was submitted by RIs for inclusion in the register maintained by the HKMA.\n\n# Supervision of treasury activities\n\nAIs’ liquidity risk management remained one of the HKMA’s priority supervisory focuses, particularly in light of the anticipated normalisation of interest rates in the US and the potential subsequent reversal of fund flows that could have an impact on AIs’ liquidity positions. Throughout 2015, the HKMA continued to implement the enhanced Stable Funding Requirement for AIs to maintain sufficient stable funds to support their lending business. Since the implementation of the Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) from 1 January 2015, the HKMA has been monitoring the level and trend of LCRs of category 1 institutions, which generally maintained LCRs close to or over 100%, well above the statutory minimum of 60% for 2015 under the phase-in arrangement.\n\nSeparately, the HKMA conducted thematic on-site examinations on selected AIs’ control framework for managing the risks associated with the anticipated interest rate normalisation. Amid the market volatility, the HKMA also paid close attention to abrupt market changes and their impact on the banking sector as well as individual AIs, and undertook appropriate follow-up action.\n\n# Supervisor-driven stress testing programme\n\nThe HKMA continued to conduct the bottom-up supervisor-driven stress testing programme to better understand the resilience of locally incorporated retail banks under extreme and adverse economic conditions, and to encourage them to develop plans to address potential problems in times of stress. A number of improvements were introduced during the year to collect more granular information to gain a greater insight into the risk dynamics of selected areas. The HKMA analysed the results submitted by the participating AIs and discussed with them how their stress-testing processes could be further improved.\n\n# Credit risk management and asset quality\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nThe strong credit growth trend observed in previous years has subsided since the second half of 2015. For the year as a whole, the banking sector’s total lending increased by 3.5%, compared with 12.7% in 2014 (table 2). As customer deposits grew faster than bank lending, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio decreased to 70.1% at the end of 2015 from 72.2% a year ago.","terms":{"\"too big to fail\"

2015年回顧\n\n# 概述\n\n鑑於主要發達經濟體在貨幣政策立場上出現分歧的跡象，新興市場在2015年面臨資本外流風險增加及經濟增長放緩的挑戰。為維持銀行體系抵禦宏觀經濟環境可能突然惡化的能力，金管局繼續密切監察認可機構的風險管治及其信貸和流動風險管理系統的成效。\n\n# 監管工作\n\n二零一五年，金管局繼續採用監理方式，即定期進行現場審查，並輔以增加數量的專題評估。專題評估是對選定的認可機構在特定風險領域或具體活動進行深入的非現場審查。這種方式讓金管局能夠優先調配監理資源，專注於認可機構新興及更重要的風險。\n\n金管局全年共進行了193次現場審查。並針對信貸風險管理及資產質素進行了更多深入的專題現場審查，因應認可機構貸款組合資產質素出現惡化跡象。鑑於主要先進經濟體貨幣政策分歧所引致的市場不確定性，金管局增加了對財資相關業務的審查次數。亦對中國內地相關業務、壓力測試及流動性風險管理、業務操作及科技風險管理、資本規劃、打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集活動管控措施，以及認可機構的內部評級基準(IRB)模式進行了現場審查。全年亦有專門團隊對認可機構在證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（強積金）相關業務方面的活動進行了現場審查。\n\n此外，總共進行了152項非現場審查，涵蓋範圍與專題現場審查相似。第一表載有監管工作之細節。\n\n2015年，共進行了196次非現場審查，以評估認可機構的公司治理、財務狀況及業務運作。監管重點放在風險管治、資本規劃、企業部門信貸及監察巴塞爾三號標準的落實情況。監管團隊與部分認可機構的董事局及外聘核數師保持頻繁聯繫。與認可機構的高級管理層及外聘核數師舉行了20次三方聯席會議，並與部分認可機構的董事局或董事會層級委員會舉行了23次會議。\n\n銀行業監管檢討委員會審視了四宗案件，全部涉及認可機構的授權事宜。\n\n為更有效地運用監管資源以應對各項優先事項，金管局繼續援引《銀行業條例》第59(2)條的權力，要求認可機構委任外聘核數師跟進潛在重大監管問題。金管局於2015年根據此條款委託了六份報告，其中兩份報告涵蓋打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集活動的管控措施，另外兩份報告涉及私人銀行業務，其餘則與證券相關活動及貸款分類制度等領域有關。\n\n#銀行體系的穩定\n\n2015年，沒有任何認可機構違反與資本充足比率或流動性比率有關的銀行業條例規定。雖然在該條例的多個條文中出現了共84宗違規情況，但這些情況均未影響存款人利益，並已由認可機構迅速糾正。\n\n表 1 監管工作\n\n# 銀行業條例第五十二條賦予的權力\n\nMelli Bank Plc 繼續受到《銀行條例》第52條賦予權力的執行。金融管理專員於2008年6月25日根據《銀行條例》第52(1)(A)條對 Melli Bank Plc 香港分行事務、業務及財產所發出的指示，在年內仍然有效。金管局將會繼續定期與相關當局溝通，以監察與該分行及其英國總部相關的發展情況，並會留意為保障存款人的利益而採取的監管措施。\n\n# CAMEL評級 審查\n\nCAMEL核准委員會審查並確定認可機構的綜合CAMEL評級。認可機構已知悉該評級，並獲有請求複核的機會。本年度內無任何機構提出複核請求。\n\n# 專業監督工作\n\n# 營運及科技風險的監控\n\n金管局持續就業務操作及科技風險管理發出新或更新的指引，以應對新興風險及行業發展。特別是，金管局已完成有關電子銀行的監管政策手冊模塊修訂，使認可機構在提供新電子銀行服務方面擁有更大靈活性。此外，金管局發出有關網絡保安的通函，重申認可機構董事會及管理層對有效網絡保安風險管理進行監督的重要性。金管局亦定期發佈「操作事故通訊」，重點介紹所選詐騙案件或操作事故的手法，以及所發現的控制弱點。\n\n金管局進行以風險為基礎的主題性現場及非現場監察，評估所選認可機構的業務操作及科技風險管理，涵蓋企業層面或特定業務範疇。 這些監察重點包括認可機構的業務運作風險管理框架、網絡保安風險管理、管控措施以防止違規交易、對重要外判服務供應商的監督、詐騙風險管理，以及打擊洗錢的科技管控。 此外，金管局亦會透過年度獨立合規評估，覆蓋業務運作風險管理框架、科技風險管理（包括客戶資料保護）及業務持續運作規劃，要求所選認可機構委聘獨立且具資歷的評估員，審查其相關管控措施的充分性，並糾正所發現的不足之處。 金管局同時識別及分析認可機構業務操作及科技風險的趨勢，尤其關注在維持香港銀行業及貨幣體系穩定和有效運作方面發揮重要作用的認可機構。\n\n金管局監督銀行業實施晶片式自動櫃員機技術的最後階段，認可機構於2015年底完成純信用卡的換卡程序。金管局亦要求發卡認可機構實施身份驗證管控措施，以進一步提升無卡支付信用卡交易的安全性。另方面，在接獲報告指部分非接觸式信用卡內儲存的卡戶姓名可能被暗中存取後，金管局要求相關認可機構迅速通知及保護受影響的卡戶。金管局投入資源向公眾宣傳及解釋事件的規模及影響，以處理公眾疑慮，並監督認可機構的補救工作，包括迅速更換受影響的卡片。\n\n金管局與業界及其他持份者合作推行多項措施，包括舉辦提高公眾對電子銀行保安預防措施認識的宣傳計劃、建立網絡保安情報共享平台，以及為由香港金融服務界業務持續管理協會主辦、涉及認可機構及其他金融機構的危機管理演習提供支援和建議。\n\n# 對財富管理及強積金相關業務的監管\n\n金管局與香港其他金融監管機構緊密合作，就指導及監督認可機構銷售證券、投資產品、保險產品及強積金計劃提供協助。金管局透過雙邊及多邊會議，以及在金融監管機構議會的框架下，與監管機構保持定期聯繫。這些會議覆蓋涉及不同金融服務界領域內具有緊密業務關係的金融機構或受規管實體的各項議題，以確保監管行動更具協調性和有效性。\n\n在年內，金管局進行了二十五項現場及非現場審查，並對認可機構進行了十五項非現場監察。 這些審查涵蓋了投資產品的銷售、處理證券交易的結算及客戶證券的安全保管，以及銷售非投資相連長期保險（非投連長險）產品及涉及零售、私人銀行業和企業銀行業客戶的強制性公積金（強積金）相關產品。\n\n八月份，金管局向認可機構發出通函，就向客戶銷售非投資相連長期保險（非投連長險）產品的適當性評估和產品資訊披露提供指引。此指引旨在協助認可機構遵守監管標準，包括保險業監理處和香港保險業聯會於七月發出的相關規定。\n\n#銀行體系的穩定\n\n金管局（HKMA）繼續與財經事務及庫務局（財庫局）在《2014 年保險公司（修訂）條例草案》的立法過程中緊密合作，以設立獨立保險業監管局及針對保險中介人法定發牌制度。七月，立法會通過了《2015 年保險公司（修訂）條例》，當中載有賦予金融管理專員透過委託，就認可機構的保險中介人活動，查察及調查權力。\n\n金管局處理了六宗成為註冊機構的申請，以及一宗註冊機構提出的從事額外規管活動的申請。金管局批准了204名負責監督註冊機構證券業務的主管人員，並對由註冊機構提交的9,697名人士進行背景審查，以納入金管局維護的登記冊。\n\n# 財資活動的監管\n\n認可機構的流動性風險管理仍為金管局監管重點之一，尤其在預期美國利率將逐步正常化，以及資金流向可能隨後逆轉，而此逆轉可能影響認可機構流動性狀況的情況下。2015年期間，金管局持續推行加強版穩定資金要求，以確保認可機構擁有足夠穩定資金支持其貸款業務。自2015年1月1日起實施《巴塞爾協定三》流動性覆蓋比率（LCR）後，金管局已監測第1類機構的LCR水平及趨勢，這些機構普遍維持LCR接近或高於100%，遠高於2015年緩步實施安排下的法定最低標準60%。\n\n另外，金管局針對選定的認可機構，就管理預期利率正常化所帶來風險的控制架構，進行專題現場審查。在市場波動期間，金管局亦密切關注突發市場變動對銀行體系及個別認可機構的影響，並採取適當後續行動。\n\n# 監管機構主導的壓力測試計劃\n\n金管局繼續推行由下而上的壓力測試計劃，以更深入了解在極端及不利經濟情況下，本地註冊零售銀行的抗風險能力，並鼓勵它們制定應對壓力時期潛在問題的方案。今年引入了若干改進措施，以收集更細緻的資料，從而更深入掌握所選領域的風險動態。金管局分析了參與認可機構提交的測試結果，並與它們討論如何進一步改善壓力測試流程。\n\n#信用風險管理與資產質素\n\n# 信貸增長與資產質素\n\n近年來觀察到的強勁信貸增長趨勢，自2015年下半年起已趨緩。全年來看，銀行體系總貸款額增長3.5%，較2014年的12.7%明顯減緩（見表2）。由於客戶存款增長速度高於銀行貸款，整體貸存比率從去年同期的72.2%降至2015年底的70.1%。"}
{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nThe global economic and financial environment was fraught with challenges in 2015, calling for closer international collaboration and communication to maintain stability. During the year, the HKMA continued to actively participate in international and regional forums while sparing no effort in raising Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre, including enhancing our financial infrastructure, optimising the regulatory and tax regime, and capitalising on the internationalisation of the renminbi to further develop offshore renminbi business. Hong Kong’s strong economic fundamentals and robust fiscal performance continued to be recognised by credit rating agencies with Standard & Poor’s maintaining its top-rated AAA rating for Hong Kong.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nThe HKMA actively contributes to international discussions on issues of significance to global and regional financial stability. In July, it assumed co-chairmanship of the Financial Stability Board Regional Consultative Group for Asia (FSB RCG(A)) for a two-year period. The group’s aim is to promote interaction between FSB members and nonmembers on policy initiatives, encourage implementation of financial reforms and facilitate the exchange of views on financial stability issues. The HKMA continued to work closely with the ASEAN+3 authorities to strengthen the operations of the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO) — which has been upgraded to an international organisation — to monitor and analyse regional economies and support decision-making of the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralisation (CMIM).\n\nDuring the year, Hong Kong’s offshore renminbi pool and bond issuance experienced some contraction due to a number of market factors. However the market continued to function orderly, and renminbi trade settlement, bank lending and foreign exchange turnover maintained steady growth. In addition, the growing renminbi business conducted in and through Hong Kong contributed to the recognition of the renminbi by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as a freely usable currency. The iMF’s decision to include it in the Special Drawing Right (SDR) currency basket will add impetus to the internationalisation of the renminbi as well as the further development of the offshore market in Hong Kong.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong's financial infrastructure and its continued development play a significant role in reinforcing the competitive edge of Hong Kong as an international financial centre and the global offshore renminbi business hub. The turnover of the renminbi payment system in Hong Kong hit new highs in 2015, while the trade repository for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives continued to support entities to report their OTC derivatives transactions as required under the new OTC derivatives market regulatory regime, which was introduced in July.\n\nHong Kong's financial infrastructure was further enhanced by the HKMA in 2015 with new components and services, including the successful launch of the e-Cheque service in December, which means that over 150 banks are now capable of receiving and processing e-Cheques from their customers through the Internet and mobile channels. The electronic bill presentment and payment (EBPP) service, which was launched in 2013, continued to see growth in merchant participation in 2015. In July, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMu) launched a service under its Fund Order Routing Service to support the implementation of the Mainland - Hong Kong Mutual Recognition of Funds (MRF). And, the regulatory framework for retail payment products and services was improved with the commencement in November of the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO). Under the PSSVFO, the HKMA is empowered to implement a mandatory licensing regime for multi-purpose stored value facilities and perform relevant supervision and enforcement functions, as well as designating important retail payment systems to ensure their safe and efficient operation under prudential regulation.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\n# REVIEW OF 2015\n\n# International and regional co-operation\n\nWith increased connections among global financial markets, the HKMA proactively fosters co-operation with other jurisdictions in promoting sustainable economic growth and financial system stability through international and regional forums including the FSB, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC). The HKMA also continues to implement global financial regulatory reforms, including the recommendations of the G20, to help strengthen the resilience of the global financial system.\n\nThe HKMA became a co-chair of the FSB RCG(A) in July and hosted its ninth meeting in Hong Kong in October. The RCG(A) serves as an important platform for FSB members and non-FSB members to communicate and co-operate on financial stability issues. Senior representatives from finance ministries, central banks and financial regulators of 16 Asian jurisdictions attended the meeting to discuss risks facing the region, the implications of increasing asset management activities, misconduct risk and experience with deposit insurance schemes. The HKMA also co-chaired a workshop on macroprudential policies in Hong Kong in August. The workshop was organised by the Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS), and attended by representatives from 18 central banks from around the world. Participants shared their experiences in macroprudential policies, focusing on the calibration and evaluation of tools, their interaction with monetary policy, and possible spillover effects. The HKMA also co-hosted a conference with the Bank of England and the IMF, featuring discussions on the challenges that central banks and other policymakers face in choosing the optimal mix of monetary, macroprudential and microprudential policies. The conference was attended by over a hundred participants, including representatives from academia, central banks and international financial institutions.\n\n# Promoting monetary and financial stability in Asia\n\nThe HKMA maintained its commitment to regional cooperative initiatives to promote financial stability in Asia and to harness the region's collective voice in international financial affairs. As a co-ordinator of the macro-surveillance work for the Monetary and Financial Stability Committee established under the Executives' Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP), the HKMA continued to prepare the Committee’s half-yearly Macro-Monitoring Report to assess the region’s risks and vulnerabilities and the policy implications. As Chair of the EMEAP Working Group on Payment and Settlement Systems, the HKMA worked closely with the Deputy Chair to co-ordinate the Group’s effort in sharing experiences and exchanging information on risk management, oversight, standards and best practices, and developments in domestic and cross-border payment and settlement systems. It also led the Working Group’s sub-group on cross-border co-operation and development. The HKMA hosted meetings of the EMEAP\/BIS Forum on Foreign Exchange Markets and the EMEAP Working Group on Financial Markets (WGFM) in Hong Kong in June. Attended by representatives from 17 authorities from the region and major economies, the meetings reviewed the latest developments in financial markets and financial regulatory reforms.\n\nFollowing the signing of the AMRO Agreement by Hong Kong and the ASEAN+3 authorities last year, AMRO was upgraded to an international organisation in February 2016 to support its pivotal role under the enhanced CMIM.\n\n# Hong Kong’s credit ratings\n\nThe HKMA continued to maintain close dialogue with international credit rating agencies to present a balanced assessment of Hong Kong's economic performance and fiscal strength. These efforts contributed to the affirmation of Hong Kong's credit ratings by all major credit rating agencies in 2015. Standard & Poor's affirmed its highest AAA rating for Hong Kong, reflecting the agency’s recognition of Hong Kong’s above-average growth prospects for a high-income economy, sizable fiscal reserves, consistently healthy fiscal performance and strong net external asset position. Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings also maintained Hong Kong’s ratings at Aa1 and AA+ respectively, just one notch below triple-A.\n\n# Development of Hong Kong as the offshore renminbi business centre\n\nIn 2015, market factors had an impact on Hong Kong's renminbi pool. At the end of the year, outstanding renminbi customer deposits and certificates of deposit stood at RMB 1,010 billion, as compared with RMB 1,158 billion a year ago (Chart 1). Offshore renminbi bond issuance moderated amid declining interest rates in the onshore market. As a result, issuance of renminbi bonds in Hong Kong dropped to RMB 75 billion. On the other hand, renminbi trade settlement transactions handled by banks in Hong Kong expanded by 9% to RMB 6,833 billion. The outstanding amount of renminbi bank loans also increased by 58% year-on-year to RMB 297 billion (Chart 2). Average daily turnover in the renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system increased to RMB 947 billion, up 29% from 2014. At the same time, the offshore renminbi foreign exchange market saw further growth in Hong Kong, with survey results indicating a daily turnover of some US$ 93 billion equivalent at the end of April 2015, an increase of 88% from April 2013 when the last BIS Triennial Survey was conducted. Hong Kong remained the largest offshore renminbi business hub with a market of considerable depth and breadth. Another significant development reinforcing this position was the implementation of the MRF initiative in July, which has expanded Hong Kong’s renminbi product offering.\n\nThe HKMA's policy initiative to expand channels for crossborder renminbi fund flows and its joint efforts with the industry to enhance Hong Kong's renminbi financial platform continued to bear fruit. In June, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) announced that offshore renminbi business clearing banks and participating banks would be allowed to conduct repo transactions in the onshore interbank bond market and remit proceeds offshore, to facilitate renminbi liquidity management by banks in the offshore market. In September, the PBoC relaxed the rules on cross-border renminbi cash pooling, enabling more multinational corporations to conduct intra-group cash transfers under streamlined arrangements. The Mainland authorities also granted foreign central banks, international financial institutions and sovereign wealth funds wider access to the onshore interbank bond market in July. They further opened up the Mainland’s foreign exchange market to these institutions in September.\n\nOn 30 november, the IMF announced its decision to include the renminbi in the SDR currency basket with effect from 1 October 2016. The decision affirms the renminbi’s status as a freely usable currency, and further promotes confidence in the use of the renminbi for global transactions. As an international financial centre and the global offshore renminbi business hub, Hong Kong will benefit from new business opportunities arising from the further internationalisation of the renminbi and the Mainland’s enhanced connection with the global economic and financial systems.\n\nHong Kong continued to reinforce its collaboration on renminbi business with other jurisdictions throughout the year. The HKMA co-hosted the third RMB Trade and Investment Dialogue with Australia and the fifth RMB Business Forum with London, and worked with Malaysia and Thailand for the second time in facilitating private sector discussions on renminbi business. Through these initiatives, banks in Hong Kong strengthened their renminbi business flows and linkages with other markets, which will bring more renminbi business to Hong Kong. The HKMA also stepped up its marketing efforts to promote the wider use of renminbi in trade, investment and financing among corporations and institutions through participation in industry events in Hong Kong and in overseas markets including Canada, Japan and Africa.\n\nDeputy Chief Executive of the HKMA, Mr Eddie Yue, speaks at a seminar during the fifth meeting of Hong Kong–London RMB Forum on 11 December 2015.\n\n# CEPA\n\nA new agreement to achieve basic liberalisation of trade in services between Mainland China and Hong Kong was signed in November under the framework of the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA). The agreement extends most of the pilot liberalisation measures introduced in Guangdong in 2014 nationwide. By according national treatment, in principle, to Hong Kong banks, the new agreement is expected to provide these banks with more policy certainty and greater flexibility when conducting business in Mainland China.\n\n# Training\n\nThe HKMA continued to provide training programmes for officials from the PBoC, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange and the China Banking Regulatory Commission. In addition to programmes dealing with central banking and general risk management, topics included consumer protection, credit reference, monetary and collateral management, financial soundness indicators analysis, and systemic risk monitoring. Ad hoc training sessions were also conducted for delegations from overseas banking and law enforcement agencies.\n\n# Government Bond Programme\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA arranged eight tenders of institutional government bonds amounting to HK$ 20.4 billion. By the end of 2015, the total amount of outstanding institutional bonds was HK$ 68.9 billion.\n","terms":{"\"too big to fail\" problem":["大至不能倒問題"],"10 years plus Caring organisation

國際金融中心\n\n2015年，全球經濟及金融環境充滿挑戰，需要更緊密的國際合作與溝通以維持穩定。年內，金管局繼續積極參與國際及區域論壇，並全力提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力，包括加強我們的金融基建，優化監管與稅務制度，以及利用人民幣國際化進一步發展離岸人民幣業務。香港穩健的經濟基礎和強勁的財政表現繼續受到信貸評級機構的認可，標準普爾維持香港的最高級別AAA評級。\n\n# 概覽\n\n金管局積極參與關於全球與區內金融穩定重要議題的國際討論。七月，金管局擔任金融穩定理事會亞洲地區諮詢委員會（金融穩定理事會區域諮詢小組亞洲）的聯合主席，任期兩年。該小組旨在促進金融穩定理事會成員國與非成員國在政策倡議上的互動，鼓勵金融改革的實施，並促進就金融穩定問題的觀點交流。金管局繼續與東盟+3 相關機構密切合作，加強宏觀經濟研究辦公室（AMRO）——現已升級為國際組織——的運作，以監測和分析區域經濟，並支持清邁倡議多邊化（CMIM）的決策。\n\n年內，香港的離岸人民幣資金池及債券發行因多項市場因素而出現一定程度的收縮。然而市場仍維持有序運作，人民幣貿易結算、銀行貸款及外匯成交額持續穩定增長。此外，透過香港進行的人民幣業務不斷擴展，有助於國際貨幣基金組織將人民幣認定為可自由使用貨幣。國際貨幣基金組織將人民幣納入特別提款權貨幣籃子的決定，將為人民幣國際化以及香港離岸市場的進一步發展增添動力。\n\n香港金融基建的安全高效運作及其持續發展，對強化香港作為國際金融中心及全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的競爭優勢發揮重要作用。香港人民幣支付系統的交易額在2015年創下新高，同時場外衍生工具交易資料儲存庫持續支持實體根據七月推出的新場外衍生工具市場監管制度的要求，報告其場外衍生工具交易。\n\n香港的金融基建於2015年進一步得到金管局加強，新增多項組成部分及服務，包括於12月成功推出電子支票服務，這意味著現時超過150間銀行均可透過互聯網及流動渠道接收及處理客戶的電子支票。電子帳單及繳費服務（EBPP）自2013年推出後，2015年繼續見到商戶參與度增加。同年7月，債務工具中央結算系統（CMU）在其基金訂單路由服務下推出新服務，以支持內地與香港基金互認安排（MRF）的實施。此外，零售支付產品及服務的監管框架亦因《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（PSSVFO）於11月的實施而得到改善。根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》，金管局獲授權實施多用途儲值支付工具的強制發牌制度，並執行相關的監管和執法工作，以及指定重要零售支付系統，以確保這些系統在審慎監管下安全及高效運作。\n\n# 國際金融中心\n\n# 2015年回顧\n\n# 國際和區域合作\n\n與環球金融市場聯繫日益緊密，金管局積極與其他司法管轄區合作，透過包括金融穩定理事會、國際結算銀行（國際結算銀行）及亞太經濟合作組織等國際和區域論壇，促進可持續經濟增長和金融體系穩定。金管局亦繼續實施全球金融監管改革，包括二十國集團的建議，以協助強化全球金融體系的韌性。\n\n金管局於七月成為金融穩定理事會（FSB）區域諮詢小組（亞洲）的聯合主席，並於十月在香港舉辦了其第九次會議。該小組為金融穩定理事會成員和非成員提供了一個重要的平台，以溝通和合作解決金融穩定問題。來自亞洲十六個地區的財政部、中央銀行和金融監管機構的高級代表出席了會議，討論了該地區面臨的風險、日益增加的資產管理活動的影響、不當行為風險以及存款保險計劃的經驗。金管局還於八月在香港聯合主持了一場關於宏觀審慎政策的工作坊。該工作坊由全球金融體系委員會（CGFS）組織，並有來自世界各地的十八家中央銀行的代表出席。與會者分享了他們在宏觀審慎政策方面的經驗，重點關注工具的校準和評估、與貨幣政策的互動以及可能的溢出效應。金管局還與英格蘭銀行和國際貨幣基金組織（基金組織）聯合舉辦了一次會議，探討了中央銀行和其他決策者在選擇最佳的貨幣、宏觀審慎和微觀審慎政策組合時所面臨的挑戰。會議有超過一百名與會者，包括來自學術界、中央銀行和國際金融組織的代表。\n\n# 倡導主管貨幣事務副總裁及金融穩定在亞洲的推廣\n\n金管局繼續履行其對促進亞洲金融穩定及在國際金融事務中發揚地區集體聲音的區域合作倡議的承諾。作為東亞及太平洋地區中央銀行會議（EMEAP）下設的貨幣及金融穩定委員會的宏觀監察工作協調人，金管局持續準備委員會的半年度宏觀監察報告，以評估地區的風險與脆弱性以及相關政策含義。作為EMEAP支付及結算系統工作小組主席，金管局與副主席密切合作，協調小組在風險管理、監管、標準與最佳實踐，以及國內及跨境支付結算系統發展方面的經驗分享與資訊交流。金管局亦領導小組內專責跨境合作與發展的子小組。金管局於六月在香港主辦EMEAP與國際結算銀行外匯市場小組及EMEAP金融市場工作小組（WGFM）會議，與來自地區內17個機構及主要經濟體的代表出席，會議審視了金融市場的最新發展及金融監管改革情況。\n\n繼去年香港與東盟+3當局簽署宏觀經濟研究辦公室協議後，宏觀經濟研究辦公室於二零一六年二月升格為國際組織，以支持其在強化清邁倡議多邊化中的關鍵角色。\n\n# 香港的信貸評級\n\n金管局持續與國際信貸評級機構保持密切溝通，以提供對香港經濟表現及財政儲備的平衡評估。這些努力促成了二零一五年所有主要信貸評級機構對香港信貸評級的肯定。標準普爾確認香港獲得其最高的AAA評級，反映該機構認可香港作為高收入經濟體的優於平均水平的增長前景、規模龐大的財政儲備、持續健康的財政表現及強勁的淨外部資產地位。穆迪及惠譽亦分別維持香港的Aa1及AA+評級，僅低於AAA一個級別。\n\n# 香港發展成為離岸人民幣業務中心\n\n2015年，市場因素影響了香港的人民幣匯款。截至年末，人民幣客戶存款和存款證的未結餘分別為人民幣1,010百億元，較一年前的人民幣1,158百億元有所減少（圖表1）。在岸市場利率下降的影響下，離岸人民幣債券發行有所放緩。因此，香港的人民幣債券發行額降至人民幣75百億元。另一方面，香港銀行處理的人民幣貿易結算交易增長了9%，達到人民幣6,833百億元。人民幣銀行貸款的未結餘也較去年同期增長了58%，達到人民幣297百億元（圖表2）。即時支付結算（RTGS）系統的每日平均成交額增長至人民幣947百億元，較2014年增長29%。同時，離岸人民幣外匯市場在香港進一步增長，調查結果顯示，截至2015年4月底，日均成交額約為930億美元，較2013年4月（上次國際結算銀行每三年一度調查進行時）增長了88%。香港仍然是最大的離岸人民幣業務樞紐，擁有市場深度和廣度。鞏固這一地位的另一個重要發展是，內地與香港基金互認安排（MRF）於7月實施，擴展了香港的人民幣產品供應。\n\n金管局擴展跨境人民幣資金流向渠道的政策舉措，以及與業界合作提升香港人民幣金融平台的共同努力，持續取得成效。六月，中國人民銀行宣布，離岸人民幣業務清算行及參加行將被允許在在岸銀行間債券市場進行回購交易，並可將相關資金匯出境外，以協助離岸市場銀行進行人民幣流動性管理。九月，中國人民銀行放寬跨境人民幣資金池業務規則，使更多跨國企業可在簡化流程下進行集團內部人民幣調度。內地當局亦於七月授予境外中央銀行、國際金融組織及主權財富基金更廣泛的准入，參與在岸銀行間債券市場。當局更於九月進一步開放內地外匯市場予這些機構。\n\n2015年11月30日，國際貨幣基金組織（基金組織）宣布，自2016年10月1日起將人民幣納入特別提款權貨幣籃子。此決定肯定了人民幣作為可自由使用貨幣的地位，並進一步促進了對使用人民幣進行全球交易的信心。作為國際金融中心及全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐，香港將受益於人民幣進一步國際化，以及內地與全球經濟金融體系聯繫更加緊密所帶來的新商機。\n\n香港全年持續加強與其他地區在人民幣業務方面的合作。金管局與澳洲共同主辦第三屆人民幣貿易與投資對話，與倫敦共同主辦第五屆人民幣業務合作小組，並與馬來西亞和泰國第二次合作，促進私營機構磋商人民幣業務相關事宜。透過這些舉措，香港的銀行加強了人民幣業務的拓展，並與其他市場建立了更緊密的聯繫，為香港帶來更多人民幣業務。金管局同時加大了市場推廣力度，鼓勵企業和機構在貿易、投資和融資方面更廣泛地使用人民幣，並參與了在香港及海外市場（包括加拿大、日本和非洲）的業界活動。\n\n金管局副總裁葉奕雄先生於2015年12月11日香港–倫敦人民幣論壇第五次會議期間的一場研討會上發言。\n\n#內地與香港關於建立更緊密經貿關係的安排\n\n於11月在內地與香港關於建立更緊密經貿關係的安排框架下簽署了一項新協議，以實現內地中國與香港之間服務貿易的基本自由化。該協議將2014年在廣東省推出的試點自由化措施擴展至全國範圍。透過給予香港銀行國民待遇，新協議預期將為這些銀行在內地中國進行業務時提供更多的政策確定性及更大的靈活性。\n\n# 訓練\n\n金管局繼續為中國人民銀行、國家外匯管理局及中國銀行業監督管理委員會的官員提供培訓課程。除涉及中央銀行及一般風險管理的課程外，內容還包括消費者保障、信貸參考、貨幣及抵押品管理、金融穩健指標分析，以及系統性風險監察。此外，亦為來自海外銀行業及法規執行機構的代表團舉辦特別培訓課程。\n\n#政府債券計劃\n\n在本年度內，金管局進行了八次機構政府債券的招標，總金額達204億港元。截至2015年底，未償還的機構債券總額達689億港元。\n"}
{"en":"# Reserves Management\n\n2015 was a turbulent year for the global financial markets, presenting unprecedented challenges to investment funds. Amid such challenging and difficult investment environment, the Exchange Fund recorded an overall investment return of -0.6% in 2015, but its loss was relatively mild as compared with major market indices and comparable investment funds, thanks to a series of defensive moves deployed by the HKMA over the past years which have enhanced the resilience of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary and may be invested in any securities or other assets he considers appropriate, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC).\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nEFAC has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(a) to preserve capital;\n(b) to ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, will be fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(c) to ensure that sufficient liquidity will be available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) subject to (a) — (c), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund.\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios — the Backing Portfolio and the Investment Portfolio. The Backing Portfolio holds highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of the assets. The long-term target bond-to-equity mix for the two portfolios as a whole is 72:28. In terms of target currency mix, 81% of the assets are allocated to the US dollar and the Hong Kong dollar, and the remaining 19% to other currencies.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA has been diversifying part of the Exchange Fund’s investment, in a prudent and incremental manner, into a greater variety of asset classes, including emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity and overseas investment properties. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the Investment Portfolio while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The cap for the net asset value of the HKMA’s investments under the LTGP is maintained at one-third of the Accumulated Surplus of the Exchange Fund. At the end of 2015, the market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$142.1 billion, made up of HK$91.3 billion in private equity and HK$50.8 billion in real estate, with outstanding investment commitments amounted to HK$122.4 billion.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007 to hold shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that were acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes, is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of the unique nature of this Portfolio.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation — the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation. The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents the long-term optimal asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This often means the actual allocation is different from the benchmark, or strategic, allocation. The differences between the actual and the benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and the limits for tactical deviations are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with EFAC, tactical decisions are made by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the limits allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may take positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nHKMA staff in the Reserves Management Department directly manage the investment of about 76% of the Exchange Fund, which includes the entire Backing Portfolio and part of the Investment Portfolio. This part of the Investment Portfolio includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers based in a number of international financial centres to manage about 24% of the Exchange Fund's assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised assets. The purpose of appointing external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to capture a diverse mix of investment styles, and transfer knowledge and information from the market to in-house professionals.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is primarily determined by market factors, and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe high volatility of the financial markets in recent years has highlighted the importance of risk management. Stringent controls and investment guidelines have been established for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and compliance with guidelines and regulations is closely monitored. Risk-control tools are deployed to assess market risks under both normal and adverse market conditions. The HKMA also conducts detailed performance attribution analyses to make the best use of the investment skills of both internal and external managers.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2015\n\nThe global financial markets were highly volatile in 2015. The equity markets, in particular, encountered exceptional turbulence. Major equity markets reached new highs in the first half of the year. However, market sentiment worsened drastically in the third quarter, arising from Mainland China growth concerns, with major equity markets reversing their year-to-date gains and registering significant quarterly losses. Global equity markets recovered somewhat along with improving market sentiment thereafter, but they worsened again towards the end of the year. With their close linkage with the Mainland economy, Hong Kong equities underperformed other major equity markets in 2015.\n\nOn sovereign bond markets, longer-term US Treasury yields rose moderately in 2015 despite expectation of US interest rate normalisation and the start of the US interest rate up-cycle, as positive sentiment was checked by concerns over global economic growth, lingering global disinflationary pressures and intensified geopolitical tensions. On the other hand, short-term European government bond yields declined and some even slipped into negative territory on the back of the European Central Bank’s aggressive monetary easing policy.\n\nOn currency markets, the US dollar continued to strengthen in 2015 with the US dollar index surging by almost 10%, amid expectation of the commencement of the US policy rate normalisation. The euro weakened significantly in the first quarter, posting the biggest single-quarter fall in the history of the euro since 1999, as the European Central Bank announced quantitative easing measures in January. On the other hand, the yen stayed largely flat against the US dollar in 2015.\n\nThe performance of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2015 is shown in Table 1.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nAgainst the backdrop of exceptionally volatile financial markets and difficult investment environment, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment loss of HK$15.8 billion in 2015, comprising gains of HK$7.1 billion on overseas equities, losses of HK$5 billion on Hong Kong equities, gains of HK$15.9 billion on bonds, a negative currency translation effect of HK$44.9 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets and gains of HK$11.1 billion on other investments held by the investment holding subsidiaries of the Fund. The negative currency translation effect was unavoidable when translating the Exchange Fund’s non-US dollar investments into Hong Kong dollar amid the sharp strengthening of the US dollar last year. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$2.2 billion.\n\nThe total assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$3,422.9 billion at the end of 2015. The investment return of the Exchange Fund (excluding the Strategic Portfolio) in 2015 was -0.6%. That notwithstanding, the Exchange Fund’s loss could be considered mild when compared with the underperforming major market indices and the investment fund community in general. In anticipation of a worsening investment environment, the HKMA has deployed a series of defensive moves over the past years, which include shortening the duration of bond portfolios, increasing cash holdings, and significantly reducing non-US dollar assets. We have also quickened the pace of investment diversification, especially through investments under the LTGP. These moves have enhanced the resilience of the Exchange Fund and helped mitigate some potential losses.\n\nThe annual return of the Fund from 1994 to 2015 is set out in Chart 1. Table 2 shows the 2015 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over a number of different time horizons. The average return was 1.2% over the past three years, 1.8% over the past five years, 3.3% over the past 10 years and 5.0% since 1994. Table 3 shows the currency mix of the Fund's assets on 31 December 2015.\n\nChart 1 Investment return of the Exchange Fund (1994 – 2015) \n1 investment return calculation excludes the holdings in the Strategic Portfolio. \n2 Composite Consumer price index is calculated based on the 2009\/2010-based series.\n","terms":{"\"too big to fail\" problem":["大至不能倒問題"],"10 years plus Caring organisation

儲備管理\n\n二零一五年是環球金融市場動盪不安的一年，為投資基金帶來前所未有的挑戰。在如此充滿挑戰和艱難的投資環境下，外匯基金在二零一五年錄得總投資回報率為負百分之零點六，但其虧損相較於主要市場指數及同類投資基金而言相對溫和， وذلك 歸功於金管局過去幾年實施的一系列防禦措施，這些措施提升了外匯基金的韌性。\n\n#外匯基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》，外匯基金的主要宗旨是直接或間接影響香港貨幣的匯價。基金亦可用於維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定與完整，以協助維持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。外匯基金由財政司司長掌管，經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後，可投資於他認為適當的任何證券或其他資產。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標與投資組合架構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會已為外匯基金設定以下投資目標：\n\n(a) 保存資本；  \n(b) 確保貨幣基礎始終由高流動性的美元資產充分支持；  \n(c) 確保有足夠的流動性可用於維持貨幣和金融穩定；以及  \n(d) 在(a)至(c)的條件下，實現有助於維持基金長期購買力的投資回報率。\n\n這些目標已充分考慮外匯基金的法定目的，並已納入基金的投資組合結構及目標資產分布中。\n\n外匯基金廣義上設有兩個主要投資組合—支持組合和投資組合。支持組合持有高度流動的美元資產，以符合貨幣發行局制度的要求，為貨幣基礎提供支持。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作暨發展組織成員國的股市，以保值並維持資產的長期購買力。這兩個投資組合的整體長期債券與股票的長線目標分布比率為72比28。在目標貨幣組合方面，81%的資產配置於美元和港元，其餘19%配置於其他貨幣。\n\n為更好地管理風險及提升中長期回報，金管局已以謹慎及逐步的方式，將外匯基金部分投資分散至更多元化的資產類別，包括新興巿場及內地債券與股票、私募股權及海外投資物業。新興巿場及內地債券與股票由投資組合持有，而私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合持有。金管局在長期增長組合下的投資淨資產價值上限維持為外匯基金累計盈餘的三分之一。截至2015年底，長期增長組合下的投資市值總計為1,421億港元，其中私募股權為913億港元，房地產投資為508億港元，已承擔但尚未提取作投資的總額為1,224億港元。\n\n於2007年設立的策略性資產組合，用以持有香港交易及結算所有限公司股份，這些股份是由政府為外匯基金的戰略目的而購入，由於此資產組合的獨特性，因此不包括在評估外匯基金的投資表現之內。\n\n# 儲備管理\n\n# 投資程序\n\n外匯基金的投資程序基於兩種類型的資產分布——戰略性資產分布及戰術性資產分布。戰略性資產分布反映於投資基準，代表外匯基金根據其投資目標所設定的長期最佳資產分布。在戰略性分配的指導下，資產會進行戰術性分配，以圖在基準之上取得超額回報。這通常意味著實際的資產分布與基準（即戰略性）分布有所不同。實際分布與基準分布之間的差異被稱為「戰略性偏離」。雖然基準及戰略性偏離的範圍是由財政司司長與外匯基金諮詢委員會進行諮詢後確定，但戰術性決策則由金管局根據授權作出。在戰略性偏離所允許的範圍內，投資組合經理可採取立場以利用短期市場波動。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局儲備管理部直接管理外匯基金約76%的投資，其中包括整個支持組合和部分投資組合。這部分投資組合包括投資於全球定息市場及運用宏觀風險管理策略的各種衍生工具。\n\n# 外聘投資經理\n\n除了內部管理資產外，金管局聘用位於多個國際金融中心的​外聘投資經理，管理約 24% 的​外匯基金​資產，包括所有​上市股票組合​及其他​特別資產​。聘用​外聘投資經理​的目的，是利用市場上最佳的投資專業知識，捕捉多樣化的投資風格，並將市場的知識和資訊傳授給內部專業人員。\n\n與外聘投資經理相關的支出包括基金管理、託管費、交易費以及扣繳稅和其他稅項。此類支出主要由市場因素決定，並可能逐年波動。\n\n# 風險管理及監察\n\n近年來金融市場的高波動性凸顯了風險管理的重要性。針對內部及外聘投資經理管理的投資組合，已建立嚴格的管控措施和投資指引，並密切監督對指引和法規的遵循情況。風險管控工具被用來評估在正常及不利市場條件下的市場風險。金管局亦進行詳細的投資表現因素分析，以充分發揮內部及外聘投資經理的投資能力。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2015年金融市場\n\n2015年環球金融市場極度波動。股市則面臨異常動盪。主要股市在年中前創下新高。然而，第三季市場情緒因中國內地增長擔憂而急劇惡化，主要股市抹去累計漲幅，並錄得顯著季度虧損。此後，隨著市場情緒改善，全球股市部分復甦，但年內末段再度惡化。由於與中國內地經濟密切聯繫，香港股票在2015年表現較其他主要股市為差。\n\n在政府債市方面，儘管市場預期美國利率正常化及美國加息周期的啟動，2015年長期國庫券收益率仍溫和上漲，因對全球經濟增長的擔憂、持續存在的全球低通脹壓力以及升溫的地緣政治緊張局勢抑制了正面情緒。另一方面，受歐洲中央銀行積極貨幣寬鬆政策影響，短期歐洲政府債券收益率下跌，部分甚至跌入負值區域。\n\n在貨幣市場方面，美元在2015年持續走強，美元匯價指數上漲近10%，原因是市場預期美國將開始政策利率正常化周期。 歐元在第一季度大幅走弱，自1999年以來單季跌幅創歷史新高，原因為歐洲中央銀行在1月份宣布量化寬鬆措施。 另一方面，日圓在2015年對美元匯率基本持平。\n\n2015年主要外匯市場、債券市場及股市的表現如表1所示。\n\n# 儲備管理\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n在金融市場異常波動及投資環境艱難的背景下，外匯基金於2015年錄得投資虧損158億港元，其中包括海外股票盈利71億港元、香港股票虧損50億港元、債券盈利159億港元、非港元資產因貨幣換算產生負面影響達449億港元，以及基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資盈利111億港元。在去年美元大幅升值的情況下，將外匯基金的非美元資產換算為港元時產生的負面貨幣換算影響是無法避免的。另外，策略性資產組合則錄得估值收益22億港元。\n\n外匯基金的總資產在2015年底達到3,4229億港元。外匯基金（不包括策略性資產組合）在2015年的投資回報率為-0.6%。儘管如此，與表現不佳的主要市場指數及投資基金界整體相比，外匯基金的虧損可視為輕微。預見投資環境惡化，金管局在過去幾年已採取一系列防禦性措施，包括縮短債券組合的久期、增加現金持有量，以及大幅減少非美元資產。我們亦加快了多元化投資的進度，特別是透過長期增長組合下的投資。這些措施已提升外匯基金的抗風險能力，並有助緩解部分潛在虧損。\n\n基金自一九九四年至二零一五年

{"en":"# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communications with the community and the market through the media, public education programmes, and various other channels to facilitate understanding of its policies and operations. In 2015, the HKMA improved corporate governance by supporting professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline, enhancing IT security, and realigning duties among senior management to help cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new programmes and systems and the increasing complexity of work.\n\n# ENGAGING THE COMMUNITY CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT\n\n# Media relations\n\nThe HKMA works closely with the media to improve transparency and promote public understanding of its policies and work. In 2015, 59 open media events were held, comprising 14 news conferences, 14 stand-up interviews and 31 other public functions. A further 43 media interviews were arranged, 325 bilingual press releases were issued and a substantial number of media enquiries were handled daily.\n\nIn addition, to enhance public understanding of the HKMA's key functions, two media tours were organised to the Hong Kong Note Printing Limited and Hong Kong Interbank Clearing Limited (HKICL) respectively to showcase Hong Kong's world-class note printing technologies and financial infrastructure. Educational workshops were conducted on the Currency Board system, renminbi business and the Exchange Fund for a more in-depth briefing for the media on these important subjects.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan (centre), and Executive Director (Monetary Management), Mr Howard Lee (right), inspect security features on banknotes during a media visit to the Hong Kong Note Printing Limited.\n\nAn automated cheque sorting demonstration during a media tour to HKICL. In the middle of the photo (from left to right) are HKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan; Executive Director (Financial Infrastructure), Mr Esmond Lee; and HKICL Chief Executive Officer, Ms Haster Tang.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\n# Public enquiries\n\nThe Public Enquiry Service provides an effective means for people to obtain information from the HKMA, enabling them to get a greater understanding of the organisation's key functions. The Service handled 9,078 enquiries in 2015. About half of these related to banking policies and regulations, notes and coins, and consumer banking issues. Notable examples included prudential measures for property mortgage loans, banking products and services, prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing, and the coin collection programme.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received since 2012 and Chart 2 provides a breakdown by nature of the enquiries in 2015.\n\nChart 1 Total number of public enquiries\n\n# Publications\n\nApart from the HKMA Annual Report, the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report, 4 issues of the Quarterly Bulletin, and released regular updates of the Monthly Statistical Bulletin over the past year to provide up-to-date and thematic information and analyses on monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. In addition, senior management of the HKMA published 14 inSight articles covering various topical and timely policy issues.\n\nThe HKMA Annual Report 2014 received a Bronze award in the “non-profit Making and Charitable Organisations” category in the Hong Kong Management Association’s 2015 Best Annual Reports Awards.\n\n# The HKMA website\n\nThe HKMA corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk), with over 50,000 pages in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, is the public access gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It also contains the Register of Securities Staff of Authorized Institutions (AIs) and the Register of AIs and Local Representative Offices, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance. With the implementation of the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, the website will also contain the register of stored value facility licensees under the Ordinance. Dedicated webpage and eye-catching short-cut links have been provided to draw the public's attention to important and timely information on issues such as reminders on the need to remain vigilant against bogus phone calls and the location of the coin carts in the coin collection programme.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\n# Public education programme\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre on the 55th Floor of Two International Finance Centre is an important resource for introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters. The Centre consists of the Exhibition Area and the Library, and is open to the public six days a week. The Exhibition Area introduces the work of the HKMA and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong. It includes reading materials and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong's monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nGuided tours of the Information Centre are organised for visitors. During the year, the Centre received more than 48,300 visitors and hosted over 630 quided tours for schools and other groups (Chart 3). Over 530,400 people have visited the Information Centre since it opened in December 2003.\n\nThe Library, situated next to the Exhibition Area, houses more than 23,000 books, journals and other publications for the detailed study of Hong Kong's monetary, banking and financial affairs and central banking topics. It also maintains an electronic register of AIs in Hong Kong as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nIn its ongoing programme to reach out to the community, the HKMA continued to organise public education seminars. In 2015, three seminars were held for some 2,300 secondary school students and teachers. Topics included the Linked Exchange Rate System, banknotes in Hong Kong, the smart use of credit cards and the Deposit Protection Scheme. More than 54,700 people have participated in the programme since its launch in 1998.\n\nChart 3 Types of group visits to the Information Centre\n\nYoung visitors learn about the development of money and banking in Hong Kong during a guided tour of the Information Centre.\n\nSecondary school students and teachers participate in a public education seminar.\n\n# HUMAN RESOURCES\n\nThe HKMA recruits, develops and maintains a highly professional workforce to support its policy objectives and respond flexibly to changing work priorities. While the HKMA is an integral part of the Government, it is able to employ staff on terms different from those of the civil service to attract personnel with the right experience and expertise. As a public organisation, the HKMA aims to maintain a lean and flexible structure and to redeploy staff resources to undertake new initiatives and meet increased workload.\n\n# Organisational changes\n\nFollowing the enactment of the payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, a new Retail Payment Oversight Division was formed under the Monetary Management Department (MMD) in December 2015 to carry out the HKMA’s new statutory duties in the licensing and day-to-day supervision of stored value facilities and other retail payment systems. To enhance synergy amongst departments and reprioritise staff resources in coping with the challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives as well as increasing workload and complexity of work, reshuffling of duties among a number of departments was planned in 2015 for implementation in early 2016. Details are as follows:\n\nThe Financial Infrastructure Department (FID) took over the administration of the Deposit Protection Scheme and the settlement function from the Enforcement Department (ENFD) and the Currency Division from MMD. It also took over from the Banking Departments certain banking-related work such as consumer education, directors’ development and enhanced competency framework for bank practitioners;\n\nThe External Department took over the market development function of MMD, while the latter will continue with its work relating to the Treasury Markets Association and financial benchmarks; and\n\nENFD took over the Anti-Money laundering (AML) and Financial Crime Risk Division from the Banking Supervision Department, and was retitled as Enforcement and AML Department.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\n# Staffing\n\nThe establishment of the HKMA in 2015 was 841. This is increased by 34 to 875 in 2016 (an increase of 4%) to ensure that sufficient resources are provided to cope with (i) the implementation of new legislation and initiatives, (ii) continuation of pilot projects proven necessary on an on-going basis, and (ii) the increasing complexity and volume of existing work. The new posts are deployed to the following functions:\n\nEnhancing banking and financial stability, which includes:\n\nstrengthening banking supervision work including on-site examination of banks' stress testing process, implementation of international banking standards and peer review exercises;\n\nstrengthening the supervision of banks' liquidity risk and cyber security risk management;\n\nimplementing the supervisory framework regarding over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives conducted through banks and approved money brokers under the newly effective OTC derivatives reporting and record-keeping rules;\n\nstrengthening supervisory and enforcement efforts in anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing;\n\ngearing up the planning and preparatory work for the implementation of the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Bill, which applies international standards to address the \"too big to fail\" problem of the financial industry;\n\npromoting capacity building in the banking sector through the development of a director empowerment programme for independent non-executive directors of banks to further improve the governance of banks and collaboration with the industry to promote enhanced competency frameworks for banking practitioners engaged in core areas of banking operations;\n\nstepping up the banking conduct policy and research capability in new banking, securities and insurance products;\n\nenhancing consumer protection and consumer education efforts; and\n\nstepping up the monitoring and analysis of developments in the onshore renminbi market and in the CNH market with a view to supporting the orderly operation of Hong Kong’s offshore renminbi market.\n\nStrengthening investment, risk management and legal support to the expanding investment activities associated with the establishment of the Future Fund and further diversification of the Exchange Fund’s investment products, and enhancing strategic asset allocation and investment processes in the light of an increasingly challenging investment environment.\n\nImplementing the new statutory regime which empowers the HKMA to regulate stored value facilities and retail payment systems under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance.\n\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nTemporary resources are deployed to meet other work demands. The HKMA transfers staff on secondment to other international or local organisations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Services Development Council to assist in activities or policy initiatives in which Hong Kong or the HKMA has an interest. Some staff members are deployed on a full-time or part-time basis to provide operational support to the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board and the Treasury Markets Association.\n\n# Remuneration policies and pay review mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary (FS) determines the pay and conditions of service for HKMA staff on the advice of the Governance Sub-Committee (GSC) through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC), taking into account the prevailing market rates and practices. Remuneration comprises a total cash package and a provident fund scheme, with minimal benefits in kind. The cash package consists of monthly fixed pay (or basic pay) and variable pay, which may be awarded to individual staff members as a lump sum once a year depending on performance.\n\nPay for HKMA staff is reviewed annually by the FS in the light of recommendations made to him by the GSC through EFAC, taking into account the GSC's assessment of the performance of the HKMA in the preceding year, the pay-survey findings of the financial sector conducted by independent human resources consultants and any other relevant factors. Special pay adjustments may be made from time to time for individual meritorious staff to maintain their pay competitiveness.\n\nAny approved annual adjustments to the fixed pay or any variable pay awards for the HKMA are distributed to individual staff based on their performance. Investment professionals in the HKMA are subject to a variable pay system that seeks to strengthen the linkage between their investment performance and remuneration award. The pay adjustments or awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Executive Director or above are approved by the FS on the advice of the GSC. The staff members concerned are not present at the meetings when their pay is discussed. The pay adjustments or awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Division Head and below are determined by the Chief Executive of the HKMA under delegated authority from the FS and within the approved overall pay awards.\n","terms":{"\"too big to fail\" problem":["大至不能倒問題"],"10 years plus Caring organisation logo":["10年Plus同心展關懷標誌"],"2015 article iV Consultation":["2015

機構職能\n\n金管局透過媒體、公眾教育活動及其他各種渠道維持與社區及市場的有效溝通，以促進對其政策及運作的了解。2015年，金管局透過支持員工專業發展、推行嚴謹的財務紀律、加強資訊科技保安及重新調整管理層職責，提升企業管治水平，以應對新計劃及系統實施所帶來的挑戰，以及工作日益複雜的情況。\n\n# 參與社區企業發展\n\n# 傳媒關係\n\n金管局與傳媒密切合作，以提高透明度並促進公眾對其政策和工作的理解。二零一五年，共舉行了五十九場公開的傳媒活動，包括十四場新聞發布會、十四場即場訪問及三十一項其他公開活動。此外，安排了四十三場傳媒訪問，發佈了三百二十五份雙語新聞稿，並每日處理大量傳媒查詢。\n\n此外，為加強公眾對金管局主要職能的了解，分別舉辦兩次傳媒參觀活動，前往香港印鈔有限公司及香港銀行同業結算有限公司（香港銀行同業結算有限公司），展示香港世界一流的印鈔技術和金融基建。並就貨幣發行局制度、人民幣業務和外匯基金舉辦研討會，向傳媒提供這些重要議題更深入的簡報。\n\n香港金融管理局局長陳德霖（中）、助理總裁（貨幣管理）李惠來（右）在媒體參觀香港印鈔有限公司期間檢查紙幣的防偽特徵。\n\n香港銀行同業結算有限公司媒體參觀活動期間進行的自動化支票分類示範。照片中間（由左至右）為金管局行政總裁陳德霖先生；金融基建助理總裁李志強先生；以及香港銀行同業結算有限公司行政總裁湯慧怡女士。\n\n# 機構職能\n\n# 公眾問詢\n\n公眾查詢服務為市民提供一個有效的途徑，以從金管局獲取資訊，使他們能更深入了解該機構的主要職能。該服務在2015年處理了9,078宗查詢。約半數查詢涉及銀行業政策與規例、紙幣及硬幣，以及零售銀行業務問題。值得注意的例子包括物業按揭貸款的審慎監管措施、銀行產品及服務、打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集活動，以及硬幣收集計劃。\n\n圖表1顯示自2012年起接獲的公眾查詢數目，圖表2則提供2015年查詢類型的細項分析。\n\n圖表 1 公眾查詢總數\n\n# 出版品\n\n除了《金管局年報》外，金管局過去一年發佈兩期《貨幣與金融穩定情況半年度報告》，四期《季報》，並定期更新《金融數據月報》，以提供香港貨幣、銀行業和經濟問題的最新及主題性資訊和分析。此外，金管局管理層發表了十四篇匯思，涵蓋各項熱門及及時的政策議題。\n\n金管局二零一四年年報於香港管理專業協會二零一五年最佳年報評選中，在「非牟利及慈善機構」類別中獲得銅獎。\n\n# 香港金管局網站\n\n金管局的機構網站（www.hkma.gov.hk）以英文及繁體和簡體中文提供超過五萬頁的資料，是公眾獲取有關金管局最新資訊的入口。網站亦載有認可機構證券業務員工紀錄冊及認可機構及本地代表辦事處紀錄冊，兩者均根據銀行業條例第20條設立及維護。隨著支付系統及儲值支付工具條例的實施，網站將會載有根據該條例設立的儲值支付工具持牌人紀錄冊。網站設有專門網頁及醒目快捷連結，以引起公眾對一些重要及時資訊的關注，例如提醒公眾需提高警覺以防止假冒電話詐騙，以及硬幣收集計劃中收銀車的分布位置等資訊。\n\n# 機構職能\n\n# 公眾教育計畫\n\n位於國際金融中心2期55樓的金管局資訊中心是向公眾介紹金管局工作及推廣貨幣及銀行業事務意識的重要資源。中心設有展覽館及圖書館，並於週一至週六開放公眾使用。展覽館介紹金管局的工作以及香港貨幣及銀行業的發展，內設有有關香港貨幣、銀行業和金融事務的閱讀資料及展品。\n\n導覽團會為訪客安排至資訊中心參觀。在過去一年中，中心接待了超過四萬八千三百名訪客，並為學校和其他團體舉辦了超過六百三十個導覽團（圖表三）。自二零零三年十二月開幕以來，已有超過五十三萬零四百人次參觀了資訊中心。\n\n圖書館位於展覽館旁，藏有超過二萬三千本書籍、期刊及其他出版物，供深入研究香港的貨幣、銀行業和金融事務及中央銀行事務。它亦根據《銀行條例》第20條的規定，保存香港認可機構的電子登記冊。\n\n為持續向社區推廣金融知識，金管局繼續舉辦公眾教育講座。2015年，共舉辦三場講座，約2,300名中學生及教師參與。講座主題包括聯繫匯率制度、香港紙幣、信用卡的智慧使用及存款保障計劃。自1998年推出以來，參與人數已超過54,700人。\n\n圖3 團體參訪資訊中心類型\n\n年輕的訪客在導覽員帶領下參觀資訊中心，了解香港貨幣及銀行業的發展。\n\n中學生及教師參與公共教育研討會。\n\n# 人力資源\n\n金管局招募、培訓及維持一支高專業水平的員工隊伍，以支持其政策目標，並靈活應對不斷變化的工作重點。雖然金管局是政府的重要組成部分，但它可以根據與公務員不同的條件聘用員工，以吸引具備適當經驗和專長的人才。作為一個公共機構，金管局致力維持精簡靈活的架構，並重新調配人力資源，以推動新計劃及應對增加的工作量。\n\n# 組織架構變動\n\n支付系統及儲值支付工具條例生效後，金管局於二零一五年十二月在貨幣管理部（MMD）下設立零售支付系統監管處，以履行其在儲值支付工具及其他零售支付系統的牌照事務及日常監管方面的法定職能。為加強部門間協同效應，並重新調整人力資源的優先順序，以應對新措施推行所帶來的挑戰，以及日益增加的工作量和工作複雜性，金管局於二零一五年擬定若干部門職務重組計劃，並於二零一六年年初實施。詳情如下：\n\n金融基建部（FiD）接管了存款保障計劃及結算職能，分別從法規部（ENFD）和貨幣處（MMD）處移交。此外，它還接管了銀行部門的部分銀行業相關工作，例如消費者教育、董事培訓和銀行從業員優化專業架構等；\n\n外事部接掌MMD的市場發展職能，而後者將繼續處理與財資市場公會及金融基準相關的工作。\n\n法規部接管了打擊清洗黑錢及金融罪行處，原隸屬於銀行業監督處，後改為法規及打擊清洗黑錢部。\n\n# 機構職能\n\n# 人力配置\n\n香港金融管理局（金管局）於2015年成立時的編制為841人。為確保有足夠資源應對（i）新法例及新措施的實施，（ii）持續進行已被證實必要的試行項目，以及（iii）現有工作的複雜性及工作量不斷增加，2016年編制增加34人，增至875人（增加4%）。新增職位將分配至以下職能：\n\n提升銀行及金融體系穩定，包括以下內容：\n\n加強銀行業監管工作，包括對銀行壓力測試程序的現場審查、落實國際銀行標準及進行同業評審；\n\n加強對銀行流動性風險及網絡保安風險管理的監管；\n\n實施有關透過銀行及核准貨幣經紀進行的場外衍生工具的監管制度，並遵守新生效的場外衍生工具匯報及備存紀錄規則；\n\n加強打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集活動的監管及執法工作。\n\n積極進行金融機構（處置機制）條例草案的規劃及準備工作，該草案應用國際標準來應對金融產業的「大而不倒」問題；\n\n透過發展一項為銀行獨立非執董而設的專業能力計劃，促進銀行體系的能力建設，進一步提升銀行治理水平，並與業界合作，推動銀行業從業員在銀行業核心運營領域的專業能力框架加強。\n\n加強銀行操守政策及新銀行業、證券和保險產品的研究能力；\n\n加強消費者保障及消費者教育工作；並\n\n加強對人民幣在岸市場及離岸市場的發展動向監控與分析，以支持香港離岸人民幣市場的有序運作。\n\n加強對未來基金設立及外匯基金投資產品進一步多元化所提供的投資、風險管理及法律支援，並提升策略性資產分布及投資流程，以應對日益嚴峻的投資環境。\n\n實施新的法定監管制度，賦權金管局根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》監管儲值支付工具和零售支付系統。\n\n\n# 機構職能\n\n調動暫時性資源以應對其他工作需求。金管局會調派員工至其他國際或本地機構，例如國際貨幣基金組織（基金組織）及金融發展局，以協助與香港或金管局有利益關係的活動或政策計劃。部分員工會以全職或兼職形式調派，為香港存款保障委員會及財資市場公會提供運作支援。\n\n# 薪酬政策與薪資審核機制\n\n財政司司長根據管治委員會的建議，透過外匯基金諮詢委員會決定金管局員工的薪酬及服務條件，並會考慮現行的市場薪酬水平及慣例。薪酬包括現金薪酬和公積金，實物福利則極少。現金薪酬包括每月固定薪金（或基本薪金）和變動薪金，變動薪金可根據表現，每年以一次過形式授予個別員工。\n\n金管局員工薪酬每年由財政司司長審閱，根據管治委員會透過外匯基金諮詢委員會向他提出的建議，並考慮管治委員會對金管局上一年度表現的評估、由獨立人力資源顧問進行的金融業薪酬調查結果及其他相關因素。有需要時，可就個別表現優異的員工作出特別薪酬調整，以維持其薪酬競爭力。\n\n任何已批准的固定薪酬或金管局的任何變動薪酬獎勵，均會根據員工的表現分配予個別員工。金管局的投資專業人士受變動薪酬制度約束，旨在加強其投資表現與薪酬獎勵之間的聯繫。對於助理總裁或以上職級的個別員工的薪酬調整或獎勵，由財政司司長根據管治委員會的建議批准。在討論其薪酬時，相關員工不會出席會議。對於職級為部門主管及以下的個別員工的薪酬調整或獎勵，由金管局總裁根據財政司司長授予的權力及在已批准的整體薪酬獎勵範圍內決定。\n"}

{"en":"# The Exchange Fund\n\nReport of the Director of Audit \nExchange Fund Financial Statements\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit\n\n# Audit Commission \n# The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region\n\n# Independent Audit Report\n\n# To the Financial Secretary\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (\"the Group\") set out on pages 134 to 222, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2015, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.\n\n# Monetary Authority’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66) and Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\n# Auditor’s Responsibility\n\nMy responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on my audit. I conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards. Those standards require that I comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.\n\nAn audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the Monetary Authority, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.\n\nI believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit (continued)\n\n# Opinion\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2015, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance.\n\nDavid Sun \nDirector of Audit\n\n7 April 2016\n\nAudit Commission \n26th Floor \nImmigration Tower \n7 Gloucester Road \nWanchai, Hong Kong\n\n# Contents\n\nINCOME AND EXPENDITURE ACCOUNT\nSTATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nBALANCE SHEET\nATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY\nATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:\n\n1.

The principal activities of the Fund are safeguarding the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong and maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong's monetary and financial systems.\n\nThe assets of the Fund are managed as four portfolios: the Backing Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio and the Strategic Portolio. The assets of the Backing Portolio fully match the Monetary Base, under Hong Kong's Currency Board system. The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The Long-Term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments. The Strategic Portfolio holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited acquired by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) for the account of the Fund for strategic purposes. Operating segment information is set out in note 31.\n\n# 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n# 2.1 Statement of compliance\n\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with all applicable Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRSs), which is a collective term that includes all applicable individual Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, Hong Kong Accounting Standards (HKASs) and Interpretations issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), and accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong. A summary of the significant accounting policies adopted by the Fund and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) is set out below.\n\nThe HKICPA has issued certain new and revised HKFRSs that are first effective or available for early adoption for the current accounting period. Note 3 provides information on the changes, if any, in accounting policies resulting from initial adoption of these developments to the extent that they are relevant to the Group for the current and prior accounting periods reflected in these financial statements.\n\n# Exchange Fund – Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)\n\n(Amounts expressed in millions of Hong Kong dollars, unless otherwise stated.)\n\n# 2.2 Basis of preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe Group financial statements include the financial statements of the Group as well as the Group's interests in associates and joint ventures. The principal activities of the principal subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are shown in notes 16 and 17.\n\nThe measurement basis used in the preparation of the financial statements is historical cost except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair values as explained in the accounting policies set out below:\n\ntrading financial instruments (note 2.6.2.1);\nfinancial assets and financial liabilities designated at fair value (note 2.6.2.2); available-for-sale securities (note 2.6.2.5);\ngold (note 2.11); and\ninvestment properties (note 2.12).\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with HKFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nNote 18 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of investment properties. Note 37 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of financial instruments. There are no critical accounting judgements involved in the application of the Group's accounting policies except for the valuation of certain financial instruments as set out in note 2.5.\n\n# 2.3 Subsidiaries and non-controlling interests\n\nA subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. When assessing whether the Group has power, only substantive rights (held by the Group and other parties) are considered.\n\n# Exchange Fund – Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)\n\n(Amounts expressed in millions of Hong Kong dollars, unless otherwise stated.)\n\nAn investment in a subsidiary is consolidated into the Group financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.\n\nIntra-group balances, transactions and cash flows and any unrealised profits and losses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in full in preparing the Group financial statements.\n\nNon-controlling interests represent the equity in a subsidiary not attributable directly or indirectly to the Fund, and in respect of which the Group has not agreed any additional terms with the holders of those interests which would result in the Group as a whole having a contractual obligation in respect of those interests that meets the definition of a financial liability. Non-controlling interests are presented in the Group balance sheet within equity, separately from equity attributable to the owner of the Fund. Non-controlling interests in the results of the Group are presented on the face of the Group income and expenditure account and the Group statement of comprehensive income as an allocation of the surplus or deficit and total comprehensive income or loss for the year between non-controlling interests and the owner of the Fund.\n\nIn the balance sheet of the Fund, its investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less impairment losses, if any (note 2.14).\n\n# 2.4 Associates and joint ventures\n\nAn associate is an entity in which the Group has significant influence, but not control or joint control, over its management, through its power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions.\n","terms":{"\"too big to fail\" problem":["大至不能倒問題"],"10 years plus Caring

外匯基金財務報表\n\n# 審計署署長報告\n\n# 審計署\n# 香港特別行政區政府\n\n# 獨立審計報告\n\n# 致 財政司司長\n\n本人謹此證明，我已審核《外匯基金》及其附屬公司（「本集團」）於頁數134至222所載的財務報表，該等財務報表包括《外匯基金》及本集團於2015年12月31日的資產負債表，以及截至該日止年度的收入及支出表、全面收益表、權益變動表及現金流量表，並附有重大的會計政策及其他說明性資料的摘要。\n\n# 金融管理專員之財務報表監控責任\n\n金融管理專員須根據行政長官根據《外匯基金條例》（第66章）第7條頒發的指示，以及香港財務報告準則，負責編製提供真實而公平觀點的財務報表，並制定金融管理專員認為必要以確保財務報表無重大錯誤陳述的內部控制措施，無論該等錯誤陳述是因欺詐還是錯誤所致。\n\n# 審計師的責任\n\n我的責任是根據審計對這些財務報表表達意見。我依照《外匯基金條例》第七條行政長官的指示以及審計署的審計準則進行審計。這些準則要求我遵守道德規範，並規劃和執行審計，以對財務報表是否不存在重大錯誤陳述獲得合理的保證。\n\n審計包括執行程序以取得關於財務報表中金額和披露事項的審計憑證。所選程序取決於審計師的判斷，包括對財務報表存在重大錯誤陳述風險的評估，無論是因舞弊還是錯誤所致。在進行這些風險評估時，審計師會考慮與實體編製提供真實而公平觀點的財務報表相關的內部控制，以設計適合情況的審計程序，但並非用於對實體內部控制的有效性發表意見。審計還包括評估所使用的會計政策的適當性以及金融管理專員所作出的會計估計的合理性，以及評估財務報表整體的呈報方式。\n\n我相信我所取得的審計憑證已足夠且恰當，足以作為我審計意見的依據。\n\n# 審計署署長報告（續）\n\n# 觀點\n\n我認為，財務報表真實而公平地反映了外匯基金及本集團於二零一五年十二月三十一日的財務狀況，以及彼等截至該日止年度的財務表現和現金流量，並已根據香港財務報告準則妥善編製，且符合根據《外匯基金條例》第7條行政長官指示所作出的規定。\n\n大衛·孫\n審計署署長\n\n2016年4月7日\n\n審計署\n26樓\n入境事務大樓\n告士打道7號\n灣仔，香港\n\n#

主要活動\n\n金融管理專員，根據財政司司長作為外匯基金控制人的授權（該基金），根據《外匯基金條例》（第66章）的規定管理該基金。該基金的主要職能是保障港幣的匯價，以及維持香港的貨幣及金融體系穩定和健全。\n\n本基金的資產被管理為四個組合：支持組合、投資組合、長期增長組合及策略性資產組合。支持組合的資產完全與香港的貨幣基礎相符，並在香港的貨幣發行局制度下運作。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債券及股市。長期增長組合持有私募股權及房地產投資。策略性資產組合持有香港交易及結算所有限公司股份，該股份由香港特別行政區政府為本基金的策略性目的而收購。經營分部資訊詳見附註31。\n\n#

合規聲明\n\n這些財務報表已根據所有適用香港財務報告準則（香港財務報告準則）編製，而香港財務報告準則是一個統稱，涵蓋所有適用的個別香港財務報告準則、香港會計準則（香港會計準則）及由香港會計師公會（香港會計師公會）發佈的解釋，以及香港公認的會計準則。基金及其附屬公司（統稱為本集團）所採納的重大會計政策摘要載列如下。\n\n香港會計師公會已頒佈若干新的及經修訂的香港財務報告準則，這些準則於當前會計期間首次生效或可供早期採用。附註3提供有關因首次採納這些發展而導致會計政策變動的資訊（如有），並說明這些變動在財務報表所反映的當前及過往會計期間內對本集團的相關性。\n\n# 外匯基金 – 財務報表附註（續）\n\n（除非另有說明，所有金額均以百萬港幣表示。）\n\n# 2.2 財務報表編製依據\n\n本集團的財務報表包括本集團本身的財務報表以及本集團於聯營公司和合營公司的權益。主要附屬公司、聯營公司和合營公司的主要業務活動於附註十六及十七中列示。\n\n編製財務報表所採用的計量基礎為原值成本法，惟下列資產及負債係按公允價值列示，詳情請參閱下述會計政策。\n\n交易用途的金融工具（附註2.6.2.1）；  \n指定以公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債（附註2.6.2.2）；可供出售證券（附註2.6.2.5）；  \n黃金（附註2.11）；及  \n投資物業（附註2.12）。\n\n編製符合香港財務報告準則的財務報表，需要管理層作出判斷、估計和假設，這些會影響政策的應用以及資產、負債、收入和支出的報告金額。這些估計和相關假設乃基於經驗及各種其他因素，而這些因素在當時情況下被認為是合理的，其結果構成判斷資產和負債賬面價值的基礎，而這些賬面價值並非容易從其他來源得知。實際結果可能與這些估計存在差異。\n\n會計估計及其相關假設會持續進行檢討。若會計估計的修訂僅影響當期，則該修訂應於修訂當期認列；若該修訂同時影響當期及未來期間，則應於修訂當期及未來期間認列。\n\n附註18載列有關投資物業公平值估計所用假設的資料。附註37載列有關金融工具公平值估計所用假設的資料。除附註2.5所述的某些金融工具計值外，應用本集團會計政策時並未涉及任何關鍵會計判斷。\n\n# 2.3 附屬公司及非控股權益\n\n附屬公司是由集團透過管控措施所控制的實體。集團對實體實施管控措施，係指集團因參與該實體而暴露於或享有來自該實體的變動回報，且能透過對該實體的控制權影響這些回報。在評估集團是否擁有控制權時，僅考慮實質性權利（由集團及其他各方所持有）。\n\n# 外匯基金 – 財務報表附註（續）\n\n（除非另有說明，所有金額均以百萬港幣表示。）\n\n對附屬公司的投資，自取得控制權之日起直至失去控制權之日止，均納入集團財務報表中。\n\n集團內各公司間的往來餘額、交易及現金流量，以及因集團內交易產生的任何未實現利潤及虧損，在編製集團財務報表時均全數抵銷。\n\n非控股權益代表附屬公司中不直接或間接歸屬於基金的權益，且集團與該等權益的持有人並未另行達成任何條款，致使集團整體對該等權益負有符合財務負債定義的合約義務。非控股權益在集團資產負債表內權益部分列示，與歸屬於基金所有者的權益分開列示。集團業績中的非控股權益在集團收支帳目及集團全面收益表中，作為將年度盈餘或虧損及總全面收益或虧損分配予非控股權益與基金所有者之項目。\n\n在基金的資產負債表中，其對附屬公司的投資按成本減去減值虧損列示（如有，請參閱附註2.14）。\n\n# 2.4 聯營公司及合營公司\n\n聯營企業是指集團對其管理具有重大影響，但不具控制權或共同控制權的實體，此影響係透過參與其財務及營運政策決策的權利而產生。\n"}

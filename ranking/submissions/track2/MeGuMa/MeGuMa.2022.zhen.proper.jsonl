{"zh":"2022年是迎難而上的一年。\n\n2022年伊始，全球經濟環境一片暗淡。新冠病毒變異株Omicron肆虐，令全球經濟增長繼續受壓，通脹壓力亦持續上升。其後俄羅斯與烏克蘭爆發衝突，進一步推高通脹壓力，導致各主要央行採取前置式貨幣緊縮政策，擴大環球金融市場的波動，並加劇經濟增長放緩的風險。本地方面，第五波疫情爆發，感染個案急速上升，亦進一步打擊經濟。同時，圍繞防疫措施與檢疫限制的負面報道，更令外界對香港產生誤解，威脅香港作為國際金融中心的聲譽。全年計，香港實質本地生產總值收縮了3.5%。\n\n儘管面對重重挑戰，金管局繼續致力保障香港貨幣與金融穩定，並於主要策略範疇推進多項有利發展的措施，進一步鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位。經歷3年的旅遊限制後，我們成功向國際社會展示香港已全面復常，旅客亦能再次親身訪港體驗。金管局在去年11月舉辦「國際金融領袖投資峰會」，來自世界各地的金融領袖親身來港出席。外界如此熱烈的反應，成為印證香港全面復常最好不過的證明。\n\n展望未來，外圍環境仍然充滿前所未有的不確定性。儘管如此，內地經濟重啟會為香港以至整個地區重新注入動力。金管局將繼續緊守崗位，履行維持香港貨幣與銀行體系穩定的職能，並積極尋求更多有利香港發展的機會，展現及提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。我們亦會繼續為提升全球氣候應變能力及可持續發展出力。今年除《二零二二年年報》外，我們會另外發表《二零二二年可持續發展報告》，以便更詳細地介紹金管局在提升香港作為綠色和可持續金融樞紐的地位所進行的各項工作，以及金管局作為負責任投資者及可持續機構所作出的努力。\n\n# 貨幣及金融體系：堅穩如昔\n\n聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）自1983年實施至今，歷經多個經濟周期，成功抵禦各種各樣的外來衝擊。2022年再次見證聯匯制度的抗震能力。在美國聯邦儲備局（聯儲局）大幅收緊貨幣政策下，弱方兌換保證於2022年5月至11月期間被觸發41次，金管局按照既定機制，以有序及具透明度的方式從市場買入合共2,421億港元。其間港元匯率及貨幣市場繼續運作暢順，反映聯匯制度穩健有效。\n\n這份對聯匯制度的信心，來自於建立多年的穩固根基。正如國際貨幣基金組織在其《2022年對外部門報告》中重申，聯匯制度的公信力建基於多項因素，包括具高透明度的運作規則、充裕的外匯儲備、審慎的財政制度、穩健的金融監管，以及靈活的經濟結構。\n\n我們深信除了穩健的機制外，致力與公眾及市場溝通以加深其對聯匯制度的了解、進行有效的市場監察，以及就不同情景作出應變計劃，均有助鞏固各界對聯匯制度的信心。我們就聯匯制度運作機制推出的社交媒體宣傳活動，有助在年內弱方兌換保證多次被觸發的情況下，有效維護市場對聯匯制度的信心。內部方面，金管局亦善用數據分析技術加強市場監察，讓我們能適時回應最新市場形勢。\n\n年內，儘管面對宏觀層面的挑戰以及遞增的信用風險，香港銀行體系仍然維持穩健，資本及流動性均非常充裕。2022年底，本地銀行的綜合總資本充足比率為20.1%，遠高於國際最低要求的8%。2022年第4季，大型銀行的流動性覆蓋比率稍升至162.3%，亦遠高於法定最低要求的100%。鑑於信貸環境面對挑戰，銀行體系的資產質素略為轉差，特定分類貸款比率於2022年底升至1.38%，但有關水平仍屬穩健，並低於2000年以來的長期平均水平1.8%。\n\n# 銀行體系：有效監管確保運作穩健\n\n疫情持續3年，來自各方面的挑戰均有所加劇，例如地緣政治緊張局勢升溫及主要央行收緊貨幣政策。然而，全賴多年來妥善的風險管理及有效的監管，香港銀行體系得以維持穩健，繼續發揮支持經濟的重要作用。\n\n過去一年面對的一項主要監管挑戰，是在第五波新冠疫情後經濟仍充滿不確定性之下，確保銀行繼續為客戶提供所需支援的同時，維持穩健的信用風險管理。「預先批核還息不還本」計劃進一步展期，並加入自願性部分本金還款選項，讓借款人可以選擇開始償還部分本金，協助客戶就最終回復正常還款作好準備。\n\n因應主要經濟體大幅收緊貨幣政策令市場波動加劇，2022年金管局另一項主要監管工作是加強監察銀行的市場及流動性風險承擔。我們深入評估各經濟體同步收緊貨幣政策對銀行可能產生的影響，並就壓力測試引入新情景，以評估銀行應對長時間流動性壓力的韌性。\n\n與此同時，我們繼續採取具前瞻性的措施，促進在多個範疇的有效風險管理。在運作穩健性及網絡防衛能力方面，我們提供指引協助銀行制定綜合及全面的運作架構，以達致穩健經營，並就銀行具體的運作範疇提供詳盡監管指引，例如因應雲端技術普及而就使用雲端運算提供指引。此外，因應數碼化加速發展，我們亦加強了應對「網絡釣魚」騙案和推進消費者及投資者保障的工作。\n\n除了維持銀行體系穩健外，金管局亦致力推動普及金融及提高銀行服務的便利性。銀行對於金管局就提供基本銀行服務的呼籲反應正面，有銀行在新發展地區的大型公共屋邨增設分行及自助銀行服務設施。受到疫情相關的旅遊限制影響，許多香港市民無法使用其內地銀行戶口。有見及此，金管局與有關各方緊密合作，協助重新啓動約50萬個內地銀行戶口，受影響戶口持有人無需親身前往內地辦理。\n\n另一個對銀行業持續發展具策略重要性的範疇是提升專業能力。為擴展業務，銀行業對專業人才的需求仍然龐大。金管局在其人才發展策略 — 「連接人才與未來」— 的基礎上，在過去一年推出多項措施，協助銀行業吸引、培育及挽留人才，集中提升及再培訓現有從業員的技能，以及培育年輕一代，以建立可持續的人才庫。\n\n# 國際金融中心：香港重回國際舞台!\n\n實施多時的疫情相關旅遊限制於2022年逐步撤銷，我們作出了多方面的努力讓香港重回國際舞台。11月舉行的「國際金融領袖投資峰會」吸引超過200位來自環球金融機構的國際及地區負責人親臨香港，並獲得全球各地的關注及熱切迴響。儘管峰會舉行日期不巧遇上50年來首個在11月份發出的8號颱風訊號，峰會仍然十分成功，向世界傳遞了香港已全面復常並正展現無比朝氣與活力的有力訊息。我們很高興看到峰會產生了正面的漣漪效應，不少環球金融機構及國際組織現正或計劃在香港舉辦各類活動。\n\n除吸引各地訪客重臨香港外，我和金管局的同事體會到面對面交流聯繫的重要性，因此盡可能親身代表香港出席主要國際會議，積極參與全球政策討論，並藉外訪機會與環球金融機構的集團管理層會面，加深他們對香港穩健的金融體系以及在「一國兩制」下香港提供的各種機遇的了解。\n\n為確保香港保持作為國際金融中心的競爭力，我們在金融科技、內地機遇，以及綠色和可持續金融等策略性重點領域不斷開拓市場新界限。我們亦進一步加強本港的金融平台，提供頂尖的服務，吸引更多企業落戶香港。有關金管局在綠色和可持續金融方面的工作詳情，請參閱《二零二二年可持續發展報告》。\n\n# 金融科技\n\n繼2021年6月公布「金融科技2025」策略，2022年我們在五大範疇均取得顯著進展。\n\n我們在「全面推展銀行數碼化」方面的工作取得理想成果。根據金融科技應用評估的結果，香港銀行業在不同業務領域廣泛採用金融科技，而且所採用的科技類別亦持續增加。我們自2017年以來逐步推廣及支持數碼化的工作獲銀行積極回應，並持續取得成果，成續令人鼓舞。我們將繼續與業界緊密合作，根據評估的結果，進一步推動金融科技在特定銀行業務領域的應用及促進個別科技類別的發展。\n\n年內我們在央行數碼貨幣方面的工作邁進重要的新里程。「多種央行數碼貨幣跨境網絡」(mBridge)項目進入試行階段，並成為全球其中一個率先為企業跨境交易進行真實結算的央行數碼貨幣項目。在零售層面，數字人民幣跨境使用的技術測試已進入第二階段，主要測試通過「轉數快」為數字人民幣錢包增值。數碼港元方面，我們將採取三軌道方式為將來可能發行數碼港元作好準備，並推出第二軌道先導計劃，邀請業界深入研究數碼港元可行的應用場景。\n\n數據可全面釋放金融科技的潛力。我們於去年10月推出的「商業數據通」正是提升香港數據基建的重要一步。作為以數據擁有人授權為本的共享數據基建，「商業數據通」能方便金融機構提取企業的商業數據，使企業（尤其中小型企業）更容易獲得融資。截至2022年底，「商業數據通」已促成超過1,000宗中小企貸款，總額逾19億港元。\n\n最後，我們在擁抱金融創新和它帶來的好處的同時，亦明白有必要監察及處理好相關發展可能帶來的風險。我們正密切注視虛擬資產領域的發展，並參與相關監管事宜的國際討論。經考慮公眾諮詢收集到的意見及相關國際標準後，我們將採納「相同風險，相同監管」1 的方式制定穩定幣的監管制度及界定其監管範圍。未來我們率先規管的對象將是那些標榜與一種或以上法定貨幣的價值掛鈎的穩定幣，因為這類穩定幣可能對貨幣及金融穩定帶來更高及更迫切的潛在風險。我們相信在訂立適當的規範下，業界將可更安全穩妥地開拓數碼金融的潛力。\n\n科技正重塑我們的未來。金管局與銀行業界正積極準備迎向這個「新常態」。我們有信心我們正構建的金融科技生態圈將有助全面釋放金融科技的潛力，並提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。\n\n#

challenges head-on.\n\nAt the beginning of 2022, the global economic environment was bleak. The Omicron variant of the COVID-19 virus raged, continuing to put pressure on global economic growth, while inflationary pressures continued to rise. Subsequently, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine broke out, further pushing up inflationary pressures, leading major central banks to adopt a hawkish monetary tightening policy, expanding volatility in global financial markets, and exacerbating the risk of slowing economic growth. Locally, the fifth wave of the epidemic broke out, with a rapid increase in cases, further impacting the economy. At the same time, negative reports surrounding epidemic prevention measures and quarantine restrictions further led to misunderstandings about Hong Kong from the outside world, threatening Hong Kong’s reputation as an international financial center. For the whole year, Hong Kong’s real GDP contracted by 3.5%.\n\nDespite facing numerous challenges, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to dedicate itself to safeguarding Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, and has advanced a number of beneficial measures across key strategic areas, further solidifying Hong Kong’s position as an international financial center. After three years of travel restrictions, we have successfully demonstrated to the international community that Hong Kong has fully returned to normal, and visitors can once again experience Hong Kong firsthand. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority hosted the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit in November last year, and financial leaders from around the world attended in person. This enthusiastic response from the outside world is the best proof of Hong Kong’s full resumption of normalcy.\n\nLooking ahead, the external environment remains fraught with unprecedented uncertainty. Nevertheless, Mainland China’s economic reopening will inject renewed impetus into Hong Kong and the entire region. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority will continue to fulfill its role in maintaining the stability of Hong Kong’s monetary and banking systems, and actively seek opportunities conducive to Hong Kong’s development, demonstrating and enhancing Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial center. We will also continue to contribute to enhancing global climate resilience and sustainable development. This year, in addition to the Annual Report 2022, we will publish the Sustainability Report 2022 to provide a more detailed introduction of the HKMA’s work in enhancing Hong Kong’s position as a green and sustainable finance hub, as well as the efforts made by the HKMA as a responsible investor and sustainable institution.\n\n# Monetary and Financial System: As Stable as Ever\n\nThe Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has been in place since 1983, enduring multiple economic cycles and successfully withstanding various external shocks. In 2022, the resilience of the LERS was once again demonstrated. Amid the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed)'s significant tightening of monetary policy, the weak-side exchange guarantee was triggered 41 times between May and November 2022. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) purchased a total of HKD 242.1 billion from the market in accordance with its established mechanism, in an orderly and transparent manner. During this period, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate and the money market continued to operate smoothly, reflecting the robustness and effectiveness of the LERS.\n\nThis confidence in the linked exchange rate system stems from a solid foundation built over many years. As reiterated in the International Monetary Fund’s External Sector Report 2022, the credibility of the linked exchange rate system is based on a number of factors, including transparent operating rules, ample foreign exchange reserves, prudent fiscal policies, sound financial regulation, and a flexible economic structure.\n\nWe firmly believe that, in addition to having a sound mechanism, efforts to communicate with the public and the market to enhance their understanding of the Linked Exchange Rate System, effective market surveillance, and contingency planning for different scenarios all contribute to strengthening confidence in the Linked Exchange Rate System. Our social media campaigns launched to promote understanding of the operational mechanisms of the Linked Exchange Rate System have helped effectively maintain market confidence in the system, even in situations where the weak-side exchange guarantee was triggered multiple times during the year. Internally, the HKMA has also made good use of data analytics technology to enhance market surveillance, enabling us to respond promptly to the latest market developments.\n\nThroughout the year, despite facing macro-level challenges and increasing credit risks, the Hong Kong banking system remained stable, with ample capital and liquidity. By the end of 2022, the comprehensive total capital adequacy ratio of local banks stood at 20.1%, significantly higher than the international minimum requirement of 8%. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the liquidity coverage ratio of major banks slightly increased to 162.3%, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 100%. Given the challenges in the credit environment, the quality of the banking system's assets slightly deteriorated, with the specific classification loan ratio rising to 1.38% by the end of 2022. However, this level remained stable and was below the long-term average of 1.8% since 2000.\n\n# Banking system: Effective regulation ensures stable operation.\n\nThe pandemic has persisted for three years, and challenges from various fronts have intensified, such as rising geopolitical tensions and the tightening of monetary policy by major central banks. However, thanks to prudent risk management and effective supervision over the years, the banking system in Hong Kong has remained resilient and continues to play a vital role in supporting the economy.\n\nOver the past year, a major regulatory challenge has been maintaining sound credit risk management while ensuring banks continue to provide the necessary support to their customers in the face of ongoing economic uncertainty following the fifth wave of COVID-19. The “pre-approved principal and interest moratorium” scheme has been further extended, and a voluntary partial principal repayment option has been added, allowing borrowers to choose to begin repaying part of their principal to help customers prepare for the eventual resumption of normal repayments.\n\nIn response to significant tightening of monetary policies by major economies leading to increased market volatility, another key regulatory task of the Financial Supervisory Service in 2022 is to strengthen the monitoring of banks’ market and liquidity risk bearing. We have thoroughly assessed the potential impact of synchronized monetary policy tightening across various economies on banks and introduced new scenarios for stress testing to evaluate banks’ resilience to prolonged liquidity stress.\n\nAt the same time, we continue to take forward-looking measures to promote effective risk management across various areas. Regarding operational resilience and cybersecurity capabilities, we provide guidance to assist banks in developing comprehensive and holistic operational frameworks to achieve sound operations, and offer detailed regulatory guidance on specific operational areas for banks, such as guidance on the use of cloud computing in response to the widespread adoption of cloud technology. Furthermore, in response to the accelerating pace of digitalization, we have also strengthened our work in combating “phishing” scams and promoting consumer and investor protection.\n\nIn addition to maintaining the stability of the banking system, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has also been committed to promoting financial inclusion and improving the convenience of banking services. Banks have responded positively to the HKMA's call for providing basic banking services. Some banks have set up branches and automated teller machine (ATM) facilities in large public housing estates in newly developed areas. Due to travel restrictions related to the pandemic, many Hong Kong residents have been unable to use their mainland bank accounts. In response, the HKMA has closely collaborated with relevant parties to restart approximately 500,000 mainland bank accounts, allowing affected account holders to do so without needing to visit mainland China in person.\n\nAnother strategically important area for the sustainable development of the banking industry is enhancing professional capabilities. As the industry continues to expand its operations, the demand for professional talent remains substantial. Building on its talent development strategy—Connecting Talent to the Future—the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) launched several initiatives over the past year to help the banking sector attract, cultivate, and retain talent. These measures focus on enhancing and retraining the skills of existing professionals, as well as nurturing the younger generation to build a sustainable talent pool.\n\n# International financial center: Hong Kong returns to the international stage!\n\nThe COVID-related travel restrictions, which had been in place for a long time, were gradually lifted in 2022, and we have made extensive efforts to bring Hong Kong back to the international stage. The “Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit” held in November attracted over 200 international and regional leaders from global financial institutions to visit Hong Kong in person, and received widespread attention and enthusiastic response from around the world. Despite the summit coinciding with the first No. 8 typhoon signal issued in November in 50 years, the summit was still very successful, conveying a strong message to the world that Hong Kong has fully returned to normal and is demonstrating unprecedented vitality. We are pleased to see that the summit has generated positive ripple effects, and many global financial institutions and international organizations are currently hosting or planning to host various events in Hong Kong.\n\nIn addition to attracting visitors from around the world to return to Hong Kong, my colleagues and I at the Hong Kong Monetary Authority have come to appreciate the importance of face-to-face communication. Therefore, we make every effort to personally represent Hong Kong at major international conferences, actively participate in global policy discussions, and use overseas visits to meet with senior management of global financial institutions, deepening their understanding of Hong Kong’s robust financial system and the various opportunities offered under the \"one country, two systems\" framework.\n\nTo ensure Hong Kong maintains its competitiveness as an international financial center, we continue to explore new market frontiers in strategic areas such as fintech, mainland opportunities, and green and sustainable finance. We are also further strengthening Hong Kong's financial platform to provide top-tier services and attract more companies to establish operations in Hong Kong. For details on the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's work in green and sustainable finance, please refer to the \"Sustainability Report 2022.\"\n\n# fintech\n\nFollowing the announcement of the \"Fintech 2025\" strategy in June 2021, we made significant progress across all five areas in 2022.\n\nOur work on the comprehensive digital transformation of banking has achieved ideal results. Based on the results of the fintech application assessment, the Hong Kong banking industry has widely adopted fintech across various business areas, and the number of technology categories adopted continues to grow. Our work on gradually promoting and supporting digitalization since 2017 has received active responses from banks and has continued to achieve results, with the progress being encouraging. We will continue to closely collaborate with the industry, based on the assessment results, to further promote the application of fintech in specific banking business areas and promote the development of individual technology categories.\n\nThis year, we have made significant progress in our work on central bank digital currencies. The Multiple CBDC Bridge (mBridge) project has entered the pilot phase and is among the first globally to facilitate real settlement for cross-border corporate transactions using central bank digital currencies. At the retail level, the technical testing of cross-border use of the digital RMB has entered its second phase, primarily testing the top-up of digital RMB wallets via Faster Payment System. Regarding the digital Hong Kong dollar, we will adopt a three-track approach to prepare for the possible future issuance of the digital Hong Kong dollar and launch the second-track pilot program, inviting industry to explore feasible application scenarios.\n\nData can fully unleash the potential of fintech. The \"Commercial Data Interchange\" we launched in October last year is a crucial step in enhancing Hong Kong's data infrastructure. As a shared data infrastructure based on data owner authorization, \"Commercial Data Interchange\" enables financial institutions to easily access enterprises' commercial data, making it easier for businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, to obtain financing. By the end of 2022, \"Commercial Data Interchange\" had facilitated over 1,000 SME loans with a total amount exceeding 1.9 billion HKD.\n\nFinally, while embracing financial innovation and its benefits, we also recognize the need to monitor and address the risks that such developments may bring. We are closely watching the developments in the virtual asset sector and participating in international discussions on related regulatory matters. After considering the opinions gathered from public consultations and relevant international standards, we will adopt the principle of \"same risk, same regulation\" to establish the regulatory framework for stablecoins and define their regulatory scope. In the future, our regulatory focus will first be on stablecoins that claim to be pegged to the value of one or more fiat currencies, as these stablecoins may pose higher and more urgent potential risks to monetary and financial stability. We believe that with appropriate regulations in place, the industry will be able to more safely and securely explore the potential of digital finance.\n\nTechnology is reshaping our future. The Monetary Authority and the banking industry are actively preparing to face this \"new normal.\" We are confident that the fintech ecosystem we are building will help fully unleash the potential of fintech and enhance Hong Kong's competitiveness as an international financial center.\n\n# Mainland opportunities\n"}

儲備管理\n\n2022年的投資環境異常動盪，多種資產類別的價格同時下挫，外匯基金錄得整體投資回報率為負4.5%，與市場上大部分多元資產基金的表現相比，虧損幅度相對溫和。\n\n金管局亦繼續致力推動負責任投資及資產多元化。與此同時，長期增長組合自2009年開展投資以來的內部回報率年率為12.6%。\n\n# 銀行體系穩定\n\n面對金融市場波動擴大，金管局加強對銀行的信用及市場風險管理的監管，並與銀行緊密合作，提升銀行的運作穩健性及網絡防衛能力，以應對網絡威脅持續增加及銀行業數碼轉型步伐加快的情況。\n\n金管局進一步推出有關「先買後付」產品及新增物業轉按支付安排的消費者保障措施。此外，金管局與其他監管機構合作制定虛擬資產監管架構，並就分銷投資產品發出指引及推出全新的信託業務監管制度。有關個人信貸資料的「多間信貸資料服務機構」模式下的「信貸資料平台」亦於年內啟用。\n\n金管局繼續與銀行合作提升香港的打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集（反洗錢）生態系統，並加強對騙案的回應措施，又透過「反洗錢合規科技實驗室」系列進一步推動數據與科技的應用，以及加快金管局就反洗錢工作採用監管科技的步伐。\n\n金管局在本地實施有關資本充足標準及披露標準等國際監管標準方面取得良好進展。金管局亦與銀行業共同為未來發展努力建立可持續的人才庫及提升從業員的技能。\n\n為確保香港備有具公信力的處置機制，金管局制定新處置標準，又進行地區危機模擬演習，並在所有具本地系統重要性銀行建立一層新的吸收虧損能力資源，為處置機制的發展立下重要的里程碑。\n\n# 香港的國際金融中心地位\n\n「國際金融領袖投資峰會」取得成功，鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位，並製造正面的漣漪效應。\n\n中國人民銀行與金管局之間的貨幣互換協議於年內優化，進一步鞏固香港作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位。金管局亦與其他監管機構及持份者合作，籌備開通「互換通」，及推出配合人民幣計價股票在港交易的雙櫃台莊家機制。另又致力發展債務工具中央結算系統成為亞洲區主要的國際中央證券託管平台。\n\n在加強香港金融平台的競爭力方面取得良好進展，涵蓋債券發行、資產及財富管理、企業財資中心，以及綠色和可持續金融等範疇。\n\n金管局亦繼續推行「金融科技2025」策略，促進金融業界採用金融科技，並提升香港作為金融科技樞紐的地位。快速支付系統「轉數快」隨着功能提升，使用量穩步增長。\n\n# 機構職能\n\n金管局透過不同渠道與社會及市場保持有效聯繫，提升公眾對金管局政策及工作的了解。\n\n對內，金管局悉心建立一支強調靈活應變及可持續發展的工作團隊，同時遵守嚴格的財政紀律及提升資訊科技能力，應對變化及確保有效執行各項政策及措施。\n","terms":{"12個月預期信用虧損":["12-month expected credit

financial environment\n\nHong Kong's economy significantly contracted in 2022 due to multiple adverse factors, including the fifth wave of the novel coronavirus pandemic, tightened financial conditions, and a challenging external environment. The labor market initially deteriorated before gradually improving, while inflation remained moderate. Benefiting from the full resumption of travel between mainland China and Hong Kong, Hong Kong's economic growth is expected to recover from a low base in 2023.\n\nHong Kong's banking system remained stable in 2022, with ample capital and liquidity, and asset quality remained healthy.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nAs the United States tightened its monetary policy, the Hong Kong dollar weakened, and the weak-side exchange rate guarantee was triggered multiple times this year. However, the Hong Kong dollar’s foreign exchange and money markets continued to operate smoothly and orderly, repeatedly demonstrating the stability and effectiveness of the linked exchange rate system.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\nThe investment environment in 2022 was exceptionally volatile, with prices across various asset classes declining simultaneously. The foreign exchange fund recorded an overall investment return of negative 4.5%, a relatively mild loss compared to the performance of most multi-asset funds in the market.\n\nThe Monetary Authority also continues to strive for promoting responsible investment and asset diversification. At the same time, the long-term growth portfolio has achieved an annualized internal rate of return of 12.6% since the commencement of investments in 2009.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nFacing increased volatility in financial markets, the Financial Supervisory Commission is strengthening its oversight of banks' credit and market risk management and working closely with banks to enhance their operational resilience and cybersecurity capabilities, in response to the continuing rise in cyber threats and the accelerating pace of digital transformation in the banking sector.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has further introduced consumer protection measures related to \"Pay Later\" products and new arrangements for refinancing mortgages. In addition, the HKMA has collaborated with other regulatory bodies to establish a regulatory framework for virtual assets, issued guidance on the distribution of investment products, and introduced a new regulatory regime for trust businesses. The \"Credit Reference Platform\" under the \"Multiple Credit Reference Agencies\" model for personal credit information was also launched during the year.\n\nThe HKMA continues to collaborate with banks to enhance Hong Kong's anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML) ecosystem, and strengthen response measures against fraud. It also promotes the application of data and technology, as well as accelerates the adoption of regulatory technology in AML work, through the series of \"AML Regtech Lab\".\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has made good progress in implementing international regulatory standards related to capital adequacy and disclosure standards locally. The HKMA also works together with the banking industry to strive for establishing a sustainable talent pool for future development and enhancing employees' skills.\n\nTo ensure Hong Kong has credible resolution mechanisms, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has formulated new resolution standards, conducted regional crisis simulation exercises, and established a new layer of loss-absorbing capacity resources at all banks of local systemic importance, marking an important milestone in the development of resolution mechanisms.\n\n# Hong Kong's Status as an International Financial Center\n\nThe Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit was a success, consolidating Hong Kong’s position as an international financial center and creating positive ripple effects.\n\nThe monetary swap agreement between the People's Bank of China and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority was enhanced during the year, further solidifying Hong Kong’s position as a global offshore RMB business hub. The HKMA also collaborated with other regulatory bodies and stakeholders to prepare for the launch of Swap Connect and to introduce a dual counter mechanism to support the trading of RMB-denominated stocks in Hong Kong. Additionally, efforts are being made to develop the debt instrument central settlement system into a major international central securities depository platform in Asia.\n\nSignificant progress has been made in enhancing the competitiveness of Hong Kong's financial platform, covering areas such as bond issuance, asset and wealth management, corporate treasury centres, as well as green and sustainable finance.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to implement the Fintech 2025 strategy to promote fintech adoption by the financial sector and enhance Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub. The Faster Payment System, FPS, has seen steady growth in usage as its features improve.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nThe Monetary Authority maintains effective communication with society and the market through various channels to enhance the public's understanding of its policies and work.\n\nInternally, the Financial Supervisory Commission has diligently established a work team emphasizing flexibility, adaptability, and sustainable development, while adhering to strict financial discipline and enhancing information technology capabilities, to respond to changes and ensure the effective implementation of various policies and measures.\n"}

{"zh":"# 2023年工作重點及前瞻\n\n儘管香港經濟在2023 年初出現復甦跡象，但外圍環境仍然充滿挑戰及不確定性。近期美國和歐洲的銀行業受壓，個別美國本土銀行在2023 年3 月倒閉，對環球金融市場造成漣漪效應，而主要央行收緊貨幣政策，很有可能令2023 年全球經濟增長放緩甚或衰退。另一方面，地緣政治局勢緊張，以及去全球化的威脅持續，可能會繼續拖累全球貿易，並會令環球金融市場不時出現波動。儘管如此，香港金融體系憑藉多年來所建立穩健的抗震能力及充裕的緩衝，有足夠能力抵禦不利衝擊。\n\n金管局非常重視保障貨幣及金融穩定。展望未來，面對不明朗的宏觀經濟環境，金管局會保持警惕，力求迅速辨識正浮現的風險，並靈活應對。與此同時，金管局會繼續把握機遇及創造政策空間，進一步提升香港作為主要國際金融中心的地位。面對充滿挑戰的投資環境，金管局在管理外匯基金時會繼續審慎投資，同時保持足夠靈活性，按需要採取防禦措施，並維持高流動性。\n\n# 金融體系保持穩定健全\n\n環球經濟前景仍受制於重大的不確定因素。金管局會密切注視最新發展，提高警覺，防範各種潛在風險，以維持金融體系穩定健全；這是關乎持續提供關鍵金融服務的先決條件，因此亦是維繫香港經濟正常運作的命脈。\n\n# 對潛在風險保持警惕\n\n在2023年，美國利率未來走勢的不確定性，以及在先進經濟體銀行體系出現的壓力，可能會對主要先進經濟體的增長前景帶來下行風險。此外，持續的地緣政治風險，可能會繼續拖累全球貿易，並會令環球金融市場不時出現波動。然而，香港金融體系憑藉過去多年所建立的抗震能力及緩衝，有足夠能力抵禦不利衝擊。金管局亦有能力、資源及決心維持香港貨幣及金融穩定。\n\n金管局將繼續密切注視本地及外圍環境的風險與脆弱性，並會按需要採取適當措施維持香港的貨幣及金融體系穩定。金管局亦會研究對香港經濟有影響的事項，以及評估與這些事項相關的潛在風險。\n\n# 保持銀行體系穩定\n\n鑑於地緣政治緊張局勢升級，以及各主要央行大幅加息以遏抑通脹，預計2023年銀行業的經營環境仍然充滿挑戰。另一方面，科技發展迅速及數碼化對銀行業來說既有危又有機。面對瞬息萬變的金融環境，金管局致力透過持續的監管工作確保銀行具足夠能力抵禦衝擊。與此同時，金管局亦會參照國際標準及最佳做法，繼續加強及優化銀行監管架構與政策。\n\n# 風險為本的監管重點\n\n# 信用、流動性及市場風險\n\n在2023年，金管局將繼續密切注視認可機構的資產質素，並聚焦於認可機構的貸款分類及撥備做法，以及對財務狀況較差的借款人的管理。金管局亦會加強其監察系統，並採取積極措施確保銀行體系的整體信用風險水平維持可控。\n\n另一方面，金管局會繼續留意企業的營運環境，並與銀行業及商界保持緊密溝通，以就最終退出「預先批核還息不還本」計劃作好準備，並同時確保暫時面對困難的客戶仍然得到適切的信貸支援。\n\n此外，面對不明朗的宏觀經濟環境，金管局於2023年亦會加強監管認可機構的流動性及市場風險管理。\n\n# 業務操作及科技風險\n\n隨着銀行在業務營運中更廣泛應用科技，金管局會致力提升銀行業的運作穩健性及網絡防衛能力。繼5月發出《監管政策手冊》新單元「運作穩健性」後，金管局會與業界保持緊密聯繫，審視認可機構在制定運作穩健性框架方面的進度。同時，金管局將透過跟進認可機構在「網絡防衛評估框架2.0」評估下發現的問題以及檢視認可機構實施穩固三重數據備份的進展，提高銀行業的網絡防衛能力。\n\n隨着數碼化的步伐加快，金管局的其他監管重點包括加強對銀行的第三方服務供應商風險管理的監管，以及提升銀行業的數據管治能力。\n\n# 打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集\n\n在2023年，金管局的工作重點包括更新監管資訊、加強打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集（反洗錢）生態系統各持份者的合作以應對洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集（洗錢）風險，以及進一步推動反洗錢監管科技與合規科技的發展。金管局的《打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集指引》亦會作出修訂，並會就「政治人物」採取與風險相稱的措施發出具體指引，從而促進業界以有效及風險為本的方法落實法例的主要修訂。與此同時，金管局會擴大現有公私營夥伴合作的涵蓋範圍以加強訊息共享，以及支持推出銀行之間的訊息共享平台，藉以加快偵測可疑戶口及防範戶口被濫用，並加強對騙案受害人的保障和協助受害人追討損失。金管局亦會透過「反洗錢合規科技實驗室」及其他反洗錢合規科技項目，進一步集中推動採用合規科技（包括數據分析），並致力發展宏觀分析能力，以配合其數據為本的反洗錢監管工作。透過實施上述各項措施，金管局將能更迅速針對傀儡戶口網絡等系統性洗錢風險採取相應措施，以及靈活應對不斷轉變的威脅。\n\n# 財富管理業務\n\n金管局在2023年會加強有關認可機構在財富管理以及銷售證券、強制性公積金（強積金）與其他投資及保險產品方面的操守的現場審查及非現場監察。2023年的重點將會是「跨境理財通」計劃、數碼分銷及諮詢平台、虛擬資產、環境、社會及管治(ESG)投資產品及長期保險產品。金管局在有關過程中會參考市場最新發展及國際標準的修訂。\n\n金管局亦會與其他監管機構及銀行界緊密聯繫，並按需要就銷售投資、保險及強積金產品的監管標準向認可機構提供指引，其中亦會包括有關提供虛擬資產相關投資服務的指引。就此而言，為促進虛擬資產行業可持續及負責任地發展，金管局會積極參與相關國際組織，並與政府及其他金融監管機構合作，制定全面的虛擬資產監管架構。\n\n隨着「跨境理財通」順利推出，金管局會與業界及相關監管機構聯繫，以優化該計劃。此外，金管局亦會與證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）及業界合作，精簡投資產品銷售程序（包括適用於資深投資者的銷售程序），以及開始根據相關《監管政策手冊》新單元及新營運守則監管認可機構的信託業務。\n\n# 監察金融市場基建\n\n金管局的目標是按照《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（《支付條例》）、《金融市場基建的原則》（《基建原則》），以及支付及金融基建委員會發出的各項指引促進其所監察的金融市場基建的安全及效率，按需要參照最新的國際標準評估各項基建。金管局會參與支付及金融基建委員會與國際證監會組織對實施《基建原則》的監察及評估計劃，亦會參與國際標準制定組織的工作，並參照國際慣例或因應市場及科技發展加強本身的監察規定。同時，如有需要，金管局會與有關當局合作，進一步加強合作監察安排。\n\n# 制定政策\n\n金管局會因應國際標準及最佳做法，繼續加強及優化銀行監管架構與政策。\n\n# 在香港實施巴塞爾標準\n\n# 資本標準\n\n金管局會透過實施巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（巴塞爾委員會）近年發布的標準，進一步優化資本框架，當中包括：\n- 2017年12月《巴塞爾協定三：危機後改革的最終方案》、2019年1月（2019年2月修訂）《市場風險最低資本規定》，以及2020年7月《信用估值調整風險架構具針對性的修訂》所載的經修訂資本標準 — 上述經修訂資本標準統稱《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案，載明信用風險、市場風險、信用估值調整風險及業務操作風險的新監管處理方法，並引入出項下限規定，以及優化槓桿比率框架。經過2022年的多輪業界諮詢後，金管局計劃在2023年就《銀行業（資本）規則》（《資本規則》）的建議修訂進行法定諮詢，以實施上述各項規定及正值中性逆周期緩衝資本。有關修訂預計於同年內提交立法會進行先訂立後審議程序，並不早於2024年1月1日生效，作為最低要求。\n- 2022年12月《加密資產風險承擔的審慎處理方法》金管局計劃按照巴塞爾委員會的時間表，在2025年1月1日於本地實施有關標準，並打算於2023年就相關建議諮詢業界。\n\n# 風險承擔限度\n\n金管局於2023年3月就《銀行業（風險承擔限度）規則》的建議修訂諮詢業界。有關建議修訂主要是因應金管局實施上文提及的《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案下的經修訂資本標準而提出。諮詢文件亦包括就《資本規則》下有關官方實體集中風險的處理方法所作出的其他相應修訂。經修訂規則的目標實施日期將與落實《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案的經修訂《資本規則》中的信用風險部分的實施日期一致（即不早於2024年1月1日）。\n\n# 流動性標準\n\n金管局擬於2023年諮詢業界有關透過《2023年銀行業（流動性）（修訂）規則》（《2023年流動性修訂規則》）對《銀行業（流動性）規則》作出的建議修訂。相關修訂是因應同時期的《資本規則》建議修訂而作出，所以《2023年流動性修訂規則》的目標實施日期將與落實《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案的經修訂《資本規則》中的信用風險部分的實施日期一致（即不早於2024年1月1日）。\n\n# 披露標準\n\n《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案中與經修訂資本標準相關的新的及經修訂的披露規定，主要載於巴塞爾委員會分別於2018年12月及2021年11月發出的《第三支柱1 披露規定 — 更新框架》及《修訂市場風險披露規定》。巴塞爾委員會亦於2019年6月發出《修訂槓桿比率披露規定》，藉修訂槓桿比率的披露規定處理對潛在「粉飾櫥窗」（指銀行在報告日期前後減少某些交易的交易量，從而人為地提高報告及公開披露的槓桿比率）的關注。為在香港實施上述新的及經修訂的披露規定，金管局亦正擬備《銀行業（披露）規則》（《披露規則》）的相應修訂，以及經修訂後的標準披露模版及表格，並在過程中徵詢業界意見。預計《披露規則》的修訂將於2023年內連同《資本規則》的修訂一併提交立法會進行先訂立後審議程序。\n","terms":{"12個月預期信用虧損":["12-month

Prospects\n\nDespite signs of economic recovery in Hong Kong at the beginning of 2023, the external environment remains challenging and uncertain. Recent pressures on the banking sectors in the United States and Europe, including the collapse of several US-based banks in March 2023, have sent ripple effects through global financial markets. Simultaneously, the tightening of monetary policy by major central banks could likely slow global economic growth, potentially leading to a recession in 2023. On the other hand, ongoing geopolitical tensions and the persistent threat of deglobalization may continue to weigh on global trade and cause volatility in global financial markets. Nevertheless, Hong Kong’s financial system, bolstered by the resilience and ample buffers built up over the years, possesses sufficient capacity to withstand adverse shocks.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority places great emphasis on ensuring monetary and financial stability. Looking ahead, facing an uncertain macroeconomic environment, the HKMA will remain vigilant, striving to quickly identify emerging risks and respond flexibly. At the same time, the HKMA will continue to seize opportunities and create policy space to further enhance Hong Kong's position as a major international financial center. Facing a challenging investment environment, the HKMA will continue to invest prudently in managing the foreign exchange fund, while maintaining sufficient flexibility, taking defensive measures as needed, and maintaining high liquidity.\n\n# The financial system remains stable and sound.\n\nThe global economic outlook remains subject to significant uncertainties. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority will closely monitor the latest developments, remain vigilant, and guard against various potential risks to maintain the stability and soundness of the financial system; this is a prerequisite for continuously providing essential financial services, and therefore the lifeline for sustaining Hong Kong’s normal economic operation.\n\n# Remain vigilant about potential risks.\n\nIn 2023, the uncertainty surrounding future interest rate movements in the United States, as well as pressures emerging in the banking systems of advanced economies, may pose downside risks to the growth prospects of major advanced economies. Furthermore, persistent geopolitical risks may continue to weigh on global trade and cause volatility in global financial markets. However, Hong Kong’s financial system, with the resilience and buffers built up over the past few years, has ample capacity to withstand adverse shocks. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority also has the ability, resources, and determination to maintain monetary and financial stability.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority will continue to closely monitor the risks and vulnerabilities in the local and external environments, and will take appropriate measures as necessary to maintain the stability of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems. The HKMA will also study matters that affect the Hong Kong economy, and assess the potential risks associated with these matters.\n\n# Maintain the stability of the banking system\n\nGiven the escalating geopolitical tensions and significant interest rate hikes by major central banks to curb inflation, the operating environment for the banking sector is expected to remain challenging in 2023. On the other hand, rapid technological development and digitalization present both opportunities and risks for the banking sector. Facing a rapidly changing financial environment, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is committed to ensuring banks have sufficient capacity to withstand shocks through continuous regulatory efforts. At the same time, the HKMA will continue to enhance and refine the banking regulatory framework and policies by referring to international standards and best practices.\n\n# Risk-Based Supervisory Focus\n\n# Credit, liquidity, and market risk\n\nIn 2023, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will continue to closely monitor the asset quality of authorized institutions, focusing on their loan classification and provisioning practices, as well as the management of borrowers with weaker financial conditions. The HKMA will also strengthen its surveillance systems and take proactive measures to ensure that the overall credit risk levels in the banking system remain under control.\n\nOn the other hand, the Monetary Authority will continue to monitor the operating environment of enterprises and maintain close communication with the banking sector and the business community in preparation for the eventual withdrawal from the \"pre-approved interest-only repayment\" scheme, while at the same time ensuring that customers temporarily facing difficulties still receive appropriate credit support.\n\nIn addition, facing an uncertain macroeconomic environment, the Monetary Authority will also strengthen the supervision of liquidity and market risk management for authorized institutions in 2023.\n\n# Operational and technology risk\n\nAs banks increasingly adopt technology in their business operations, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is committed to enhancing the operational resilience and cyber resilience of the banking sector. Following the issuance of the new section \"Operational Resilience\" in the Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) in May, the HKMA will maintain close communication with the industry to review the progress of authorized institutions in developing their operational resilience frameworks. At the same time, the HKMA will enhance the banking sector's cyber resilience by following up on issues identified in the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 assessments and reviewing the progress of authorized institutions in implementing robust triple data backup measures.\n\nAs the pace of digitization accelerates, the Monetary Authority's other regulatory priorities include enhancing supervision of banks' third-party service providers' risk management and improving the data governance capabilities of the banking sector.\n\n# Anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA's key priorities include updating regulatory information, strengthening collaboration among stakeholders in the AML\/CFT ecosystem to address ML\/TF risks, and further promoting the development of AML regulatory technology and compliance technology. The HKMA will also revise its \"Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism\" and issue specific guidance on \"PEP\" in line with risk-based measures, thereby promoting the implementation of legislative amendments by the industry through effective and risk-based approaches. At the same time, the HKMA will expand the scope of its existing public-private partnership to enhance information sharing, and support the establishment of an information-sharing platform among banks to accelerate the detection of suspicious accounts and prevent account misuse, as well as strengthen protection and assistance for victims of fraud. The HKMA will also further promote the adoption of compliance technology (including data analysis) through the \"AML Regtech Lab\" and other AML compliance technology initiatives, and strive to develop macro analytical capabilities to support its data-driven AML regulatory work. Through the implementation of the aforementioned measures, the HKMA will be able to more swiftly take appropriate actions against systemic ML\/TF risks such as puppet account networks, and flexibly respond to evolving threats.\n\n# Wealth management services\n\nThe HKMA will strengthen on-site inspections and off-site supervision of authorized institutions regarding their conduct in wealth management, as well as the sale of securities, Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF), and other investment and insurance products in 2023. The key areas of focus in 2023 will be the \"Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect\" program, digital distribution and advisory platforms, virtual assets, environmental, social and governance (ESG) investment products, and long-term insurance products. During this process, the HKMA will take into account the latest market developments and revisions to international standards.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will also maintain close communication with other regulatory bodies and the banking sector, and provide guidance to authorized institutions on regulatory standards for the sale of investment, insurance, and mandatory provident fund products, which will also include guidance on providing investment services related to virtual assets. In this regard, to promote the sustainable and responsible development of the virtual asset industry, the HKMA will actively participate in relevant international organizations and collaborate with the government and other financial regulators to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for virtual assets.\n\nWith the successful launch of the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will liaise with the industry and relevant regulatory authorities to optimize the program. Additionally, the HKMA will collaborate with the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the industry to streamline the sales procedures for investment products (including those applicable to sophisticated investors), as well as begin regulating the trust businesses of authorized institutions in accordance with the new sections and new operational guidelines in the relevant Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM).\n\n# Supervise Financial Market Infrastructure\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s objective is to promote the safety and efficiency of the financial market infrastructures it supervises, in accordance with the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (Payment Systems Ordinance), the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMI), and various guidelines issued by the Payments and Financial Market Infrastructures Committee, and to assess various infrastructures by referring to the latest international standards as needed. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority will participate in the Payments and Financial Market Infrastructures Committee and the International Organization of Securities Commissions’ monitoring and assessment plan for the implementation of the PFMI, and will also participate in the work of international standard-setting organizations, and strengthen its supervisory regulations by referring to international practices or in response to market and technological developments. At the same time, if necessary, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will cooperate with relevant authorities to further strengthen cooperative supervisory arrangements.\n\n# Formulate policies\n\nThe Monetary Authority will continue to strengthen and optimize the banking regulatory framework and policies in accordance with international standards and best practices.\n\n# Implementing Basel Standards in Hong Kong\n\n# Capital Standard\n\nThe HKMA will further optimize the capital framework by implementing standards issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) in recent years, including:  \n- Revised capital standards contained in the December 2017 Basel III: Finalising Post-crisis Reforms, the January 2019 (February 2019 revision) Minimum Capital Requirements for Market Risk, and the July 2020 Targeted Revisions to the Credit Valuation Adjustment Risk Framework. These revised capital standards are collectively referred to as the Basel III Final Reforms, which outline new regulatory approaches for credit risk, market risk, credit valuation adjustment risk, and operational risk, and introduce a floor requirement as well as an optimized leverage ratio framework. Following multiple rounds of industry consultations in 2022, the HKMA plans to conduct a statutory consultation on proposed revisions to the Banking (Capital) Rules (Capital Rules) in 2023 to implement the aforementioned requirements and the countercyclical buffer capital with a positive neutral stance. The proposed revisions are expected to be submitted to the Legislative Council for the pre-legislative consultation process during the same year and will not take effect before January 1, 2024, as a minimum requirement.  \n- The HKMA plans to implement the Prudential Treatment of Cryptoasset Exposures standard in accordance with the Basel Committee's timeline, locally on January 1, 2025, and intends to conduct industry consultations on the related proposals in 2023.\n\n# exposure limits\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) consulted the industry in March 2023 on proposed amendments to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules. These proposed amendments were primarily made in response to the revised capital standards under the final reform package of Basel III. The consultation document also included other corresponding amendments regarding the handling of concentration risk related to official entities under the Capital Rules. The target implementation date for the revised rules will align with the implementation date of the credit risk portion of the revised Capital Rules under the final reform package of Basel III (i.e., no earlier than January 1, 2024).\n\n# Liquidity Standard\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) intends to consult the industry in 2023 on proposed amendments to the Banking (Liquidity) Rules through the Banking (Liquidity) (Amendment) Rules 2023 (BLAR 2023). These amendments are made in response to the proposed revisions to the Capital Rules, so the implementation date of BLAR 2023 will align with the implementation date of the credit risk portion of the revised Capital Rules under the Basel III final reforms (i.e., no earlier than January 1, 2024).\n\n# Disclosure Standards\n\nThe new and revised disclosure requirements related to the revised capital standards under the final reform proposals of Basel III are primarily set out in two documents issued by the Basel Committee: the \"Third Pillar 1 Disclosure Requirements – Updated Framework\" issued in December 2018 and the \"Revisions to Market Risk Disclosure Requirements\" issued in November 2021. The Basel Committee also issued the \"Revisions to Leverage Ratio Disclosure Requirements\" in June 2019, aiming to address concerns about potential \"window-dressing\" (referring to banks reducing certain transaction volumes before or after the reporting date to artificially inflate reported and publicly disclosed leverage ratios). To implement the aforementioned new and revised disclosure requirements in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is also preparing corresponding revisions to the \"Banking (Disclosure) Rules\" (Disclosure Rules), as well as revised standard disclosure templates and forms, while consulting industry stakeholders throughout the process. The revised Disclosure Rules are expected to be submitted to the Legislative Council for pre-legislative scrutiny together with revisions to the Capital Rules in 2023.\n"}
{"zh":"# 機構管治\n\n金管局作為香港的中央銀行機構，深明良好的管治對維持及維護公眾對金管局履行其法定職責的信任及信心的重要性，因此一直致力秉持高水平的機構管治。\n\n為實踐良好機構管治的承諾，金管局：\n- 建立了一套清晰且具備高問責性的機構管治架構；\n- 實施完善穩健的監控措施以管理風險，並確保所有職級員工的行為及其日常運作均符合指定標準；及\n- 奉行具透明度及保持開放的政策，與各持份者保持緊密聯繫。\n\n# 金管局與香港特別行政區政府\n\n金管局是香港特別行政區政府（特區政府）架構的一部分，但可以按與公務員不同的聘用條款聘請員工，以吸引具適當經驗與專門知識的人才。金管局總裁及其員工均為公職人員。金管局的日常運作，在金融管理專員所獲賦予或轉授的法定權力範圍內高度自主。\n\n財政司司長負責釐定香港的貨幣政策目標及貨幣體制：財政司司長於2003年6月25日致金融管理專員的函件中，訂明應透過貨幣發行局制度維持貨幣穩定，將港元匯率保持在約7.80港元兌1美元的水平。金融管理專員須自行負責達成貨幣政策目標，包括決定有關的策略、工具及執行方式，並負責維持香港貨幣制度的穩定與健全。\n\n財政司司長在財經事務及庫務局局長的協助下，負責維持香港金融體系穩定與健全，以及保持香港的國際金融中心地位的政策。為推行這些政策，金融管理專員的職責包括：\n- 促進銀行體系的整體穩定與有效運作；\n- 與其他有關機構與組織合作，發展債務市場；\n- 處理與法定紙幣及硬幣的發行及流通有關的事宜；\n- 透過發展支付、結算及交收系統，以及在適當情況下負責操作有關系統，促進金融基建的安全與效率；及\n- 與其他有關機構與組織合作，促進對香港貨幣及金融體系的信心，並推行適當的發展市場措施，以協助加強香港金融服務的國際競爭力。\n\n外匯基金由財政司司長掌有控制權。金融管理專員須根據財政司司長轉授的權力，就外匯基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 問責性與透明度\n\n就日常運作及推行政府政策目標所採用的方法，金管局一直保持高度自主，並同時輔以高問責性及透明度。\n\n金管局致力促進貨幣與銀行體系穩定，有效管理官方儲備，發展與監察穩健及多元化的金融基建，從而鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位，推動香港經濟發展。\n\n金管局要有效履行職責，便必須取得社會人士的信任。因此，金管局以嚴謹的態度，履行向公眾解釋其政策及工作的責任，並盡力處理備受社會關注而涉及金管局職責範圍的事項。尤其，金管局透過傳統及社交媒體適時澄清有關金管局政策的失實資訊及謠言。\n\n金融管理專員由財政司司長委任，因此金管局透過財政司司長向公眾負責；而由於金管局的職權由立法會通過的法律制訂，因此金管局亦透過立法會向公眾負責。金管局亦明白本身肩負更廣泛的責任，就是促進公眾對金管局角色及目標的認識，並密切留意社會人士所關注的事項。金管局在執行日常工作及與社會保持廣泛聯繫時，堅守盡力提高透明度及保持開放的政策。這項政策有兩大目標：\n- 在顧及市場敏感性、商業秘密及機密資料披露的法定限制下，盡量使金融界及公眾充分了解金管局的工作；及\n- 確保金管局掌握社會脈搏，並對公眾意見作出適當回應。\n\n金管局在透明度方面致力達致國際最高標準，與傳媒保持廣泛聯繫之餘，亦出版各種中英文期刊及專題刊物。金管局的雙語網站(www.hkma.gov.hk)除有專門環節列載經濟研究、統計資料、監管資源、消費者資訊及其他課題外，還載有大量金管局出版的刊物、新聞稿、演辭及簡報會資料文件。此外，金管局又利用社交媒體平台，以能在數碼時代中更有效與公眾溝通。金管局辦事處設有資訊中心，分為圖書館及展覽館兩部分，每星期開放6日予公眾參觀及使用。有關金管局與公眾溝通及聯繫的工作，詳見「機構職能」一章（第157至162頁）。\n\n金管局公布外匯基金及貨幣發行局帳目資料的次數，一直逐步增加，內容亦越趨詳細。金管局於1999年開始參與國際貨幣基金組織的中央銀行「數據公布特殊標準」計劃。金管局亦公布外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下貨幣發行委員會的會議紀錄，以及貨幣發行局制度運作報告。自1996年起，金管局網站載有銀行業監管政策及指引。\n\n金管局與立法會的關係對提高問責性及透明度非常重要。金管局總裁承諾每年3次向立法會財經事務委員會簡報金管局各項工作及政策，並回答有關查詢。此外，金管局代表不時出席立法會事務委員會及小組委員會會議，闡釋及商討特別事項，以及協助議員審閱條例草案。\n\n# 監控措施\n\n金管局採用穩健有效的內部及外部監控機制，確保秉持高水平的員工操守、審慎的風險管理，以及適當的制衡。內部及外部審計職能就監控機制是否足夠及具成效提供獨立評估。\n\n# 行為守則\n\n《行為守則》就員工的道德與法律責任提供指引，確保所有職級員工的行為均符合指定標準。\n\n# 內部監控\n\n# 運作監控\n\n作為風險管理的第一度防線，所有部門及分處均有責任評估其工作流程的風險，並制定適當的監控措施，確保金管局日常運作穩妥。\n\n# 機構風險管理\n\n風險管理亦在機構層面進行。由金管局總裁擔任主席的風險委員會，是機構風險管理架構的基石之一。\n\n風險委員會審視和商討各部門所識別的潛在及新生風險，以及相關監控措施和緩解策略是否充足，並由該會定出適當的跟進行動。\n\n# 內部審計\n\n金管局內部審核處獨立評估不同部門的管治程序、風險管理及監控措施是否足夠及具成效，並提出改善建議。\n\n# 外部審計\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》第7條，外匯基金的財務報表由香港特區政府審計署審核。審計署並無就此項服務收取費用。經審核的外匯基金財務報表刊載於金管局《年報》。\n","terms":{"12個月預期信用虧損":["12-month expected credit

central bank institution of Hong Kong, the HKMA fully recognizes the importance of good governance in maintaining and sustaining public trust and confidence in its performance of statutory duties, and has always been committed to upholding high standards of institutional governance.\n\nTo fulfill its commitment to good institutional governance, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:\n- has established a clear and highly accountable institutional governance framework;\n- implements robust monitoring measures to manage risks and ensure staff behavior complies with specified standards; and\n- adopts transparent and open policies, maintaining close communication with stakeholders.\n\n# The Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is part of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government (HKSAR) framework, but it may employ staff under terms of appointment different from those of civil servants to attract personnel with appropriate experience and expertise. The Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and its staff are all public officials. The day-to-day operations of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority enjoy a high degree of autonomy within the legal authority conferred or delegated to the Financial Secretary.\n\nThe Financial Secretary is responsible for determining the monetary policy objectives and the monetary system of Hong Kong. In a letter dated June 25, 2003, addressed to the Financial Management Commissioner, the Financial Secretary stated that currency stability should be maintained through the Currency Issuance Department system, keeping the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate at approximately 7.80 HKD to 1 USD. The Financial Management Commissioner is responsible for achieving the monetary policy objectives, including determining the relevant strategies, tools, and methods of implementation, and for maintaining the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's monetary system.\n\nThe Financial Secretary, with the assistance of the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, is responsible for policies aimed at maintaining the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's financial system and preserving Hong Kong's status as an international financial center. To implement these policies, the Financial Secretary's responsibilities include:\n- Promoting the overall stability and efficient operation of the banking system;\n- Cooperating with other relevant institutions and organizations to develop the debt market;\n- Handling matters relating to the issuance and circulation of legal tender notes and coins;\n- Promoting the safety and efficiency of financial infrastructure through the development of payment, clearing and settlement systems, and where appropriate, operating such systems; and\n- Cooperating with other relevant institutions and organizations to promote confidence in Hong Kong's currency and financial system, and implementing appropriate market development measures to help enhance the international competitiveness of Hong Kong's financial services.\n\nThe Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary. The Financial Management Officer must, based on the powers delegated by the Financial Secretary, be accountable to the Financial Secretary for the management and investment of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# Accountability and transparency\n\nThe Financial Supervisory Commission has consistently maintained a high degree of autonomy in its operational practices and the methods employed to achieve government policy objectives, while also being supported by high accountability and transparency.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is dedicated to promoting the stability of the currency and banking system, effectively managing official reserves, developing and overseeing a robust and diversified financial infrastructure, thereby consolidating Hong Kong's status as an international financial center and promoting Hong Kong's economic development.\n\nIn order to effectively perform its duties, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) must gain the trust of the public. Therefore, the HKMA adopts a rigorous approach in fulfilling its responsibility to explain its policies and operations to the public, and makes every effort to address issues of public concern that fall within its scope of responsibilities. In particular, the HKMA timely clarifies false information and rumors regarding its policies through traditional and social media channels.\n\nThe Financial Management Commissioner is appointed by the Financial Secretary, therefore the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is accountable to the public through the Financial Secretary; and since the HKMA's powers are established by laws passed by the Legislative Council, the HKMA is also accountable to the public through the Legislative Council. The HKMA also recognizes its broader responsibilities, which include promoting public awareness of its role and objectives, and closely monitoring issues of public concern. While carrying out daily operations and maintaining extensive connections with society, the HKMA adheres to policies aimed at enhancing transparency and maintaining an open approach. This policy has two main objectives:\n- To ensure that the financial sector and the public are fully informed about the HKMA's work, taking into account market sensitivity, commercial secrets, and legal restrictions on disclosure; and\n- To ensure that the HKMA stays attuned to societal trends and appropriately responds to public opinion.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is committed to achieving international best practices in transparency. In addition to maintaining extensive media contacts, the HKMA publishes a variety of journals and special publications in both Chinese and English. The HKMA's bilingual website (www.hkma.gov.hk) features dedicated sections covering economic research, statistical data, regulatory resources, consumer information, and other topics, as well as a large collection of HKMA publications, press releases, speeches, and briefing documents. Furthermore, the HKMA utilizes social media platforms to communicate more effectively with the public in the digital age. The HKMA's office houses an information center, comprising a library and exhibition hall, which is open to the public six days a week. Details regarding the HKMA's work in communication and engagement with the public are provided in the chapter on \"Corporate Functions\" (pages 157 to 162).\n\nThe frequency with which the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) publishes information on the Exchange Fund and the Currency Issuing Office’s accounts has been steadily increasing, with the content becoming increasingly detailed. The HKMA began participating in the International Monetary Fund’s central bank “Special Data Dissemination Standard” program in 1999. The HKMA also publishes the minutes of meetings of the Currency Issuing Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, as well as reports on the operation of the Currency Issuing Office system. Since 1996, the HKMA website has featured banking regulatory policies and guidelines.\n\nThe relationship between the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Legislative Council is crucial for enhancing accountability and transparency. The HKMA Governor has committed to providing briefings to the Financial Affairs Committee of the Legislative Council on the HKMA's various operations and policies three times a year, and to answer relevant inquiries. Additionally, HKMA representatives frequently attend meetings of the Legislative Council's Standing Committees and Sub-Committees to explain and discuss specific matters, as well as assist members in reviewing draft legislation.\n\n# controls\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority employs robust and effective internal and external monitoring mechanisms to ensure a high standard of staff integrity, prudent risk management, and appropriate checks and balances. Both internal and external audit functions provide independent assessments of the adequacy and effectiveness of these monitoring mechanisms.\n\n# Code of Conduct\n\nThe Code of Conduct provides guidance on the ethical and legal responsibilities of employees, ensuring that the behavior of all staff at all levels complies with specified standards.\n\n# Internal Monitoring\n\n# Operational controls\n\nAs the first line of defense in risk management, all departments and branches are responsible for assessing the risks associated with their workflows and establishing appropriate monitoring measures to ensure the smooth operation of the Monetary Authority's daily activities.\n\n# Organisational risk management\n\nRisk management also takes place at the institutional level. The Risk Committee, chaired by the Governor of the Monetary Authority, is one of the cornerstones of the institution's risk management framework.\n\nThe Risk Committee reviews and discusses potential and emerging risks identified by various departments, and evaluates whether relevant monitoring measures and mitigation strategies are adequate, then determines appropriate follow-up actions.\n\n# Internal Audit\n\nThe Internal Audit Department of the Monetary Authority independently evaluates whether the governance processes, risk management, and monitoring measures of different departments are adequate and effective, and provides recommendations for improvement.\n\n# External audit\n\nUnder section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the financial statements of the Exchange Fund are audited by the Audit Commission of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government. The Audit Commission does not charge any fees for this service. The audited financial statements of the Exchange Fund are published in the HKMA Annual Report.\n"}
{"zh":"# 經濟及金融環境\n\n面對第五波新冠病毒疫情、金融狀況收緊及充滿挑戰的外圍環境，香港經濟在2022年顯著收縮。勞工市場持續一段時間轉差，其後逐步改善，而通脹則維持溫和。資產市場亦有所受壓。受惠於內地與香港全面通關，預計2023年香港經濟增長將由低位復甦。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 實體經濟活動\n\n受本地及外圍環境各項不利因素拖累，香港經濟在2022年收縮3.5%（表1及圖1）。本地方面，由於香港爆發第五波新冠病毒疫情，私人消費在第1季急跌，其後受惠於社交距離措施逐步放寬及政府消費券計劃的刺激，私人消費再度錄得按季增長。在營商氣氛疲弱及金融狀況收緊下，整體投資支出較2021年顯著下跌。對外方面，隨着外部需求轉弱，加上內地與香港之間的跨境陸路貨運受阻，香港貨物出口下挫。服務輸出依然大致疲弱，部分反映訪港旅遊活動低迷，但其後隨着政府於9月下旬撤銷抵港強制檢疫要求，情況於第4季稍為改善。\n\n圖1 組成部分對實質本地生產總值增長的貢獻\n資料來源：政府統計處\n\n表 1 按開支項目計的實質本地生產總值增長（比對上期）\n註：經季節性調整的本地固定資本形成總額按季增減幅度不詳。\n資料來源：政府統計處\n\n# 通脹\n\n本地通脹壓力於2022年稍升，但仍屬溫和。具體而言，按年基本通脹率逐步上升至12月2%的溫和水平，其中外圍能源及食品價格高企的影響部分被溫和的本地成本壓力所抵銷，尤其是偏軟的房屋租金（圖2）。此外，在經濟活動疲弱下，名義工資增長及商業樓宇租金持續偏軟，亦有助遏抑通脹。2022年全年合計，基本及整體通脹率分別為1.7%及1.9%。\n\n# 勞工市場\n\n疫情下勞工市場狀況在2022年初急速惡化，但隨後持續改善。失業率在4月升至5.4%的高位後，於12月顯著回落至3.5%（圖3），當中大多數行業的失業率均有所下降。總就業人數（圖3）及私營機構職位空缺回升，反映整體勞工需求逐步回復，惟總就業人數仍低於疫情前水平。名義工資和勞工收入的按年升幅亦略為加快。另一方面，與去年同期比較，勞動人口於12月略為減少1.5%，部分原因是勞動人口參與率輕微下跌。\n\n圖2 基本消費物價通脹\n資料來源：政府統計處及金管局職員估計數字\n\n圖3 勞工市場狀況\n資料來源：政府統計處\n\n# 股市\n\n本港股市在2022年出現大幅波動。承接2021年的下行趨勢，恒生指數加速下跌，在2022年10月31日收報14,687點，是自2009年以來的最低水平（圖4）。股市顯著調整，最初是由市場對本地新冠病毒疫情、美國加息及俄烏局勢的憂慮加劇所觸發，其後由於環球金融狀況收緊及內地新冠病毒疫情導致環球經濟前景轉差，令股市調整幅度進一步擴大。股市在年內最後兩個月重拾一些上升動力，部分受到內地優化防疫抗疫措施所支持。恒生指數於年底收報19,781點，較2021年底顯著下跌15.5%，連續第三年下挫。\n\n# 物業市場\n\n在金融狀況收緊及經濟活動疲弱下，住宅物業市場亦有所受壓。樓價於2022年回落15%（圖4），成交量也大幅縮減39%至45,050宗，創下有紀錄以來的新低。儘管樓價下跌，置業負擔能力仍然偏緊。實際按揭利率於年內由約1.6厘上升至3.375至3.625厘，增加供樓人士的按揭供款負擔。非住宅物業市場亦進一步回軟。在空置率高企下，其價格有所回落，租金亦維持偏軟。\n\n圖4 資產價格\n資料來源：差餉物業估價署及香港交易及結算所有限公司\n\n# 經濟前景\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n受惠於內地與香港全面通關，預期2023年香港經濟增長將由低位復甦。儘管先進經濟體增長預期放緩將繼續拖累香港貨物出口，但內地經濟復甦及跨境陸路貨運限制撤銷，應能為本港經濟提供支持。內地與香港全面通關亦有望令香港入境旅遊及其他服務輸出顯著受惠，並提振本地營商氣氛及資本開支。私人消費亦將會在勞工市場轉強下進一步改善。政府預測2023年全年實質本地生產總值會顯著增長，介乎3.5至5.5%。然而，香港經濟增長前景仍受眾多風險及不明朗因素所影響，並很大程度上取決於美國聯邦儲備局政策利率走勢、全球增長前景、地緣政治局勢持續緊張以及本地入境旅遊的復甦步伐。\n\n# 通脹及勞工市場\n\n展望未來，預期本地通脹將輕微上升，但在各種因素互相抵銷下應保持溫和。儘管外圍價格應會維持高企，但由於部分主要經濟體的經濟活動轉弱及商品價格上行壓力緩和，外圍價格的上升動力或會進一步減弱。同樣地，隨着本地經濟復甦及勞工市場改善，本地成本壓力或會輕微上升，但房屋租金偏軟應繼續在一定程度上抵銷其影響。政府預測2023年全年合計的整體及基本通脹率分別為2.9%及2.5%。另一方面，勞工市場狀況有望隨着本地經濟活動復常而進一步改善。\n\n# 銀行體系表現\n\n香港銀行體系在2022年面對充滿挑戰的宏觀經濟環境，包括年初爆發第五波新冠病毒疫情、地緣政治局勢升溫，以及全球各大央行大幅度加息應對通脹上升等。面對各項挑戰，香港銀行應付裕如，資本及流動性狀況繼續保持充裕。年內銀行體系面對的信貸風險增加，但整體資產質素維持於健康水平。與此同時，利率上升促使銀行淨利息收入增加，但其正面影響因呆壞帳準備金增加及費用與佣金收入減少而被局部抵銷。整體而言，零售銀行盈利較2021年改善。\n\n# 資產質素\n\n銀行體系的特定分類貸款比率由2021年底的0.89%上升至2022年底的1.38%，逾期及經重組貸款比率於同期由0.56%升至0.85%（圖5）。中國內地相關貸款的特定分類貸款比率於2022年底為2.21%，亦較2021年底的0.89%上升。特定分類貸款比率上升，主要是由於部分內地房地產發展商的貸款評級被下調。儘管如此，銀行撥備充足，截至2022年底，銀行信貸撥備覆蓋率（即信貸撥備和特定分類貸款比率）約維持於80%。若將抵押品變現價值從呆壞帳餘額中扣除，銀行信貸撥備覆蓋率約140%。另一方面，2022年底住宅按揭貸款及信用卡貸款的拖欠比率仍然處於低位，分別為0.06%及0.23%（圖6）。\n\n圖5 銀行體系的資產質素\n註：數字涵蓋香港辦事處、境外分行及境外主要附屬公司。\n資料來源：金管局\n\n圖6 住宅按揭貸款及信用卡貸款的拖欠比率\n資料來源：金管局\n\n# 盈利走勢\n\n銀行體系在2022年繼續錄得盈利。年內零售銀行的整體除稅前經營溢利上升19.0%（圖7）。盈利改善是受惠於淨利息收入（+34%）及外匯與衍生工具收入增加（+72%），但部分升幅被呆壞帳準備金增加（+151%）及費用與佣金收入減少（–19%）所抵銷。在加息環境下，淨息差由上一年的0.98%擴闊至2022年的1.31%（圖8）。年內市場波動增加，亦令銀行來自外匯及衍生工具業務的收入增加。呆壞帳準備金增加是由於須為新的特定分類貸款預留特殊準備金，而在金融市場表現疲弱下，費用及佣金收入減少。零售銀行成本與收入比率由2021年的54.7%，降至2022年的48.0%（圖9）。\n\n圖7 零售銀行的表現\n資料來源：金管局\n\n圖8 零售銀行淨息差\n資料來源：金管局\n\n圖9 零售銀行成本與收入比率\n資料來源：金管局\n\n# 資產負債表走勢\n\n2022年銀行體系資產負債表擴大2.5%。資產上升是由於外匯及衍生工具持倉按市價計值增加。面對外圍不明朗因素及利率趨升，年內貸款需求減弱。相比2021年錄得3.8%的增幅，2022年貸款總額減少3.0%。其中在香港境外使用的貸款減少10.2%，貿易融資減少13.5%，在香港使用的貸款則稍增0.9%。中國內地相關貸款繼2021年增長3.7%後，於2022年減少4.4%。\n\n在資產負債表的負債方面，銀行體系存款繼續錄得溫和增長。存款總額於2022年增加1.7%，相比2021年的增幅為4.6%。由於貸款總額減少而存款總額增加，整體貸存比率由2021年底的71.8%稍降至2022年底的68.5%（圖10）。\n\n# 資本充足水平\n\n銀行在2022年的資本狀況維持充裕。2022年底本地註冊認可機構的綜合總資本比率為20.1%，相比上一年為20.2%；一級資本比率為18.1%（圖11）。兩者均遠高於相關國際最低要求。《巴塞爾協定三》槓桿比率於2022年底為7.9%（圖12）。\n\n圖10 銀行體系的貸款及存款\n資料來源：金管局\n\n圖11 本地註冊認可機構的綜合資本比率\n資料來源：金管局\n\n圖12 本地註冊認可機構的綜合槓桿比率\n資料來源：金管局\n\n# 流動性狀況\n\n銀行體系的流動性狀況繼續維持穩健，成為在宏觀經濟環境不明朗因素加劇下的重要支柱。第1類機構的季度平均流動性覆蓋比率在2022年第4季為162.3%，第2類機構的季度平均流動性維持比率為63.2%（圖13）。銀行體系的主要資金來源仍然是客戶存款。於2022年底，第1類機構的穩定資金淨額比率及第2A類機構的核心資金比率分別為137.7%及155.7%（圖14）。以上所有4個比率均遠高於法定最低要求。\n\n圖13

environment\n\nFaced with the fifth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, tightening financial conditions, and a challenging external environment, Hong Kong's economy contracted significantly in 2022. The labor market deteriorated for a period before gradually improving, while inflation remained moderate. Asset markets also faced pressure. Benefiting from the full resumption of cross-border travel between mainland China and Hong Kong, Hong Kong's economic growth is expected to recover from a low base in 2023.\n\n# Economic Review\n\n# Real activities\n\nHong Kong's economy contracted by 3.5% in 2022, affected by various adverse factors from both local and external environments (Table 1 and Figure 1). Locally, private consumption fell sharply in the first quarter due to the outbreak of the fifth wave of the coronavirus pandemic in Hong Kong. Private consumption then recorded a quarterly increase later, benefiting from the gradual relaxation of social distancing measures and the stimulus from the government's consumption voucher program. Under weak business sentiment and tighter financial conditions, overall investment expenditure fell significantly compared to 2021. Externally, Hong Kong's goods exports declined as external demand weakened and cross-border land freight between mainland China and Hong Kong was disrupted. Service exports remained generally weak, partly reflecting the low level of tourism activities in Hong Kong, but the situation improved somewhat in the fourth quarter after the government lifted the mandatory quarantine requirement for arrivals in late September.\n\nFigure 1 shows the contribution of various components to real gross domestic product growth.\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\nTable 1: Real Growth of Local GDP by Expenditure Item (Compared to Previous Period)\nNote: The seasonally adjusted local capital formation total's quarterly increase or decrease is not specified.\nData Source: Census and Statistics Department\n\n# Inflation\n\nLocal inflation pressures rose slightly in 2022 but remained mild. Specifically, the year-on-year underlying inflation rate gradually increased to a mild level of 2% in December, where the impact of high external energy and food prices was partially offset by mild domestic cost pressures, particularly soft housing rentals (Figure 2). Furthermore, weak economic activity, along with continued soft nominal wage growth and commercial rental rates, also helped restrain inflation. For the entire year of 2022, the underlying and overall inflation rates were 1.7% and 1.9%, respectively.\n\n# Labor Market\n\nLabor market conditions under the pandemic rapidly deteriorated in early 2022 but subsequently continued to improve. The unemployment rate rose to a high of 5.4% in April, then significantly declined to 3.5% by December (Figure 3), with the unemployment rate in most industries also decreasing. Total employment numbers (Figure 3) and private sector job vacancies rose, reflecting a gradual recovery in overall labor demand, although total employment numbers remained below pre-pandemic levels. The year-on-year increase in nominal wages and labor income also slightly accelerated. On the other hand, the labor force slightly decreased by 1.5% compared to the same period last year, partly due to a slight decline in the labor force participation rate.\n\nFigure 2: Basic Consumer Price Inflation. Data Source: Government Statistics Department and Monetary Authority staff's estimated figures.\n\nFigure 3: Labor Market Situation\nData Source: Census and Statistics Department\n\n# Stock Market\n\nThe Hong Kong stock market experienced considerable volatility in 2022. Continuing the downward trend from 2021, the Hang Seng Index accelerated its decline, closing at 14,687 points on October 31, 2022—its lowest level since 2009 (Figure 4). The initial market correction stemmed from concerns over the local COVID-19 situation, U.S. interest rate hikes, and the Russia-Ukraine situation. Subsequently, tightening global financial conditions and the impact of mainland China’s COVID-19 outbreaks on the global economy exacerbated the downturn. The market regained some upward momentum in the final two months of the year, partly supported by mainland China’s optimized pandemic prevention and control measures. The Hang Seng Index closed the year at 19,781 points, a 15.5% decrease from the end of 2021, marking a third consecutive year of losses.\n\n# Real Estate Market\n\nUnder tightening financial conditions and weak economic activity, the residential property market has also come under pressure. Housing prices fell by 15% in 2022 (Figure 4), and transaction volume dropped sharply by 39% to 45,050 units, reaching a record low. Despite the decline in housing prices, affordability remains tight. Actual mortgage rates rose during the year from about 1.6% to 3.375% to 3.625%, increasing the mortgage burden for homebuyers. The non-residential property market has also weakened further. With high vacancy rates, prices have declined, and rents have remained weak.\n\nFigure 4: Asset Prices. Source: Inland Revenue Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\n\n# Outlook for the economy\n\n# Economic environment\n\nBenefiting from the full resumption of cross-border travel and trade between the mainland and Hong Kong, it is expected that Hong Kong's economic growth will recover from a low base in 2023. Although the slower growth expectations of advanced economies will continue to hinder Hong Kong's cargo exports, the recovery of the mainland economy and the lifting of cross-border land freight restrictions should provide support for Hong Kong's economy. The full resumption of cross-border travel between the mainland and Hong Kong is also expected to significantly benefit Hong Kong's inbound tourism and other service exports, while boosting the local business climate and capital expenditure. Private consumption is also expected to improve further as the labor market strengthens. The government predicts that real local GDP will experience significant growth in 2023, between 3.5 and 5.5 percent. However, the outlook for Hong Kong's economic growth remains subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and to a large extent depends on the trajectory of the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy interest rates, the global growth outlook, continued geopolitical tensions, and the pace of recovery of local inbound tourism.\n\n# Inflation and the Labor Market\n\nLooking ahead, we anticipate that local inflation will rise slightly, but should remain moderate as various factors offset each other. While external prices are expected to remain high, the upward momentum may further weaken as economic activity slows in some major economies and upward pressure on commodity prices eases. Similarly, local cost pressures may increase slightly as the local economy recovers and the labor market improves, but soft housing rentals should continue to offset their impact to a certain extent. The government forecasts that overall and core inflation for the entirety of 2023 will be 2.9% and 2.5% respectively. On the other hand, labor market conditions are expected to improve further as local economic activity normalizes.\n\n# Performance of the banking sector\n\nThe Hong Kong banking system faced a challenging macroeconomic environment in 2022, including the outbreak of the fifth wave of the coronavirus pandemic at the beginning of the year, the escalation of geopolitical tensions, and global central banks significantly raising interest rates to combat rising inflation. Despite these challenges, Hong Kong banks handled them with ease, maintaining ample capital and liquidity. The banking system encountered increased credit risk during the year, but overall asset quality remained at a healthy level. Meanwhile, rising interest rates boosted banks' net interest income, although this positive effect was partially offset by increased provisions for bad and doubtful debts and a decline in fee and commission income. Overall, retail bank profits improved compared to 2021.\n\n# Asset Quality\n\nThe specific classification loan ratio in the banking system rose from 0.89% at the end of 2021 to 1.38% at the end of 2022, while the ratio of overdue and restructured loans increased from 0.56% to 0.85% during the same period (Figure 5). The specific classification loan ratio for related loans in mainland China was 2.21% at the end of 2022, up from 0.89% at the end of 2021. The increase in the specific classification loan ratio was mainly due to the downgrading of loan ratings for some mainland property developers. Nevertheless, banks maintained adequate provisions, with the credit provision coverage ratio (i.e., the ratio of credit provisions to specific classification loan ratio) remaining around 80% as of the end of 2022. If the realization value of collateral is deducted from the amount of non-performing loans, the credit provision coverage ratio of banks is approximately 140%. On the other hand, the delinquency ratios for residential mortgage loans and credit card loans remained low at the end of 2022, at 0.06% and 0.23%, respectively (Figure 6).\n\nFigure 5 Asset Quality of the Banking System Note: The figures include Hong Kong offices, overseas branches, and major overseas subsidiaries. Data Source: HKMA\n\nFigure 6: Delinquency Rate of Residential Mortgage Loans and Credit Card Loans  \nData Source: Hong Kong Monetary Authority\n\n# Profitability Trends\n\nThe banking system continued to record profits in 2022. Within the year, the overall pre-tax operating profit of retail banks increased by 19.0% (Figure 7). The improvement in profits was benefited by net interest income (+34%) and increased foreign exchange and derivative income (+72%), but part of the increase was offset by increased loan loss provisions (+151%) and decreased fee and commission income (–19%). Under an interest rate hike environment, the net interest margin widened from 0.98% in the previous year to 1.31% in 2022 (Figure 8). Increased market volatility also led to increased income for banks from foreign exchange and derivative businesses. The increase in loan loss provisions was due to the need to set aside special reserves for newly classified loans, and the decrease in fee and commission income was due to the weak performance of financial markets. The cost-to-income ratio of retail banking decreased from 54.7% in 2021 to 48.0% in 2022 (Figure 9).\n\nFigure 7: Retail Banks’ Performance  \nData Source: HKMA\n\nFigure 8 Retail Banks’ Net Interest Margin  \nSource: HKMA\n\nFigure 9 Retail banks’ cost-to-income ratio  \nSource of data: Hong Kong Monetary Authority\n\n# Balance sheet trends\n\nIn 2022, the banking sector’s balance sheet expanded by 2.5%. The increase in assets was attributable to gains in the market value of foreign exchange and derivatives holdings. Amidst external uncertainties and rising interest rates, loan demand weakened during the year. Compared to the 3.8% growth recorded in 2021, the total loan amount decreased by 3.0% in 2022. Specifically, loans used outside of Hong Kong decreased by 10.2%, trade financing decreased by 13.5%, while loans used in Hong Kong saw a slight increase of 0.9%. Loans related to Mainland China decreased by 4.4% in 2022, following a 3.7% increase in 2021.\n\nOn the liability side of the balance sheet, bank system deposits continued to record moderate growth. Total deposits increased by 1.7% in 2022, compared to an increase of 4.6% in 2021. Due to a decrease in total loans and an increase in total deposits, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio slightly declined from 71.8% at the end of 2021 to 68.5% at the end of 2022 (Figure 10).\n\n# Capital adequacy\n\nThe banking sector maintained ample capital levels in 2022. The consolidated capital ratio of locally registered and authorized institutions at the end of 2022 was 20.1%, compared to 20.2% in the previous year; the Tier 1 capital ratio was 18.1% (Figure 11). Both ratios were significantly higher than the relevant international minimum requirements. The Basel III leverage ratio was 7.9% at the end of 2022 (Figure 12).\n\nFigure 10: Loans and Deposits in the Banking System  \nData Source: HKMA\n\nFigure 11: Comprehensive Capital Ratio of Local Registered Authorized Institutions\nData Source: Hong Kong Monetary Authority\n\nFigure 12: Comprehensive Leverage Ratio of Locally Registered Authorized Institutions\nData Source: HKMA\n\n# Liquidity conditions\n\nThe banking system's liquidity position remains robust, serving as a crucial pillar amid heightened uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment. The quarterly average liquidity coverage ratio for Tier 1 institutions was 162.3% in the fourth quarter of 2022, while the quarterly average liquidity maintenance ratio for Tier 2 institutions stood at 63.2% (Figure 13). Customer deposits continue to be the primary source of funding for the banking system. As of the end of 2022, the net stable funding ratio for Tier 1 institutions and the core funding ratio for Tier 2A institutions were 137.7% and 155.7%, respectively (Figure 14). All four ratios are significantly above the statutory minimum requirements.\n\nFigure 13: Liquidity Ratio of Designated Authorized Institutions\nData Source: HKMA\n\nFigure 14: Capital Adequacy Ratio of Designated Authorized Institutions\nData Source: HKMA\n"}
{"zh":"# 貨幣穩定\n\n隨着美國收緊貨幣政策，港元在2022年轉弱，弱方兌換保證於5月至11月期間被觸發41次。在本港股市成交轉旺及年底季節性資金需求的帶動下，港元在11月中開始轉強。在聯繫匯率制度下，香港銀行同業拆息大致跟隨美元銀行同業拆息的走勢。由於美國持續加息，香港銀行同業拆息於2022年內逐步上升。整體而言，港元外匯及貨幣市場保持穩定，交易暢順有序。作為香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石，聯繫匯率制度一直展現強大抵禦外來衝擊的能力。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的主要目標是維持貨幣穩定，即確保港元匯價穩定，使港元在外匯市場兌美元的匯率保持在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的區間內。該貨幣體制主要採用貨幣發行局制度，規定由外匯基金所持的美元儲備向貨幣基礎提供最少百分之百的支持；貨幣基礎若有變動，美元儲備亦必須作出相應增減，與貨幣基礎的變動百分之百配合。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n- 負債證明書（為3間發鈔銀行發行的銀行紙幣提供十足支持）；\n- 政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣；\n- 設於金管局的結算戶口結餘總額（即總結餘）；及\n- 金管局代表政府發行的外匯基金票據及債券。\n\n金管局透過自動利率調節機制及履行兌換保證的堅決承諾來維持港元匯率的穩定。當強方（或弱方）兌換保證被觸發，金管局會應銀行要求，按每美元兌7.75港元向銀行沽出港元、買入美元（或按7.85港元買入港元、沽出美元），使總結餘增加（或減少），令港元利率下跌（或上升），從而促使港元匯率回復到7.75至7.85的兌換範圍。\n\n# 2022 年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n受到本港股市調整、市場預期美國進一步加息，以及在香港銀行同業拆息與倫敦銀行同業拆息的負息差下的套息交易帶動，港元在2022年初轉弱，並在其後的月份一直貼近弱方兌換保證水平。弱方兌換保證於5月至11月期間被觸發41次。在本港股市成交轉旺及年底季節性資金需求的帶動下，港元在11月中開始轉強（圖1）。整體而言，港元外匯市場在2022年全年繼續運作正常。\n\n為應付銀行對外匯基金票據的持續需求，金管局於2022年初增發總值400億港元的外匯基金票據。此外，金管局在2022年5月至11月間按照聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）的設計，應銀行要求於弱方兌換保證匯率水平共買入2,421億港元。總結餘由2021年底的3,775億港元，減少至2022年底的963億港元，反映增發外匯基金票據，以及弱方兌換保證被觸發的影響。與此同時，未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額在年內由11,488億港元，稍增至12,004億港元。因此，總結餘與未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額由2021年底的15,263 億港元，減少至 2022 年底的 12,967 億港元（圖2）。整體貨幣基礎仍然由外匯儲備提供十足支持。\n\n圖1 2022年市場匯率\n\n圖2 2022年總結餘（進行貼現窗活動前）及未償還外匯基金票據及債券\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n在聯匯制度下，香港銀行同業拆息大致跟隨美元銀行同業拆息的走勢。由於美國在2022年持續加息，香港銀行同業拆息逐步上升（圖3）。全年計，隔夜、1個月及3個月香港銀行同業拆息分別上升318、419及473基點至年底時的3.23厘、4.35厘及4.99厘。\n\n因應美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍上調，基本利率上調7次，合共4.25個百分點（即425基點），由0.5厘上升至4.75厘（圖3）。在零售層面，隨着美國上調政策利率，多間銀行在9月下旬調高最優惠貸款利率12.5基點，在11月初再調高25基點，以及在12月中再調高25基點。部分銀行亦於年內提高以香港銀行同業拆息為基礎的新批按揭利率上限。整體而言，香港貨幣市場繼續正常運作。貼現窗借貸由2021年的68億港元增至2022年的84億港元。\n\n圖3 2022 年香港銀行同業拆息\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n接近40年來，聯匯制度一直是香港金融體系的重要支柱，展現強大的應對挑戰的能力。儘管2022年全球金融狀況反覆，港元外匯及貨幣市場維持有序運作，反映聯匯制度穩健有效。政府亦堅決維持聯匯制度。國際貨幣基金組織在《2022年對外部門報告》一再重申香港擁有具透明度的規則、龐大的財政及外匯儲備、穩健的金融規管與監管、靈活的經濟，以及審慎的財政架構，確保聯匯制度具公信力。\n\n穩健的銀行體系對聯匯制度的正常運作具關鍵作用。香港銀行體系繼續運作暢順，流動性及資本狀況以國際標準而言均非常充裕。為確保銀行體系具備抵禦衝擊的能力，金管局一直密切監察銀行的信用、流動性及利率風險管理，以及壓力測試結果，並維持對銀行貸款的監管。\n\n為提高貨幣發行局帳目的透明度，自1998年10月起，外匯基金已有部分資產被指定用作支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（即支持資產相對貨幣基礎的比率）於2022年在109.3%至111.0%之間上落，並無觸及上限或下限。該比率於12月31日收報110.1%（圖4）。在聯匯制度下，雖然已指定某些外匯基金資產作為支持組合，但外匯基金的全部資產均可用作支持港元匯率。外匯基金的龐大財政資源，加上香港穩健的銀行體系，為保障香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供強而有力的後盾。\n\n圖4 2022年支持比率每日變動\n\n# 貨幣發行委員會\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的貨幣發行委員會負責監察及探討與香港貨幣及金融穩定有關的課題。在2022年，貨幣發行委員會探討的課題包括中國內地物業市況、非銀行機構在住宅按揭市場的角色、深度學習在信用風險評估上的應用，以及一個用作評估港元流動性的監察框架。貨幣發行委員會會議紀錄及金管局向其呈交的貨幣發行局制度運作報告，均載於金管局網站。\n\n# 紙幣及硬幣\n\n# 香港鈔票\n\n金管局繼續舉辦講座，為銀行櫃位職員、零售店舖的收銀員及學生講解香港鈔票設計及防偽特徵，提高他們鑑別鈔票的知識及技巧。在2022年，金管局共舉辦15場講座，吸引4,200多名參加者。\n\n# 硬幣收集計劃\n\n硬幣收集計劃繼續受到市民歡迎。有關計劃詳情載於《二零二二年可持續發展報告》之「可持續發展的金管局」一章。\n\n# 外匯基金票據及債券\n\n外匯基金票據及債券計劃繼續暢順運作。為應對銀行對外匯基金票據的持續需求及考慮到市場情況，金管局在2022年首兩個月增發總計400億港元外匯基金票據，而總結餘亦因此相應減少。截至2022年底，未償還外匯基金票據及債券名義總值約為12,075億港元（表2）。\n\n表2 未償還外匯基金票據及債券\n\n# 貨幣研究\n\n香港貨幣及金融研究中心（研究中心 完成3份政策研究報告、發表24份研究論文及舉辦16場研討會╱網上研討會，內容涵蓋對香港以至區內具戰略重要性的貨幣與金融研究議題。研究中心亦作出進一步安排，透過全新的開放取用電子期刊發布研究結果，令更廣泛的讀者接收到相關資訊。此外，研究中心在其網站推出全新系列刊物《Insights from Monetary Research Digest》， 為公眾總結研究中心最近的研究成果，提供高層次非技術性的概要。\n\n除研究成果外，研究中心亦舉辦兩場國際研討會及3場網上專家研討會，促進對經濟及金融事務的對話與交流：\n\n- 於4月12日與金融學院合辦「宏觀經濟最新發展、美聯儲收緊貨幣政策及離岸人民幣市場的發展網上研討會，邀得金管局前總裁任志剛先生及北京大學國家發展研究院副院長兼金光經濟學講席教授黃益平教授作嘉賓講者。是次研討會在多個平台直播，吸引共84萬人次網上實時觀看。\n\n-

tightening of U.S. monetary policy, the Hong Kong dollar weakened in 2022, with the weak-side exchange rate guarantee being triggered 41 times between May and November. Driven by increased stock market turnover and seasonal funding demands at year-end, the Hong Kong dollar began to strengthen in mid-November. Under the linked exchange rate system, Hong Kong interbank rates generally followed the trend of U.S. interbank rates. Due to continued U.S. interest rate hikes, Hong Kong interbank rates gradually rose throughout 2022. Overall, the Hong Kong foreign exchange and money markets remained stable, with smooth and orderly trading. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability, the linked exchange rate system has consistently demonstrated strong resilience against external shocks.\n\n# Objective\n\nThe primary objective of Hong Kong's monetary policy is to maintain monetary stability, which entails ensuring the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, keeping the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar against the US dollar within the band of 7.75 to 7.85 Hong Kong dollars to 1 US dollar in the foreign exchange market. This monetary system mainly adopts the currency issue system, which stipulates that the US dollar reserves held by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority must provide at least 100% support to the monetary base; if the monetary base changes, the US dollar reserves must also be adjusted accordingly, fully matching the changes in the monetary base.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n- Certificates of Indebtedness (providing full backing for banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks);\n- Government-issued currency notes and coins;\n- The aggregate balance of clearing accounts maintained with the HKMA (i.e. the total balance); and\n- Exchange Fund bills and bonds issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority maintains the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate through the automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and its firm commitment to honoring exchange rate guarantees. When a strong (or weak) side exchange rate guarantee is triggered, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, upon request from banks, will sell Hong Kong dollars and buy US dollars from banks at a rate of HK$7.75 per US dollar (or buy Hong Kong dollars and sell US dollars at a rate of HK$7.85), increasing (or decreasing) the aggregate balance, thereby lowering (or raising) Hong Kong dollar interest rates, and thus bringing the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate back within the HK$7.75-7.85 exchange rate range.\n\n# 2022 Year in Review\n\n# Exchange Rate Stability\n\nAffected by adjustments in the Hong Kong stock market, market expectations of further U.S. interest rate hikes, and carry trades driven by negative interest rate differentials between Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBOR) and London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR), the Hong Kong dollar weakened in early 2022 and remained close to the weak-side exchange rate guarantee level in subsequent months. The weak-side exchange rate guarantee was triggered 41 times between May and November. Under the impetus of increased trading activity in the Hong Kong stock market and year-end seasonal funding demands, the Hong Kong dollar began to strengthen in mid-November (Figure 1). Overall, the Hong Kong foreign exchange market continued to operate normally throughout 2022.\n\nTo meet the continued demand by banks for bills issued by the Exchange Fund, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued bills totaling 40 billion Hong Kong dollars in early 2022. In addition, in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), the Hong Kong Monetary Authority purchased a total of 242.1 billion Hong Kong dollars at the weak-side exchange rate level upon bank requests between May and November 2022. The total reserves decreased from 3,775 billion Hong Kong dollars at the end of 2021 to 963 billion Hong Kong dollars at the end of 2022, reflecting the impact of the additional issuance of Exchange Fund bills and the triggering of the weak-side exchange rate guarantee. At the same time, the total outstanding amount of Exchange Fund bills and bonds increased slightly from 11,488 billion Hong Kong dollars to 12,004 billion Hong Kong dollars during the year. Therefore, the total reserves and the total outstanding amount of Exchange Fund bills and bonds decreased from 15,263 billion Hong Kong dollars at the end of 2021 to 12,967 billion Hong Kong dollars at the end of 2022 (Figure 2). The overall monetary base remains fully supported by foreign exchange reserves.\n\nFigure 1: 2022 Market Exchange Rate\n\nFigure 2: 2022 Year-End Balance (Before Discount Window Operations) and Outstanding Foreign Exchange Fund Notes and Bonds\n\n# money markets\n\nUnder the Linked Exchange Rate System, the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) generally follows the trend of the US dollar interbank offered rate. As the United States continued to raise interest rates in 2022, HIBOR gradually increased (Figure 3). For the year, the overnight, one-month, and three-month rates rose by 318, 419, and 473 basis points, respectively, reaching 3.23%, 4.35%, and 4.99% by year-end.\n\nIn response to the increase in the U.S. federal funds rate target range, the basic interest rate was raised seven times, totaling 4.25 percentage points (or 425 basis points), rising from 0.5% to 4.75% (Figure 3). In the retail sector, following the U.S. increase in policy rates, several banks raised their prime lending rates by 12.5 basis points in late September, by an additional 25 basis points in early November, and again by 25 basis points in mid-December. Some banks also raised the upper limit of new mortgage rates based on the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate during the year. Overall, the Hong Kong money market continued to function normally. Discount window lending increased from HK$6.8 billion in 2021 to HK$8.4 billion in 2022.\n\nFigure 3: Hong Kong Interbank Offer Rate (HIBOR) in 2022\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nFor nearly 40 years, the Linked Exchange Rate System has been a key pillar of Hong Kong's financial system, demonstrating strong resilience in facing challenges. Despite the volatile global financial situation in 2022, the Hong Kong dollar's foreign exchange and money markets maintained orderly operations, reflecting the robust and effective nature of the Linked Exchange Rate System. The government remains resolute in maintaining the Linked Exchange Rate System. The International Monetary Fund reiterated in the External Sector Report 2022 that Hong Kong has transparent rules, substantial fiscal and foreign exchange reserves, sound financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy, and a prudent fiscal framework, ensuring the credibility of the Linked Exchange Rate System.\n\nA sound banking system plays a crucial role in the normal functioning of the linked exchange rate regime. Hong Kong's banking system continues to operate smoothly, with liquidity and capital adequacy well above international standards. To ensure the banking system's resilience against shocks, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has been closely monitoring banks' credit, liquidity, and interest rate risk management, as well as the results of stress tests, and maintaining regulatory oversight of bank lending.\n\nTo enhance the transparency of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's accounts, since October 1998, certain assets of the Exchange Fund have been designated to support the currency base. The backing ratio (i.e., the ratio of supporting assets to the currency base) fluctuated between 109.3% and 111.0% in 2022, without reaching either the upper or lower limits. The ratio stood at 110.1% on December 31 (Figure 4). Under the linked exchange rate system, although certain Exchange Fund assets have been designated as part of the support portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets can be used to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. The substantial financial resources of the Exchange Fund, combined with Hong Kong's sound banking system, provide a strong backing for the maintenance of monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong.\n\nFigure 4: Daily Fluctuation of Support Rate in 2022\n\n# Currency Board Sub-Committee\n\nThe Currency Board Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for monitoring and discussing issues related to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. In 2022, the topics examined by the Currency Board Committee included the property market situation in Mainland China, the role of non-bank institutions in the residential mortgage market, the application of deep learning in credit risk assessment, and a monitoring framework for assessing Hong Kong dollar liquidity. The minutes of the Currency Board Committee meetings and the reports on the operation of the Currency Board system submitted by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) are available on the HKMA website.\n\n# Banknotes and coins\n\n# Hong Kong Banknotes\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to hold seminars to educate bank tellers, retail cashiers, and students about the design and anti-counterfeiting features of Hong Kong banknotes, enhancing their knowledge and skills in identifying genuine notes. In 2022, the HKMA conducted 15 seminars, attracting more than 4,200 participants.\n\n# Coin Collection Programme\n\nThe coin collecting initiative continues to be well-received by the public. Details of the initiative are featured in the \"Sustainable HKMA\" chapter of the \"Sustainability Report 2022\".\n\n# Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\n\nThe Exchange Fund Notes and Bonds Program continued to operate smoothly. To meet the sustained demand from banks for Exchange Fund Notes and taking into account market conditions, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued an additional HKD 40 billion in Exchange Fund Notes during the first two months of 2022, resulting in a corresponding decrease in the total outstanding amount. As of the end of 2022, the notional value of outstanding Exchange Fund Notes and Bonds amounted to approximately HKD 120.75 billion (Table 2).\n\nTable 2: Outstanding foreign exchange fund bills and bonds\n\n# Monetary Research\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMR) completed three policy research reports, published 24 research papers, and held 16 seminars and online seminars, covering monetary and financial research topics of strategic importance to Hong Kong and the surrounding region. HKIMR has also made further arrangements to release its research findings through a new open-access electronic journal, making the information accessible to a wider audience. In addition, HKIMR launched a new series of publications on its website, *Insights from Monetary Research Digest*, summarizing the institute's recent research findings and providing high-level, non-technical overviews for the public.\n\nIn addition to research findings, the research center also organized two international conferences and three online expert forums to promote dialogue and exchange on economic and financial affairs.\n\nOn April 12th, we co-hosted a webinar with the School of Finance on “Macroeconomic Developments, the Federal Reserve’s Tightening Monetary Policy, and the Development of the Offshore RMB Market,” inviting Mr. Ren Zhigang, former CEO of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, and Professor Huang Yiping, Deputy Dean of the National School of Development at Peking University and Guanghua Professor of Economics, as guest speakers. The webinar was live-streamed on multiple platforms, attracting a total of 840,000 online viewers in real-time.\n\nAn online webinar titled \"Transformation and Policy Choices in China's Real Estate Industry\" was held on June 24, featuring Ms. Qin Hong, a Senior Research Fellow at Renmin University of China and former Director of the Policy Research Center under the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, as a guest speaker, and moderated by Dr. Wang Tao, Head of Asia Economic Research and Chief China Economist at UBS. The webinar attracted nearly 1.13 million live online viewers from mainland China, Hong Kong, and other regions worldwide.\n\nOn August 25th, we co-hosted an online workshop with the Asian Development Bank and the Bank for International Settlements on the topic of Monetary Policy Spillovers, which was attended by over 200 experts and scholars from central banks, international financial organizations, and academia around the world.\n\nAs a side event of the International Financial Leaders Investment Summit, we co-hosted an online seminar with the Business School on November 2nd, \"Inflation in the Aftermath of COVID-19: Inevitable or Avoidable?\", and invited Dr. Glenn Pray, founder and chief economist of Global Money Observer and former chief economist of J.P. Morgan Asset Management, to provide analysis. Nearly 200 economists participated in the seminar online.\n\nOn November 23, the 12th Annual China Economic International Seminar was held with the theme \"Next Phase of China’s Economic Development.\" Dr. Wang Yiming, Vice President of the China Center for International Economic Exchanges and Chairman of the Academic Committee, delivered a keynote speech on the short-term and long-term prospects of China's economy. Additionally, four chief economists from different investment banks in the Greater China region shared their views on China's pandemic control policies, real estate market development, supply chain restructuring, and long-term growth prospects during the panel discussion. The seminar attracted over 1.18 million online viewers in real time.\n"}

銀行體系穩定\n\n儘管宏觀環境充滿不確定性及挑戰，加上金融市場異常波動，香港銀行體系於2022年維持穩健。年內金管局亦加強對認可機構信用及市場風險管理的監管。此外，鑑於網絡威脅持續增加及銀行業數碼轉型步伐加快，金管局與認可機構緊密合作，提升認可機構的運作穩健性及網絡防衛能力。\n\n操守監管方面，金管局加強有關「先買後付」產品的消費者保障，並就物業轉按交易提供多一種支付安排。金管局又與其他監管機構合作，就虛擬資產的可持續發展制定監管架構，精簡投資產品銷售程序，以及推出全新的信託業務監管制度。年內有關個人信貸資料的「多間信貸資料服務機構」模式下的「信貸資料平台」啟用，並推出新的強制性背景查核計劃，以應對「滾動的壞蘋果」現象。此外，面對因疫情而實施的旅遊限制，金管局協助推出便利措施讓客戶重新啟動銀行戶口。\n\n因應最新的香港洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險評估，金管局與銀行透過公私營夥伴合作（包括反訛騙及洗黑錢情報工作組），鞏固香港的打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集生態圈，以及加強應對騙案。此外，金管局亦與策略夥伴合作，以能更充分了解及有效管理日益複雜的地緣政治環境所帶來的風險及不穩定因素。金管局又透過「反洗錢合規科技實驗室」系列進一步推動業界運用數據及科技，並同時加快金管局在反洗錢工作中採用監管科技的步伐。在國際事務方面，金管局積極參與財務行動特別組織的工作。\n\n在2022年，本地就有關資本充足標準及披露標準等國際監管標準的實施上取得良好進展。此外，金管局亦大力提升業界的軟實力，包括與銀行業合作建立可持續的人才儲備，以及提升現有從業員的技能。年內金管局一直與銀行業緊密合作，改進及精簡監管政策與程序。\n\n金管局亦繼續致力推進在本地及國際層面的工作，以確保香港備有具公信力的處置機制。具體工作包括制定新處置標準；進行地區危機模擬演習，以及在所有具本地系統重要性銀行建立一層新的吸收虧損能力資源，標誌着金管局在提升處置可行性上立下里程碑。\n\n# 目標\n\n金管局的整體目標之一是促進銀行體系的安全及穩定。要達致這個目標，實有賴建立及維持具高度應對能力且能為香港經濟提供所需關鍵金融服務的金融體系。\n\n銀行可能因營運方式，甚或在極端情況下因失序地倒閉而影響銀行體系的穩定。作為監管當局，金融管理專員在保障金融穩定方面擔當重要角色，確保銀行有能力抵禦衝擊及應對危機恢復常態，以最終有助防止出現倒閉。金融管理專員負責對銀行進行審慎監管，以及認可香港的持牌銀行、有限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司（統稱「認可機構」）。\n\n香港的審慎監管制度並非為確保「零風險」而設。作為其中一個處置機制當局，金融管理專員力求確保一旦有認可機構不再可持續經營，能有秩序地處理其倒閉。為此，香港已設立金融機構處置機制，金融管理專員在該機制下為認可機構（以及其他類型機構）的處置機制當局。為落實香港的處置機制，有必要制定處置規則及政策標準、進行處置規劃以排除認可機構處置可行性的障礙，以及建立金管局處置瀕臨倒閉認可機構的運作能力。為有效執行上述工作，金管局採納與國際一致及協調的方法。\n\n金融管理專員亦負責指定及監察某些金融市場基建。金管局監察金融市場基建的目的，是促進有關基建的整體安全及效率、控制系統性風險，以及提高透明度。提升金融市場基建的抗震能力，能保障香港的貨幣與金融體系，避免因金融市場基建運作中斷而可能影響其穩定。\n\n# 2022年回顧\n\n# 牌照事宜\n\n年內金管局核准6個境外交易平台成為貨幣經紀，另有5間持牌銀行及1間有限制牌照銀行被撤銷認可資格。\n\n有關香港的認可機構及本地代表辦事處的更多資訊，請參閱分別載於第283至286頁及第292至295頁的附錄及表D至F。\n\n# 監管工作概覽\n\n在2022年金管局共進行183次非現場審查，涵蓋範圍甚廣，包括認可機構的CAMEL評估、企業管治、風險管理及採用金融科技的情況。為繼續加強認可機構的風險管治水平，金管局與認可機構董事局、獨立非執行董事或董事局轄下委員會共舉行36次會議，並與認可機構及其外聘核數師共舉行38次三方聯席會議。\n\n除了非現場審查工作外，金管局亦對認可機構的各項業務進行定期現場審查。從審慎監管角度而言，信用風險管理為主要監管重點之一。同時，由於銀行運用科技的情況日趨普及，業務操作風險及科技風險管理是另一個監管重點。隨着綠色及可持續銀行業在香港急速發展，金管局亦已進行一輪以氣候風險管理為重點的專題審查。在操守監管方面，金管局對認可機構的證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（強積金）相關業務進行現場審查，並以專題評估作為配合，以審視被評估為屬較高風險的範疇。\n\n表1載有金管局於2022年的監管工作概要。\n\n表1 監管工作概要\n\n# 信用風險\n\n# 信貸增長及資產質素\n\n2022年貸款總額減少3.0%，2021年則增加3.8%。表2列載各類貸款及墊款的增長情況。2022年內地相關貸款總額亦減少4.4%至45,220億港元（表3）。\n\n年內銀行體系受到來自各方面的挑戰和衝擊，包括第五波新冠疫情、地緣政治局勢升溫、主要央行進取的加息步伐及部分內地房地產發展商的財務狀況惡化等。儘管面對上述各種挑戰，銀行體系依然保持穩定及健全。\n\n銀行體系的資產質素在年內惡化，但仍然維持在健康水平。銀行業的特定分類貸款比率於2022年底為1.38%，高於2021年底的0.89%。內地相關貸款的特定分類貸款比率由一年前的0.89%上升至2.21%。\n\n年內金管局提升其風險監察的廣度與深度，並與認可機構緊密聯繫，以便對經濟及市場形勢，以至認可機構的風險管理措施及時作出評估。銀行體系面對的整體信用風險仍屬可控。金管局的償債壓力測試結果顯示，銀行體系繼續維持充足資本緩衝，能承受極端壓力。\n\n金管局在年內進行專題評估，檢視認可機構的信用風險管理，重點放在資產質素、對較易受影響行業的風險承擔、香港以外分行的信用風險，以及提供予私人銀行及財富管理客戶的有抵押貸款。\n\n另一方面，在充滿挑戰的宏觀經濟環境下，越來越多企業面對財政困難，金管局鼓勵認可機構按照《香港企業財務困難處理守則》所載的原則處理企業出現還款困難的情況，從而使個別認可機構能夠從有關貸款機構的共同利益角度出發協調合作。\n\n表3 內地相關貸款增長\n\n# 紓緩客戶的資金周轉壓力\n\n考慮到第五波新冠病毒疫情的打擊，加上外圍與本港經濟的前景仍然複雜多變，金管局聯同「銀行業中小企貸款協調機制」延長「預先批核還息不還本」計劃至2023年7月底。此外，該計劃亦推出及其後優化部分本金還款選項，協助客戶就最終回復正常還款作好準備。\n\n截至2022年底，銀行共批出108,000多宗企業客戶貸款展期及其他支援措施的個案，涉及金額超過1.1萬億港元。個人客戶方面，銀行亦批出81,000多宗住宅按揭還息不還本及其他個人應急貸款的個案，涉及金額超過650億港元。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n金管局自2009年起先後推出多輪逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施，已經加強銀行的風險管理及香港銀行體系抵禦本港樓市一旦逆轉的能力。新批出住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數於2022年12月為57%，而有關按揭成數於2009年9月推出首輪逆周期措施前為64%。新批出按揭的平均供款與入息比率維持在低水平，於2022年12月為39%，而在2010年8月首度推出有關比率上限時為41%（圖1）。\n\n金管局在9月將物業按揭貸款壓力測試的假設按揭利率上升幅度由300基點下調至200基點。金管局作出此決定時已考慮目前的利率環境，以及按揭息率走勢與其過往的長期平均水平。金管局認為此水平已經足夠確保銀行按揭業務風險得到妥善管理。\n\n圖1 新批出住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數及供款與入息比率\n\n# 業務操作及科技風險\n\n過去一年金管局推出多項措施加強銀行體系的運作穩健性。有關措施包括在5月發出《監管政策手冊》新單元「運作穩健性」，載明金管局預期認可機構為確保運作穩健而應維持的管治及管控架構，並舉辦兩場業界對話，增進業界對新標準的了解，以及促進業內的經驗交流（圖示1）。\n\n金管局又就銀行營運的具體範疇提供詳細監管指引，包括客戶資料保障、支付系統運作、雲端運算、支付卡保安及分散式阻斷服務攻擊防禦機制等。\n\n因應不斷轉變的網絡威脅，金管局透過推動銀行採納穩固三重數據備份安排、監察認可機構實施「網絡防衛評估框架」2.0的進度，以及評估銀行應對供應鏈攻擊的能力，力求提升銀行體系的網絡防衛能力。\n\n因應「網絡釣魚」騙案及其他網上詐騙的風險明顯增加，金管局與香港銀行公會（銀行公會）於9月聯合推出以「數碼KEY睇緊啲，撳LINK前要三思！」為主題的新一輪大型推廣活動，提高公眾的防範意識，又在7月與香港警務處合辦工作坊，向銀行講解騙徒的最新犯案手法。\n\n以「數碼KEY睇緊啲，撳LINK前要三思！」為主題的宣傳活動的海報\n\n圖示1 業界對話「邁向運作穩健之旅」\n\n# 流動性及市場風險\n\n面對主要經濟體進一步收緊貨幣政策導致市場波動加劇，金管局加強監察銀行的市場及流動性風險承擔。金管局進行審查，以檢視認可機構的流動性風險管理是否足夠，並聚焦於分散資金來源及集團內部流動性風險管理的制度及管控措施。此外，金管局亦進行審查，以評估認可機構的市場風險管理架構及財資業務管控措施的成效。\n","terms":{"12個月預期信用虧損":["12-month

macroeconomic environment full of uncertainty and challenges, coupled with abnormal volatility in financial markets, the banking sector in Hong Kong remained resilient in 2022. The HKMA also strengthened its supervision of credit and market risk management at authorized institutions throughout the year. Furthermore, given the continued increase in cyber threats and the accelerating pace of digital transformation in the banking industry, the HKMA worked closely with authorized institutions to enhance their operational resilience and cybersecurity capabilities.\n\nIn terms of conduct regulation, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has strengthened consumer protection for \"Buy Now, Pay Later\" products and introduced an additional payment arrangement for property refinancing transactions. The HKMA has also collaborated with other regulatory bodies to establish a regulatory framework for the sustainable development of virtual assets, streamline the sales process for investment products, and introduce a new regulatory regime for trust business. This year, the \"Credit Reference Platform\" under the \"Multiple Credit Reference Agencies (MCRAs)\" model for personal credit data was launched, along with a new mandatory background verification program to address the \"rolling bad apples\" phenomenon. In addition, in response to travel restrictions imposed due to the pandemic, the HKMA assisted in introducing convenient measures to help customers restart their bank accounts.\n\nIn response to the latest Hong Kong money laundering and terrorist financing risk assessment, the HKMA collaborates with banks through public-private partnerships (including the Anti-Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Working Group) to strengthen Hong Kong's fight against money laundering and terrorist financing ecosystem, as well as enhance efforts to combat fraud. Additionally, the HKMA also collaborates with strategic partners to better understand and effectively manage the risks and instability factors arising from the increasingly complex geopolitical environment. The HKMA further promotes the industry's use of data and technology through the \"AML Regtech Labs\" series, while simultaneously accelerating the adoption of regulatory technology in its anti-money laundering efforts. In terms of international affairs, the HKMA actively participates in the Financial Action Task Force's work.\n\nIn 2022, significant progress was made in the implementation of international regulatory standards, including capital adequacy and disclosure standards, locally. In addition, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) actively enhanced the industry's soft power by collaborating with the banking sector to establish a sustainable talent pool and improve the skills of existing professionals. Throughout the year, the HKMA maintained close collaboration with the banking industry to improve and streamline regulatory policies and procedures.\n\nThe HKMA continues to advance its work at both local and international levels to ensure Hong Kong has a credible resolution mechanism. Specific initiatives include the formulation of new resolution standards; conducting regional crisis simulation exercises; and establishing a new layer of loss-absorbing capacity resources in all systemically important local banks, marking a milestone in the HKMA's efforts to enhance the feasibility of resolution.\n\n# Objective\n\nOne of the HKMA’s overall objectives is to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this goal necessarily relies on establishing and maintaining a financial system that is highly resilient and capable of providing essential financial services for the Hong Kong economy.\n\nBanks may affect the stability of the banking system through their operational methods, or even through disorderly closures in extreme cases. As a regulatory authority, the Financial Secretary plays an important role in safeguarding financial stability, ensuring that banks have the capacity to withstand shocks and respond to crises to restore normal operations, ultimately helping to prevent closures. The Financial Secretary is responsible for prudential regulation of banks, as well as authorizing licensed banks, restricted license banks, and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong (collectively referred to as \"authorized institutions\").\n\nHong Kong’s prudent regulatory system is not designed to ensure “zero risk.” As one of the resolution authorities, the Monetary Authority strives to ensure that if a licensed institution is no longer viable, its resolution can be handled in an orderly manner. To this end, Hong Kong has established a resolution framework, under which the Monetary Authority serves as the resolution authority for licensed institutions (and other types of institutions). To implement Hong Kong’s resolution framework, it is necessary to formulate resolution rules and policy standards, conduct resolution planning to eliminate obstacles to the resolvability of licensed institutions, and establish the Monetary Authority’s operational capability to resolve near-failed licensed institutions. To effectively carry out the above work, the Monetary Authority adopts methods that are consistent with and coordinated with international practices.\n\nThe Financial Secretary is also responsible for designating and overseeing certain financial market infrastructures. The purpose of the Financial Secretary's oversight of financial market infrastructures is to promote the overall safety and efficiency of such infrastructures, control systemic risks, and enhance transparency. Strengthening the resilience of financial market infrastructures can safeguard Hong Kong's currency and financial system, preventing potential impacts on its stability that could arise from disruptions in the operation of financial market infrastructures.\n\n# 2022 Year in Review\n\n# License matters\n\nWithin the year, the Financial Supervisory Administration approved six overseas trading platforms to become currency brokers, while the licenses of five licensed banks and one restricted-license bank were revoked.\n\nFor more information about the accredited institutions and local representative offices in Hong Kong, please refer to the appendices on pages 283 to 286 and tables D to F on pages 292 to 295, respectively.\n\n# Regulatory Work Overview\n\nIn 2022, the HKMA conducted 183 on-site inspections, covering a wide range of areas including the CAMEL assessment of authorized institutions, corporate governance, risk management, and the adoption of financial technology. To further enhance the risk management standards of authorized institutions, the HKMA held 36 meetings with the boards of authorized institutions, independent non-executive directors, or committees under the boards, and 38 tripartite meetings with authorized institutions and their external auditors.\n\nIn addition to off-site review work, the HKMA also conducts regular on-site inspections of authorized institutions’ various business activities. From a prudential regulatory perspective, credit risk management is one of the primary regulatory focuses. At the same time, as the use of technology by banks becomes increasingly prevalent, operational risk and technology risk management are another regulatory focus. With the rapid development of green and sustainable banking in Hong Kong, the HKMA has also conducted a round of thematic reviews focusing on climate risk management. In terms of conduct regulation, the HKMA conducts on-site inspections of authorized institutions’ securities, investment product, insurance, and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) related businesses, and supplements these with thematic assessments to review areas identified as being of higher risk.\n\nTable 1 outlines the Financial Supervisory Commission’s regulatory work summary for 2022.\n\nTable 1: Regulatory Work Summary\n\n# Credit risk\n\n# Loan Growth and Asset Quality\n\nThe total loan amount in 2022 decreased by 3.0%, while it increased by 3.8% in 2021. Table 2 lists the growth rates of various loans and advances. The total amount of related loans in mainland China also decreased by 4.4% to 45,220 billion Hong Kong dollars (Table 3).\n\nThe banking system faced challenges and shocks from various sources during the year, including the fifth wave of the pandemic, escalating geopolitical tensions, aggressive interest rate hikes by major central banks, and the deterioration of financial conditions of some mainland real estate developers. Despite facing these various challenges, the banking system remained stable and sound.\n\nThe asset quality of the banking system deteriorated during the year but remained at a healthy level. The specific classified loan ratio for the banking sector was 1.38% at the end of 2022, higher than 0.89% at the end of 2021. The specific classified loan ratio for loans related to the mainland rose from 0.89% a year earlier to 2.21%.\n\nWithin the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) enhanced the breadth and depth of its risk oversight and maintained close communication with authorized institutions to promptly assess economic and market conditions, as well as the risk management measures of those institutions. The overall credit risk faced by the banking system remains manageable. The HKMA’s stress test results indicate that the banking system continues to maintain adequate capital buffers and can withstand severe economic pressures.\n\nThe HKMA conducts a thematic review during the year to examine the credit risk management of authorized institutions, focusing on asset quality, risk exposure to vulnerable industries, credit risk of branches outside Hong Kong, and secured loans provided to private banking and wealth management clients.\n\nOn the other hand, in a challenging macroeconomic environment, an increasing number of enterprises are facing financial difficulties. The HKMA encourages authorized institutions to handle cases of borrowers experiencing repayment difficulties in accordance with the principles set out in the Hong Kong Approach to Corporate Difficulties, thereby enabling individual authorized institutions to coordinate and cooperate from the perspective of the common interests of the relevant lending institutions.\n\nTable 3: Domestic-Related Loan Growth\n\n# Alleviate customers' fund turnover pressure\n\nTaking into account the impact of the fifth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the continued complex and volatile outlook for both the external and local economies, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, together with the \"Banking Sector Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) Lending Coordination Mechanism,\" has extended the \"Pre-approval Interest-Only Loan Repayment\" scheme until the end of July 2023. In addition, the scheme has introduced and subsequently optimized some principal repayment options to help customers prepare for resuming normal repayments in the long term.\n\nAs of the end of 2022, banks had approved over 108,000 cases of loan extensions and other support measures for corporate customers, involving amounts exceeding HK$1.1 trillion. For individual customers, banks also approved over 81,000 cases of residential mortgage principal repayment deferral and other personal emergency loans, involving amounts exceeding HK$65 billion.\n\n# Property Mortgage Lending\n\nSince 2009, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has introduced multiple rounds of countercyclical macro-prudential regulatory measures, which have enhanced banks' risk management capabilities and the Hong Kong banking system's ability to withstand potential reversals in the local property market. The average mortgage loan-to-value ratio for newly approved residential mortgages was 57% in December 2022, compared to 64% in September 2009 before the introduction of the first round of countercyclical measures. The average debt service-to-income ratio for newly approved mortgages has remained at a low level, at 39% in December 2022, compared to 41% in August 2010 when the relevant ratio cap was first introduced (Figure 1).\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) lowered the assumed mortgage rate increase in the property mortgage loan stress test from 300 basis points to 200 basis points in September. The HKMA made this decision after considering the current interest rate environment, as well as the trend of mortgage rates compared to their long-term average level. The HKMA believes this level is sufficient to ensure that risks in banks' mortgage businesses are adequately managed.\n\nFigure 1: Average Loan-to-Value Ratio and Debt-to-Income Ratio for Newly Approved Residential Mortgage Loans\n\n# Operational and technology risk\n\nOver the past year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has introduced multiple measures to enhance the operational resilience of the banking system. These measures included issuing a new section on \"Operational Resilience\" in the Supervisory Policy Manual in May, outlining the governance and control frameworks that authorized institutions are expected to maintain. The HKMA also hosted two industry dialogues to improve understanding of the new standards and facilitate knowledge sharing within the sector (Figure 1).\n\nThe Financial Supervisory Commission has also provided detailed regulatory guidance on specific aspects of bank operations, including customer data protection, payment system operations, cloud computing, payment card security, and defense mechanisms against distributed denial-of-service attacks.\n\nIn response to constantly evolving cyber threats, the Monetary Authority is working to enhance the cybersecurity resilience of the banking system by promoting banks' adoption of robust triple data backup arrangements, monitoring the progress of authorized institutions in implementing the \"Cyber Defense Assessment Framework\" 2.0, and assessing banks' ability to respond to supply chain attacks.\n\nIn response to the significant increase in risks such as phishing scams and other online fraud, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Hong Kong Bankers' Association (HKAB) jointly launched a new large-scale promotional campaign in September with the theme \"Digital Key: Keep an Eye Out, Think Twice Before Clicking the Link!\" to raise public awareness of prevention. In July, they also co-hosted a workshop with the Hong Kong Police Force to explain the latest scamming techniques to banks.\n\nPoster for a promotional campaign with the theme \"Look carefully at the digital key, think thrice before clicking the link!\"\n\nFigure 1: Industry Dialogues \"A Journey Toward Operational Stability\"\n\n# Liquidity and market risk\n\nFacing increased market volatility resulting from further tightening of monetary policies by major economies, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is strengthening its monitoring of banks’ market and liquidity risk exposures. The HKMA is conducting a review to assess whether authorized institutions’ liquidity risk management is adequate, focusing on the systems and control measures for diversifying funding sources and managing liquidity risk within groups. Furthermore, the HKMA is also conducting a review to evaluate the effectiveness of authorized institutions’ market risk management framework and measures for controlling financial businesses.\n"}

香港的國際金融中心地位\n\n金管局在2022年多管齊下，在提升香港作為具全球競爭力的國際金融中心的地位方面取得重要進展。\n\n「國際金融領袖投資峰會」舉辦成功，吸引來自約120間環球金融機構超過200位國際及區內領袖參加，不僅鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位，更製造正面的漣漪效應。\n\n在鞏固香港作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐方面，多個範疇均取得理想進展，包括優化金管局與中國人民銀行之間現有的貨幣互換協議，以及金管局的人民幣流動資金安排，確保有足夠人民幣流動性，協助進一步推進離岸人民幣產品及市場發展；與中國人民銀行和證券及期貨事務監察委員會聯合宣布開展「互換通」；與證券及期貨事務監察委員會和香港交易及結算所有限公司合作推出雙櫃台莊家機制，推動人民幣計價股票在香港交易；以及金管局推出多年期計劃，進一步優化金融市場基建及發展債務工具中央結算系統成為亞洲區主要的國際中央證券託管平台。受惠於充足的人民幣流動性，並憑藉世界級的市場基建及內地與香港之間各個互聯互通機制，香港已成為內地資金進入國際市場及國際投資者投資於快速增長的內地市場的首選平台。\n\n金管局在加強香港金融平台的競爭力方面亦取得良好進展，涵蓋債券發行、資產及財富管理、企業財資中心，以及綠色和可持續金融等範疇。為宣傳香港的金融服務，金管局加強向海外及內地持份者的市場推廣工作，讓大家認識香港穩健的金融體系及其帶來的前景。\n\n與此同時，金管局繼續推行「金融科技2025」策略，促進金融業界更廣泛採用金融科技全面鞏固香港的金融科技樞紐地位。快速支付系統「轉數快」繼續穩步增長，登記數目在3月份突破1,000萬個，每日平均交易量亦在9月份超越100萬宗。\n\n金管局繼續積極參與國際及區內的央行及監管組織，對維持金融穩定及促進市場發展的全球工作作出貢獻。\n\n# 概覽\n\n金管局繼續主動提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。於11月，金管局舉辦「國際金融領袖投資峰會」，落實財政司司長在《2022至23年度財政預算案》宣布的計劃。峰會為期3日，雲集國際金融業界翹楚，就如何在各項不確定因素下把握機遇分享各自獨到的觀點。是項活動獲得極大迴響，吸引超過200位來自約120個國際金融機構的重量級嘉賓參加，充分體現全球金融界對香港的支持。\n\n香港進一步鞏固其作為離岸人民幣樞紐的地位，年內離岸人民幣業務穩健增長。香港在促進內地與國際金融市場之間的資金流方面發揮關鍵作用，香港與內地間的互聯互通機制被公認為國際投資者進入在岸資本市場及內地投資者配置離岸資產的首選渠道。在2022年，債券通「北向通」成交額佔境外投資者在中國銀行間債券市場整體成交額的61%。債券通「南向通」及「跨境理財通」自2021年開通以來一直運作暢順。金管局與中國人民銀行（人民銀行）和證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）聯合宣布開展「互換通」，把香港與內地的金融合作進一步擴展至衍生品市場，並強化了香港作為主要離岸人民幣業務樞紐及風險管理中心的地位。金管局與人民銀行之間現有的貨幣互換協議於7月優化，是加強香港作為離岸人民幣業務樞紐的另一重要里程碑。\n\n為在香港提供更多元的人民幣計價產品，由金管局、證監會與香港交易及結算所有限公司（港交所）組成的工作小組完成擴大人民幣在港股市場交易中的使用的可行性研究。工作小組已展開籌備工作，包括推出雙櫃台莊家機制，以優化港幣及人民幣雙櫃台股票的交易機制。\n\n金管局繼續致力提升香港金融平台的競爭力。具體而言，為增加香港作為首選基金管理中心的吸引力，金管局與政府及金融業緊密合作，締造更便利的稅務及監管環境。在推動香港債券市場創新，以及鞏固香港作為區內綠色和可持續金融樞紐的地位方面，亦取得重大進展。與此同時，金管局加強市場推廣，向海外及內地持份者介紹香港的金融服務。\n\n金管局金融科技促進辦公室繼續與各銀行部門聯手實施「金融科技2025」策略，促進業界廣泛採用金融科技，並提升香港作為亞洲金融科技樞紐的地位。年內推行的主要措施包括：\n- 促進合規科技應用及進行金融科技應用評估；\n- 推動批發層面央行數碼貨幣的工作，致力改善跨境支付；\n- 加深在香港發行零售層面央行數碼貨幣（即「數碼港元」或e-HKD）的研究；\n- 推出「商業數據通」；\n- 加強人才培育；\n- 善用資源政策支持金融科技生態圈；\n- 加強跨境金融科技合作；及\n- 推動更廣泛使用快速支付系統「轉數快」。\n\n金融基建的可靠及有效運作，是鞏固香港作為主要國際金融中心地位的關鍵。在2022年，處理銀行同業交易的4個即時支付結算系統（RTGS系統）、債務工具中央結算系統(CMU)及香港交易資料儲存庫均達到100%2的系統可供使用率，高於99.95%的目標水平。債券通「北向通」及「南向通」的交收服務維持暢順。年底時存放在CMU系統的債券中，未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額為12,075億港元，其他債券的未償還總額增至相當於15,733億港元，是2013年以來最高水平。\n\n「轉數快」使用量在2022年繼續增長。截至2022年底共有1,148萬個登記，每日平均交易量較2021年上升40%。除個人對個人支付及商業支付穩步增長外，透過「轉數快」繳付政府帳單、支付予商戶及為儲值支付工具電子錢包或銀行帳戶增值持續增加，是帶動「轉數快」交易量顯著增長的主要原因。\n\n為促進本地零售支付業的安全及效率，金管局根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（《支付條例》）監察6個指定零售支付系統，並監管17個持牌儲值支付工具（其中4個由持牌銀行發行）。年內為繼續協助政府順利實施消費券計劃，金管局協調及促進相關政府部門與就計劃獲委任的儲值支付工具持牌人之間的溝通及合作。\n\n金管局在2023年1月發布加密資產和穩定幣討論文件的總結，歸納就討論文件收集到的意見和金管局的回應。總結文件確認金管局將會以風險為本和靈活的方式監管穩定幣，並闡述預期的監管範圍、主要的監管要求及下一步的工作。\n\n在國際層面，金管局積極參與中央銀行領域的事務，在多個區內及國際委員會擔當領導角色。自2018年起，金管局在東亞及太平洋地區中央銀行會議(EMEAP)3轄下金融市場工作小組連任三屆主席。此外，金管局擔任巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（巴塞爾委員會）轄下政策及標準小組，以及金融穩定理事會轄下非銀行監察專家小組與金融創新網絡的聯席主席，另又領導金融穩定理事會轄下監察金融基準過渡相關監管事項的進度及作出跟進的小組。\n\n# 2022年回顧\n\n# 國際金融領袖投資峰會\n\n「國際金融領袖投資峰會」於11月1日至3日舉行\n\n繼財政司司長在《2022至23年度財政預算案》宣布，金管局於11月舉辦「國際金融領袖投資峰會」。峰會為期3日，反響熱烈，匯聚26位金融業界翹楚就應對經濟、金融、科技及地緣政治不穩定因素，以及如何把握當中的機遇分享獨到觀點和想法。峰會共有超過200位來自約120間全球金融機構的參加者，當中超過40間機構均由集團董事長或行政總裁親自出席。參與峰會的機構不乏位列全球最大的銀行、證券、資產管理、主權財富基金、私募股權與風險投資、對冲基金及保險公司等金融界別。\n\n峰會向全球發出明確訊息，表明香港已經一切復常；全球金融領袖可以親身感受香港獨有的韌性和活力並了解發展亞洲業務的過程中香港可以提供的機遇。\n\n# 香港作為進入內地的主要門戶及全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐\n\n香港致力鞏固其作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位，包括增強離岸流動性、進一步加強與內地金融市場的聯通，以及提升金融市場基建。年內人民幣業務，包括銀行存款、貿易結算、支付及離岸債券發行，繼續錄得穩健增長。在增強流動性、產品開發及擴大互聯互通機制方面，取得令人鼓舞的進展及成績。2022年國際結算銀行三年一度的外匯及衍生工具市場成交額調查結果，再次確認香港作為人民幣外匯中心的領先地位。\n\n債券通「北向通」繼續是國際投資者透過香港的市場基建及金融服務投資內地債券市場的主要渠道。債券通「北向通」於2022年的平均每日成交額達322億元人民幣（較2021年增加25%），佔境外投資者於中國銀行間債券市場整體成交額的61%。\n\n債券通「北向通」於7月份推出技術優化措施，包括將投資者參與境內債券一級市場發行的流程電子化及降低服務費。這些市場為本的優化措施提高債券通「北向通」的運作效率，亦降低投資者的交易成本。\n\n為完善債券通「北向通」的配套，並便利國際投資者管理內地債券投資相關的利率風險，香港與內地於7月宣布開展兩地利率互換市場互聯互通合作（「互換通」）。「互換通」初期會先開通北向交易，讓國際投資者透過香港與內地基礎設施機構之間的連接交易內地的利率互換產品，從而強化香港作為風險管理中心的地位。「互換通」籌備工作正在有序推進，以期盡快開通北向交易。金管局會繼續聯同有關當局及機構探索提供更多元化的風險管理工具，包括推出離岸國債期貨，進一步支持國際投資者投資內地債券市場。\n\n債券通「南向通」於2021年開通以來市場反應正面，運作暢順，交易涵蓋可在香港市場買賣並以多種貨幣計價的主要債券產品。「南向通」促進了離岸人民幣市場的發展，尤其人民幣計價債務工具發行的顯著增長。金管局正與內地有關當局緊密合作，研究優化債券通「南向通」，促進香港債券市場的多元發展。\n","terms":{"12個月預期信用虧損":["12-month

International Financial Center\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority made significant progress in 2022 in enhancing Hong Kong’s position as a globally competitive international financial centre through a multi-pronged approach.\n\nThe Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit was successfully held, attracting over 200 international and regional leaders from approximately 120 global financial institutions, not only consolidating Hong Kong’s position as an international financial center but also creating a positive ripple effect.\n\nSignificant progress has been made in strengthening Hong Kong's position as a global offshore RMB hub across multiple areas. These include optimizing the existing currency swap agreements between the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the People's Bank of China (PBOC), as well as the HKMA's RMB liquidity arrangements, ensuring sufficient RMB liquidity to support the further development of offshore RMB products and markets; jointly announcing the launch of \"Swap Connect\" with the PBOC and the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC); and collaborating with the SFC and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) to introduce a dual-counter market maker mechanism, promoting the trading of RMB-denominated stocks in Hong Kong. Additionally, the HKMA has launched a multi-year plan to further enhance financial market infrastructure and develop the Central Clearing and Settlement System for Debt Instruments into a major international central securities custody platform in Asia. Benefiting from ample RMB liquidity and supported by world-class market infrastructure and various interconnectivity mechanisms between Mainland China and Hong Kong, Hong Kong has become the preferred platform for Mainland China funds to enter international markets and for international investors to invest in the rapidly growing Mainland China market.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has made significant progress in enhancing the competitiveness of Hong Kong's financial platform, covering areas such as bond issuance, asset and wealth management, corporate treasury centres, and green and sustainable finance. To promote Hong Kong's financial services, the HKMA has intensified its marketing efforts towards overseas and mainland stakeholders, raising awareness of Hong Kong's robust financial system and the opportunities it offers.\n\nAt the same time, the HKMA continues to implement the Fintech 2025 strategy, promoting wider adoption of fintech in the financial industry and further consolidating Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub. The Faster Payment System continues to grow steadily, with the number of registrations exceeding 10 million in March, and the average daily transaction volume surpassing 1 million in September.\n\nThe Monetary Authority continues to actively participate in international and regional central bank and regulatory organizations, contributing to global efforts in maintaining financial stability and promoting market development.\n\n# Overview\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to proactively enhance Hong Kong's competitiveness as an international financial center. In November, the HKMA hosted the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit, implementing the plan announced by the Financial Secretary in the 2022-23 Annual Budget Speech. The three-day summit brought together leading figures from the international financial industry to share their unique perspectives on seizing opportunities amidst various uncertainties. This event received significant attention, attracting over 200 participants from approximately 120 international financial institutions, fully demonstrating the global financial community's support for Hong Kong.\n\nHong Kong has further solidified its position as an offshore RMB hub, with steady growth in offshore RMB business throughout the year. Hong Kong plays a key role in facilitating capital flows between the Mainland and international financial markets, and the connectivity mechanisms between Hong Kong and the Mainland are widely recognized as the preferred channels for international investors to access onshore capital markets and for Mainland investors to allocate offshore assets. In 2022, transactions under the Northbound Bond Connect accounted for 61% of the overall trading volume of foreign investors in the China interbank bond market. The Southbound Bond Connect and Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect have been operating smoothly since their launch in 2021. The HKMA, together with the People's Bank of China (PBoC) and the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), jointly announced the launch of Swap Connect, further extending financial cooperation between Hong Kong and the Mainland to the derivatives market and strengthening Hong Kong’s position as a major offshore RMB business hub and risk management center. The existing currency swap agreement between the HKMA and the PBoC was optimized in July, marking another important milestone in strengthening Hong Kong’s position as an offshore RMB business hub.\n\nTo provide a wider range of Renminbi-denominated products in Hong Kong, a working group comprising the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the Securities and Futures Commission, and the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) has completed a feasibility study on expanding the use of Renminbi in the Hong Kong stock market. The working group has initiated preparatory work, including the introduction of a dual trading desk mechanism to optimize the trading mechanisms for stocks traded in both Hong Kong dollars and Renminbi.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to be committed to enhancing the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial sector. Specifically, to increase Hong Kong’s attractiveness as a leading fund management center, the HKMA is working closely with the Government and the financial industry to create a more convenient tax and regulatory environment. Significant progress has also been made in promoting innovation in the Hong Kong bond market and consolidating Hong Kong’s position as a regional hub for green and sustainable finance. At the same time, the HKMA has strengthened market promotion efforts to introduce Hong Kong’s financial services to overseas and mainland stakeholders.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Fintech Promotion Office continues to collaborate with various banking sectors to implement the \"Fintech 2025\" strategy, promoting widespread adoption of fintech solutions and enhancing Hong Kong's position as Asia's fintech hub. Key initiatives to be rolled out this year include:  \n- Promoting the application of compliance technology and conducting fintech application assessments;  \n- Advancing work on central bank digital currency at the wholesale level, striving to improve cross-border payments;  \n- Deepening research on issuing central bank digital currency at the retail level in Hong Kong (i.e., \"e-HKD\");  \n- Launching the \"Commercial Data Interchange\" (CDI);  \n- Strengthening talent development;  \n- Leveraging resource policies to support the fintech ecosystem;  \n- Enhancing cross-border fintech collaboration; and  \n- Promoting broader adoption of the fast payment system \"Faster Payment System\" (FPS).\n\nThe reliable and efficient operation of financial infrastructure is key to maintaining Hong Kong's status as a major international financial center. In 2022, the four real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems handling bank-to-bank transactions, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU), and the Hong Kong Trading Data Repository all achieved 100% system availability, exceeding the target level of 99.95%. Settlement services for Northbound Bond Connect and Southbound Bond Connect remained smooth. By year-end, the outstanding amount of foreign exchange fund notes and bonds held in the CMU system totaled HKD 12,075 billion, while the outstanding amount of other bonds increased to HKD 15,733 billion, the highest level since 2013.\n\nThe use of Faster Payment System grew steadily in 2022. As of the end of 2022, there were a total of 11.48 million registered users, with the average daily transaction volume increasing by 40% compared to 2021. In addition to the steady growth of person-to-person payments and commercial payments, the use of Faster Payment System to pay government bills, make payments to merchants, and top up stored-value payment tools such as e-wallets or bank accounts continued to increase, which was a major driver of the significant growth in Faster Payment System transaction volume.\n\nTo promote the safety and efficiency of local retail payment services, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority oversees six designated retail payment systems and regulates 17 licensed stored value facilities (of which four are issued by licensed banks) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO). This year, to continue assisting the government in the smooth implementation of the consumption voucher scheme, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority coordinates and facilitates communication and cooperation among the relevant government departments and the licensed stored value facility operators appointed for the scheme.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) released a summary in January 2023 of its discussion paper on crypto assets and stablecoins, summarizing the feedback received and the HKMA’s responses. The summary confirms that the HKMA will regulate stablecoins in a risk-based and flexible manner, and outlines the expected regulatory scope, key regulatory requirements, and next steps.\n\nOn an international level, the Monetary Authority actively participates in central banking matters and assumes a leadership role in numerous regional and international committees. Since 2018, the Monetary Authority has served as the chairman for three consecutive terms of the Financial Market Workstream under the East Asia and Pacific Regional Financial Stability Forum (EMEAP). In addition, the Monetary Authority serves as the co-chair of the Policy and Standards Group under the Basel Committee, as well as the Non-Bank Supervision Expert Group and Financial Innovation Network under the Financial Stability Board, and also leads the group responsible for monitoring the progress and follow-up of regulatory matters related to the transition of financial benchmarks under the Financial Stability Board.\n\n# 2022 Year in Review\n\n# Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit\n\nThe Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit will be held from November 1st to 3rd.\n\nFollowing the Financial Secretary’s announcement in the “2022-23 Budget” that the Hong Kong Monetary Authority would host the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit in November, the Summit was held for three days to great acclaim, bringing together 26 leaders in the financial industry to share unique perspectives and ideas on addressing economic, financial, technological, and geopolitical instability, as well as how to seize the opportunities within them. The Summit attracted over 200 participants from approximately 120 global financial institutions, with over 40 institutions represented by their group chairmen or CEOs in person. Participating institutions included some of the world’s largest banks, securities firms, asset management companies, sovereign wealth funds, private equity and venture capital firms, hedge funds, and insurance companies.\n\nThe summit sent a clear message to the world, indicating that Hong Kong has fully returned to normal; global financial leaders can personally experience Hong Kong’s unique resilience and dynamism and understand the opportunities Hong Kong can offer in the process of developing business in Asia.\n\n# Hong Kong serves as a major gateway to the Mainland and a global hub for offshore RMB business.\n\nHong Kong is committed to consolidating its position as a global hub for offshore RMB businesses, including enhancing offshore liquidity, further strengthening connectivity with the mainland financial markets, and upgrading financial market infrastructure. Within the year, RMB-related activities, including bank deposits, trade settlement, payments, and offshore bond issuance, continued to record steady growth. Encouraging progress and notable achievements have been made in enhancing liquidity, product development, and expanding cross-border connectivity mechanisms. The 2022 Triennial Central Bank Survey of Foreign Exchange and Derivatives Markets, conducted by the Bank for International Settlements, once again confirmed Hong Kong’s leading position as an RMB foreign exchange center.\n\nNorthbound Bond Connect continues to be the primary channel for international investors to access the mainland bond market through Hong Kong’s market infrastructure and financial services. The average daily turnover of Northbound Bond Connect reached RMB 32.2 billion in 2022 (a 25% increase compared to 2021), accounting for 61% of the total turnover of the China interbank bond market by overseas investors.\n\nNorthbound Bond Connect launched technical optimization measures in July, including the digitization of the process for investors to participate in the primary market issuance of domestic bonds and a reduction in service fees. These market-oriented optimization measures enhance the operational efficiency of Northbound Bond Connect and reduce investors' transaction costs.\n\nTo improve the arrangements for the \"Northbound Trading\" component of the Bond Connect program and to facilitate international investors in managing interest rate risks related to their investments in mainland bonds, Hong Kong and the mainland announced in July the launch of a cross-border connectivity cooperation initiative between the two regions' interest rate swap markets (\"Swap Connect\"). Initially, \"Swap Connect\" will commence with Northbound trading, allowing international investors to trade mainland interest rate swap products through the connection between Hong Kong and mainland infrastructure institutions, thereby strengthening Hong Kong's position as a risk management center. The preparation work for \"Swap Connect\" is proceeding in an orderly manner, with the aim of launching Northbound trading as soon as possible. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority will continue to work with relevant authorities and institutions to explore more diversified risk management tools, including the introduction of offshore government bond futures, to further support international investors in investing in the mainland bond market.\n\nSince its launch in 2021, Southbound Bond Connect has received positive market responses, operated smoothly, and facilitated transactions covering major bond products that can be traded in the Hong Kong market and priced in multiple currencies. Southbound Bond Connect has promoted the development of the offshore RMB market, particularly the significant growth in the issuance of RMB-denominated debt instruments. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is closely cooperating with relevant mainland authorities to study the optimization of Southbound Bond Connect, promoting the diversified development of Hong Kong's bond market.\n"}
{"zh":"# 儲備管理\n\n2022年的投資環境異常動盪，多種資產類別的價格同時下挫，不僅打破同時持有股票與債券可產生緩減風險作用的傳統投資智慧，更成為近半世紀以來唯一一次股票、債券及主要非美元貨幣匯兌同時錄得負回報的一年。在如此惡劣的投資環境下，外匯基金在2022年錄得投資回報率負4.5%。與年內大部分多元資產基金蒙受重大虧損的情況相比，外匯基金的表現反映金管局的多元化長期資產配置，以及因應外圍最新局勢變化而作出的防禦性部署及戰略性調整，有效減低市場風暴帶來的衝擊。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》，外匯基金的首要目的是直接或間接影響港元匯價，亦可運用於保持香港貨幣及金融體系穩定健全，藉此保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。金管局根據財政司司長轉授的權力及轉授權力的條款，就外匯基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標及組合架構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會為外匯基金制定下列投資目標：\n(i) 保障資本；\n(ii) 確保整體貨幣基礎在任何時候都由流通性極高的美元資產提供十足支持；\n(iii) 確保流動資金足以維持貨幣及金融穩定；以及\n(iv) 在符合上述(i)至(iii)項的前提下盡量爭取投資回報，以保障外匯基金的長期購買力。\n\n以上目標全面顧及外匯基金的法定目的，並已於外匯基金的組合架構及目標資產配置中反映（圖示1）。\n\n圖示1 外匯基金的投資組合類別\n\n外匯基金大致上分成兩個主要組合：支持組合及投資組合。支持組合持有流通性極高的美元資產，按照貨幣發行局制度的規定為貨幣基礎提供十足支持。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員經濟體的債市及股市，以保障資產的價值及長期購買力。\n\n為能更妥善管理風險及提高中長期回報，金管局以審慎及循序漸進方式將外匯基金的部分資產配置於較多元化的資產類別，包括新興巿場及內地債券與股票、私募股權（包括基建）及房地產。新興巿場及內地債券與股票由投資組合持有，私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合持有。長期增長組合的目標資產配置與其他資產類別的配置，按審慎的風險管理原則及資產組合多元化策略一起制定。\n\n策略性資產組合於2007年設立，一直持有政府基於策略性目的而為外匯基金帳目購入的香港交易及結算所有限公司股份。由於這個組合性質獨特，因此外匯基金的投資表現評估並無將其包括在內。\n\n# 於外匯基金的存款\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定組織的存款，利率一般與投資組合的表現掛鈎，但未來基金屬主要個別例子。未來基金存款的利率與投資組合及長期增長組合的回報掛鈎，實際利率視乎組合比重而定。未來基金在投資組合與長期增長組合的比重於2022年約為35：65。\n\n# 投資程序\n\n外匯基金的投資程序分別以策略性資產配置及戰略性資產配置作基礎。策略性資產配置以投資基準方式反映，亦即外匯基金為達到投資目標而可作出的長線資產配置。外匯基金以策略性配置作為指引，透過戰略性的資產配置，以爭取超越基準的回報。因此，實際配置往往會與基準配置（亦即策略性配置）有所偏離，而實際與基準配置之間的差距稱為「戰略性偏離」。財政司司長經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後制定投資基準及循跡誤差限額，金管局獲授權決定戰略性資產配置及定出戰略性偏離的容許範圍。投資組合經理可在戰略性偏離的容許範圍內管理倉盤，從短期市場變化中獲利。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局的外匯基金投資辦公室專責外匯基金的投資及相關風險管理職能。該辦公室職員負責直接管理外匯基金約70%的投資，包括整個支持組合及部分投資組合。該部分內部管理的投資組合包括不同的環球定息市場投資，並透過衍生工具執行外匯基金的宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 外聘投資經理\n\n除透過內部職員管理資產外，金管局亦僱用外聘投資經理負責管理外匯基金約30%的資產，包括所有上市股票組合及其他特別資產類別。僱用外聘投資經理的目的是要運用市場上最佳的專業投資專才為外匯基金投資，獲取可持續回報，並讓外匯基金受惠於多元化及互補的投資方式，以及汲取市場心得與專門的投資知識。\n\n僱用外聘投資經理的相關支出包括基金管理與託管費、交易費、預扣稅及其他稅項。這些支出主要受市場因素影響而每年不同。\n\n# 風險管理及監察\n\n投資環境越趨複雜，風險管理的重要性不言而喻。金管局為內部及外聘投資經理所管理的投資組合均訂下嚴格管控措施及投資指引，並設立嚴謹的風險監察及合規制度。金管局為投資相關活動設有三重防線，以實施有效的風險管理及管治。金管局定期監察主要投資風險類別（包括信用、市場、流動性及業務操作風險），而風險管理程序的設置為外匯基金的策略性規劃及多元化投資提供穩健的框架。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n金管局相信透過適度強調負責任投資及考慮各項投資的可持續長期表現，可更有效達致外匯基金的投資目標，並且減低投資活動涉及的環境、社會及管治(ESG)相關風險。當ESG投資與其他投資項目的經風險調整長期收益相若時，金管局一般會按既定指導性原則優先考慮ESG投資，並已將ESG因素併入外匯基金的公開市場及私募市場的投資管理過程中。有關金管局的負責任投資框架及落實情況，詳見《二零二二年可持續發展報告》之「負責任投資」一章。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2022 年的金融市場\n\n2022年環球金融市場異常波動，債市及股市分別累計下跌16.2%及19.8%，跌幅顯著。\n\n受累於全球通脹飆升、緊縮貨幣政策及經濟增長放緩，年內主要股市指數大幅下挫。儘管環球股市因市場出現通脹及利率見頂的憧憬而於年末稍作反彈，年內美國標準普爾500指數仍下跌19.4%，香港恒生指數則下跌15.5%。\n\n由於各國央行進取加息以對抗通脹，觸發主要市場國債收益率持續飆升。美國10年期國債收益率從2022年初的1.63%一直攀升，至第4季升穿4%，達2008年以來最高水平。美國國債收益率曲線自年中開始已出現倒掛，幅度不斷擴大，加深市場對經濟衰退的憂慮。\n\n貨幣市場方面，在美國聯邦儲備局連續加息帶動下，美元在2022年大幅走強。其他主要貨幣，包括歐元、英鎊、日圓及人民幣兌美元匯率大幅貶值，其中英鎊及日圓兌美元分別貶值10.7%及12.2%。\n\n表1列載主要貨幣、債巿及股市在2022年的表現。\n\n表1 2022年市場回報\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n外匯基金在2022年錄得2,054億港元的投資虧損，其中包括債券投資虧損532億港元、股票投資虧損805億港元（其中包括境外股票投資虧損610億港元及香港股票投資虧損195億港元）、非港元資產外匯估值下調400億港元，以及外匯基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資虧損317億港元。另一方面，策略性資產組合錄得87億港元估值虧損。\n\n於2022年年底，外匯基金的資產總值達40,080億港元。長期增長組合投資的總市值為4,847億港元，其中私募股權為3,700億港元，房地產為1,147億港元。長期增長組合中已承擔但尚未提取作投資的總額為2,708億港元。\n\n外匯基金（不包括策略性資產組合）在2022年的投資回報率為負4.5%，其中投資組合的回報率為負8.6%，支持組合為負0.4%。長期增長組合自2009年開展投資以來的內部回報率年率為12.6%。\n\n圖1列明外匯基金由1994至2022年的年度回報率。表2顯示外匯基金在2022年的投資回報率及不同年期的平均投資回報率。外匯基金在2020至2022年的平均回報率為1.5%、2018至2022年為2.3%、2013至2022年為2.4%，以及自1994年起計為4.5%。表3列載外匯基金資產於2022年12月31日的貨幣比重。\n\n有關外匯基金的經審計2022年度財務報表，見第173至281頁。\n\n圖1

investment environment in 2022 was exceptionally volatile, with prices across various asset classes declining simultaneously, breaking the traditional investment wisdom that holding both stocks and bonds could mitigate risk. It also became the only year in nearly half a century in which stocks, bonds, and major non-USD currency exchange rates all recorded negative returns. In such a challenging investment environment, the foreign exchange fund recorded a negative investment return of 4.5% in 2022. Compared to the significant losses suffered by most multi-asset funds during the year, the foreign exchange fund’s performance reflects the regulator's diversified long-term asset allocation, as well as defensive deployments and strategic adjustments made in response to changes in the external situation, effectively reducing the impact of the market storm.\n\n# Exchange Fund\n\nUnder the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the primary purpose of the Exchange Fund is to directly or indirectly influence the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar and may also be used to maintain the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's monetary and financial system, thereby preserving Hong Kong's status as an international financial center. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is accountable to the Financial Secretary for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund under the delegated powers and the terms of the delegated authority conferred by the Financial Secretary.\n\n# Foreign exchange fund management.\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nThe Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee has set the following investment objectives for the Foreign Exchange Fund:\n(i) to safeguard capital;\n(ii) to ensure that the overall monetary base is at all times fully backed by highly liquid U.S. dollar assets;\n(iii) to ensure that sufficient liquidity is available to maintain monetary and financial stability; and\n(iv) to seek investment returns as far as possible, subject to the above (i) to (iii), in order to safeguard the long-term purchasing power of the Foreign Exchange Fund.\n\nThe above objectives fully consider the statutory purposes of the foreign exchange fund and have been reflected in its portfolio structure and target asset allocation (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 illustrates the categories of the foreign exchange fund’s investment portfolio.\n\nThe foreign exchange fund is generally divided into two main portfolios: supporting portfolio and investment portfolio. The supporting portfolio holds highly liquid U.S. dollar assets, providing ample support for the currency base as stipulated by the currency issuance system. The investment portfolio primarily invests in bond and stock markets of member economies of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to safeguard asset value and long-term purchasing power.\n\nTo better manage risk and enhance long-term returns, the Monetary Authority has, in a prudent and gradual manner, allocated a portion of the Exchange Fund’s assets to a more diversified range of asset classes, including emerging markets and Mainland bonds and stocks, private equity amounting (including infrastructure) and real estate. Emerging markets and Mainland bonds and stocks are held by the investment portfolio, while private equity amounting and real estate investments are held by the long-term growth portfolio. The target asset allocation of the long-term growth portfolio, in conjunction with the allocation to other asset classes, is formulated based on prudent risk management principles and a diversified asset allocation strategy.\n\nThe Strategic Asset Portfolio was established in 2007 and has continuously held shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited purchased by the government for strategic purposes through the Exchange Fund. Due to the unique nature of this portfolio, it has not been included in the Exchange Fund’s investment performance evaluation.\n\n# Deposits in the Foreign Exchange Fund\n\nThe Foreign Exchange Fund regularly accepts deposits from fiscal reserves, government funds, and statutory organizations, with interest rates generally linked to the performance of the investment portfolio. However, the Future Fund serves as a key example of such deposits. The interest rate on Future Fund deposits is tied to the returns of both the investment portfolio and the long-term growth portfolio, with the actual interest rate depending on the allocation between these portfolios. In 2022, the proportion of the Future Fund allocated to the investment portfolio and the long-term growth portfolio was approximately 35:65.\n\n# Investment Process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is based on both strategic asset allocation and tactical asset allocation. Strategic asset allocation is reflected through an investment benchmark, which represents the long-term asset allocation that the Exchange Fund can make in pursuit of its investment objectives. The Exchange Fund uses strategic allocation as a guide, and through tactical asset allocation, it aims to achieve returns that exceed the benchmark. Therefore, actual allocation often deviates from the benchmark allocation (i.e., the strategic allocation), and the difference between the actual allocation and the benchmark allocation is referred to as \"tactical deviations.\" The Financial Secretary sets the investment benchmark and tracking error limits after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is authorized to determine the strategic asset allocation and set the allowable range of tactical deviations. Portfolio managers can manage their portfolios within the allowable range of tactical deviations to profit from short-term market fluctuations.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct Investment\n\nThe Monetary Authority’s foreign exchange fund investment office is responsible for the investment and related risk management functions of the foreign exchange fund. The office’s staff are responsible for directly managing approximately 70% of the foreign exchange fund’s investments, including the entire supporting portfolio and part of the investment portfolio. This portion of internally managed investment portfolio includes investments in various global fixed income markets, and executes the foreign exchange fund’s macroeconomic risk management strategies through derivative instruments.\n\n# External Fund Managers\n\nBesides managing assets through internal staff, the Financial Supervisory Commission also hires external investment managers to manage approximately 30% of the foreign exchange fund's assets, including all listed stock portfolios and other special asset categories. The purpose of hiring external investment managers is to utilize the best professional investment talent in the market for the foreign exchange fund's investments, obtain sustainable returns, and allow the foreign exchange fund to benefit from diversified and complementary investment approaches, as well as learn market insights and specialized investment knowledge.\n\nExpenses related to hiring an external investment manager include fund management and custody fees, transaction costs, withholding tax, and other taxes. These expenses are primarily influenced by market factors and vary annually.\n\n# Risk Management and Supervision\n\nThe investment environment is becoming increasingly complex, making the importance of risk management self-evident. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has established strict control measures and investment guidelines for investment portfolios managed by both internal and external investment managers, along with a rigorous risk monitoring and compliance system. The HKMA has implemented a three-line defense system for investment-related activities to ensure effective risk management and governance. The HKMA regularly monitors major investment risk categories, including credit, market, liquidity, and operational risks. The establishment of risk management procedures provides a robust framework for the strategic planning and diversified investment of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) believes that by appropriately emphasizing Responsible investment and considering the sustainable long-term performance of various investments, it can more effectively achieve the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund and reduce environmental, social, and governance (ESG) related risks associated with investment activities. When ESG investments offer risk-adjusted long-term returns comparable to other investment options, the HKMA generally prioritizes ESG investments according to established guiding principles and has incorporated ESG factors into the investment management processes of both the Exchange Fund's public and private markets. For details on the HKMA’s Responsible investment framework and implementation, see the \"Responsible Investment\" chapter of the Sustainability Report 2022.\n\n# Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\n# The financial markets in 2022.\n\nIn 2022, global financial markets experienced unusual volatility, with bond and stock markets cumulatively falling 16.2% and 19.8% respectively, representing significant declines.\n\nHampered by soaring global inflation, tight monetary policies, and slowing economic growth, major stock market indices plunged sharply during the year. Although global stock markets rebounded slightly at year-end amid hopes of peaking inflation and interest rates, the U.S. S&P 500 index still fell by 19.4% for the year, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index dropped by 15.5%.\n\nDue to aggressive interest rate hikes by central banks to combat inflation, government bond yields in major markets have risen sharply. The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note increased from 1.63% at the beginning of 2022 to surpass 4% in the fourth quarter, reaching its highest level since 2008. The U.S. Treasury yield curve has been inverted since mid-year, and the widening inversion has deepened concerns about an economic recession.\n\nIn the currency market, the US dollar strengthened significantly in 2022, driven by consecutive interest rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve. Other major currencies, including the euro, pound sterling, Japanese yen, and renminbi, depreciated sharply against the US dollar, with the pound sterling and Japanese yen depreciating by 10.7% and 12.2% respectively.\n\nTable 1 shows the performance of major currencies, bond markets, and stock markets in 2022.\n\nTable 1: 2022 Market Return\n\n# Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Foreign Exchange Fund recorded investment losses of 205.4 billion HKD in 2022, which included bond investment losses of 53.2 billion HKD, equity investment losses of 80.5 billion HKD (comprising foreign equity investment losses of 61 billion HKD and Hong Kong equity investment losses of 19.5 billion HKD), depreciation of non-HKD assets due to foreign exchange valuation adjustments amounting to 40 billion HKD, and other investment losses held by the Foreign Exchange Fund's investment holding subsidiary company totaling 31.7 billion HKD. On the other hand, the strategic asset portfolio recorded valuation losses of 8.7 billion HKD.\n\nBy the end of 2022, the total value of the Foreign Exchange Fund's assets reached 400.8 billion Hong Kong dollars. The total market value of long-term growth portfolio investments was 48.47 billion Hong Kong dollars, comprising 37 billion Hong Kong dollars in private equity and 11.47 billion Hong Kong dollars in real estate. The total amount already committed but not yet drawn down for investment in the long-term growth portfolio was 27.08 billion Hong Kong dollars.\n\nThe Exchange Fund (excluding the Strategic Asset Portfolio) recorded a negative 4.5% investment return in 2022, with the investment portfolio returning negative 8.6% and the support portfolio returning negative 0.4%. The Long-term Growth Portfolio has achieved an annualized internal rate of return of 12.6% since its investment commencement in 2009.\n\nFigure 1 shows the annual return rates of the Foreign Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2022. Table 2 displays the investment return rate of the Foreign Exchange Fund in 2022 and the average investment return rates for different periods. The average return rate of the Foreign Exchange Fund was 1.5% for 2020-2022, 2.3% for 2018-2022, 2.4% for 2013-2022, and 4.5% since 1994. Table 3 lists the currency composition of the Foreign Exchange Fund's assets as of December 31, 2022.\n\nRegarding the audited 2022 annual financial statements of the foreign exchange fund, see pages 173 to 281.\n\nFigure 1: Foreign Exchange Fund Investment Return Rate (1994–2022)\n"}

organization's functional departments support the operation of the Monetary Authority, maintaining a high degree of transparency and accountability, and demonstrating outstanding efficiency and professionalism. To promote public understanding of the Monetary Authority’s policies and work, the Monetary Authority maintains effective communication with the wider community and the market through traditional and social media, websites, information centers, and other channels.\n\nInternally, the Financial Supervisory Commission has diligently established a work team emphasizing flexibility, adaptability, and sustainable development, while adhering to strict financial discipline and enhancing information technology capabilities, to respond to changes and ensure the effective implementation of various policies and measures.\n\n# Maintain transparency\n\n# Media Relations and Social Media\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority maintains close communication with the media to enhance transparency and improve public understanding of its policies and operations. In 2022, the Authority organized or participated in a total of 112 physical and online events, including 8 press conferences, 11 site visits, and 93 other public events. It also arranged 46 media interviews. During the year, 492 bilingual press releases were issued, and a large volume of media inquiries were handled daily.\n\nTo enhance public understanding of the Monetary Authority's main functions, the Monetary Authority holds press conferences and media briefings for local, mainland, and overseas media, covering topics such as the operation of the currency issuing authority, green and sustainable finance, and central bank digital currency.\n\nVarious media outlets actively participated in events organized by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority in 2022, including the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit. The three-day summit attracted significant media attention, with over 200 journalists from 87 media outlets attending the coverage and resulting in approximately 1,000 news articles published in local, regional, and international media. In addition, the event arranged live streaming for 30 media outlets.\n\nTo effectively connect with the public, the HKMA operates six social media pages (including Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, WeChat and YouTube), which have attracted over 100,000 followers. The HKMA added a WeChat page in 2022 to reach a wider audience. The HKMA uses social media to promote major events and initiatives, including the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit and the Government Green Bond Programme, and to raise public awareness of various areas such as the linked exchange rate system (LERS), financial technology and fraud prevention.\n\nThe CEO of the Financial Services and Markets Commission, Mr. Yu Wai-man, gave a live interview to the media at the “Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit”.\n\nMr. Yu Wai-man, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), delivered the opening keynote speech at Hong Kong FinTech Week 2022.\n\nRuan Guohang, Deputy Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, delivered remarks at the “FinTech Elite Forum 2022,” jointly organized by Cyberport and Accenture.\n\nThe Deputy Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Mr. Li Da Zhi, chaired a press conference to explain the HKMA’s policy stance on e-HKD.\n\nMr. Chen Weimin, Deputy Governor of the Monetary Authority, delivered a video address at the 2022 Financial Street Forum Annual Conference.\n\n# Public Inquiry\n\nThe public inquiry service is an effective channel for enhancing the public's understanding of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's main functions and operations. In 2022, a total of 9,952 inquiries were handled. Approximately half of these inquiries involved banking consumer matters, banking policies and regulations, paper currency and coins, financial infrastructure, and bond market development. Among these, a significant number pertained to the coin collection program, banking products and services, banking-related guidelines and circulars, as well as the retail bond issuance program.\n\nFigure 1 shows the total number of public inquiries received each year since 2019, and Figure 2 lists the proportion of different categories of inquiries in 2022.\n\nFigure 1: Total Number of Public Inquiries\n\nFigure 2: Queries Received in 2022, Categorized by Type\n\n# Publication\n\nBesides the Annual Report, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority publishes two Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report and four quarterly reports, and regularly updates the Monthly Statistical Bulletin data, providing the latest and in-depth information and analysis on Hong Kong’s monetary, banking, and economic affairs. In addition, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority publishes 17 inSight articles, introducing the Authority’s important measures and policies, and discussing matters of public concern.\n\nThe HKMA’s 2021 Annual Report won the Silver Award in the Non-profit Making and Charitable Organizations category and the Certificate of Excellence in Environmental, Social, and Governance Reporting at the Hong Kong Institute of Management’s 2022 Best Annual Report Awards.\n\n# Corporate Website\n\nThe corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk) provides over 46,000 pages of information in English and Traditional\/Simplified Chinese versions, conveniently enabling the public to access the latest information from the HKMA. The website also features the \"Register of Recognized Institutions and Local Representative Offices\" and the \"Register of Securities Staff\" of recognized institutions, maintained in accordance with Section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the \"Register of Licensed Stored Value Facility Operators\" maintained under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance.\n\nThe HKMA has been gradually releasing financial data and important information hosted on its website through open application programming interfaces (open APIs) since 2018. By the end of 2022, the HKMA had launched a total of 148 open APIs on its website in accordance with the original plan.\n\n# Information Center\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) Information Centre is located on the 55th floor of International Financial Centre Phase 2 and serves as an important facility for introducing the HKMA's work and enhancing the public's understanding of monetary and banking matters. The Information Centre is divided into two sections: an exhibition hall and a library. The exhibition hall introduces the HKMA's work and the development of Hong Kong's currency and banking sector in an interactive manner, and also provides reference materials and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong's currency, banking, and financial affairs. The library, located adjacent to the exhibition hall, houses more than 26,000 books, journals, and other publications covering topics such as Hong Kong's currency, banking, finance, and central banking. The library also maintains, in accordance with Section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, the \"Register of Recognized Institutions and Local Representative Offices\" and the \"Register of Securities Staff of Recognized Institutions,\" which are available for public reference.\n\nAs the pandemic situation gradually stabilized, the Information Center resumed public guided tour services step by step in the second half of 2022.\n\nFollowing renovations, the newly renovated library reopened to the public in March 2023.\n\n# Community engagement and public education\n\nTo maintain contact with the community and enhance public understanding of the HKMA's work, the HKMA has been organizing public education seminars since 1998. In 2022, the HKMA held an online seminar, attracting more than 2,200 students and teachers from 82 secondary schools. The seminar covered topics including an introduction to the HKMA's work, the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), Hong Kong banknotes, protection of personal digital keys, the Deposit Protection Scheme, and opportunities in the banking industry. To date, the public education seminars have attracted more than 65,000 participants.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) educates and engages the public, reminding them how to be wise and responsible users of financial services. In view of the increasing number of phishing scams, the HKMA has launched a cross-media publicity campaign to further remind the public to be vigilant against fake hyperlinks contained in text messages and emails purportedly sent by banks, and to be cautious of other types of fraudulent activities involving deposits and credit cards. The HKMA has also organized radio and social media publicity campaigns, providing tips on the wise use of credit cards, personal loans, online shopping, and other payment methods, including \"Buy Now, Pay Later\" products.\n\nA new short video titled \"Be aware of digital keys! Think twice before clicking the link!\"\n\nTo help citizens keep pace with the times and stay updated with the development of financial technology services, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) promoted the distribution of electronic red envelopes during the Lunar New Year period through social media and radio. The HKMA produced an animated short film explaining open APIs and introducing matters to be aware of when using banking services via mobile apps from third-party service providers (such as online shopping platforms and mortgage service companies). The animated short film also introduced the App-to-App and Web-to-App payment features and advantages of the \"Faster Payment System (FPS).\"\n\nAnimated short films help enhance public digital finance knowledge.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is also committed to enhancing public understanding of the financial industry and fostering interest among the younger generation in joining the HKMA and the industry. In a newly produced interview video, graduates of the HKMA’s Trainee Manager Program share their experiences firsthand, introducing the program to prospective applicants and increasing their understanding of the HKMA’s work.\n\nManagement trainee program graduates share how to prepare for interviews.\n\nTo enhance financial literacy among secondary school students, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, in collaboration with several related organizations, is hosting the 8th annual Hong Kong Financial Literacy Championship. This year's theme is green and sustainable finance, and students are absorbing new knowledge through an online quiz competition (with a record number of participants), webinars, and a design thinking competition.\n\nStudents present creative solutions incorporating green and sustainable elements at the design thinking competition to meet the needs of managing personal finances.\n\nThe Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau launched the \"Little Financial Planner\" online parenting educational campaign during the March holiday and August summer vacation periods in the 2021-22 school year. Through animated short videos, storytelling, making simple toys, and sharing sessions with experts in finance and early childhood education, kindergarten and primary school students learned basic concepts of banknotes and coins, banking and payment services, and financial knowledge.\n\nChildren learn financial concepts and skills through online learning.\n\n# Financial disclosure\n\nTo maintain a high level of transparency, the HKMA adopts international financial disclosure standards applicable to central bank operations, including Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and other relevant reporting requirements (such as the IMF’s Special Data Dissemination Standard). The Finance Division prepares the Exchange Fund financial statements in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards with the assistance of independent auditors and other accounting professionals. In addition, the HKMA discloses and thoroughly analyzes each expenditure item and budgetary data in detail in the Annual Report.\n\n# Accountability and controls\n\n# Risk management\n\nManaging currency and banking system risks is one of the most important tasks of the Financial Supervisory Commission. Risk management is reflected not only in strategy formulation but also in daily operations. The Financial Supervisory Commission’s risk management framework has two high-level committees: the Macro Supervision Committee and the Risk Committee; both are chaired by the Governor of the Financial Supervisory Commission.\n\nThe Macroprudential Oversight Committee's functions are as follows:  \n- Identify potential risks and threats facing Hong Kong's monetary and financial system, and discuss feasible countermeasures;  \n- Review existing risk management measures in the monetary and financial system, identify potential vulnerabilities, and ensure the measures are comprehensive; and  \n- Encourage cross-departmental sharing of macroprudential oversight information to enhance the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's macroprudential oversight capabilities.\n\nThe Risk Committee’s scope of authority is as follows:\n- To identify potential risks and threats faced by the Authority and develop strategies to mitigate their impact;\n- To review the existing risk management systems of various departments, identify potential vulnerabilities and significant risks, and ensure that appropriate measures are in place to address these situations;\n- To standardize risk assessment criteria and methods, and to prioritize resource management based on identified risks; and\n- To promote and strengthen a risk management culture within the Authority, and to encourage appropriate delegation of authority and monitoring.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has established a robust operational risk management framework covering organizational structure risks at both the institutional and departmental levels. Institutional-level risks generally refer to medium-term risks affecting the entire organization or those requiring coordination across departments. During implementation, each department is required to review and report quarterly on potential and emerging risks, along with proposed monitoring measures and mitigation strategies. This is supported by a top-down institutional risk management model, enabling senior management within each department to identify significant risks and recommend solutions. These evaluations are regularly reviewed, and the Risk Committee determines appropriate follow-up actions.\n\n# Internal audit\n\nThe Internal Audit Division independently and objectively assesses whether the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) governance, risk management, and monitoring processes are adequate and effective. Functionally, the division reports to the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, and administratively reports to the HKMA's Chief Executive. The Internal Audit Division employs a risk-based approach in conducting operational and information system audits, covering all major risk areas. In 2022, the division conducted 28 audits on the HKMA's reserve management, banking supervisory activities, monetary and financial development, information technology, and other institutional functions. The audit results showed that the HKMA has sufficient and effective monitoring measures in place to manage risks arising from its operations.\n"}
{"zh":"# 外匯基金\n\n- 審計署署長報告\n- 外匯基金財務報表\n\n# 審計署署長報告\n\n# 獨立審計師報告致財政司司長\n\n# 意見\n\n茲證明我已審計列載於第179頁至281頁外匯基金及其附屬公司（「集團」）的財務報表，該等財務報表包括外匯基金及集團於2022年12月31日的資產負債表與截至該日止年度的收支帳目、全面收益表、權益變動表和現金流量表，以及財務報表的附註，包括主要會計政策概要。\n\n我認為，該等財務報表已按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》真實而中肯地反映外匯基金及集團於2022年12月31日的財務狀況及截至該日止年度的財務表現和現金流量，並已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》（第66章）第7條下所發出的指示妥為擬備。\n\n# 意見的基礎\n\n我已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示及審計署的審計準則進行審計。我根據該等準則而須承擔的責任，詳載於本報告「審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任」部分。根據該等準則，我獨立於集團，並已按該等準則履行其他道德責任。我相信，我所獲得的審計憑證是充足和適當地為我的審計意見提供基礎。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項是根據我的專業判斷，對截至2022年12月31日止年度財務報表的審計最為重要的事項。我對整體財務報表進行審計及形成意見時處理了這些事項，而我不會對這些事項提供單獨的意見。\n\n# 按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.5、2.6及38.1。\n\n於2022年12月31日，集團按公平值列帳的金融資產共38,361.82億港元，金融負債共12,074.98億港元。\n\n87%的該等金融資產及所有該等金融負債的公平值為相同資產或負債於活躍市場的報價（第1級參數），或是以估值方法估計，而所用的參數是以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第2級參數）。\n\n其餘13%的該等金融資產的公平值，是以估值方法估計，而所用的參數並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第3級參數）。有關金融資產共4,876.94億港元，主要包括非上市投資基金。\n\n鑑於所涉數額龐大及涉及估計，按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值屬關鍵審計事項。\n\n就按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值，審計程序包括：\n- 了解不同類別金融資產及金融負債的估值程序，包括相關監控措施；\n- 評價及測試監控措施，包括電腦系統的相關應用程式監控措施；\n- 就金融資產及金融負債的估值、存在、權利與責任及完整性取得函證；\n- 若使用市場報價，根據獨立來源核實價格；\n- 若所用估值方法的參數是以可觀察市場數據為基礎，評價估值方法是否適合及有關假設是否合理，以及根據獨立來源核實參數；及\n- 若所用估值方法的參數並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎，評價估值方法是否適合，以及有關假設與參數是否合理。\n\n# 按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.11、18及19。\n\n集團的投資物業按公平值列帳，於2022年12月31日共值233.94億港元。集團亦於4間聯營公司及22間合營公司擁有權益，該等公司主要業務為持有海外投資物業，有關權益共值396.31億港元。不論是由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有，該等投資物業的公平值均主要根據獨立專業估值師的估值釐定。該等估值涉及重大判斷及估計，包括所用的估值方法及假設。\n\n就按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值，審計程序包括：\n- 獲取及審視由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有的投資物業的估值報告，並核實公平值是根據有關估值報告所列的估值釐定；\n- 評估估值師的獨立性及資歷；及\n- 評價估值方法是否適合，以及有關假設與參數是否合理。\n\n# 其他資料\n\n金融管理專員須對其他資料負責。其他資料包括金融管理局2022年年報內的所有資料，但不包括財務報表及我的審計師報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見並不涵蓋其他資料，我亦不對其他資料發表任何形式的鑒證結論。\n\n就財務報表審計而言，我有責任閱讀其他資料，從而考慮其他資料是否與財務報表或我在審計過程中得悉的情況有重大矛盾，或者似乎存有重大錯誤陳述。基於我已執行的工作，如果我認為其他資料存有重大錯誤陳述，我需要報告該事實。在這方面，我沒有任何報告。\n\n# 金融管理專員及外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會就財務報表而須承擔的責任\n\n金融管理專員須負責按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》及行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示擬備真實而中肯的財務報表，及落實其認為必要的內部控制， 使財務報表不存有因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在擬備財務報表時，金融管理專員須負責評估集團持續經營的能力，以及在適用情況下披露與持續經營有關的事項，並以持續經營作為會計基礎。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會負責監督集團的財務報告過程。\n\n# 審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任\n\n我的目標是就整體財務報表是否不存有任何因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述取得合理保證，並發出包括我意見的審計師報告。合理保證是高水平的保證，但不能確保按審計署審計準則進行的審計定能發現所存有的任何重大錯誤陳述。錯誤陳述可以由欺詐或錯誤引起，如果合理預期它們個別或滙總起來可能影響財務報表使用者所作出的經濟決定，則會被視作重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在根據審計署審計準則進行審計的過程中，我會運用專業判斷並秉持專業懷疑態度。我亦會：\n- 識別和評估因欺詐或錯誤而導致財務報表存有重大錯誤陳述的風險；設計及執行審計程序以應對這些風險；以及取得充足和適當的審計憑證，作為我意見的基礎。由於欺詐可能涉及串謀、偽造、蓄意遺漏、虛假陳述，或凌駕內部控制的情況，因此未能發現因欺詐而導致重大錯誤陳述的風險，較未能發現因錯誤而導致者為高；\n- 了解與審計相關的內部控制，以設計適當的審計程序。然而，此舉並非旨在對集團內部控制的有效性發表意見；\n- 評價金融管理專員所採用的會計政策是否恰當，以及其作出的會計估計和相關資料披露是否合理；\n- 判定金融管理專員以持續經營作為會計基礎的做法是否恰當，並根據所得的審計憑證，判定是否存在與事件或情況有關，而且可能對集團持續經營的能力構成重大疑慮的重大不確定性。如果我認為存在重大不確定性，則有必要在審計師報告中請使用者留意財務報表中的相關資料披露。假若所披露的相關資料不足，我便須發出非無保留意見的審計師報告。我的結論是基於截至審計師報告日止所取得的審計憑證。然而，未來事件或情況可能導致集團不能繼續持續經營；\n- 評價財務報表的整體列報方式、結構和內容，包括披露資料，以及財務報表是否中肯反映交易和事項；及\n- 就集團中實體或業務活動的財務資料獲取充足和適當的審計憑證，以對財務報表發表意見。我負責指導、監督和執行集團審計。我對我的審計意見承擔全部責任。\n\n我會與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通計劃的審計範圍和時間以及重大審計發現等事項，包括我在審計期間識別出內部控制的任何重大缺陷。\n\n我亦會向外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會提交聲明，說明我已符合有關獨立性的相關道德要求，並與他們溝通所有被合理認為可能會影響我獨立性的關係和其他事項，以及在適用的情況下，相關的防範措施。\n\n從與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通的事項中，我會決定哪些事項對本期財務報表的審計最為重要，因而構成關鍵審計事項。我會在審計師報告中描述這些事項，除非法律法規不允許對某件事項作出公開披露，或在極端罕見的情況下，因為有合理預期在我報告中溝通某事項而造成的負面後果將會超過其產生的公眾利益而我決定不應在報告中溝通該事項。\n\n審計署署長\n林智遠教授\n\n審計署\n香港\n金鐘道66號\n\n2023

the Audit Office's Report  \n- Exchange Fund Financial Statements\n\n# Auditor-General's Report\n\n# Independent Auditor's Report to the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI hereby certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and its subsidiaries (\"the Group\") listed on pages 179 to 281, which include the balance sheets of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Group as at December 31, 2022, the income statements, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity, cash flow statements, and the notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies, for the year ended on that date.\n\nI believe that the financial statements truly and fairly reflect the financial position of the Exchange Fund and the Group as of 31 December 2022, and their financial performance and cash flows for the year ended on that date, and have been properly prepared in accordance with the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66) and the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants.\n\n# Basis of opinion\n\nI have conducted the audit in accordance with the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the audit standards of the Audit Office. The responsibilities I am required to bear based on these standards are set out in the section \"Responsibilities of the Auditor in Auditing Financial Statements\" of this report. In accordance with these standards, I have remained independent of the group and fulfilled other ethical responsibilities as required by these standards. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were most important to the audit of the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022. I addressed these matters during the audit and in forming my opinion on the financial statements as a whole, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Valuation of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Measured at Fair Value\n\nPlease refer to Notes 2.5, 2.6, and 38.1 of the financial statements.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Group's financial assets measured at fair value totaled 38,361.82 billion Hong Kong dollars, and financial liabilities totaled 12,074.98 billion Hong Kong dollars.\n\n87% of those financial assets and all of those financial liabilities are valued at fair value, either based on quoted prices in active markets (Level 1), or estimated using valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data (Level 2).\n\nThe fair value of the remaining 13% of these financial assets is determined using valuation techniques, with parameters not based on observable market data (Level 3 parameters). These financial assets totaled HK$487.694 billion, and primarily include unlisted investment funds.\n\nGiven the significant amounts involved and the reliance on estimates, the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value is a key audit matter.\n\nThe audit procedures for the valuation of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value include:\n- Understanding the valuation processes for different categories of financial assets and liabilities, including related monitoring measures;\n- Evaluating and testing the monitoring measures, including related application controls for computer systems;\n- Obtaining confirmations regarding the valuation, existence, rights and obligations, and completeness of financial assets and liabilities;\n- Verifying prices based on independent sources if market quotations are used;\n- Evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methods and the reasonableness of related assumptions, as well as verifying the parameters based on independent sources, if the parameters used in the valuation methods are based on observable market data; and\n- Evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methods and the reasonableness of related assumptions and parameters if the parameters used in the valuation methods are not based on observable market data.\n\n# Valuation of Investment Properties Measured at Fair Value\n\nPlease refer to Notes 2.11, 18, and 19 of the financial statements.\n\nThe Group's investment properties are accounted for at fair value, totaling HKD 233.94 billion as of December 31, 2022. The Group also holds interests in 4 associate companies and 22 joint ventures, whose principal business is holding overseas investment properties, with these interests totaling HKD 396.31 billion. The fair values of these investment properties, whether held directly by the Group or by associate companies or joint ventures, are primarily determined based on valuations by independent professional valuers. These valuations involve significant judgments and estimates, including the valuation methods and assumptions used.\n\nRegarding the valuation of investment properties measured at fair value, the audit procedures include:\n- Obtaining and reviewing valuation reports for investment properties directly held by the Group or held by associates or joint ventures, and verifying that fair value is determined based on the valuation as stated in the relevant valuation reports;\n- Assessing the independence and qualifications of the valuers; and\n- Evaluating whether the valuation methods are appropriate, and whether the relevant assumptions and parameters are reasonable.\n\n# Other materials\n\nThe Financial Controller is responsible for other information. This other information includes all information in the 2022 Annual Report of the Financial Services Commission, except for the financial statements and my auditor's report.\n\nMy opinion regarding the financial statements does not include other data, and I also do not provide any form of attestation conclusion on other data.\n\nWith respect to the audit of financial statements, I have a responsibility to read other information, in order to consider whether such information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or with circumstances known to me during the audit process, or appears to contain material misstatements. Based on the work I have performed, if I conclude that other information contains material misstatements, I need to report that fact. In this regard, I have nothing to report.\n\n# Responsibilities of the financial controller and the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with respect to financial statements.\n\nThe Financial Management Officer must be responsible for preparing true and fair financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under Section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for implementing internal controls he considers necessary to ensure that the financial statements do not contain material misstatements resulting from fraud or error.\n\nWhen preparing financial statements, the financial manager must be responsible for assessing the group's ability to continue as a going concern, and in applicable circumstances, disclosing matters related to going concern, and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Committee under the Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditors' Responsibilities in the Audit of Financial Statements\n\nMy objective is to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements as a whole do not contain any material misstatements resulting from fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but it does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the audit standards of the audit office will necessarily detect any material misstatements that may exist. A misstatement may be caused by fraud or error, and it will be considered a material misstatement if it is reasonably expected that it, individually or in aggregate, could influence the economic decisions made by users of the financial statements.\n\nDuring the audit process conducted in accordance with the Audit Office's auditing standards, I will apply professional judgment and maintain a professional skeptical attitude. I will also:  \n- Identify and assess the risk of material misstatements in the financial statements due to fraud or error; design and perform audit procedures to address these risks; and obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence to support my opinion. Since fraud may involve collusion, falsification, intentional omission, false statements, or overriding of internal controls, the risk of not detecting material misstatements due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting those due to error;  \n- Understand the internal controls relevant to the audit in order to design appropriate audit procedures. However, this is not intended to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the group's internal controls;  \n- Evaluate whether the accounting policies adopted by the Financial Management Officer are appropriate, and whether the accounting estimates and related disclosures made are reasonable;  \n- Determine whether the Financial Management Officer's use of the going concern basis for accounting is appropriate, and based on the audit evidence obtained, determine whether there are significant uncertainties related to events or circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the group's ability to continue as a going concern. If I believe that significant uncertainty exists, it is necessary to draw the users' attention to the relevant disclosures in the financial statements in the auditor's report. If the relevant disclosures are insufficient, I will issue an auditor's report with a non-unqualified opinion. My conclusion is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of the auditor's report. However, future events or circumstances may lead to the group's inability to continue as a going concern;  \n- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure, and content of the financial statements, including disclosures, and whether the financial statements fairly present transactions and events; and  \n- Obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of entities or business activities within the group in order to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for directing, supervising, and performing the group audit. I bear full responsibility for my audit opinion.\n\nI will communicate with the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding the scope and timeline of the plan’s audit, as well as significant audit findings, including any material deficiencies in internal control that I identify during the audit.\n\nI will also submit a statement to the Audit Committee under the Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, disclosing that I have met the relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicating to them all relationships and other matters that could reasonably be considered to affect my independence, as well as any relevant safeguards in place where applicable.\n\nFrom discussions with the Audit Committee under the Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I will determine which matters are most important to the audit of the current financial statements, thus constituting key audit matters. I will describe these matters in the auditor’s report, unless laws and regulations do not permit public disclosure of a matter, or in extremely rare circumstances, because there is a reasonable expectation that the negative consequences of communicating a matter in my report would outweigh the public interest and I decide not to communicate that matter in the report.\n\nProfessor Lin Zhiyuan, Director of Audit\n\nAudit Commission, Hong Kong, Jinzhong Road No. 66\n\nApril 11, 2023\n"}

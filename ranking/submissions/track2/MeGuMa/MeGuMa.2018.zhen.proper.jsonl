{"zh":"# 總裁報告\n\n2018年是全球金融危機發生十周年，十年間國際政經形勢經歷巨大轉變，當中不乏一幕幕超乎最佳編劇所能想像的場景。我在去年的年報指出，2017年金融市場表現是「喜出望外」，同時提到前景「潛藏隱憂」。回顧2018年，或許可形容為「先喜後悲」。環球多個股票指數在1月創出歷史新高後不久，熾熱的投資情緒旋即遇上中美貿易摩擦的冷鋒，加上英國脫歐談判一直拉鋸、地緣政治惡化、美聯儲四次加息等因素，市場樂觀氣氛急劇逆轉，資產價格在年內大幅下跌。MSCI全球指數從高點至低點曾下跌20.3%，全年累跌約一成，是2008年環球金融危機以來表現最差的一年。恒生指數從高點最多曾下跌26.7%，全年下挫13.6%，錄得七年來最大年度跌幅。\n\n# 聯匯穩健 信心所繫\n\n儘管外圍形勢波動難測，香港金融體系仍然保持穩健，貨幣市場運作暢順無阻。實施三十五年的聯繫匯率制度成功應對了資金流出港元的考驗。自環球金融危機爆發以來，累積約10,000億港元等值的資金流入港元。去年，隨着美國息率上升，港美息差持續擴闊，「沽港元、買美元」套息活動增加，港元兌美元匯率在年初轉弱，2005年制訂的「弱方兌換保證」，自4月首度觸發後，年內再觸發26次。金管局按照既定機制，履行「買港元、沽美元」的弱方兌換保證，有序、透明地在市場承接1,035億港元的港元沽盤。隨着資金流走，一個月香港銀行同業拆息在2018年內累升了105基點，而銀行亦在去年9月美國加息後，上調了最優惠利率。金管局多次和適時通過不同渠道向公眾闡釋「弱方兌換保證」的運作機制，令公眾了解資金流出港元是香港利率正常化的必經過程，也是聯匯制度的正常運作。國際貨幣基金組織在去年年底重申支持香港聯匯制度的立場，特區政府也強調聯匯是香港貨幣穩定的基石。這都有助於穩定香港市民對聯繫匯率的信心。\n\n# 銀行體系 穩中有進\n\n2008年環球金融危機暴露了全球金融系統潛藏的種種弊端及隱患，促使國際間在過去十年協調推出一系列針對金融市場、金融機構的改革，包括在銀行業監管方面，提升企業管治和風險管理。金管局的銀行監管工作重點針對兩方面：一是着眼於銀行資產負債風險的審慎監管，二是銀行的行為操守，二者不可偏廢。資產負債風險監管方面，金管局作為巴塞爾銀行監管委員會(Basel Committee on Banking Supervision)及二十國集團轄下金融穩定理事會(FinancialStability Board)成員，有責任全面落實國際監管標準，確保香港銀行業穩健審慎地經營業務。去年底香港銀行資本充足率達20.3%，不但遠高於國際最低標準要求的8%，也較環球金融危機時的14.7%水平顯著提升。大型銀行去年第四季平均流動覆蓋比率達167.6%，同樣遠高於法定最低要求的90%。與此同時，為避免重蹈環球金融危機時需動用公帑拯救「大得不能倒」金融機構的覆轍，金融穩定理事會制訂了關於金融機構處置機制的國際標準。香港是亞洲區內少數已經全面落實符合機制要求的地區之一，金管局下設的處置機制辦公室正落實該機制的操作細則，要求銀行推行結構性變動令處置預案在需要時能有效實施，去年亦推出了《吸收虧損能力規則》，未來還會陸續推出更多相關規則。\n\n鑑於樓價持續上升，金管局未雨綢繆，在2009至2017年間共推出八輪逆周期措施，確保一旦地產市況逆轉，本港銀行體系有足夠的抗震能力應對衝擊。這些措施成效顯著：新造住宅平均按揭成數由2009年的64%降至2018年底的46%；平均供款與入息比率亦由2010年的41%下調至2018年底的34%。年內銀行信貸錄得4.4%的溫和增長，整體資產質素維持良好，零售銀行不良貸款比率進一步降至0.5%，遠低於國際及本港歷史平均水平。去年銀行業盈利持續增長，整體股東權益回報率連升兩年至13%；多家國際性銀行集團在本港的業務交出了不俗的成績表，成為集團盈利的重要支柱。\n\n# 穩善文化 上行下效\n\n在監管銀行的行為操守方面，金管局在2010年增設銀行操守部，促進銀行公平待客，並加強保障消費者權益。要做到標本兼治，除了訂出各種針對銀行營運基本操守的監管要求外，我們近年來大力推動改革銀行文化，鼓勵銀行循管治、獎勵制度、評估與回饋機制三方面推動穩善文化，務求銀行內部做到上行下效，在根本上恢復、提升客戶對銀行的信任和尊重。繼2017年金管局向全港銀行提供具體的指引，金管局在2018年底進一步推出銀行文化的監管措施，包括要求銀行就企業文化和落實有關措施作出自我評估等，令穩善銀行文化的三大支柱能有效執行。\n\n雖然互聯網和移動金融是全球趨勢，金管局去年仍繼續促進普及金融，照顧未能應用新科技的社群。例如我們連同香港銀行公會推動便利店推出長者透過「易辦事」免購物提款服務，有關便利店網絡已增至逾300家；我們並聯絡香港郵政在7家主要位於離島和新界的郵政局推出長者提款易服務。銀行業界響應金管局的建議，年內積極增加無障礙設施，提供傷健共融的銀行服務，例子之一是設有聲音導航的自動櫃員機數目一年內增加逾十倍至超過700部。另外，在金管局積極推動下，我們預期將會陸續有銀行在偏遠地區開設更多實體分行和增設流動銀行服務，便利市民。\n\n# 智慧銀行 嶄新體驗\n\n金管局與銀行和科技業界緊密合作，在2017年9月啟動「智慧銀行新紀元」，推動香港金融科技發展和創新，為市民帶來嶄新的支付和銀行服務體驗。2018年的亮點，無疑是在9月正式開通的「轉數快」。它是全球獨一無二的零售快速支付系統，打破香港各種電子支付工具和銀行帳戶之間的屏障，讓市民享受全年無休的港元和人民幣即時轉帳服務。金管局還同步推出全球首個「共用二維碼」標準和應用程式，商戶可憑單個二維碼接通多個電子支付系統。「轉數快」推出以來深受市民歡迎，短短半年，登記紀錄已逾258萬個，日均交易量達6萬宗，平均每宗金額分別20,700港元和38,000元人民幣。\n\n去年5月，金管局發出虛擬銀行的認可指引，隨即有33家機構提交虛擬銀行牌照的申請。截至今年四月中，四個牌照已經發出，預期它們將於年內正式投入營運。虛擬銀行有助推動香港金融科技發展和創新，為個人和中小企提供嶄新服務和體驗，並促進普及金融。\n\n此外，金管局在7月發布開放應用程式介面(OpenAPI)框架，銀行將分四階段開放產品和服務的對外接口，開創更靈活、更開放的金融科技環境，讓銀行客戶更便捷地整合帳戶資料、獲取資訊，選取貼合自己需要的服務。年內，共有42項新科技產品使用金管局的金融科技監管沙盒進行測試，當中28項完成試行，有關產品和服務已順利推出市場。\n\n金管局聯同多家銀行研發的「貿易聯動」去年10月正式啟用，這個採用「分布式分類帳技術」的貿易融資平台，將提升銀行審批貿易融資的效率。「貿易聯動」目前正在測試連接其他地區相關平台，以促進跨境貿易融資活動。\n\n金融科技不但廣泛應用於日常生活，近年更走進合規和監管領域。金管局鼓勵銀行運用合規科技(Regtech)協助處理日常營運如監察涉嫌洗錢和恐怖分子資金籌集的可疑活動。與此同時金管局正研究使用監管科技(Suptech)，進一步提升監管工作的效率和成效。\n\n# 金融實力 鞏固提升\n\n國際金融中心之間是軟實力的較量，我們要不斷順應經濟社會和科技發展的變化，把握機遇，不斷為香港金融業開拓新的發展空間。綠色金融就是香港開拓債券和項目融資市場的一個重大機遇。金管局支持和配合特區政府發展綠色金融，除了配合特區政府籌備1,000億港元的政府綠色債券發行計劃，我們去年還舉辦多場綠色金融研討會，包括兩場國際大型會議，以提升市場對綠色金融的認識、了解和參與，並鼓勵發行機構參與政府去年推出的綠色債券資助計劃和香港的綠色金融認證服務。去年在港發行綠色債券規模逾110億美元，相等於2017年的三倍多。\n\n近年來投資界對基建和相關項目興趣日濃。金管局於2016年成立基建融資促進辦公室(IFFO)，合作夥伴至今已倍增至95家機構，成為區內基建融資的重要交流平台。去年金管局與國務院國有資產監督管理委員會（國資委）首次合辦高層圓桌會議，討論香港為中央國有企業「走出去」的獨特優勢和作用，為央企與香港金融、專業服務界日後共拓發展機遇奠下良好基礎。\n","terms":{"10年期美國國庫券收益率":["10-year

Over the past decade, the international political and economic landscape has undergone significant shifts, presenting scenes that defied even the most astute predictions. In last year's annual report, I noted that the 2017 financial market performance was unexpectedly positive, while also highlighting underlying concerns about the outlook. Looking back at 2018, it can be described as a tale of two halves. Following record highs for several global stock indices in January, the buoyant investment sentiment quickly encountered the headwinds of US-China trade tensions, compounded by protracted Brexit negotiations, escalating geopolitical risks, and four interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. This led to a sharp reversal of market optimism and a substantial decline in asset prices throughout the year. The MSCI Global Index fell by as much as 20.3% from its peak, declining by approximately 10% for the year—its worst performance since the 2008 global financial crisis. The Hang Seng Index dropped as much as 26.7% from its high, falling 13.6% for the year, marking its largest annual decline in seven years.\n\n# Stable exchange rates are key to confidence.\n\nDespite the volatile and unpredictable external environment, Hong Kong's financial system has remained resilient, and the money market has operated smoothly. The linked exchange rate system, in place for 35 years, has successfully withstood the test of capital outflows from Hong Kong dollars. Since the outbreak of the global financial crisis, approximately HKD 1,000 billion equivalent in capital has flowed into Hong Kong dollars. Last year, with the rise in U.S. interest rates, the interest rate differential between Hong Kong and the U.S. continued to widen, leading to an increase in \"sell Hong Kong dollars, buy U.S. dollars\" carry trade activities. The Hong Kong dollar weakened against the U.S. dollar at the beginning of the year. The \"Weak-Side Convertibility Undertaking\" established in 2005 was first triggered in April and was triggered another 26 times during the year. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) fulfilled the \"Weak-Side Convertibility Undertaking\" by purchasing Hong Kong dollars and selling U.S. dollars in accordance with the established mechanism, orderly and transparently absorbing HKD 103.5 billion in Hong Kong dollar sell orders in the market. As capital flowed out, the Hong Kong interbank offered rate (HIBOR) rose by 105 basis points within one month in 2018, and banks also raised their prime lending rates after the U.S. interest rate hike in September last year. The HKMA has repeatedly and timely explained the operational mechanism of the \"Weak-Side Convertibility Undertaking\" to the public through various channels, helping the public understand that capital outflows from Hong Kong dollars are a necessary process for the normalization of Hong Kong's interest rates and also a normal operation of the linked exchange rate system. The International Monetary Fund reiterated its support for the Hong Kong linked exchange rate system at the end of last year, and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government also emphasized that the linked exchange rate system is the cornerstone of Hong Kong's monetary stability. All of these have helped to stabilize Hong Kong citizens' confidence in the linked exchange rate system.\n\n# Banking System: Steady Progress Amid Stability\n\nThe 2008 global financial crisis exposed various flaws and vulnerabilities in the global financial system, prompting international coordination over the past decade to implement a series of reforms targeting financial markets and institutions, including enhancing corporate governance and risk management in banking regulation. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)'s bank regulatory work focuses on two key areas: prudent supervision of banks' balance sheet risks and banks' conduct and ethics, neither of which can be neglected. In terms of balance sheet risk regulation, as a member of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the Financial Stability Board under the Group of Twenty (G20), the HKMA is responsible for fully implementing international regulatory standards to ensure the sound and prudent operation of the banking sector in Hong Kong. At the end of last year, the capital adequacy ratio of Hong Kong banks reached 20.3%, which is significantly higher than the international minimum requirement of 8%, and also notably improved from the level of 14.7% during the global financial crisis. The average liquidity coverage ratio of large banks in the fourth quarter of last year reached 167.6%, also far exceeding the statutory minimum requirement of 90%. At the same time, to avoid repeating the mistake of having to use public funds to rescue \"Too Big To Fail\" financial institutions during the global financial crisis, the Financial Stability Board has established international standards for financial institution resolution mechanisms. Hong Kong is one of the few regions in Asia that has fully implemented mechanisms meeting these requirements. The HKMA's Resolution Mechanism Office is implementing the operational details of the mechanism, requiring banks to make structural changes to ensure that resolution plans can be effectively implemented when needed. Last year, the HKMA also introduced the \"loss-absorbing capacity rules,\" and will continue to introduce more related rules in the future.\n\nGiven the continued rise in property prices, the Financial Services and Markets Commission has taken proactive measures, launching a total of eight counter-cyclical measures between 2009 and 2017 to ensure that the local banking system has sufficient resilience to withstand shocks should the property market turn. These measures have been remarkably effective: the average mortgage loan-to-value ratio for new residential properties decreased from 64% in 2009 to 46% by the end of 2018; the average debt-to-income ratio also fell from 41% in 2010 to 34% by the end of 2018. Bank lending recorded a moderate growth of 4.4% during the year, overall asset quality remained sound, and the retail banking non-performing loan ratio further decreased to 0.5%, significantly below historical international and local averages. Last year, bank profits continued to grow, with overall return on equity rising for two consecutive years to 13%; several international banking groups achieved impressive results in Hong Kong, becoming important pillars of group profits.\n\n# Stable and Virtuous Culture: Leading by Example from Above, Following by Example from Below\n\nIn regulating banking conduct, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) established the Banking Conduct Division in 2010 to promote fair treatment of customers and strengthen consumer protection. To address the problem at its source, in addition to setting regulatory requirements for fundamental banking practices, we have actively promoted reforms in bank culture in recent years. We encourage banks to foster a culture of integrity through governance, incentive systems, and assessment and feedback mechanisms, aiming to ensure that leadership sets a positive example throughout the organization, thereby restoring and enhancing customer trust and respect for banks. Following the provision of specific guidelines to all Hong Kong banks in 2017, the HKMA further introduced regulatory measures on bank culture at the end of 2018, including requiring banks to conduct self-assessments of their corporate culture and the implementation of related measures, ensuring the effective implementation of the three pillars of a sound bank culture.\n\nAlthough the internet and mobile finance are global trends, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continued to promote financial inclusion last year, addressing communities unable to access new technologies. For example, we collaborated with the Hong Kong Bankers Association to introduce an elderly-friendly cash withdrawal service via \"Electronic Payment Services\" in convenience stores, expanding the network to over 300 stores; we also partnered with Hong Kong Post to launch the \"Elderly Cash Withdrawal Service\" at seven main post offices located in outlying islands and the New Territories. In response to HKMA's recommendations, the banking industry actively increased accessibility features, offering inclusive banking services for people with disabilities. One example is the number of ATMs equipped with voice navigation, which increased more than tenfold within a year to over 700 units. Additionally, under HKMA's active promotion, we expect banks to gradually open more physical branches and expand mobile banking services in remote areas, further facilitating public access.\n\n# Smart Banking: A Brand New Experience\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority worked closely with banks and the technology industry to launch the \"New Era of Smart Banking\" in September 2017, promoting the development and innovation of Hong Kong’s financial technology and providing citizens with a new payment and banking service experience. A highlight of 2018 was undoubtedly the official launch of the \"Faster Payment System\" (FPS) in September. It is a unique retail fast payment system globally, breaking down barriers between various electronic payment tools and bank accounts in Hong Kong, allowing citizens to enjoy 24\/7 instant transfers in Hong Kong dollars (HK$) and Renminbi (RMB). The HKMA also simultaneously launched the world’s first \"Common QR Code\" standard and application, enabling merchants to connect to multiple electronic payment systems with a single QR code. Since its launch, FPS has been well-received by the public, with registrations exceeding 2.58 million in just six months, and an average daily transaction volume of 60,000, averaging HK$20,700 and RMB 38,000 per transaction.\n\nIn May last year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued guidelines for the licensing of virtual banks, and shortly after, 33 institutions submitted applications for virtual bank licenses. As of mid-April this year, four licenses have already been issued, and it is expected that they will officially commence operations within the year. Virtual banks will help promote the development and innovation of financial technology in Hong Kong, provide individuals and small and medium-sized enterprises with new services and experiences, and promote financial inclusion.\n\nFurthermore, the Financial Supervisory Authority released an OpenAPI framework in July, with banks opening up external interfaces for their products and services in four phases, creating a more flexible and open fintech environment, allowing bank customers to more conveniently integrate account data, obtain information, and select services that meet their needs. During the year, a total of 42 new technology products used the Financial Supervisory Authority’s fintech regulatory sandbox for testing, of which 28 completed trials, and these products and services have been successfully launched into the market.\n\nThe \"eTradeConnect,\" developed by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority in collaboration with several banks, was officially launched in October last year. This trade financing platform utilizes \"distributed ledger technology\" to enhance the efficiency of banks' approval processes for trade financing. \"eTradeConnect\" is currently testing connections with relevant platforms in other regions to promote cross-border trade financing activities.\n\nFintech is not only widely applied in daily life but has also entered the compliance and regulatory fields in recent years. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) encourages banks to use compliance technology (Regtech) to assist in handling daily operations such as monitoring suspicious activities related to money laundering and terrorist financing. Meanwhile, the HKMA is studying the use of supervisory technology (Suptech) to further enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of regulatory work.\n\n# Strengthen and Enhance Financial Strength\n\nThe competition among international financial centers is a contest of soft power. We must continuously adapt to changes in the economic, social, and technological landscape, seize opportunities, and constantly open up new development spaces for Hong Kong's financial sector. Green finance represents a significant opportunity for Hong Kong to develop its bond and project financing markets. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority supports and collaborates with the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government in developing green finance. In addition to supporting the government's preparation for the issuance plan of HKD 100 billion in government green bonds, we held multiple green finance seminars last year, including two major international conferences, to enhance market understanding, awareness, and participation in green finance, and to encourage issuing institutions to participate in the government's green bond subsidy program launched last year and the green finance certification service in Hong Kong. The amount of green bonds issued in Hong Kong last year exceeded USD 11 billion, which is more than three times that of 2017.\n\nIn recent years, the investment community has shown growing interest in infrastructure and related projects. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) established the Infrastructure Financing Promotion Office (IFFO) in 2016, and its number of partner institutions has since more than doubled to 95, making it an important exchange platform for infrastructure financing in the region. Last year, the HKMA and the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) of the State Council co-hosted their first high-level roundtable meeting, discussing Hong Kong’s unique advantages and role in supporting central state-owned enterprises’ “going global” strategy. This meeting laid a solid foundation for future collaborative development opportunities between central state-owned enterprises and Hong Kong’s financial and professional services sectors.\n"}

{"zh":"# 金管局簡介\n\n香港金融管理局是香港的中央銀行機構，主要職能有4項：在聯繫匯率制度的架構內維持貨幣穩定；促進金融體系（包括銀行體系）的穩定與健全；協助鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位，包括維持與發展香港的金融基建；以及管理外匯基金。\n\n# 金管局的法定授權\n\n立法會（前稱立法局）於1992年通過《外匯基金條例》修訂條文，授權財政司司長（前稱財政司）委任金融管理專員，金管局隨後在1993年4月1日成立。\n\n金融管理專員的權力、職能及責任由《外匯基金條例》、《銀行業條例》、《金融機構（處置機制）條例》、《存款保障計劃條例》、《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》及其他有關條例明文規定。財政司司長與金融管理專員於2003年6月25日的互換函件，列載彼此在貨幣與金融事務方面的職能與責任的分配，亦披露財政司司長將若干權力轉授金融管理專員。有關函件為公開文件，可於金管局網站查閱。\n\n外匯基金根據《外匯基金條例》設立，由財政司司長掌有控制權。該條例規定外匯基金須主要運用於影響港元匯價。財政司司長亦可運用外匯基金以保持香港貨幣金融體系的穩定與健全，藉此保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。\n\n金融管理專員根據《外匯基金條例》委任，以協助財政司司長執行其根據該條例獲授予的職能，以及執行其他條例及財政司司長所指派的職能。金融管理專員的辦公室稱為金管局，金融管理專員即為金管局總裁。\n\n金融管理專員根據《銀行業條例》賦予的職責及權力，規管及監管銀行業務與接受存款業務。根據《銀行業條例》，金融管理專員負責處理香港持牌銀行、有限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司的認可資格事宜。\n\n《金融機構（處置機制）條例》指定金融管理專員為銀行界實體的處置機制當局。該條例賦予金融管理專員一系列權力，對有關實體進行有秩序處置，以減低有關實體不可持續經營對香港金融體系的穩定及有效運作構成的風險。\n\n《證券及期貨條例》及《強制性公積金計劃條例》賦予金融管理專員若干有關銀行證券及強制性公積金業務的權力。\n\n《保險業條例》訂明可就銀行的保險業務向金融管理專員轉授查察及調查權力。\n\n《打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集條例》賦權金融管理專員監管銀行遵守該條例的規定。\n\n《存款保障計劃條例》授予金融管理專員責任，就存款保障計劃的運作提供協助，以及啟動從存款保障計劃基金向無力償付銀行的存款人發放補償。\n\n金融管理專員在《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》的法定架構下，可指定及監察對香港貨幣或金融穩定或對香港發揮作為國際金融中心的功能事關重要的結算及交收系統。該條例亦授權金融管理專員管理儲值支付工具發牌制度，及指定零售支付系統並監察該等系統的運作是否安全及有效率。\n\n# 金管局與香港特別行政區政府\n\n金管局是香港特別行政區政府架構的一部分，但可以按與公務員不同的聘用條款聘請員工，以吸引具適當經驗與專門知識的人才。金管局總裁及其員工均為公職人員。金管局的日常運作，在金融管理專員所獲賦予或轉授的法定權力範圍內高度自主。\n\n財政司司長負責釐定香港的貨幣政策目標及貨幣體制：財政司司長於2003年6月25日致金融管理專員的函件中，訂明應透過貨幣發行局制度維持貨幣穩定，將港元匯率保持在約7.80港元兌1美元的水平。金融管理專員須自行負責達成貨幣政策目標，包括決定有關的策略、工具及執行方式，並負責維持香港貨幣制度的穩定與健全。\n\n財政司司長在財經事務及庫務局局長的協助下，負責維持香港金融體系穩定與健全，以及保持香港的國際金融中心地位的政策。為推行這些政策，金融管理專員的職責包括：\n- 促進銀行體系的整體穩定與有效運作\n- 與其他有關機構與組織合作，發展債務市場\n- 處理與法定紙幣及硬幣的發行及流通有關的事宜\n- 透過發展支付、結算及交收系統，以及在適當情況下負責操作有關系統，促進金融基建的安全與效率\n- 與其他有關機構與組織合作，促進對香港貨幣及金融體系的信心，並推行適當的發展市場措施，以協助加強香港金融服務的國際競爭力。\n\n外匯基金由財政司司長掌有控制權。金融管理專員須根據財政司司長轉授的權力，就外匯基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 問責性與透明度\n\n就日常運作及推行政府政策目標所採用的方法，金管局一直保持高度自主，並同時輔以高問責性及透明度。\n\n金管局致力促進貨幣與銀行體系穩定，有效管理官方儲備，發展與監察穩健及多元化的金融基建，從而鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位，推動香港經濟發展。\n\n金管局要有效履行職責，便必須取得社會人士的信心。因此，金管局以嚴謹的態度，履行向公眾解釋其政策及工作的責任，並盡力處理社會上備受關注而涉及金管局職責範圍的事項。\n\n金融管理專員由財政司司長委任，因此金管局透過財政司司長向公眾負責；而由於金管局的職權由立法會通過的法律制訂，因此金管局亦透過立法會向公眾負責。此外，金管局亦明白本身肩負更廣泛的責任，就是促進公眾對金管局角色及目標的認識，並密切留意社會人士所關注的事項。金管局在執行日常工作及與社會保持廣泛聯繫時，堅守盡力提高透明度及保持開放的政策。這項政策有兩大目標：\n- 在顧及市場敏感性、商業秘密及機密資料披露的法定限制下，盡量使金融界及公眾充分了解金管局的工作；\n- 確保金管局掌握社會脈搏，並對公眾意見作出適當回應。\n\n金管局在透明度方面致力達致國際最高標準，與傳媒保持廣泛聯繫之餘，亦出版各種中英文期刊及專題刊物。金管局的雙語網站(www.hkma.gov.hk)除有專門環節列載經濟研究、統計資料、消費者資訊及其他課題外，還載有金管局出版的刊物、新聞稿、演辭及簡報會資料文件。此外，金管局又利用社交媒體平台，以能在數碼時代中更有效與公眾溝通。金管局辦事處設有資訊中心，分為圖書館及展覽館兩部分，每星期開放6日予公眾參觀及使用。金管局亦舉辦公眾教育活動，透過講座及資訊中心導賞服務，向公眾人士（特別是學生）講解金管局的工作，以及增進市民的金融知識。有關金管局的傳媒聯繫工作、刊物及公眾教育活動的詳細資料，見「機構職能」一章。\n\n金管局公布外匯基金及貨幣發行局帳目資料的次數，一直逐步增加，內容亦越趨詳細。金管局於1999年開始參與國際貨幣基金組織的中央銀行「數據公布特殊標準」計劃。金管局亦公布外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下貨幣發行委員會的會議紀錄，以及貨幣發行局制度運作報告。自1996年起，金管局網站亦載有銀行業監管政策及指引。\n\n金管局與立法會的關係對提高問責性及透明度非常重要。金管局總裁承諾每年3次向立法會財經事務委員會簡報金管局各項工作及政策，並回答有關查詢。此外，金管局代表亦會不時出席立法會財經事務委員會及法案委員會會議，闡釋及商討特別事項，以及協助議員審閱條例草案。\n\n#

外匯基金諮詢委員會\n\n財政司司長行使外匯基金的控制權時，會聽取外匯基金諮詢委員會的意見。外匯基金諮詢委員會根據《外匯基金條例》第3(1)條成立。該項條文訂明財政司司長行使對外匯基金的控制權時，須諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會的意見。財政司司長為外匯基金諮詢委員會的當然主席，其他委員（包括金融管理專員）則以個人身分，由財政司司長根據香港特別行政區行政長官的授權委任。委員因各具專業知識及經驗而獲委任，他們的加入讓外匯基金諮詢委員會廣受裨益。委員的專業知識及經驗涵蓋貨幣、金融、經濟、投資、會計、管理、商業及法律等範疇。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會下設5個專責委員會，負責監察金管局特定環節的工作，並透過外匯基金諮詢委員會向財政司司長報告及提出建議。外匯基金諮詢委員會在2018年共舉行5次會議，討論各項與金管局工作有關的事宜，其中大部分事項均由有關的專責委員會事先進行討論。\n\n管治委員會監察金管局的表現，以及就金管局薪酬與服務條件、人力資源政策、財政預算、行政及管治事務，向外匯基金諮詢委員會提出建議。該委員會在2018年共召開5次會議，內容涵蓋金管局的開支預算、表現評估、年度薪酬檢討及策略性規劃事宜。該委員會亦審議金管局定期提交的工作報告。\n\n審核委員會檢討金管局的財政匯報程序，並評核其內部管控制度是否足夠和有效，以及提交報告。審核委員會負責檢視金管局的財務報表，編製該等報表的組成項目與會計原則，並聯同外部及內部審計師查核其審計範疇與結果。審核委員會各委員在金管局並沒有任何行政職能。該委員會在2018年共召開2次會議，並審議風險委員會及內部審核處的工作報告。\n\n貨幣發行委員會監察貨幣發行局制度的運作，並匯報這個作為香港聯繫匯率制度支柱的情況。該委員會負責確保貨幣發行局制度按照既定政策運作、提出改進該制度的建議，以及確保該制度的運作維持高透明度。金管局定期公布貨幣發行委員會的會議紀錄及提交該委員會的貨幣發行局制度運作報告。該委員會在2018年共召開4次會議。\n","terms":{"10年期美國國庫券收益率":["10-year

four main functions: maintaining monetary stability within the framework of the linked exchange rate system; promoting the stability and soundness of the financial system (including the banking system); assisting in consolidating Hong Kong's status as an international financial center, including maintaining and developing Hong Kong's financial infrastructure; and managing the foreign exchange fund.\n\n# Statutory Authority of the Monetary Authority\n\nThe Legislative Council (formerly the Legislative Assembly) passed an amendment to the Exchange Fund Ordinance in 1992, authorizing the Financial Secretary (formerly the Financial Commissioner) to appoint a Financial Secretary for the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, which was subsequently established on April 1, 1993.\n\nThe powers, functions, and responsibilities of the Financial Secretary and the Financial Management and Supervision Agency are explicitly stipulated in the Currency and Foreign Exchanges Ordinance, the Banking Ordinance, the Financial Institutions (Resolution Regime) Ordinance, the Deposit Protection Scheme Ordinance, the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, and other relevant ordinances. The exchange of letters between the Financial Secretary and the Financial Management and Supervision Agency dated June 25, 2003, outlines the allocation of functions and responsibilities in monetary and financial matters, and also discloses that the Financial Secretary has delegated certain powers to the Financial Management and Supervision Agency. This letter is a public document and can be accessed on the FMA website.\n\nThe Exchange Fund is established under the Exchange Fund Ordinance and is controlled by the Financial Secretary. The Ordinance stipulates that the Exchange Fund shall primarily be used to influence the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar. The Financial Secretary may also utilize the Exchange Fund to maintain the stability and integrity of the monetary and financial system of Hong Kong, thereby preserving Hong Kong’s position as an international financial centre.\n\nThe Financial Controller is appointed under the Exchange Fund Ordinance to assist the Financial Secretary in performing the functions conferred upon him under the Ordinance, as well as functions assigned by other ordinances and by the Financial Secretary. The office of the Financial Controller is known as the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), and the Financial Controller is the Chief Executive of the HKMA.\n\nThe Financial Secretary, under the powers and responsibilities granted by the Banking Ordinance, regulates and supervises banking and deposit-taking businesses. Under the Banking Ordinance, the Financial Secretary is responsible for handling the recognition of qualifications for licensed banks, restricted license banks, and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong.\n\nThe Financial Institutions (Resolution Regime) Ordinance designates the Financial Services Oversight Counsel as the resolution authority for entities in the banking sector. The Ordinance confers on the Financial Services Oversight Counsel a range of powers to orderly resolve relevant entities, thereby reducing the risks posed to the stability and effective operation of the Hong Kong financial system by the unsustainable operations of such entities.\n\nThe Securities and Futures Ordinance and the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Ordinance grant the Financial Services Commissioner certain powers related to banking securities and mandatory provident fund schemes.\n\nThe Insurance Ordinance stipulates that the power of inspection and investigation regarding banks’ insurance business may be delegated to financial controllers.\n\nThe \"Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance\" empowers the Financial Secretary to oversee banks' compliance with the ordinance's provisions.\n\nThe Deposit Protection Scheme Ordinance grants the Financial Secretary the responsibility to provide assistance in the operation of the deposit protection scheme and to initiate the payment of compensation from the deposit protection scheme fund to depositors of insolvent banks.\n\nUnder the statutory framework of the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, the Financial Secretary may designate and supervise settlement and clearing systems that are crucial to the stability of Hong Kong's currency and financial system, or to Hong Kong's function as an international financial center. The Ordinance also authorizes the Financial Secretary to administer the licensing regime for stored value facilities and to designate retail payment systems and supervise the safety and efficiency of their operations.\n\n# The Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is part of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government structure, but it may hire staff under terms different from those applicable to civil servants to attract individuals with appropriate experience and expertise. The Chief Executive and staff of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority are public officials. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority exercises a high degree of autonomy in its daily operations within the scope of legal powers conferred or delegated by the Financial Secretary.\n\nThe Financial Secretary is responsible for determining the monetary policy objectives and monetary system of Hong Kong. In a letter dated June 25, 2003, the Financial Secretary stipulated to the Commissioner of Financial Services that monetary stability should be maintained through the currency board system, keeping the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate at approximately 7.80 Hong Kong dollars to 1 US dollar. The Commissioner of Financial Services is responsible for achieving the monetary policy objectives, including determining the relevant strategies, tools, and methods of implementation, and is responsible for maintaining the stability and soundness of Hong Kong’s monetary system.\n\nThe Financial Secretary, with the assistance of the Chief Executive of the Financial Services and Treasury Bureau, is responsible for maintaining the stability and soundness of the Hong Kong financial system and preserving Hong Kong's position as an international financial center. To implement these policies, the duties of the Financial Management Officer include:\n- Promoting the overall stability and efficient operation of the banking system\n- Collaborating with other relevant institutions and organizations to develop the debt market\n- Handling matters related to the issuance and circulation of legal tender notes and coins\n- Promoting the safety and efficiency of financial infrastructure by developing payment, settlement, and clearing systems, and operating such systems as appropriate\n- Collaborating with other relevant institutions and organizations to enhance confidence in the Hong Kong currency and financial system, and implementing appropriate market development measures to help strengthen the international competitiveness of Hong Kong's financial services.\n\nThe Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary. The Financial Management Officer must, based on the powers delegated by the Financial Secretary, be accountable to the Financial Secretary for the management and investment of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# Accountability and Transparency\n\nThe Financial Supervisory Commission has consistently maintained a high degree of autonomy in its operational practices and the methods employed to achieve government policy objectives, while also being supported by high accountability and transparency.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is dedicated to promoting the stability of the monetary and banking systems, effectively managing official reserves, developing and overseeing a robust and diversified financial infrastructure, thereby consolidating Hong Kong’s position as an international financial centre and driving economic development in Hong Kong.\n\nTo effectively perform its duties, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority must earn public confidence. Therefore, the HKMA adopts a rigorous approach to explaining its policies and operations to the public, and actively addresses issues of public concern that fall within its purview.\n\nThe Financial Management Officer is appointed by the Financial Secretary, hence the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is accountable to the public through the Financial Secretary; and since the HKMA's powers are established by laws passed by the Legislative Council, the HKMA is also accountable to the public through the Legislative Council. Furthermore, the HKMA is aware of its broader responsibilities, which include promoting public understanding of its role and objectives, and closely monitoring issues of public concern. While carrying out daily operations and maintaining extensive connections with society, the HKMA adheres to policies aimed at enhancing transparency and maintaining an open approach. This policy has two main objectives: \n- To fully inform the financial sector and the public about the HKMA's work, taking into account market sensitivity, commercial secrets, and legal restrictions on the disclosure of confidential information; \n- To ensure the HKMA stays attuned to societal trends and appropriately responds to public opinions.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is committed to achieving the highest international standards in transparency. In addition to maintaining extensive contact with the media, the HKMA publishes various publications in both Chinese and English. The HKMA's bilingual website (www.hkma.gov.hk) features dedicated sections for economic research, statistical data, consumer information, and other topics, as well as publications issued by the HKMA, press releases, speeches, and materials from briefing sessions. Furthermore, the HKMA utilizes social media platforms to communicate more effectively with the public in the digital age. The HKMA's office houses an information center, which is divided into a library and an exhibition hall, and is open to the public six days a week. The HKMA also organizes public education activities, through lectures and guided tours of the information center, to explain the HKMA's work to the public, especially students, and to enhance the public's financial knowledge. Detailed information on the HKMA's media relations, publications, and public education activities can be found in the chapter on \"Institutional Functions.\"\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has progressively increased the frequency of disclosing information on the Exchange Fund and the Currency Board’s accounts, with the content becoming increasingly detailed. The HKMA joined the International Monetary Fund's Special Data Dissemination Standard project in 1999. It also publishes the minutes of meetings of the Currency Board under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, as well as reports on the operation of the Currency Board system. Since 1996, the HKMA website has also featured banking supervision policies and guidelines.\n\nThe relationship between the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Legislative Council is crucial for enhancing accountability and transparency. The HKMA Governor has committed to briefing the Financial Affairs Committee of the Legislative Council three times a year on the HKMA's various operations and policies and to answer relevant inquiries. In addition, HKMA representatives will occasionally attend meetings of the Financial Affairs Committee and the Bills Committee of the Legislative Council to explain and discuss specific matters, as well as assist members in reviewing draft legislation.\n\n# Advisory committees and other committees\n\n# Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC)\n\nThe Financial Secretary consults the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee when exercising control over the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund Advisory Committee was established under section 3(1) of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, which stipulates that the Financial Secretary must seek the opinion of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee when exercising control over the Exchange Fund. The Financial Secretary serves as the ex-officio chairman of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, while other members (including the Commissioner for Financial Management) are appointed in their individual capacity by the Financial Secretary upon authorization from the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. Members are appointed due to their respective professional expertise and experience, which greatly benefits the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee. The professional expertise and experience of the members cover areas such as currency, finance, economics, investment, accounting, management, business, and law.\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee has five specialized committees responsible for overseeing specific aspects of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's work, and they report and make recommendations to the Financial Secretary through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee. In 2018, the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee held five meetings to discuss various matters related to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's work, with most of these matters having been previously discussed by the relevant specialized committees.\n\nThe Governance Committee oversees the performance of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and provides recommendations to the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee on the HKMA's remuneration and service conditions, human resources policies, budgetary matters, and administrative and governance issues. The Committee held five meetings in 2018, covering topics such as the HKMA's expenditure budget, performance evaluation, annual remuneration review, and strategic planning. The Committee also reviewed the HKMA's regularly submitted work reports.\n\nThe Audit Committee reviews the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) financial reporting procedures and evaluates the adequacy and effectiveness of its internal control systems, as well as submits reports. The Audit Committee is responsible for examining the HKMA's financial statements, the components of those statements, and the accounting principles used in their preparation, and works together with external and internal auditors to review the scope and results of the audits. The members of the Audit Committee have no administrative functions within the HKMA. The Committee held two meetings in 2018 and reviewed the work reports of the Risk Committee and the Internal Audit Department.\n\nThe Currency Issuance Committee oversees the operation of the Currency Issuance System and reports on its role as a pillar of the linked exchange rate system in Hong Kong. The Committee is responsible for ensuring that the Currency Issuance System operates in accordance with established policies, proposing improvements to the system, and ensuring the operation of the system maintains a high degree of transparency. The HKMA regularly publishes the minutes of the Currency Issuance Committee meetings and the reports on the operation of the Currency Issuance System submitted to the Committee. The Committee held a total of four meetings in 2018.\n"}
{"zh":"# 經濟及金融環境\n\n2018年香港經濟持續擴張，不過隨着金融狀況收緊及貿易保護主義升溫令不明朗因素增加，增長動力於年內有所減弱。隨着全球經濟增長轉弱，預期2019年香港經濟增長亦會減慢。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 實體經濟活動\n\n2018年香港經濟進一步擴張，不過按年增長速度由第1季的4.6%，逐步減慢至第4季的1.3%（表1），並拖累全年增長率由2017年的3.8%下降至3.0%。經濟擴張轉弱，反映本地需求增長減慢以及經濟持續受淨出口所拖累（圖1）。本地方面，私人消費在第1季強勁增長，但其後增長動力減弱，部分反映貿易保護主義升溫令不明朗因素增加，以及本地資產價格調整帶來的財富減值效應。由於營商信心脆弱，整體投資支出的增長速度亦放緩。外圍方面，貨品出口於首3季大致保持平穩，但在第4季隨着中美貿易摩擦加劇而顯著轉差。貨品進口亦因為出口帶動的需求轉弱而放緩。相比之下，服務輸出錄得較快的全年增長，部分是受惠於訪港旅遊業表現蓬勃，而服務輸入則由於運輸、商業及其他服務增長而得以大致維持增長動力。按淨額計，貿易差額由2017年的順差轉為2018年的小幅逆差，並拖累本地經濟增長。\n\n表1 按開支項目計的實質本地生產總值增長（比對上期）\n\n註：本地固定資本形成總額經季節因素調整的按季增減幅度不詳。\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n圖1 組成部分對實質本地生產總值增長的貢獻\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 貨幣狀況\n\n主要受到港元與美元負息差下的套息活動所影響，港元兌美元匯率在2018年大致回軟。尤其弱方兌換保證在4月、5月及8月被觸發，促使金管局按照聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）所定，在7.85港元兌1美元的水平，向銀行購入港元及沽出美元。按照聯匯制度的設計，港元貨幣基礎因而收縮，表示銀行同業流動性減少，再加上市場預期美國加息，導致港元銀行同業拆息整體上升。由於銀行體系資金成本上升，銀行於9月下旬在美國聯邦基金利率目標區間上調後，調高最優惠貸款利率12.5至25基點。信貸增長方面，部分由於本地經濟增長放緩以及對外貿易表現轉弱，整體銀行貸款的增幅由2017年的16.1%，顯著減慢至2018年的4.4%。\n\n# 通脹\n\n通脹壓力於2018年略為增加。剔除政府一次性紓緩措施的影響後，基本通脹率由2017年的1.7%低位，升至2018年的2.6%，不過仍屬於溫和水平。當中的住屋租金組成項目增幅較快，反映較早前新簽訂私人住宅租金上升的影響（圖2）。更廣泛的分析顯示，名義勞工成本及商用物業租金增長略為加快，令本地成本壓力更趨明顯。隨着香港部分主要進口來源地通脹上升，進口價格通脹亦因而攀升。\n\n圖2 基本消費物價通脹\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 勞工市場\n\n勞工市場狀況在2018年保持穩健（圖3）。失業率由2017年全年的3.1%下降至2018年的2.8%，是自1997年以來的最低水平。當中大部分主要服務行業的失業率都有所回落，特別是住宿及膳食服務業的跌幅更為顯著。隨着總就業人數及私營機構職位空缺進一步增加，整體勞工需求持續增強，而且勞動人口參與率亦輕微上升。在勞工市場狀況趨緊下，實質工資及收入進一步增加。\n\n圖3 勞工市場狀況\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 股市\n\n香港股市走勢在2018年大幅逆轉。恒生指數在2017年強勁的上升動力帶動下，於2018年1月升上33,484點的歷史高位（圖4）。然而，隨着主要中央銀行收緊貨幣政策、中美貿易摩擦加劇及本地經濟增長放緩引起投資者的憂慮，市場的樂觀情緒急劇逆轉。恒生指數在10月下挫至24,586點的低位，在年底則收報25,846點，較一年前下跌13.6%。然而，平均每日成交額則由2017年的882億港元上升至1,074億港元，本港首次公開招股集資總額亦因數間從事新興及創科產業的企業上市而大幅增加。\n\n圖4 資產價格\n資料來源：差餉物業估價署及香港交易及結算所有限公司。\n\n# 物業市場\n\n住宅物業市場在2018年上半年保持暢旺，不過在下半年隨着中美貿易摩擦加劇、環球股市調整及本港最優惠利率上升而有所降溫。整體樓價在7月至12月期間由高位回落9%，然而全年計仍錄得2%的升幅（圖4）。由於一手及二手市場的買賣活動於下半年顯著減少，所以物業成交量在2018年亦較前一年下跌7%至57,247宗。此外，置業負擔能力仍然偏緊，樓價與收入比率以及收入槓桿比率分別為17.0及75.7，兩者均遠高於長期平均水平。另一方面，非住宅物業價格在2018年整體上升，惟接近年底時稍見回落。全年計，價格及租金均進一步上升，租金回報率則維持在低位。\n\n# 經濟前景\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n由於全球經濟增長放緩，預期2019年香港經濟增長將會減慢。尤其外圍環境充滿挑戰，預期香港出口表現仍會受壓。本地方面，雖然失業率低企及家庭收入增加將繼續支撐私人消費，但部分由於消費信心減弱及較早前的資產價格調整帶來的財富減值效應的影響，預期私人消費增長步伐會放緩。固定資本形成方面，雖然隨着房屋供應增加，樓宇及建造活動應會穩步增長，但面對經濟不明朗因素增加，企業對於資本投資可能會變得更為審慎。政府預測2019年實質本地生產總值增長率介乎2至3%之間，私營機構分析員的最新預測增幅則平均為2.3%。\n\n# 通脹及勞工市場\n\n由於包括香港在內的全球增長放緩，外圍物價及本地成本壓力或會得到紓緩，因此預期通脹壓力在2019年仍保持溫和。近期新簽訂住宅租金回落，亦會對通脹產生壓抑作用。市場共識預測2019年整體通脹率為2.2%，政府預期基本通脹率則為2.5%。預期在經濟持續增長及訪港旅遊業維持暢旺下，勞工市場狀況會繼續偏緊。私營機構分析員預計失業率於2019年會維持於約3%的水平。\n\n# 不明朗因素及風險\n\n2019年經濟前景受貿易摩擦、美國貨幣政策未來方向、內地經濟表現、英國脫歐及其他地緣政治局勢等不明朗因素及風險所影響。另外，一旦上述的不明朗因素加劇並長期持續，金融市場情緒及營商信心或會大受影響，對本地資產市場及實體經濟活動構成下行壓力。\n\n另外，住宅物業市場受眾多外圍及本地因素所影響，其前景並不明朗。外圍方面，中美貿易摩擦的不確定性將有可能影響市場情緒、經濟前景及金融狀況，使香港物業市場前景繼續蒙上陰影。本地方面，雖然經濟增長放緩，但就業情況及收入增長仍大致穩定，或可支持住宅物業需求。本港利率的走勢某程度上視乎美國未來的政策利率變動，惟後者走勢並不明確。長遠而言，由於過去幾年住宅落成量有所增加，加上政府致力增加土地及房屋供應，預期房屋供求缺口或會收窄。\n\n# 銀行體系表現\n\n儘管外圍不利因素增加，例如中美貿易衝突、英國脫歐及利率正常化，令金融市場波動加劇，香港銀行體系在2018年仍然穩健。銀行體系的資本及流動性狀況穩健，資產質素保持良好。利率趨升令息差擴闊，刺激銀行盈利顯著增加。\n\n# 資產負債表走勢\n\n2018年銀行體系繼續穩步增長，資產負債表擴大5.9%。面對經濟不明朗因素持續，例如主要經濟體之間的貿易衝突及加息等，企業在獲取新貸款方面變得較為保守。年內貸款總額增幅放緩至4.4%，而2017年為16.1%。有關增長受在香港使用的貸款（+6.5%）及在香港境外使用的貸款（+2%）同告增加帶動。另一方面，由於環球貿易環境不明朗，貿易融資下跌7.6%。中國內地相關貸款的增長亦由2017年的17.5%放緩至2018年的1.4%。\n\n銀行體系持有的債務證券總額在2018年底繼續佔總資產的22%，與2017年一樣。由於這些債務證券大部分為政府及銀行發行的投資級別債務證券，因此有關信用風險維持在低水平。\n\n就負債方而言，存款總額在2018年增加5%，較2017年（+8.7%）的增幅小。由於預期美國持續加息，部分銀行上調定期存款利率，吸引存戶將往來及儲蓄存款轉為定期存款，從而鎖定資金。往來及儲蓄存款佔存款總額的比例由對上一年的57.4%，降至2018年底的51.4%，導致資金成本上升。由於存款總額的增長較貸款總額快，整體貸存比率由2017年底的73%稍降至2018年底的72.6%（圖5）。\n\n圖5 銀行體系的貸款及存款\n\n# 資本充足水平\n\n銀行體系資本相當充裕，表示其具備強大緩衝以抵禦潛在衝擊。資本比率處於自實施《巴塞爾協定三》以來的歷史高位；本地註冊認可機構的綜合總資本比率由2017年底的19.1%，增加至2018年底的20.3%（圖6）。\n\n圖6 本地註冊認可機構的綜合資本比率\n\n《巴塞爾協定三》槓桿比率於2018年1月1日生效；該比率是一項非風險為本規定，旨在限制銀行體系過度累積槓桿。於2018年底，槓桿比率為8.0%，遠高於3%的法定最低要求（圖7）。\n\n圖7 本地註冊認可機構的綜合槓桿比率\n\n# 流動性狀況\n\n銀行體系的流動性狀況維持穩健，反映其具備強大能力，可有效承受來自潛在金融及經濟壓力的衝擊。短期流動性（涵蓋1個月期資金）方面，第1類機構的平均流動性覆蓋比率在第4季為167.6%，遠高於2018年適用的90%法定最低要求。第2類機構的平均流動性維持比率為54.3%，亦遠高於25%的法定最低要求（圖8）。\n","terms":{"10年期美國國庫券收益率":["10-year

tightened and trade protectionism heated up, uncertainties increased, and growth momentum weakened during the year. With the global economy slowing, it is expected that Hong Kong’s economic growth will also slow in 2019.\n\n# Economic Review\n\n# Real activities\n\nIn 2018, Hong Kong's economy continued to expand, but the year-on-year growth rate gradually slowed from 4.6% in the first quarter to 1.3% in the fourth quarter (Table 1), dragging the full-year growth rate down from 3.8% in 2017 to 3.0%. The weakening economic expansion reflected a slowdown in local demand growth and the continued drag on the economy from net exports (Figure 1). Domestically, private consumption grew strongly in the first quarter but subsequently lost momentum, partly reflecting increased uncertainty due to rising trade protectionism and the wealth depreciation effect from adjustments in local asset prices. Due to fragile business confidence, the growth rate of overall investment expenditure also slowed. Externally, goods exports remained largely stable in the first three quarters but deteriorated significantly in the fourth quarter as Sino-US trade tensions intensified. Goods imports also slowed due to weaker export-driven demand. In contrast, service exports recorded faster annual growth, partly benefiting from robust performance in the tourism sector, while service imports maintained growth momentum largely due to expansion in transport, business, and other services. On a net basis, the trade balance shifted from a surplus in 2017 to a small deficit in 2018, dragging down local economic growth.\n\nTable 1: Real Gross Domestic Product Growth by Expenditure Category (Compared to the Previous Period)\n\nNote: The seasonally adjusted quarterly change in the total amount of fixed capital formation in the locality is not available.  \nData source: Census and Statistics Department.\n\nFigure 1: Contribution of Components to the Growth of Real Local GDP\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Currency status.\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate against the US dollar generally weakened in 2018, primarily due to carry trade activities driven by the negative interest rate differential between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar. In particular, the weak-side exchange guarantee was triggered in April, May, and August, prompting the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) to purchase Hong Kong dollars and sell US dollars at the level of 7.85 Hong Kong dollars to 1 US dollar, as stipulated by the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS). According to the design of the LERS, the Hong Kong dollar monetary base consequently contracted, indicating reduced interbank liquidity. Combined with market expectations of US interest rate hikes, this led to an overall increase in the Hong Kong interbank offered rate (HIBOR). As funding costs within the banking system rose, banks raised their prime lending rates by 12.5 to 25 basis points in late September following the upward adjustment of the US federal funds rate target range. In terms of credit growth, partly due to slower local economic growth and weaker external trade performance, the overall growth rate of bank loans significantly slowed from 16.1% in 2017 to 4.4% in 2018.\n\n# Inflation\n\nInflationary pressure slightly increased in 2018. Excluding the impact of one-off government relief measures, the underlying inflation rate rose from 1.7% in 2017 to 2.6% in 2018, although it remained at a moderate level. Among the components, the housing rental component increased more rapidly, reflecting the impact of earlier rises in private residential rents (Figure 2). A broader analysis showed that nominal labor costs and commercial property rents grew slightly faster, making local cost pressures more pronounced. As inflation rose in some major import sources for Hong Kong, import price inflation also increased accordingly.\n\nFigure 2: Basic Consumer Price Inflation. Data Source: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Labour market\n\nThe labor market remained robust in 2018 (Figure 3). The unemployment rate decreased from 3.1% in 2017 to 2.8% in 2018, the lowest level since 1997. The unemployment rate declined in most major service industries, with a particularly significant drop in the accommodation and food service sector. With total employment and the number of job vacancies in the private sector increasing further, overall labor demand continued to strengthen, and the labor force participation rate also rose slightly. Under the tightening labor market conditions, real wages and income increased further.\n\nFigure 3: Labour Market Situation. Data Source: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Stock Market\n\nThe Hong Kong stock market experienced a significant reversal in 2018. Driven by strong upward momentum in 2017, the Hang Seng Index rose to a historical high of 33,484 points in January 2018 (Figure 4). However, as major central banks tightened monetary policy, U.S.-China trade tensions escalated, and local economic growth slowed, investor concerns arose, and market sentiment reversed sharply. The Hang Seng Index fell to a low of 24,586 points in October and closed at 25,846 points at year-end, down 13.6% from the previous year. However, the average daily trading volume increased from HKD 88.2 billion in 2017 to HKD 107.4 billion, and the total funds raised from initial public offerings in Hong Kong also increased significantly due to several companies in the emerging and technology industries going public.\n\nFigure 4: Asset Prices. Data Source: Valuation and Rating Department, Inland Revenue Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market remained strong in the first half of 2018, but cooled down in the second half due to intensified Sino-US trade tensions, global stock market adjustments, and the rise of the most favorable interest rate in Hong Kong. Overall property prices fell by 9% from the peak between July and December, yet still recorded a 2% increase for the full year (Figure 4). Due to a significant decline in transaction activities in both the new and second-hand property markets during the second half, property transaction volumes in 2018 dropped by 7% to 57,247 units compared to the previous year. Moreover, purchasing affordability remained tight, with the price-to-income ratio and income leverage ratio at 17.0 and 75.7 respectively, both well above long-term average levels. On the other hand, non-residential property prices rose overall in 2018, but slightly declined towards the end of the year. For the full year, prices and rents continued to rise, while the rental yield remained at a low level.\n\n# Economic Prospects\n\n# Economic environment\n\nDue to the slowdown in global economic growth, Hong Kong's economic growth is expected to decelerate in 2019. Particularly, with a challenging external environment, Hong Kong's export performance is likely to remain under pressure. Locally, although low unemployment rates and rising household incomes will continue to support private consumption, the growth of private consumption is expected to slow down partly due to weakened consumer confidence and the wealth erosion effect from earlier asset price adjustments. Regarding fixed capital formation, although housing supply increases are expected to lead to steady growth in construction and property activities, businesses may become more cautious about capital investment in the face of heightened economic uncertainties. The government forecasts that the real GDP growth rate for Hong Kong in 2019 will range between 2% and 3%, while the latest average forecast by private sector analysts stands at 2.3%.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nDue to slowing global growth, including in Hong Kong, external price pressures and local cost pressures are expected to ease, moderating inflation in 2019. Recent declines in newly signed residential rental rates will also put downward pressure on inflation. Market consensus forecasts an overall inflation rate of 2.2% for 2019, while the government expects a core inflation rate of 2.5%. With continued economic growth and a robust tourism sector, the labor market conditions are expected to remain tight. Private sector analysts predict the unemployment rate will remain at approximately 3% in 2019.\n\n# Uncertain factors and risks.\n\nThe economic outlook for 2019 is influenced by uncertainties and risks such as trade tensions, the future direction of U.S. monetary policy, mainland China's economic performance, Brexit, and other geopolitical situations. Additionally, if these uncertainties intensify and persist in the long term, financial market sentiment and business confidence could be significantly affected, exerting downward pressure on local asset markets and real economic activities.\n\nIn addition, the residential property market is influenced by numerous external and local factors, and its future remains uncertain. Externally, the uncertainty surrounding US-China trade tensions could affect market sentiment, economic forecasts, and financial conditions, clouding the outlook for Hong Kong's property market. Locally, although economic growth has slowed, the employment situation and income growth remain relatively stable, which should support residential property demand. Hong Kong interest rates are partly dependent on future US policy rate changes, though the direction of those rates remains unclear. In the long term, increased residential construction in recent years, combined with the government’s efforts to expand land and housing supply, is expected to narrow the gap between supply and demand.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nDespite increased external headwinds such as the US-China trade conflict, Brexit, and the normalization of interest rates, which heightened financial market volatility, the banking sector in Hong Kong remained resilient in 2018. The sector’s capital and liquidity positions were robust, and asset quality remained good. Rising interest rates widened net interest margins, significantly boosting bank profits.\n\n# Balance sheet trends\n\nThe banking system continued steady growth in 2018, with the balance sheet expanding by 5.9%. Faced with the continued economic uncertainties, such as trade conflicts among major economies and interest rate hikes, businesses became more conservative in obtaining new loans. The annual growth rate of total loans slowed to 4.4%, compared to 16.1% in 2017. This growth was driven by increases in loans used in Hong Kong (+6.5%) and loans used outside Hong Kong (+2%). On the other hand, trade financing declined by 7.6% due to the uncertain global trade environment. The growth of loans related to mainland China also slowed from 17.5% in 2017 to 1.4% in 2018.\n\nThe total amount of debt securities held by the banking system continued to account for 22% of total assets at the end of 2018, the same as in 2017. Since most of these debt securities are investment-grade debt securities issued by governments and banks, the related credit risk remained at a low level.\n\nFrom the perspective of depositors, total deposits increased by 5% in 2018, a smaller increase than the 8.7% growth in 2017. Some banks raised time deposit rates in anticipation of continued interest rate hikes in the United States, encouraging depositors to convert their current and savings deposits into time deposits to lock in funds. The proportion of current and savings deposits in total deposits fell from 57.4% in the previous year to 51.4% by the end of 2018, leading to higher funding costs. Since the growth in total deposits outpaced the growth in total loans, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio slightly decreased from 73% at the end of 2017 to 72.6% by the end of 2018 (Figure 5).\n\nFigure 5: Loans and Deposits in the Banking System\n\n# Capital adequacy\n\nThe banking system has ample capital, indicating a strong buffer against potential shocks. Capital ratios are at historical highs since the implementation of Basel III; the aggregate total capital ratio of locally registered authorized institutions increased from 19.1% at the end of 2017 to 20.3% at the end of 2018 (Figure 6).\n\nFigure 6 Comprehensive Capital Ratio of Locally Registered Accredited Institutions\n\nThe Basel III leverage ratio took effect on January 1, 2018; this ratio is a non-risk-based regulation aimed at limiting excessive leverage accumulation in the banking system. By the end of 2018, the leverage ratio was 8.0%, far higher than the 3% legal minimum requirement (Figure 7).\n\nFigure 7 Comprehensive Leverage Ratio of Locally Registered Accredited Institutions\n\n# Liquidity\n\nThe liquidity position of the banking system remains robust, reflecting its strong capacity to effectively withstand potential financial and economic pressures. In terms of short-term liquidity (covering one-month funding), the average liquidity coverage ratio for Class 1 institutions was 167.6% in the fourth quarter, far exceeding the 90% statutory minimum requirement applicable in 2018. The average liquidity maintenance ratio for Class 2 institutions was 54.3%, also significantly higher than the 25% statutory minimum requirement (Figure 8).\n"}
{"zh":"# 貨幣穩定\n\n2018年港元利率普遍上升，而港元現貨匯率則回軟，並貼近弱方兌換保證匯率的水平。儘管如此，港元外匯及貨幣市場運作仍然暢順有序。聯繫匯率制度是香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石，並繼續展現其承受強大衝擊的能力。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的主要目標是維持貨幣穩定，即確保港元匯價穩定，使港元在外匯市場兌美元的匯率保持在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的區間內。該貨幣體制主要採用貨幣發行局制度，規定由外匯基金所持的美元儲備向貨幣基礎提供最少百分之百的支持；貨幣基礎若有變動，美元儲備亦必須作出相應增減，與貨幣基礎的變動百分之百配合。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n- 負債證明書（為3間發鈔銀行發行的銀行紙幣提供十足支持）\n- 政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣\n- 銀行在金管局所持結算戶口的結餘總額（即總結餘）\n- 金管局代表政府發行的外匯基金票據及債券。\n\n金管局透過自動利率調節機制及履行兌換保證的堅決承諾來維持港元匯率的穩定。若市場對港元的需求大過供應，令市場匯率轉強至7.75港元兌1美元的強方兌換保證匯率，金管局會向銀行沽出港元、買入美元，使總結餘增加及港元利率下跌，從而令港元匯率從強方兌換保證匯率水平回復至7.75到7.85的兌換範圍內。相反，若港元供過於求，令市場匯率轉弱至7.85港元兌1美元的弱方兌換保證匯率，金管局會向銀行買入港元，使總結餘減少及推高港元利率，港元匯率隨之由弱方兌換保證匯率水平回復至兌換範圍內。\n\n# 2018年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n在港元與美元負息差擴闊帶動套息活動的背景下，港元匯率自年初以來逐步轉弱。於4月12日，弱方兌換保證在2005年訂於7.85水平以來首度被觸發。全年計，弱方兌換保證在2018年合共被觸發27次，分別在4月被觸發13次，5月6次，以及8月8次。儘管如此，港元交易仍然暢順有序，港元匯率於4月中至9月中在弱方兌換保證匯率7.85附近徘徊（圖1）。其後港元匯率略為轉強，部分反映假期、季結及年結臨近，銀行同業流動性收緊，帶動部分套息交易平倉。同時，某程度上港元亦受到11月初股市氣氛好轉支持。整體而言，港元外匯市場在2018年全年正常運作。\n\n圖1 2018年市場匯率\n\n由於弱方兌換保證被觸發，總結餘與未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額由2017年底的12,268億港元，下降至2018年底的11,362億港元（圖2）。年內，金管局按照聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）的設計，應銀行要求於弱方兌換保證匯率7.85的水平，購入合共1,035億港元，總結餘因而由2017年底的1,798億港元下降至2018年底的764億港元。年內未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額沒有明顯變動。貨幣基礎仍然由外匯儲備提供十足支持。\n\n於2018年底，總結餘與未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額為11,362億港元。\n\n圖2 2018年總結餘及未償還外匯基金票據及債券\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n由於觸發弱方兌換保證後銀行同業流動性減少，以及市場預期美國加息，香港銀行同業拆息在2018年內普遍上升。受新股集資活動相關的資金需求增加及季節性流動資金需求帶動，短期銀行同業拆息更出現較大波幅（圖3）。整體而言，短期銀行同業拆息在2018年大致維持在低於基本利率的水平。鑑於銀行體系資金成本上升，在9月下旬美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍上調後，銀行調高最優惠貸款利率12.5至25基點。\n\n因應年內美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍4次合共上調100基點，由1.25至1.50厘上調至2.25至2.50厘，基本利率於3月22日、6月14日、9月27日及12月20日合共上調100基點，由1.75厘上調至2.75厘。基本利率的調整是按照2009年3月26日宣布的經修訂計算公式作出。按照該公式，基本利率定於美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍下限加50基點的水平，或隔夜與1個月香港銀行同業拆息的5天移動平均數的平均值水平，以兩者中較高者為準。\n\n圖3 2018年香港銀行同業拆息\n\n港元遠期匯率折讓在首4個月擴大，大致跟隨港元與美元息差的走勢，其中12個月港元遠期匯率點子在4月中達到負620點子（圖4）。其後隨着港元與美元的負息差收窄，港元遠期匯率折讓略為縮小，然後在第4季再度擴大。整體而言，香港貨幣市場繼續正常運作。貼現窗借貸由2017年的103億港元增至2018年的402億港元。\n\n圖4 2018年美元兌港元遠期匯率點子\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n聯匯制度自1983年實施以來，直是維持香港貨幣及金融穩定的重要基石；並在多次區內以至全球金融危機考驗下，展現其承受強大衝擊的能力。由於港元轉弱，作為聯匯制度設計一部分的弱方兌換保證於4月、5月及8月被多次觸發。資金流出港元，是香港利率正常化的必經過程，亦是聯匯制度下的正常運作。為增進各界對有關操作及聯匯制度機制的了解，金管局致力向公眾闡釋聯匯制度的技術細節，並展示香港金融體系應對衝擊的能力。政府亦堅決維持聯匯制度。外匯及貨幣市場保持穩定，進一步鞏固公眾對政府的承擔，以及港元作為支付及保值貨幣的信心。國際貨幣基金組織在與香港進行2018年第四條磋商時，重申對聯匯制度的支持，並指出聯匯制度仍然是最適合香港的貨幣制度，是維持穩定的支柱，有助確保經濟持續增長、維持競爭力及促進龐大的金融服務業暢順運作。\n\n鑑於穩健的銀行體系對聯匯制度的正常運作具關鍵作用，金管局繼續密切監察銀行的信用、流動性及利率風險管理，以及壓力測試結果，並維持對銀行的企業、物業相關及內地相關貸款的監管，以確保銀行體系具備承受衝擊的能力。銀行持有大量外匯基金票據及債券，可經貼現窗用作換取港元流動資金，為利率大幅波動的情況提供有效緩衝。金管局隨時準備透過調整外匯基金票據及債券的發行量以提供額外流動性，以應對資金可能急劇流出港元的情況。金管局亦提醒市民審慎管理市場及利率風險，並為可能出現的市場波動作好準備。\n\n為提高貨幣發行局帳目的透明度，自1998年10月起，外匯基金已有部分資產被指定用作支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（即支持資產相對貨幣基礎的比率）於2018年在107.8至109.9%之間上落，並無觸及上限或下限。該比率於12月31日為109.9%（圖5）。在聯匯制度下，雖然已指定某些外匯基金資產作為支持組合，但外匯基金的全部資產均可用作支持港元匯率。外匯基金的龐大財政資源，能在面對突如其來的衝擊時為保障香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供強力後盾。\n\n圖5 2018年支持比率每日變動\n\n# 貨幣發行委員會\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的貨幣發行委員會（貨幣發行委員會）負責監察和探討與香港貨幣及金融穩定有關的課題。在2018年，貨幣發行委員會探討的課題包括多國央行聯合退出非常規貨幣政策對在香港的境外銀行美元貸款供應造成的潛在影響、港元貨幣需求的利率敏感度，以及聯匯制度自3項優化措施以來的運作機制及理論。貨幣發行委員會會議紀錄及金管局向其呈交的貨幣發行局制度運作報告，均載於金管局網站。\n\n# 研究\n\n香港金融研究中心（研究中心）繼續支持貨幣政策、銀行業及金融範疇的研究工作。過去4年，研究中心更着重政策方面的研究，從所舉辦的研討會及訪問學者計劃尤其可見一斑。一方面，研究中心與主要中央銀行及政策研究機構合作，聯合舉辦更多政策相關的研討會。另一方面，在2016年推出專題研究學者計劃，支持更多與金管局政策制定相關的研究項目。\n\n在2018年，研究中心合共邀請16位研究學者到訪，並發表了25份研究論文。年內研究中心亦舉辦了4場國際研討會：\n- 於1月舉行的「第9屆中國經濟年度國際研討會」，主題為「中國房地產市場及其對經濟與金融穩定的影響」。研討會由研究中心、國務院發展研究中心市場經濟研究所及中國人民銀行金融研究所合辦，集中討論內地房地產市場相關的課題及風險。\n- 於10月舉行由金管局及國際結算銀行合辦的「匯率與貨幣政策框架」研討會。研討會為國際結算銀行於香港的亞太區辦事處成立20周年的慶祝活動之一，旨在探討匯率在貨幣政策框架中的角色。\n- 於11月舉行的「2018年中央銀行金融市場微結構的年度研討會」。研討會討論金融市場微結構理論研究、實證研究結果及近期發展相關的政策影響。\n- 於11月舉行由金管局、歐洲中央銀行及美國聯邦儲備委員會合辦的「中國經濟的新時代」中國專家網絡研討會。研討會討論內地經濟正面對的迫切問題及其對全球經濟的影響，並特別着重與中央銀行決策者相關的政策議題。這是中國專家網絡研討會首次在歐洲以外地區舉行。\n","terms":{"10年期美國國庫券收益率":["10-year US Treasury

rate weakened and approached the level of the weak-side exchange rate guarantee. Nevertheless, the Hong Kong foreign exchange and money markets continued to operate smoothly. The Linked Exchange Rate System remains the cornerstone of Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability and continues to demonstrate its ability to withstand strong shocks.\n\n# Objective\n\nThe primary objective of Hong Kong's monetary policy is to maintain monetary stability, ensuring the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar remains stable, keeping the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar against the US dollar in the foreign exchange market within the range of 7.75 to 7.85 Hong Kong dollars per US dollar. The monetary system primarily adopts the currency issuance bureau system, which stipulates that the dollar reserves held by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority must provide at least 100% support to the monetary base; if the monetary base changes, the dollar reserves must also be adjusted accordingly, fully matching the changes in the monetary base.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n- Certificates of Indebtedness (providing full backing for banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks)\n- Government-issued notes and coins\n- The aggregate balance of clearing accounts maintained by banks with the Monetary Authority (i.e., the total balance)\n- Exchange Fund Bills and Bonds issued by the Monetary Authority on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority maintains the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate through the automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and its firm commitment to the exchange rate guarantee. If market demand for the Hong Kong dollar exceeds supply, causing the market exchange rate to strengthen to the strong-side exchange rate guarantee of 7.75 Hong Kong dollars to 1 US dollar, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will sell Hong Kong dollars and buy US dollars from banks, increasing total reserves and lowering Hong Kong dollar interest rates. This action returns the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate from the strong-side exchange rate guarantee level to within the exchange rate range of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if the Hong Kong dollar is oversupplied, causing the market exchange rate to weaken to the weak-side exchange rate guarantee of 7.85 Hong Kong dollars to 1 US dollar, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will buy Hong Kong dollars from banks, reducing total reserves and raising Hong Kong dollar interest rates. This restores the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate to within the exchange rate range.\n\n# 2018 Retrospective\n\n# Exchange Rate Stability\n\nIn the context of widening negative interest rate differentials between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar driving arbitrage activities, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate has gradually weakened since the beginning of the year. On April 12, the linked exchange rate assurance mechanism was triggered for the first time since it was set at the 7.85 level in 2005. Throughout the year, the linked exchange rate assurance mechanism was triggered a total of 27 times in 2018, 13 times in April, 6 times in May, and 8 times in August. Nevertheless, Hong Kong dollar transactions remained smooth and orderly, and the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate hovered around the linked exchange rate assurance mechanism rate of 7.85 from mid-April to mid-September (Figure 1). Subsequently, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate strengthened slightly, partly reflecting the approach of holidays, quarter-end, and year-end, as well as tightening interbank liquidity, which drove some arbitrage transactions to close out. At the same time, the Hong Kong dollar was also supported to some extent by the improved stock market sentiment in early November. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar foreign exchange market operated normally throughout 2018.\n\nFigure 1: 2018 Market Exchange Rate\n\nDue to the activation of the weak-side exchange guarantee, the total reserves and the aggregate amount of outstanding bills and bonds issued by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority decreased from 12,268 billion HKD at the end of 2017 to 11,362 billion HKD at the end of 2018 (Figure 2). During the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), purchased a total of 103.5 billion HKD at the weak-side exchange guarantee rate of 7.85 at the request of banks, resulting in the total reserves decreasing from 1,798 billion HKD at the end of 2017 to 764 billion HKD at the end of 2018. The aggregate amount of outstanding bills and bonds issued by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority remained largely unchanged during the year. The monetary base continues to be fully supported by foreign exchange reserves.\n\nAs of the end of 2018, the total surplus and outstanding foreign exchange fund notes and bonds amounted to HKD 113.62 billion.\n\nFigure 2: 2018 Year-End Balance and Outstanding Foreign Exchange Fund Bills and Bonds\n\n# currency markets\n\nDue to reduced banking system liquidity following the triggering of the weak-side exchange guarantee and market expectations of U.S. interest rate hikes, Hong Kong interbank rates generally rose throughout 2018. Short-term interbank rates experienced greater volatility, driven by increased funding demands from new share offerings and seasonal liquidity requirements (Figure 3). Overall, short-term interbank rates remained largely below the benchmark rate in 2018. Due to rising funding costs in the banking system, banks increased the prime lending rate by 12.5 to 25 basis points after the U.S. Federal Funds Rate target range was raised in late September.\n\nIn response to the four increases within the year in the U.S. Federal Funds Rate Target Range, which collectively raised the range by 100 basis points from 1.25 to 1.50 percent to 2.25 to 2.50 percent, the basic interest rate was increased by a total of 100 basis points on March 22, June 14, September 27, and December 20, raising it from 1.75 percent to 2.75 percent. The adjustment of the basic interest rate was made according to the revised calculation formula announced on March 26, 2009. According to this formula, the basic interest rate is set at the level of the lower bound of the U.S. Federal Funds Rate Target Range plus 50 basis points, or the 5-day moving average of the overnight and 1-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR), whichever is higher.\n\nFigure 3: Hong Kong Interbank Offer Rate (HIBOR) in 2018\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar forward exchange rate discount widened in the first four months, generally following the trend of the Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate differential. The 12-month Hong Kong dollar forward points reached negative 620 points in mid-April (Figure 4). Subsequently, as the negative Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate differential narrowed, the Hong Kong dollar forward exchange rate discount slightly decreased, then widened again in the fourth quarter. Overall, the Hong Kong monetary market continued to operate normally. Discount window lending increased from HKD 10.3 billion in 2017 to HKD 40.2 billion in 2018.\n\nFigure 4: Forward Exchange Rate Points of the US Dollar against the Hong Kong Dollar in 2018\n\n# Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nThe Exchange Rate Regime has been an important cornerstone for maintaining monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong since its implementation in 1983. It has demonstrated its ability to withstand strong shocks during multiple regional and global financial crises. Due to the weakness of the Hong Kong dollar, the weak-side exchange rate guarantee, which is part of the Exchange Rate Regime design, was triggered multiple times in April, May, and August. Capital outflows from the Hong Kong dollar are an inevitable process in the normalization of Hong Kong interest rates, and also a normal operation under the Exchange Rate Regime. To enhance public understanding of the operational mechanisms and the Exchange Rate Regime, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has been actively explaining the technical details of the Exchange Rate Regime to the public and demonstrating the ability of Hong Kong's financial system to respond to shocks. The government remains resolute in maintaining the Exchange Rate Regime. The stability of the foreign exchange and money markets further reinforces public confidence in the government's commitment and in the Hong Kong dollar as a medium of exchange and store of value. During the 2018 Fourth Review with the International Monetary Fund, the IMF reaffirmed its support for the Exchange Rate Regime and stated that it remains the most suitable monetary system for Hong Kong, serving as a pillar of stability that helps ensure sustained economic growth, maintain competitiveness, and facilitate the smooth operation of the large financial services sector.\n\nGiven the critical role of a robust banking system in the normal functioning of the Linked Exchange Rate System, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to closely monitor banks' credit risk, liquidity risk, and interest rate risk management, as well as the results of stress tests. It also maintains oversight of banks' corporate, property-related, and mainland China-related lending to ensure the banking system's resilience to shocks. Banks hold substantial amounts of Exchange Fund Bills and Bonds, which can be used at the discount window to obtain Hong Kong dollar liquidity, providing an effective buffer against significant interest rate fluctuations. The HKMA is always prepared to provide additional liquidity by adjusting the issuance volume of Exchange Fund Bills and Bonds to address potential sharp outflows of Hong Kong dollar funds. The HKMA also reminds the public to prudently manage market and interest rate risks and to prepare for possible market turbulence.\n\nTo enhance the transparency of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's accounts, since October 1998, certain assets of the Exchange Fund have been designated to support the currency base. The backing ratio (i.e., the ratio of supporting assets to the currency base) fluctuated between 107.8% and 109.9% in 2018, without reaching either the upper or lower limits. The ratio stood at 109.9% on December 31 (Figure 5). Under the linked exchange rate system, although certain Exchange Fund assets have been designated as part of the support portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets can be used to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. The substantial financial resources of the Exchange Fund can provide a strong buffer to safeguard Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability in the face of sudden shocks.\n\nFigure 5: Daily Fluctuation of Support Rate in 2018\n\n# Currency Board Sub-Committee\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC), which is under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, is responsible for monitoring and examining issues related to the stability of Hong Kong's currency and financial system. In 2018, the CBC examined topics including the potential impact of multiple central banks jointly exiting unconventional monetary policies on the supply of U.S. dollar loans by foreign banks in Hong Kong, the interest rate sensitivity of the demand for Hong Kong dollars, and the operational mechanisms and theoretical aspects of the Linked Exchange Rate System since the implementation of three optimization measures. Meeting minutes of the CBC and the reports on the operation of the Currency Board System submitted by the HKMA are available on the HKMA website.\n\n# Research\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research (HKIMR) continues to support research in the areas of monetary policy, banking, and finance. Over the past four years, HKIMR has placed greater emphasis on policy-related research, which is evident from the seminars it has organized and its visiting scholars program. On one hand, HKIMR collaborates with major central banks and policy research institutions to jointly host more policy-related seminars. On the other hand, it launched a specialized research scholars program in 2016 to support more research projects related to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's policy-making.\n\nIn 2018, the research center invited a total of 16 research scholars for visits and published 25 research papers. The research center also hosted 4 international conference activities throughout the year:\n- The “9th International Conference on the Chinese Economy” held in January, with the theme “The Impact of the Chinese Real Estate Market on Economic and Financial Stability.” The conference activities were co-organized by the research center, the Institute of Market Economy Research of the State Council Development Research Center, and the Financial Research Institute of the People’s Bank of China, focusing on issues and risks related to the mainland’s real estate market.\n- The “Exchange Rates and Monetary Policy Framework” conference activities held in October, co-organized by the HKMA and the Bank for International Settlements. The conference activities were part of the celebrations for the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the Bank for International Settlements’ Asia-Pacific Office in Hong Kong, and aimed to explore the role of exchange rates in the monetary policy framework.\n- The “2018 Annual Conference on Central Bank Financial Market Microstructure” held in November. The conference activities discussed policy implications related to theoretical research, empirical research results, and recent developments in financial market microstructure.\n- The CEN workshop “China’s New Era of Economic Development” held in November, co-organized by the HKMA, the European Central Bank, and the US Federal Reserve. The conference activities discussed the pressing issues facing the mainland economy and its impact on the global economy, with particular emphasis on policy issues relevant to central bank policymakers. This was the first time the CEN workshop had been held outside of Europe.\n"}
{"zh":"# 銀行體系穩定\n\n儘管環球經濟及金融市場的不確定性增加，2018年香港銀行體系維持穩健。認可機構的流動性及信用風險管理制度的成效繼續是金管局年內的監管重點。鑑於網絡威脅持續增加，以及銀行業更廣泛使用金融科技，金管局加強對認可機構科技風險管理及業務操作恢復能力的監管。金管局亦於5月發出《虛擬銀行的認可》指引修訂本，並開始處理虛擬銀行認可申請。在操守監管方面，金管局採取進一步措施，加強監管認可機構銷售投資及保險產品的手法、促進為殘疾人士提供無障礙銀行服務，以及推動以客為本的企業文化。\n\n隨着金融罪行越趨複雜及全球化，金管局繼續借助新科技及風險為本方法，加強香港打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度的應對能力。金管局在香港落實國際監管標準方面進展理想，其中包括資本充足標準、披露標準、流動性標準及大額風險承擔限額。此外，金管局亦加強與銀行業的溝通接觸，確保在監管成效與市場發展兩者間取得適當平衡。\n\n與此同時，金管局繼續致力確保香港備有具公信力的認可機構處置機制，其中包括推出最低吸收虧損能力規定的規則，以解決認可機構處置可行性面對的一大障礙。\n\n# 目標\n\n金管局的整體目標之一是促進銀行體系的安全及穩定。要達致這個目標，實有賴建立及維持具高度應對能力且能為香港經濟提供所需關鍵金融服務的金融體系。\n\n銀行可能因其營運方式，甚或在極端情況下因失序地倒閉而影響銀行體系的穩定。作為監管當局，金融管理專員在保障金融穩定方面擔當重要角色，確保銀行有能力抵禦衝擊、對危機作出應對，並自危機中恢復常態，以最終有助防止出現倒閉。金融管理專員負責對銀行進行審慎監管，以及認可香港的持牌銀行、有限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司（統稱「認可機構」）。金融管理專員亦負責某些金融市場基建的指定及監管。\n\n然而，金融管理專員不能確保金融體系全無風險，香港的審慎監管制度亦非為了確保「零風險」而設。作為其中一個處置機制當局，金融管理專員力求確保一旦有認可機構不再可持續經營，即能有序地處理其倒閉。為此，香港已設立金融機構處置機制，金融管理專員於該機制之下作為包括認可機構在內的若干金融機構的處置機制當局。為建立運作暢順的香港處置機制，必須制定處置法例及政策標準、進行處置規劃以清除認可機構處置可行性的障礙，以及建立金管局處置無法經營的認可機構的運作能力。為有效執行上述工作，金管局需要採納與國際一致及協調的方法。\n\n# 2018年回顧\n\n# 監管工作概覽\n\n金管局在2018年共進行187次非現場審查，涵蓋範圍廣泛，包括認可機構的CAMEL評級、企業管治、業務操作及風險管理，以及認可機構應對金融科技發展的業務策略。為繼續加強認可機構的風險管治水平，金管局與認可機構董事局或董事局轄下委員會共舉行27次會議，並跟進認可機構實施企業管治指引的進度。此外，金管局與認可機構及其外聘核數師共舉行28次三方聯席會議。\n\n除了非現場審查工作外，金管局繼續進行定期現場審查，並以專題評估作為配合，以審視被評估為較高風險的範疇。金管局於年內共進行392次現場審查及專題評估，並繼續以信用風險管理作為審查與評估的主要重點。其他重點為科技風險及業務操作風險管理，以及打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集管控措施。金管局亦增加針對流動性與市場風險管理，以及巴塞爾資本充足架構的實施情況的現場審查及專題評估次數。專項審查小組亦對認可機構的證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（強積金）相關業務進行現場審查。\n\n表1載有金管局於2018年的監管工作概要。\n\n# 信用風險的監管\n\n# 信貸增長及資產質素\n\n2018年信貸增長放緩，全年貸款總額增加4.4%，2017年的增幅則為16.1%（表2）。貿易融資於2018年減少7.6%。貸款增長放緩，主要是因為全球經濟及貿易環境越趨不明朗，以致信貸需求收縮。\n\n表2 貸款及墊款的增長\n\n內地相關貸款總額在2018年底增加1.4%至42,490億港元，低於2017年的增幅（表3）。\n\n表3 內地相關貸款增長\n\n認可機構的資產質素在2018年維持穩健。零售銀行的特定分類貸款比率由2017年底的0.56%下降至2018年底的0.50%，遠低於2000年以來的長期平均水平2.1%；同期，整體銀行業的特定分類貸款比率則由0.68%下降至0.55%。內地相關貸款方面，零售銀行的特定分類貸款比率由0.75%下降至2018年的0.63%，整體銀行業的相關比率亦由一年前的0.67%下降至0.54%。\n\n年內金管局加強監管，確保認可機構繼續採取審慎的信用風險管理準則。尤其金管局更主動了解大型企業的背景及結構，從而加強企業信用風險的監察制度。此外，金管局亦進行以主要信用風險管理監控措施為重點的專題評估，例如大型企業貸款的批核準則及風險管理、貸款分類及撥備制度、信用風險管治架構、地產發展商貸款的風險管理、有抵押貸款及保單抵押貸款等。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n住宅物業價格在2018年7月到達歷史高位，但在下半年出現緩和跡象。金管局自2009年10月以來推出的8輪逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施，已增強香港銀行體系應對本港樓市可能逆轉的抵禦能力。新造住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數由2009年9月金管局推出首輪逆周期措施前的64%，降至2018年12月的46%。平均供款與入息比率亦由2010年8月首度推出有關比率上限時的41%，降至2018年12月的34%（圖1）。\n\n圖1 新造住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數及供款與入息比率\n\n# 業務操作及科技風險的監管\n\n銀行業面對的科技風險仍然偏高。金管局於2016年推出「網絡防衛評估框架」。第一期實施安排涵蓋包括所有大型銀行在內的30間認可機構，該等認可機構已完成3個階段的評估，即自身風險程度評估、成熟程度評估及（如適用）風險資訊主導網絡攻防模擬測試。有關評估有助認可機構查找需要改進的運作範疇及採取補救措施，加強網絡防衛。與此同時，金管局已制定第二及第三期實施安排的時間表，這兩期實施安排將涵蓋其餘認可機構。年內金管局進行現場審查，集中檢視認可機構的網絡保安管控措施、外判安排及資訊科技管治。\n\n# 智慧銀行\n\n金管局繼續就2017年9月公布的7項推動智慧銀行的措施與銀行業合作，以促進金融科技在香港的發展。在監管層面，金管局於5月發出《虛擬銀行的認可》指引修訂本。此外，金管局在「銀行易」措施下，已經精簡有關遙距開戶、網上貸款及網上財富管理的監管要求。這些優化的監管要求有助銀行提供更佳的網上銀行用戶體驗。「銀行易」措施的工作範疇在9月擴大至促進銀行採用金融合規科技(Regtech)，而當中3個新的工作重點包括打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集的監察科技、用於審慎風險管理和合規的金融合規科技，以及「機器可讀」的監管要求。\n\n金管局副總裁阮國恒先生在香港銀行學會主辦的「香港銀行家峰會2018」上發表演辭，題為「智慧銀行新紀元下的金融合規科技」。\n\n# 流動性及市場風險的監管\n\n隨着美國貨幣政策持續正常化，金管局加強了流動性風險的監管，以確保認可機構審慎及有效地管理其流動性風險。年內金管局進行了一輪專題評估，以評估認可機構為美元流動性可能收緊所作的準備，以及其內部流動性壓力測試的能力。此外，金管局亦監察認可機構遵守於1月生效的「穩定資金淨額比率」要求的情況。\n\n金管局除檢視認可機構的債券組合的市場風險管理外，亦進行了針對《環球外匯守則》及非中央結算場外衍生工具的保證金和風險緩解標準的專題現場審查，以審視認可機構在財資業務中遵行新國際標準的情況。\n\n# 打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集\n\n政府於4月發表的《香港洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險評估報告》指出，香港銀行體系面對高洗錢威脅，這與其他國際金融中心一樣，亦反映金融服務日趨全球化及複雜。香港面對的洗錢威脅除源自本地犯罪活動外，在更大程度上也來自境外活動。該等境外活動包括來自境外貪污活動的非法得益、跨國犯罪集團的詐騙活動、逃稅及基於香港作為支付及貿易樞紐的地位而引致與制裁相關的風險。在金管局協助下，政府制定打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集政策聲明，列載對該等威脅的回應，目標是在提高打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度的應對能力的同時，又能吸引及便利正當企業。\n\n《2018年打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集（金融機構）（修訂）條例》於3月1日生效，引入的修訂包括在核實客戶身分方面賦予靈活性，以配合認可機構利用科技方便客戶開戶的發展。新法例亦擴大適用範圍，規定律師、會計師、地產代理及信託或公司服務提供者須負上打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集的責任，從而全面強化打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度。該等修訂連同《公司條例》為提高企業實益擁有權透明度而作出的修訂，有助認可機構執行打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集方面的工作。\n\n為鞏固及進一步強化與認可機構就打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集政策與監管方法的溝通，金管局在10月發出《監管政策手冊》下的全新單元「打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集的監管方法」，及配合相關法例修訂的《打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集指引（認可機構適用）》，以能更有效實施風險為本的方法，並減少認可機構就打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度採用新科技的障礙。\n\n資訊交流在打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度中的作用日見重要；在金管局與香港銀行公會（銀行公會）的支持下，銀行業積極參與反訛騙及洗黑錢情報工作組（情報工作組），並已取得實質成果。有關情報工作組先導計劃的檢討工作於2018年末展開，並會於2019年初完成。\n","terms":{"10年期美國國庫券收益率":["10-year

banking system remained resilient in 2018. The effectiveness of liquidity and credit risk management systems of authorized institutions continued to be a key regulatory focus for the HKMA throughout the year. In light of the persistent increase in cybersecurity threats and the broader adoption of fintech in the banking sector, the HKMA strengthened its oversight of authorized institutions' technology risk management and business continuity capabilities. The HKMA also issued the revised \"Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks\" in May and began processing applications for virtual bank authorizations. In terms of conduct regulation, the HKMA took further measures to enhance supervision over the methods used by authorized institutions to sell investment and insurance products, promote accessible banking services for people with disabilities, and foster a customer-centric corporate culture.\n\nAs financial crimes become increasingly complex and globalized, the HKMA continues to leverage new technologies and risk-based approaches to enhance Hong Kong's capacity to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. The HKMA has made satisfactory progress in implementing international regulatory standards in Hong Kong, including capital adequacy standards, disclosure standards, liquidity standards, and large risk exposure limits. Furthermore, the HKMA has also strengthened communication with the banking sector to ensure an appropriate balance between regulatory effectiveness and market development.\n\nAt the same time, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to strive to ensure that Hong Kong has a credible mechanism for dealing with authorized institutions, including introducing rules specifying a minimum loss-absorption capacity, to address a major obstacle to the feasibility of dealing with authorized institutions.\n\n# Objective\n\nOne of the HKMA’s overall objectives is to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this objective depends on establishing and maintaining a financial system with a high level of resilience and capable of providing the essential financial services needed by the Hong Kong economy.\n\nBanks may affect the stability of the banking system through their operational methods, or even in extreme cases through disorderly closures. As a regulatory authority, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) plays a crucial role in safeguarding financial stability, ensuring that banks have the capacity to withstand shocks, respond to crises, and recover to normal operations, ultimately helping to prevent failures. The HKMA is responsible for prudential regulation of banks, as well as authorizing licensed banks, restricted licensed banks, and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong (collectively referred to as authorized institutions). The HKMA also oversees the designation and regulation of certain financial market infrastructures.\n\nHowever, financial supervisors cannot guarantee a financial system free from risk, and Hong Kong’s prudential regulatory system is not designed to ensure “zero risk.” As one of the resolution authorities, the financial supervisor strives to ensure that if a licensed institution ceases to be viable, it can be handled in an orderly manner. To this end, Hong Kong has established a financial institution resolution mechanism, within which the financial supervisor acts as the resolution authority for a number of financial institutions, including licensed institutions. To establish a smoothly functioning Hong Kong resolution mechanism, it is necessary to formulate resolution legislation and policy standards, conduct resolution planning to remove obstacles to the feasibility of licensed institution resolution, and build the operational capability of the financial supervisor to resolve non-viable licensed institutions. To effectively carry out the above work, the financial supervisor needs to adopt methods consistent with and coordinated with international practices.\n\n# 2018 Retrospective\n\n# Supervisory Work Overview\n\nThe HKMA conducted 187 off-site inspections in 2018, covering a wide range of areas including the CAMEL ratings of authorized institutions, corporate governance, business operations, risk management, and business strategies of authorized institutions in response to the development of fintech. To further enhance the risk management standards of authorized institutions, the HKMA held 27 meetings with the boards or committees under the boards of authorized institutions and followed up on the progress of implementing corporate governance guidelines by authorized institutions. In addition, the HKMA held 28 trilateral meetings with authorized institutions and their external auditors.\n\nIn addition to off-site review work, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to conduct regular on-site inspections, supplemented by thematic assessments, to examine areas assessed as higher risk. During the year, the HKMA carried out a total of 392 on-site inspections and thematic assessments, continuing to focus primarily on credit risk management. Other key areas included technology risk and operational risk management, as well as measures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. The HKMA also increased the number of on-site inspections and thematic assessments targeting liquidity and market risk management, as well as the implementation of the Basel Capital Adequacy Framework. Specialized review teams also conducted on-site inspections of authorized institutions' securities, investment products, insurance, and mandatory provident fund (MPF)-related businesses.\n\nTable 1 outlines the Financial Supervisory Commission’s regulatory work summary for 2018.\n\n# Credit Risk Regulation\n\n# Loan growth and asset quality\n\nCredit growth slowed in 2018, with the total loan amount increasing by 4.4% for the year, compared to a 16.1% increase in 2017 (Table 2). Trade financing decreased by 7.6% in 2018. The slower growth in loans was mainly due to the increasingly uncertain global economic and trade environment, leading to a contraction in credit demand.\n\nTable 2: Growth of Loans and Advances\n\nThe total loan amount from China increased by 1.4% to HK$424.9 billion at the end of 2018, lower than the growth rate in 2017 (Table 3).\n\nTable 3: Domestic-Related Loan Growth\n\nThe asset quality of recognized institutions remained stable in 2018. The specific classified loan ratio for retail banks decreased from 0.56% at the end of 2017 to 0.50% at the end of 2018, significantly below the long-term average of 2.1% since 2000; during the same period, the specific classified loan ratio for the banking sector as a whole decreased from 0.68% to 0.55%. Regarding loans related to Mainland China, the specific classified loan ratio for retail banks decreased from 0.75% to 0.63% in 2018, while the relevant ratio for the banking sector as a whole also decreased from 0.67% the previous year to 0.54%.\n\nWithin the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority strengthened its supervision to ensure that authorized institutions continue to adopt prudent credit risk management principles. In particular, the HKMA has taken a more proactive approach to understanding the background and structure of large corporations, thereby enhancing the monitoring system for corporate credit risk. In addition, the HKMA also conducted thematic assessments focusing on key credit risk management monitoring measures, such as the approval criteria and risk management of large corporate loans, loan classification and provisioning systems, credit risk governance frameworks, risk management of loans to property developers, as well as mortgage loans and insurance policy-backed loans.\n\n# Property mortgage loan\n\nResidential property prices reached a historical high in July 2018, but showed signs of easing in the second half of the year. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) eight rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures introduced since October 2009 have enhanced the resilience of Hong Kong's banking system against a potential reversal in the local property market. The average loan-to-value ratio for new residential mortgages fell from 64% before the HKMA introduced its first round of countercyclical measures in September 2009, to 46% in December 2018. The average debt-to-income ratio also dropped from 41% when the HKMA first introduced a cap on this ratio in August 2010, to 34% in December 2018 (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 New residential mortgage loans' average loan-to-value ratio and debt-to-income ratio\n\n# Operational and technological risk oversight.\n\nThe technology risks faced by the banking sector remain relatively high. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) introduced the \"Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework\" in 2016. The first phase implementation covers 30 authorized institutions, including all major banks, and these authorized institutions have completed three stages of assessment: self-assessment of their risk levels, maturity assessment, and (where applicable) risk information-driven cyber attack simulation testing. These assessments help authorized institutions identify areas of operation requiring improvement and take corrective actions to enhance their cyber resilience. Meanwhile, the HKMA has developed a timetable for the implementation of the second and third phases, which will cover the remaining authorized institutions. During the year, the HKMA will conduct on-site reviews, focusing on examining the cyber security controls, outsourcing arrangements, and information technology governance of authorized institutions.\n\n# Smart Banking\n\nThe HKMA continues to collaborate with the banking industry on the seven measures announced in September 2017 to promote smart banking and foster the development of fintech in Hong Kong. On the regulatory front, the HKMA issued the revised \"Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks\" in May. In addition, under the \"Banking Made Easy initiative,\" the HKMA has streamlined regulatory requirements related to remote account opening, online loans, and online wealth management. These streamlined regulatory requirements help banks provide better online banking user experiences. The scope of the \"Banking Made Easy initiative\" was expanded in September to promote the adoption of financial compliance technology (Regtech), with three new focus areas including monitoring technology for combating money laundering and terrorist financing, Regtech for prudential risk management and compliance, and \"machine-readable\" regulatory requirements.\n\nMr. Ruan Guohang, Deputy Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, delivered a speech titled \"Financial Compliance Technology in the New Era of Smart Banking\" at the \"Hong Kong Bankers' Summit 2018,\" hosted by the Hong Kong Institute of Bankers.\n\n# Regulatory Oversight of Liquidity and Market Risk\n\nAs the US monetary policy continues to normalize, the Financial Services and Markets Commission has strengthened the regulation of liquidity risk to ensure that authorized institutions prudently and effectively manage their liquidity risk. This year, the Commission conducted a round of thematic assessments to evaluate authorized institutions’ preparations for potential tightening of US dollar liquidity and their ability to conduct internal liquidity stress tests. In addition, the Commission also monitors authorized institutions’ compliance with the “Net Stable Funding Ratio” requirements, which took effect in January.\n\nIn addition to reviewing the market risk management of authorized institutions' bond portfolios, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority conducted a special on-site review focused on the Foreign Exchange Global Code and the margin and risk mitigation standards for non-central clearing OTC derivatives, to examine how authorized institutions are complying with new international standards in their financial services business.\n\n# AML\/CFT\n\nThe Hong Kong Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment Report, published by the government in April, points out that Hong Kong's banking system faces significant money laundering threats, similar to other international financial centers, reflecting the increasing globalization and complexity of financial services. These threats originate not only from local criminal activities but, to a greater extent, from overseas activities, including illicit proceeds from corruption abroad, fraudulent activities by transnational criminal organizations, tax evasion, and risks related to sanctions arising from Hong Kong's role as a hub for payments and trade. With the assistance of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the government formulated a policy statement on combating money laundering and terrorist financing, outlining responses to these threats. The objective is to enhance the resilience of the anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing system while simultaneously attracting and facilitating legitimate businesses.\n\nThe Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) (Amendment) Ordinance 2018 came into effect on March 1, introducing amendments that provide flexibility in verifying customer identities to align with the development of technology-enabled customer onboarding by authorized institutions. The new legislation also broadens the scope of application, requiring lawyers, accountants, real estate agents, and trust or company service providers to take responsibility for combating money laundering and terrorist financing, thereby comprehensively strengthening the anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing regime. These amendments, together with the amendments to the Companies Ordinance aimed at enhancing transparency of beneficial ownership of enterprises, will assist authorized institutions in carrying out their work in combating money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\nTo strengthen and further enhance communication with authorized institutions on anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing policies and regulatory approaches, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) issued in October a new section titled \"Regulatory Approaches to Combating Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing\" under the Supervisory Policy Manual, as well as the updated \"Guidelines on Combating Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (for Authorized Institutions)\" in line with relevant legislative amendments. This aims to more effectively implement a risk-based approach and reduce obstacles for authorized institutions in adopting new technologies to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\nThe role of information exchange in combating money laundering and terrorist financing is increasingly important. With the support of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Hong Kong Bankers' Association, the banking sector has actively participated in the Anti-Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Working Group and has achieved substantial results. The review of the Working Group’s pilot program commenced at the end of 2018 and will be completed in early 2019.\n"}

轄下金融市場工作小組主席。\n\n香港金融基建的安全及有效運作，為香港作為國際金融中心的地位奠定穩固基礎。處理銀行同業交易的4個RTGS系統、債務工具中央結算系統（CMU系統）及香港交易資料儲存庫（香港儲存庫）在2018年達到100%的系統可供使用率，高於99.95%的目標水平。透過於內地兩個中央證券託管機構的帳戶，CMU系統繼續協助結算「債券通」北向通交易，以及替相關CMU系統成員持有內地債務證券。\n\n為促進零售支付業的整體安全及效率，金管局於8月根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（《支付條例》）指定多兩個零售支付系統，使其運作受到金管局監察。迄今受金管局監察的指定零售支付系統增至6個。金管局亦對16個儲值支付工具持牌人進行監管。有關持牌人積極推出新產品及服務，致力為客戶提供更多選擇及更佳的用戶體驗。與此同時，電子支票與電子帳單及繳費服務涵蓋範圍，進一步擴展至包括香港與整個廣東省的跨境支付交易。\n\n# 2018年回顧\n\n# 香港作為亞洲的金融科技樞紐\n\n# 推動智慧銀行的措施\n\n金管局於2017年9月公布7項推動智慧銀行的措施，旨在協助銀行業提升至更高層次，並把握銀行與科技結合帶來的龐大機遇。金管局於年內在落實這些措施及為香港金融生態轉型方面，進展良好。\n\n# 「轉數快」\n\n「轉數快」於9月成功啟動，方便銀行及儲值支付工具用戶隨時隨地進行港元及人民幣的跨行即時資金轉帳，用戶只需輸入收款人的手機號碼或電郵地址。共有21間銀行（包括大部分零售銀行）及10間儲值支付工具營運商已加入該系統，為客戶提供即時支付服務及╱或帳戶綁定服務。\n\n「轉數快」在3.5個月內已接獲超過200萬個登記，相對香港人口比例27%。該系統自推出以來處理超過480萬宗交易，涉及總額逾1,049億港元及27.5億元人民幣。\n\n金管局於同月推出香港零售支付共用二維碼標準及相關流動應用程式「香港共用二維碼」(HKQR)，是全球首創將多個二維碼整合成為個綜合二維碼的流動應用程式，方便商戶尤其中小企以同一個二維碼接受不同支付服務營運商的支付方案，無需向客戶展示多個二維碼。\n\n# 開放應用程式介面\n\n開放API是指透過向第三方服務供應商開放銀行的相關數據，更好更方便地融合銀行與其他行業的服務。用家單用一個系統就能在安全環境下享受綜合服務。為促進銀行界研發及提供開放API，金管局於7月發布開放API框架。該框架採用風險為本原則，並分4個階段落實各項開放API功能。截至2019年1月底，20間銀行已開放第一階段約500個開放API接口，涵蓋逾1,000項產品及服務的資料。\n\n# 科研及人才培訓\n\n建基於金管局主導的貿易融資概念驗證成果由香港多間銀行組成的聯盟於10月啟動以分布式分類帳技術(DLT)為基礎的貿易融資平台「貿易聯動」。該平台旨在透過數碼化貿易文件及自動化貿易融資流程，減低失誤及詐騙風險。截至2018年底，已有12間銀行加入成為該聯盟成員。「貿易聯動」與歐洲貿易融資平台「we.trade」於10月簽署《諒解備忘錄》，進行對接雙方平台的概念驗證。金管局亦同步探討「貿易聯動」與其他地區對接的機會，包括與新加坡金融管理局合作推出「全球貿易連接網絡」。\n\n金管局總裁陳德霖先生（左）於「貿易聯動」啟動儀式上。\n\n為培育更多金融科技專才，金管局於1月與香港應用科技研究院（應科院）合作推出「金融科技人才培育計劃」升級版(FCAS 2.0)。FCAS 2.0設有4個項目，適合處於不同職涯發展階段的年輕人才。計劃下有200多名學生受惠。\n\n金管局總裁陳德霖先生（左二）與數碼港主席林家禮博士（左一）、香港應科院主席王明鑫先生（右二）及香港科技園公司行政總裁黃克強先生（右一）出席FCAS 2.0啟動儀式。\n\n# 跨境合作\n\n繼於2017年與深圳市人民政府金融發展服務辦公室（深圳金融辦）簽署《諒解備忘錄》後，金管局繼續加強與深圳的金融科技合作。當中包括金管局贊助「深圳金融科技暑期實習計劃」，讓50名學生到深圳多間著名公司進行為期6星期的實習，體驗當地的金融科技生態；另與深圳金融辦第二次合辦「深港金融科技創新獎」。\n\n金管局副總裁李達志先生（右二）與首批深圳金融科技暑期實習生交談。\n\n金管局亦於2018年與瑞士金融市場監督管理局、波蘭金融監管局、阿布扎比國際金融中心金融服務監管局及巴西中央銀行簽署金融科技合作協議，促進金融科技合作。\n\n在8月，金管局與11間金融監管當局和相關機構公布「全球金融創新網絡」計劃。該網絡旨在為創新型公司提供更有效方式與監管機構進行互動，並促進監管機構之間就創新相關議題的合作。\n\n# 虛擬銀行\n\n引入虛擬銀行將會為香港金融科技應用增添新動力，並為數碼銀行客戶帶來嶄新體驗。虛擬銀行以個人或中小企等零售客戶為對象，因此亦有助促進普及金融。經公眾諮詢，金管局於5月發出《虛擬銀行的認可》指引修訂本，並於8月底接獲約30宗申請。\n\n# 金融科技監管沙盒\n\n年內沙盒的使用穩步上升。為協助建立金融合規科技的生態系統，沙盒於9月起開放予金融合規科技的項目。\n\n截至2018年底，共有42項金融科技或科技產品獲准使用沙盒進行測試，其中28項已完成試行，有關產品亦已於其後推出市場。金管局另接獲220項使用「金融科技監管聊天室」的個案，希望在金融科技項目構思初期取得監管反饋意見。其中有約70%的個案來自科技公司。\n","terms":{"10年期美國國庫券收益率":["10-year

center is one of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's main responsibilities. The seven measures aimed at promoting the development and application of financial technology in the banking and payment sectors have made good progress this year, with the best example being the successful launch of the Faster Payment System.\n\nThe enhanced connectivity plan between mainland China and Hong Kong's capital markets, along with the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, has further strengthened Hong Kong’s unique position as a gateway to mainland China. Hong Kong’s status as a global offshore RMB business hub is also more secure, and RMB financial activities in the city are thriving.\n\nAt the same time, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is committed to exploring new opportunities to further enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong's financial platform, including infrastructure financing, corporate treasury centers, and the green bond market. The HKMA is also strengthening its market promotion initiatives to communicate Hong Kong's advantages to overseas and mainland stakeholders. On the international front, the HKMA plays a leading role in several regional and international committees, clearly demonstrating Hong Kong's expertise and commitment in relevant international endeavors.\n\n# Overview\n\nTo strengthen Hong Kong's position as an Asian fintech hub, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is committed to implementing seven measures announced in September 2017 to promote the development and application of fintech in the banking and payment industries. Key progress made this year in advancing smart banking through these measures includes:\n\n- Successfully launched the Faster Payment System FPS, fully connecting different banks and stored-value payment tools (collectively known as e-wallets).\n- Released a framework for the banking industry’s Open APIs and promoted the implementation of Open APIs within the industry;\n- Enhanced financial technology research and talent training;\n- Strengthened cross-border financial technology cooperation;\n- Revised the Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks and processed virtual banking license applications;\n- The upgraded Fintech Supervisory Sandbox (FSS 2.0) is operating smoothly; and\n- Expanded the Banking Made Easy initiative to encourage banks to adopt financial compliance technology.\n\nThe Financial Technology Facilitation Office (FFO) under the Financial Supervisory Commission, together with the Commission’s various banking departments, plays a vital role in promoting the implementation of the aforementioned measures.\n\nAs optimization measures for the mutual market access plan between the Mainland and Hong Kong continue to be implemented, Hong Kong’s unique position as a major gateway to the Mainland market is further strengthened. The full implementation of the Bond Connect’s immediate funds and securities settlement (DvP) and the State Council’s announcement of tax exemptions for overseas investors investing in the Mainland bond market have further enhanced the plan’s efficiency and attractiveness. The HKMA is also working closely with Mainland authorities to explore and implement a number of financial measures to facilitate the lives, work and business of individuals and enterprises in the GBA. Hong Kong’s offshore renminbi business continues to flourish, with the renminbi deposit pool rising 6% year-on-year to RMB 657.7 billion; the renminbi Real-Time Gross Settlement system recorded a high daily average transaction volume of RMB 101.01 billion.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is actively exploring new opportunities to further enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. To promote the development of Hong Kong’s bond market, the HKMA has implemented the \"Pilot Bond Grant Scheme\" proposed in the Budget initiative, providing financial support to institutions issuing bonds for the first time in Hong Kong. It is also closely collaborating with the government to amend legislation, expanding the scope of bond investment income eligible for tax exemption under the Qualifying Debt Instrument scheme. Additionally, the HKMA has intensified its market promotion activities, communicating Hong Kong’s advantages to overseas and mainland stakeholders, including organizing a number of large-scale and thematic outreach events to position Hong Kong as a hub for green finance, infrastructure financing, and corporate treasury centers.\n\nAt the international level, the HKMA leads several regional and international committees. The HKMA currently serves as Chair of the Standing Committee on Regulatory Coordination under the Financial Stability Board, the Regulatory and Implementation Guidelines Group under the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), and Chair of the Financial Markets Working Group under the East Asia and Pacific Central Banks Meeting (EMEAP).\n\nHong Kong’s financial infrastructure operates safely and efficiently, laying a solid foundation for its status as an international financial center. The four real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems handling interbank transactions, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU), and the Hong Kong Trade Repository (HKTR) all achieved 100% system availability in 2018, exceeding the target level of 99.95%. Through accounts at two central securities depositories on the mainland, the CMU continues to facilitate the settlement of northbound trading under Bond Connect, and to hold mainland debt securities on behalf of its members.\n\nTo enhance the overall safety and efficiency of the retail payment industry, the HKMA designated two additional retail payment systems in August under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO), bringing the number of designated retail payment systems under the HKMA's supervision to six. The HKMA also regulates 16 licensed stored value facility operators. These licensees are actively introducing new products and services to provide customers with more choices and a better user experience. Meanwhile, the coverage of electronic cheques and electronic bill and payment services has further expanded to include cross-border payment transactions between Hong Kong and the entire province of Guangdong.\n\n# 2018 Retrospective\n\n# Hong Kong as Asia's Fintech Hub\n\n# Steps to Advance Smart Banking\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) announced seven measures to promote smart banking in September 2017, aimed at helping the banking industry reach a higher level and seize the vast opportunities brought about by the integration of banking and technology. The HKMA has made good progress during the year in implementing these measures and facilitating the transformation of Hong Kong's financial ecosystem.\n\n# FPS\n\nThe Faster Payment System (FPS) was successfully launched in September, enabling bank and stored value payment tool users to make real-time interbank transfers in Hong Kong dollars and Renminbi anytime and anywhere by simply entering the recipient's mobile phone number or email address. A total of 21 banks (including most retail banks) and 10 stored value payment tool operators have joined the system, providing customers with instant payment services and\/or account linking services.\n\n\"Faster Payment System\" (FPS) has received over 2 million registrations within 3.5 months, accounting for 27% of Hong Kong's population. Since its launch, the system has processed over 4.8 million transactions, involving a total value of over HKD 104.9 billion and RMB 2.75 billion.\n\nThe HKMA launched the Hong Kong Retail Payment Common QR Code Standard and its related mobile application, \"Hong Kong Common QR Code\" (HKQR), in the same month. This is the world’s first mobile application to integrate multiple QR codes into a single, unified QR code, making it easier for merchants, particularly SMEs, to accept payment solutions from different payment service providers using a single QR code, without needing to display multiple QR codes to customers.\n\n# Open Application Programming Interface\n\nOpen API refers to the practice of opening a bank's relevant data to third-party service providers, enabling better and more convenient integration of banking services with those of other industries. Users can enjoy comprehensive services in a secure environment through a single system. To promote the development and provision of open APIs in the banking sector, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority released the Open API framework in July. The framework adopts a risk-based approach and implements various open API functions in four stages. As of the end of January 2019, approximately 500 open API interfaces in the first stage had been opened by 20 banks, covering data on more than 1,000 products and services.\n\n# Research and Talent Development\n\nA consortium of Hong Kong banks, led by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, launched eTradeConnect in October, building on the results of the HKMA’s trade finance initiative. The platform, based on distributed ledger technology (DLT), aims to reduce errors and fraud risks by digitizing trade documents and automating trade finance processes. By the end of 2018, 12 banks had joined the consortium. In October, eTradeConnect signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the European trade finance platform we.trade to conduct a proof of concept for linking the two platforms. The HKMA is also exploring opportunities to connect eTradeConnect with other regions, including collaborating with the Monetary Authority of Singapore to launch the Global Trade Connectivity Network.\n\nMr. Chen Der-lin, Governor of the Financial Supervisory Commission (left), at the eTradeConnect launch ceremony.\n\nTo cultivate more fintech specialists, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) launched the upgraded version of the \"Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme\" (FCAS 2.0) in January in collaboration with the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute (ASTRI). FCAS 2.0 features four programs tailored for young talents at different career development stages. Over 200 students have benefited from the program.\n\nMr. Chan Tak-lun, Director of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (second from the left), Dr. Lam Ka-lee, Chairman of Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks (first from the left), Mr. Wang Ming-sin, Chairman of the Hong Kong Institute of Applied Science and Technology (second from the right), and Mr. Huang Ke-chiang, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Company (first from the right) attended the FCAS 2.0 launch ceremony.\n\n# Cross-border Collaboration\n\nFollowing the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding with the Shenzhen Financial Development Service Office (OFDS) in 2017, the HKMA continues to strengthen its fintech collaboration with Shenzhen. This includes the HKMA sponsoring the Shenzhen Summer Internship Programme, allowing 50 students to intern at several well-known companies in Shenzhen for six weeks to experience the local fintech ecosystem; and co-organizing the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Fintech Award with the OFDS for a second time.\n\nMr. Li Dazhi, Deputy Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (second from the right), discussed with the first batch of Shenzhen Fintech summer interns.\n\nThe Authority also signed a fintech cooperation agreement with the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, the Polish Financial Supervision Authority, the Abu Dhabi Global Market Financial Services Regulatory Authority, and the Central Bank of Brazil in 2018 to promote fintech collaboration.\n\nIn August, the Monetary Authority jointly announced the \"Global Financial Innovation Network\" initiative with 11 financial regulatory authorities and related institutions. This network aims to provide innovative companies with more effective ways to interact with regulatory authorities and to promote cooperation among regulatory bodies on issues related to innovation.\n\n# Virtual Banking\n\nIntroducing virtual banks will add new impetus to Hong Kong's fintech applications and bring innovative experiences to digital banking customers. Virtual banks target retail customers such as individuals and SMEs, thus helping promote financial inclusion. Following public consultation, the HKMA issued the revised \"Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks\" in May and received approximately 30 applications by the end of August.\n\n# Fintech Supervisory Sandbox\n\nThe use of the sandbox has steadily increased throughout the year. To help build an ecosystem for financial compliance technology, the sandbox was opened to projects in financial compliance technology starting in September.\n\nAs of the end of 2018, a total of 42 fintech or technology products had been approved to use the sandbox for testing, of which 28 had completed the trial, and the relevant products have since been launched in the market. The HKMA also received 220 cases involving the use of the \"FSS Chatroom,\" seeking regulatory feedback on fintech projects at the early stages of development. Approximately 70% of these cases came from technology companies.\n"}
{"zh":"# 儲備管理\n\n2018年對投資者而言是困難的一年，投資環境備受多項風險因素困擾，包括美國利率持續正常化引發金融狀況收緊、主要經濟體之間的貿易摩擦升級，以及全球多處民粹主義抬頭及地緣政治風險加劇。環球股市普遍向下，美國國庫券收益率亦隨着美國聯邦儲備局4次加息而上升。在美息趨升下，美元轉強。部分新興市場面對國內嚴峻的政治及經濟壓力，其貨幣顯著下挫。儘管投資環境充滿挑戰，外匯基金在2018年仍錄得109億港元投資收入。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》，外匯基金的首要目的是直接或間接影響港元匯價，亦可運用於保持香港貨幣及金融體系穩定健全，藉此保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。金管局根據財政司司長轉授的權力及轉授權力的條款，就外匯基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標及組合架構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會為外匯基金制定下列投資目標：\n\n(a) 保障資本；\n(b) 確保整體貨幣基礎在任何時候都由流通性極高的美元資產提供十足支持；\n(c) 確保流動資金足以維持貨幣及金融穩定；以及\n(d) 在符合上述(a)至(c)項的前提下盡量爭取投資回報，以保障基金的長期購買力。\n\n以上目標全面顧及外匯基金的法定目的，並已於外匯基金的組合結構及目標資產配置中反映。\n\n外匯基金大致上分成兩個主要組合：支持組合及投資組合。支持組合持有流通性極高的美元資產，按照貨幣發行局制度的規定為貨幣基礎提供十足支持。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債市及股市，以保障資產的價值及長期購買力。\n\n為能更妥善管理風險及提高中長期回報，金管局以審慎及循序漸進方式將外匯基金的部分資產分散投資至較多元化的資產類別，包括新興巿場及內地債券與股票、私募股權（包括基建）及房地產。新興巿場及內地債券與股票由投資組合持有，私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合持有。長期增長組合的市值上限為外匯基金累計盈餘的三分之一及未來基金與外匯基金附屬公司存款中與長期增長組合掛鈎部分的總和。\n\n策略性資產組合於2007年設立，以持有政府基於策略性目的而為外匯基金帳目購入的香港交易及結算所有限公司股份。由於這個組合性質獨特，因此外匯基金的投資表現評估並無將其包括在內。\n\n# 於外匯基金的存款\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定組織的存款，利率一般與投資組合的表現掛鈎，但主要以未來基金除外。未來基金存款的利率與投資組合及長期增長組合的表現掛鈎，實際利率視乎組合比重而定。於2018年底，未來基金在投資組合與長期增長組合的比重約為50:50。\n\n# 投資程序\n\n外匯基金的投資程序分別以策略性資產配置及戰略性資產配置作基礎。策略性資產配置，即投資基準反映的配置情況，顯示外匯基金為達到投資目標而可作出的長線資產配置。外匯基金以策略性配置作為指引，對資產進行戰略性配置，以爭取超越基準的回報。因此，實際配置往往會與基準配置（亦即策略性配置）有所偏離，而實際與基準配置之間的差距稱為「戰略性偏離」。財政司司長經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後制定投資基準及循跡誤差限額，金管局獲授權決定戰略性資產配置及定出戰略性偏離的容許範圍。投資組合經理可在戰略性偏離的容許範圍內選持倉盤，從短期市場變化中獲利。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局於8月成立外匯基金投資辦公室，專責投資及相關風險管理職能。該辦公室職員負責直接管理外匯基金約72%的投資，包括整個支持組合及部分投資組合。該部分的投資組合投資於環球定息市場，並透過衍生工具執行外匯基金的宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 外聘投資經理\n\n除透過內部職員管理資產外，金管局亦僱用外聘投資經理負責管理外匯基金約28%的資產，包括所有上市股票組合及其他特別資產。僱用外聘投資經理的目的是要運用市場上最佳的專業投資技術為外匯基金投資，以取得可持續回報，並讓外匯基金受惠於多元化及互補的投資方式，以及汲取市場心得與專業投資技術知識。\n\n僱用外聘投資經理的相關支出包括基金管理與託管費、交易費、預扣稅及其他稅項。這些支出主要受市場因素影響而每年不同。\n\n# 風險管理及監察\n\n投資環境越趨複雜，突顯風險管理的重要。金管局為內部及外聘投資經理所管理的投資組合均訂立嚴格管控措施及投資指引，並密切監察對指引及法規的遵守情況。金管局已加強風險評估，以配合外匯基金越趨多元化的投資；另採用風險管控工具來評估在正常及極度不利市況下的市場風險。金管局亦進行詳細的投資表現因素分析，以識別促成不同表現的成因，藉此評估如何充分利用內部及外聘投資經理的投資管理技術。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n金管局支持負責任投資。例如，金管局已採納證券及期貨事務監察委員會公布的《負責任的擁有權原則》。該套原則旨在協助投資者釐定如何以最佳方法履行其於香港上市公司投資的擁有權責任。就外匯基金的管理而言，金管局已就環境、社會及管治因素制定內部指引，適用於外聘基金經理的甄選、委任及監察程序。獲委任負責主動式管理香港股票組合的外聘基金經理，須在管理有關投資時遵守《負責任的擁有權原則》。整體而言，金管局已將環境、社會及管治因素納入投資及相關監察活動的內部程序。金管局會密切注視環境、社會及管治因素的相關標準的發展，並評估如何能夠將這些標準進一步融入投資程序。此外，為促進負責任投資的國際合作，金管局已成為非牟利組織FCLTGlobal的成員，該組織旨在推動長遠目標為本的業務及投資決定。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2018年的金融市場\n\n在2018年，原先被市場低估的多項風險因素一一浮現，包括美國利率正常化的步伐、美國政府外貿政策和保護主義對全球貿易的衝擊，以及地緣政治的風險，環球金融市場因而出現大幅波動及調整。\n\n中美貿易爭議升級，令投資者非常憂慮，新興市場及香港股市自1月底開始反覆下跌，恒生指數自該月份的高位最多下跌27%。自第4季起，主要歐美股市亦大幅下滑，錄得雙位數字跌幅。就2018年整體而言，全球股市普遍下跌，涵蓋已發展國家股市的MSCI全球指數下跌10.4%，MSCI新興市場指數亦下跌16.6%。\n\n債市方面，由於美國貨幣政策正常化，美國國庫券收益率於2018年大致向上。然而，年內債市仍有波動。例如10年期美國國庫券收益率由年初約2.5%上升至11月3.2%的7年新高，但至年底時受投資者憂慮中美貿易爭議及趨向避險投資所影響而回軟至2.7%。\n\n貨幣市場方面，年內美元跟隨美國加息轉強。美匯指數上升4.4%，歐元及人民幣等主要貨幣兌美元下跌約5%。此外，部分新興市場受到國內政局及經濟不穩影響，其貨幣進一步受挫。例如，阿根廷披索及土耳其里拉兌美元分別下跌約五成及三成。相比之下，避險投資需求帶動日圓兌美元上升2.7%。\n\n表1列載主要貨幣、債巿及股市在2018年的表現。\n\n表1 2018年市場回報\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n外匯基金在2018年錄得109億港元投資收入，當中包括債券投資收益574億港元、香港股票投資虧損207億港元、其他股票投資虧損387億港元、非港元資產外匯估值下調90億港元，以及外匯基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資收益219億港元。另一方面，策略性資產組合錄得5億港元估值下調。\n\n於2018年年底，外匯基金的資產總值達40,549億港元。長期增長組合投資的總市值為2,836億港元，當中私募股權為1,911億港元，房地產為925億港元。已承擔但尚未提取作投資的總額為2,024億港元。\n\n外匯基金（不包括策略性資產組合）在2018年的投資回報率為0.3%，其中投資組合的回報率為負2.4%，支持組合為2.1%。長期增長組合自2009年開展投資以來的內部回報率年率為12.9%。\n\n圖1列明外匯基金由1994至2018年的年度回報率。表2顯示外匯基金在2018年的投資回報率及不同年期的平均投資回報率。外匯基金在過去3年的平均回報率為3.2%、過去5年為2.1%、過去10年為2.8%，以及自1994年起計為4.7%3。表3列載外匯基金資產於2018年12月31日的貨幣比重。\n","terms":{"10年期美國國庫券收益率":["10-year

risk factors, including the continued normalization of U.S. interest rates leading to tighter financial conditions, escalating trade tensions among major economies, and the rise of populism and heightened geopolitical risks in various parts of the world. Global stock markets generally declined, and U.S. Treasury yields rose alongside the Federal Reserve's four interest rate hikes. With rising U.S. interest rates, the U.S. dollar strengthened. Some emerging markets faced severe domestic political and economic pressures, leading to significant depreciation of their currencies. Despite the challenging investment environment, the Foreign Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$10.9 billion in 2018.\n\n# Exchange Fund\n\nAccording to the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the primary objective of the Exchange Fund is to influence the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar, directly or indirectly, and may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of the monetary and financial system in Hong Kong, thereby maintaining Hong Kong’s position as an international financial centre. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is accountable to the Financial Secretary for the operation and investment management of the Exchange Fund, in accordance with the provisions delegating powers from the Financial Secretary and the delegation of authority.\n\n# Foreign exchange fund management.\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nThe Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee has formulated the following investment objectives for the Foreign Exchange Fund:\n\n(a) Capital preservation;\n(b) Ensuring that the overall monetary base is always fully supported by highly liquid U.S. dollar assets;\n(c) Ensuring sufficient liquidity to maintain monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) Seeking to maximize investment returns, subject to the above (a) to (c), in order to safeguard the fund’s long-term purchasing power.\n\nThe above objectives comprehensively take into account the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund and have been reflected in the composition structure and target asset allocation of the Exchange Fund.\n\nThe foreign exchange fund is generally divided into two main portfolios: supporting portfolio and investment portfolio. The supporting portfolio holds highly liquid U.S. dollar assets, providing ample support for the currency base as stipulated by the currency issuance system. The investment portfolio primarily invests in the bond and stock markets of member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to safeguard asset value and long-term purchasing power.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance long-term returns, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has diversified part of the Exchange Fund's assets into a broader range of asset classes in a prudent and gradual manner, including emerging market and mainland bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure) and real estate. Emerging market and mainland bonds and equities are held by the investment portfolio, while private equity and real estate investments are held by the long-term growth portfolio. The market value cap of the long-term growth portfolio is set at one-third of the Exchange Fund's cumulative surplus plus the portion of future fund deposits and Exchange Fund affiliate deposits linked to the long-term growth portfolio.\n\nThe Strategic Asset Portfolio was established in 2007 to hold shares of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited purchased by the government for strategic purposes under the foreign exchange fund account. Due to its unique nature, the investment performance assessment of the foreign exchange fund does not include this portfolio.\n\n# Deposits in the Foreign Exchange Fund\n\nThe foreign exchange fund regularly accepts deposits from fiscal reserves, government funds, and statutory organizations, with interest rates generally linked to the performance of the investment portfolio, except for the Future Fund. Interest rates on deposits in the Future Fund are linked to the performance of both the investment portfolio and the long-term growth portfolio, with the actual interest rate depending on the proportion of each portfolio. As of the end of 2018, the proportion of the Future Fund in the investment portfolio and the long-term growth portfolio was approximately 50:50.\n\n# Investment Process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is based on both strategic asset allocation and tactical asset allocation. Strategic asset allocation, which reflects the investment benchmark, indicates the long-term asset allocation that the Exchange Fund can make to achieve its investment objectives. The Exchange Fund uses strategic allocation as a guide to implement tactical allocation of assets in order to achieve returns exceeding the benchmark. Therefore, the actual allocation often deviates from the benchmark allocation (i.e., strategic allocation), and the gap between the actual and benchmark allocations is referred to as \"tactical deviations.\" The Financial Secretary sets the investment benchmarks and tracking error limits after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is authorized to determine the strategic asset allocation and set the permissible range for tactical deviations. Portfolio managers can select holdings within the permissible range of tactical deviations to profit from short-term market fluctuations.\n\n# Investment Management\n\n# Direct Investment\n\nThe Monetary Authority established a Foreign Exchange Fund Investment Office in August, dedicated to investment and related risk management functions. The office’s staff are responsible for directly managing approximately 72% of the Foreign Exchange Fund’s investments, including the entire supporting portfolio and a portion of the investment portfolio. This portion of the investment portfolio invests in global fixed income markets and executes the Foreign Exchange Fund’s macroeconomic risk management strategies through derivative instruments.\n\n# External fund managers\n\nBesides managing assets through internal staff, the Financial Supervisory Commission also hires external investment managers to manage approximately 28% of the foreign exchange fund's assets, including all listed stock portfolios and other special assets. The purpose of hiring external investment managers is to utilize the best professional investment techniques available in the market for the foreign exchange fund's investments, to achieve sustainable returns, and to allow the foreign exchange fund to benefit from diversified and complementary investment approaches, as well as to learn market insights and professional investment techniques.\n\nExpenses related to hiring an external investment manager include fund management and custody fees, transaction costs, withholding and other taxes. These expenses are primarily influenced by market factors and vary annually.\n\n# Risk Management and Supervision\n\nAs the investment environment becomes increasingly complex, the importance of risk management is highlighted. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has established strict control measures and investment guidelines for both internal and externally hired investment managers, and closely monitors compliance with these guidelines and regulations. The Authority has also strengthened risk assessment to accommodate the growing diversification of the Foreign Exchange Fund's investments; it also employs risk control tools to evaluate market risks under normal and extremely adverse market conditions. Additionally, the Authority conducts detailed analysis of investment performance factors to identify the causes behind different performance outcomes, thereby assessing how to fully utilize the investment management expertise of both internal and external investment managers.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) supports responsible investment. For example, the HKMA has adopted the Principles of Responsible Ownership published by the Securities and Futures Affairs Commission. These principles aim to assist investors in determining the best ways to fulfill their ownership responsibilities when investing in Hong Kong-listed companies. In terms of the management of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA has established internal guidelines on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors applicable to the selection, appointment, and monitoring processes of external fund managers. External fund managers appointed to actively manage Hong Kong equity portfolios must adhere to the Principles of Responsible Ownership when managing such investments. Overall, the HKMA has integrated environmental, social, and governance factors into its internal procedures for investment and related monitoring activities. The HKMA closely monitors the development of ESG-related standards and evaluates how these standards can be further incorporated into investment processes. In addition, to promote international cooperation on responsible investment, the HKMA has become a member of FCLTGlobal, a non-profit organization aimed at promoting business and investment decisions based on long-term goals.\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\n# The financial markets in 2018\n\nIn 2018, several risk factors previously underestimated by the market became apparent, including the pace of U.S. interest rate normalization, the effects of U.S. government trade policies and protectionism on global trade, and geopolitical risks, leading to significant volatility in global financial markets.\n\nThe escalating US-China trade dispute has caused significant concern among investors, leading to repeated declines in emerging markets and Hong Kong's stock markets since the end of January. The Hang Seng Index has fallen as much as 27% from its peak in that month. Starting in the fourth quarter, major European and American stock markets also experienced sharp declines, recording double-digit percentage drops. Overall, global stock markets generally fell in 2018, with the MSCI Global Index, which covers developed market stocks, declining 10.4%, and the MSCI Emerging Markets Index also falling 16.6%.\n\nIn the bond market, U.S. Treasury yields generally rose in 2018 due to the normalization of U.S. monetary policy. However, the bond market remained volatile throughout the year. For example, the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield increased from approximately 2.5% at the beginning of the year to a 7-year high of 3.2% in November, but fell to 2.7% by year-end amid investor concerns over the U.S.-China trade dispute and a shift toward risk-averse investments.\n\nIn the currency market, the U.S. dollar strengthened this year following interest rate hikes in the United States. The U.S. Dollar Index rose 4.4%, while major currencies such as the euro and the Chinese yuan fell by about 5% against the dollar. Additionally, some emerging market currencies further declined due to domestic political instability and economic uncertainty. For example, the Argentine peso and Turkish lira fell by about 50% and 30% respectively against the dollar. By contrast, demand for safe-haven investments pushed the Japanese yen up 2.7% against the dollar.\n\nTable 1 shows the performance of major currencies, the bond market, and the stock market in 2018.\n\nTable 1: 2018 Market Returns\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded investment income of HKD 10.9 billion in 2018, which included bond investment gains of HKD 5.74 billion, Hong Kong stock investment losses of HKD 20.7 billion, other stock investment losses of HKD 3.87 billion, a foreign exchange valuation adjustment of non-Hong Kong dollar assets of HKD 9 billion, and investment income of HKD 2.19 billion from other investments held by the Exchange Fund’s investment holding subsidiaries. On the other hand, the strategic asset portfolio recorded a valuation adjustment of HKD 5 billion.\n\nAt the end of 2018, the Exchange Fund’s total assets reached HKD 40,549 billion. The total market value of long-term growth portfolio investments was HKD 2,836 billion, of which private equity was HKD 1,911 billion and real estate was HKD 925 billion. The total amount committed but not yet drawn down for investment was HKD 2,024 billion.\n\nThe Exchange Fund (excluding the strategic asset portfolio) achieved an investment return of 0.3% in 2018, with the portfolio return being -2.4% and the supporting portfolio being 2.1%. The long-term growth portfolio has generated an internal rate of return of 12.9% per annum since the commencement of investment in 2009.\n\nFigure 1 lists the annual return rates of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2018. Table 2 shows the Exchange Fund’s investment return rates in 2018 and average investment return rates for different periods. The Exchange Fund’s average return rate over the past 3 years was 3.2%, 2.1% over the past 5 years, 2.8% over the past 10 years, and 4.7% since 1994. Table 3 lists the currency breakdown of the Exchange Fund’s assets as of December 31, 2018.\n"}

2019年1月1日的主要人力資源數據\n\n# 2018年組織架構變動\n\n外匯基金投資辦公室於8月1日成立，取代過往由儲備管理部與風險管理及監察部負責的投資及相關風險管理職能。外匯基金投資辦公室的成立凸顯金管局的投資職能，提升其機構形象，並能更靈活應對市場的變化，以配合持續擴展及多元化的外匯基金投資工作。\n\n表1按部門列出金管局的職位編制及實際職員人數。\n\n表1 2019年1月1日金管局職位編制及實際職員人數\n\n負責監察投資風險的員工為外匯基金投資辦公室組織架構的一部分， 在此則歸納於風險管理及監察部以方便呈示其工作職能。\n\n# 薪酬福利政策及薪酬檢討機制\n\n財政司司長透過外匯基金諮詢委員會聽取其轄下管治委員會的意見，並參考市場薪酬水平及做法，決定金管局員工的薪酬及服務條件。薪酬組合包括現金薪酬及公積金，另設一些基本福利。現金薪酬包括每月固定薪酬（即基本薪酬）及根據員工工作表現每年一次過發放的浮動薪酬。\n\n財政司司長每年檢討金管局員工薪酬時，會透過外匯基金諮詢委員會聽取其轄下管治委員會的建議，並考慮管治委員會對金管局過去一年的表現評估、獨立人力資源顧問公司進行的金融業薪酬調查結果，以及其他相關因素。個別工作表現優秀的員工的薪酬亦可能獲得特別調整，以保持其薪酬競爭力。\n\n金管局按個別員工的工作表現，分配獲批准用作調整年度固定薪酬及浮動薪酬的款項；而適用於負責投資的員工的浮動薪酬制度，則旨在加強其投資表現與薪酬的連繫。助理總裁及以上職級員工的固定薪酬調整及浮動薪酬的發放，是由財政司司長經參考管治委員會的意見後批准，有關員工在會議討論到其薪酬的議案時會避席。主管及以下職級員工的固定薪酬調整及浮動薪酬的發放，則由金管局總裁根據財政司司長授權，並按照獲批准用作支付薪酬的整筆款項來決定。\n\n# 高層人員薪酬\n\n表2列載2018年高層人員的薪酬資料。\n\n1. 除累積年假外，服務不足1年的員工所得的實際薪酬會化作全年計算，以得出有關職級的平均全年薪酬。\n2. 本表所載員工人數包括服務不足1年的員工。金管局高層人員人數包括香港按揭證券有限公司總裁、處置機制辦公室專員及外匯基金投資辦公室首席營運官在內。\n3. 其他福利包括公積金或合約酬金（視情況而定）、醫療及人壽保險，以及年內累積的年假。這些福利會因應個別高層人員的服務條件而有所不同。\n","terms":{"10年期美國國庫券收益率":["10-year US Treasury yields"],"2014\/2015年為基期的數列":["2014\/2015-based series"],"2018年的金融市場":["The financial

and the market through the media, its official website, public education activities and other various channels, enhancing public understanding of the HKMA’s policies and operations. Throughout the year, the HKMA continued to strengthen corporate governance, including supporting staff in enhancing their professional capabilities, exercising strict financial control and strengthening information technology security, in order to meet the challenges brought about by the implementation of new measures and the increasing workload.\n\n# Stay in touch with the public\n\n# Media Relations and Social Media\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) maintains close communication with the media to enhance its transparency and improve public understanding of its policies and operations. In 2018, the HKMA held a total of 96 public media events, including 21 press conferences, 11 on-site interviews, and 64 other public events. In addition, the HKMA arranged 39 media interviews during the year, issued 462 bilingual press releases, and handled a large number of media inquiries daily.\n\nTo enhance public understanding of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) main functions, the HKMA organizes press briefings and workshops for local and overseas media covering a variety of topics, including the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), fintech development, green finance, and infrastructure financing. In addition to enriching the content of its existing YouTube channel and LinkedIn page, the HKMA launched an official Facebook page in July to further utilize social media to strengthen communication with the public.\n\nThe Financial Supervisory Commission Chairman Mr. Chen Der-lin (left) and the Environmental Protection Bureau’s mascot, Big Waster, have joined forces through social media to promote the use of good-as-new banknotes for red envelopes.\n\n# Public Inquiry\n\nThe public inquiry service is an effective channel for enhancing public understanding of the HKMA’s key functions and operations. In 2018, it handled 9,950 inquiries, about half of which related to banking policies and regulations, banking consumer matters, and banknotes and coins – particularly coin collection schemes, banking products and services, banking-related guidelines and announcements, the Faster Payment System, virtual banks, and the 2018 Hong Kong new banknote series.\n\nFigure 1 shows the total number of public inquiries received each year since 2015, and Figure 2 lists the proportion of different types of inquiries in 2018.\n\nFigure 1: Total Number of Public Inquiries\n\nFigure 2: Inquiries Received in 2018, Categorized by Type\n\n# Publication\n\nIn addition to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) Annual Report, the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report and four issues of the Quarterly Report in 2018, and regularly updated the Monthly Statistical Bulletin, providing the latest and thematic data and analysis on Hong Kong's monetary, banking, and economic affairs. Furthermore, the HKMA published 13 inSight articles, explaining various topics related to the HKMA's work.\n\n# HKMA website\n\nThe HKMA’s institutional website (www.hkma.gov.hk) provides over 60,000 pages of information in English and Traditional and Simplified Chinese, facilitating public access to the HKMA’s latest information. The website also contains the “Register of Authorized Institutions and Local Representatives” and the “register of securities staff” maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the “Register of Licensed Stored Value Facility Operators” maintained under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance. The website features dedicated webpages and prominent quick links to remind the public of the HKMA’s new measures, such as the Faster Payment System, as well as important and timely matters, such as guarding against telephone fraud and the locations of cash collection vehicles under the coin collection scheme.\n\nTo promote the implementation of open application programming interfaces (APIs) in the banking sector, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has taken the lead by providing open APIs on its website starting in July, facilitating public access to important HKMA information. The first batch of 50 open API data sets was successfully launched in July, covering areas frequently accessed by the public, such as statistical data on the banking system and the Exchange Fund, as well as press releases and cash-in-transit vehicle schedules. The remaining 80 data sets will be rolled out in phases by mid-2019. To further facilitate public access to the latest news and information about the HKMA on the website, the HKMA is comprehensively revising the website’s design and content to make it more user-friendly. The redesigned website is expected to be launched within 2019.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority leads by example in promoting the development and application of open APIs.\n\n# Public education program\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Information Centre is located on the 55th floor of International Finance Centre 2, introducing the Authority's work to the public and enhancing public understanding of monetary and banking matters. The Information Centre comprises an exhibition hall and a library, and is open to the public for visits six days a week. The exhibition hall introduces the Authority's work and the development of Hong Kong’s monetary and banking sectors; it also provides reading materials and exhibits for research on Hong Kong’s currency, banking, and financial affairs.\n\nThe Currency Exhibition Area at the Information Centre introduces the design, security features, production process, and other interesting facts about Hong Kong banknotes and coins. The exhibition area underwent renovation during the first quarter of 2018, incorporating various interactive elements, such as educational games that make learning fun, allowing visitors to gain knowledge about Hong Kong currency while enjoying the experience. Additionally, the Currency Exhibition Area features an artistic Bauhinia tree composed of 2,018 transparent cubic blocks made from banknotes that are no longer suitable for circulation and have been shredded. This installation complements another mosaic artwork within the exhibition area, created using Hong Kong coins. The newly renovated Currency Exhibition Area reopened on August 16.\n\nThe information centre provides guided tours for visitors. Throughout the year, the information centre received over 59,000 visitors and provided 580 guided tours for schools and other groups (Figure 3). Since its opening in December 2003, the information centre has received a cumulative total of over 705,000 visitors. The library, adjacent to the exhibition hall, houses over 26,000 books, journals and other publications for research on topics such as Hong Kong currency, the banking sector, finance and central banking. The library also maintains the “Register of Approved Institutions and Local Representatives” and the register of securities staff as stipulated in Section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nIntroduce the process of Hong Kong banknote production through an interactive game.\n\nArtistic bougainvillea trees are suspended in mid-air, paired with lighting effects to showcase the beauty of the trees in different seasons.\n\nThe Information Center provides guided tours for schools and other groups.\n\nStudents and teachers from various districts attended the public education seminar.\n\nTo maintain close ties with the community and enhance public understanding of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s (HKMA) work, the HKMA held a total of three public education seminars in 2018, attracting approximately 1,500 secondary school students and teachers. The topics covered included the linked exchange rate system, Hong Kong banknotes, banking system stability, the Deposit Protection Scheme, the Faster Payment System (FPS), stored value facilities, fintech, consumer protection, and employment information in the financial industry. Since their launch in 1998, these educational seminars have engaged nearly 60,000 teachers and students.\n\nFigure 3: Types of Groups Visiting the Information Center in 2018\n\n# Financial Services Authority Employees\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is part of the government structure, but employs staff under non-civil service terms to attract talent with appropriate experience and specialized knowledge. As a public sector organization, the HKMA continuously streamlines workflows, enhances efficiency, and improves cost-effectiveness. The HKMA is committed to maintaining a streamlined and flexible organizational structure and, as much as possible, implements new initiatives and handles increasing workloads by reallocating existing staff.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is an employer committed to providing equal employment opportunities and ensures that employees can work in a discrimination-free environment. The HKMA’s equal opportunities policy applies to recruitment, compensation and benefits, performance assessment, promotions, transfer\/training opportunities, and general conduct.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) employs, trains, and maintains a professional and high-caliber workforce to fulfill its policy objectives and flexibly respond to changing work requirements. The HKMA requires its staff to uphold the highest standards of integrity and ethical conduct, adhering strictly to rigorous personal behavior and ethical guidelines at all times, and acting in the best interests of the HKMA.\n\n# Key Human Resources Data for January 1, 2019\n\n# Organizational Structure Changes in 2018\n\nThe Foreign Exchange Fund Investment Office was established on August 1st, replacing the investment and related risk management functions previously handled by the Reserve Management Division and the Risk Management and Supervision Division. The establishment of the Foreign Exchange Fund Investment Office highlights the monetary authority’s investment functions, enhances its institutional image, and enables it to respond more flexibly to market changes, in order to support the continued expansion and diversification of foreign exchange fund investment work.\n\nTable 1 lists the staffing structure and actual number of employees at the Financial Supervisory Commission by department.\n\nTable 1: Staffing Levels and Actual Number of Employees of the Monetary Authority as of January 1, 2019\n\nThe employees responsible for monitoring investment risks are part of the organizational structure of the foreign exchange fund investment office and are categorized under the risk management and monitoring department to facilitate the presentation of their functions.\n\n# Compensation and Benefits Policy and Compensation Review Mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary seeks the views of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's governing committee through the Exchange Fund Advisory Council, and considers market salary levels and practices to determine the salaries and service conditions of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's staff. The salary package includes cash compensation and a provident fund, along with some basic benefits. Cash compensation consists of a fixed monthly salary (i.e., basic salary) and a performance-based variable salary paid once a year according to the staff's work performance.\n\nThe Financial Secretary reviews the salaries of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) staff annually, and will hear recommendations from its Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, taking into account the governance committee's assessment of the HKMA’s performance over the past year, the results of a compensation survey of the financial industry conducted by an independent human resources consulting firm, and other relevant factors. The salaries of individual employees with outstanding performance may also be adjusted to maintain their compensation competitiveness.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) allocates funds approved for adjusting annual fixed and variable pay based on individual employees' performance. The variable pay system applicable to investment staff is designed to strengthen the link between their investment performance and compensation. For employees at the level of Deputy Governor and above, adjustments to fixed pay and distribution of variable pay are approved by the Financial Secretary after consulting the Governance Committee. Such employees absent themselves from meetings when their pay is discussed. For employees at the level of Director and below, adjustments to fixed pay and distribution of variable pay are determined by the HKMA Governor, who acts under the authority of the Financial Secretary and in accordance with the lump sum approved for salary payments.\n\n# Executive Compensation\n\nTable 2 lists the compensation data of senior management in 2018.\n\n1. In addition to accumulated annual leave, the actual compensation received by employees with less than one year of service is calculated on an annual basis to determine the average annual salary for the respective position.  \n2. The number of staff listed in this table includes employees with less than one year of service. The number of senior officials of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority includes the Chairman of the Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation, the Officer in Charge of the Resolution Mechanism Office, and the Chief Operating Officer of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Fund Investment Office.  \n3. Other benefits include provident fund or contract allowances (if applicable), medical and life insurance, as well as accumulated annual leave during the year. These benefits may vary depending on the service conditions of individual senior officials.\n"}
{"zh":"# 外匯基金\n\n- 審計署署長報告\n- 外匯基金財務報表\n\n# 審計署署長報告\n\n# 獨立審計師報告致財政司司長\n\n# 意見\n\n茲證明我已審計列載於第167至273頁外匯基金及其附屬公司（「集團」）的財務報表，該等財務報表包括外匯基金及集團於2018年12月31日的資產負債表與截至該日止年度的收支帳目、全面收益表、權益變動表和現金流量表，以及財務報表的附註，包括主要會計政策概要。\n\n我認為，該等財務報表已按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》真實而中肯地反映外匯基金及集團於2018年12月31日的財務狀況及截至該日止年度的財務表現和現金流量，並已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》（第66章）第7條下所發出的指示妥為擬備。\n\n# 意見的基礎\n\n我已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示及審計署的審計準則進行審計。我根據該等準則而須承擔的責任，詳載於本報告「審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任」部分。根據該等準則，我獨立於集團，並已按該等準則履行其他道德責任。我相信，我所獲得的審計憑證是充足和適當地為我的審計意見提供基礎。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項是根據我的專業判斷，對截至2018年12月31日止年度財務報表的審計最為重要的事項。我對整體財務報表進行審計及形成意見時處理了這些事項，而我不會對這些事項提供單獨的意見。\n\n# 按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.5、2.6及40.1。\n\n於2018年12月31日，集團按公平值列帳的金融資產共36,935.89億港元，金融負債共11,338.29億港元。\n\n93%的該等金融資產及所有該等金融負債的公平值為相同資產或負債於活躍市場的報價（第1級參數），或是以估值方法估計，而所用的參數是以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第2級參數）。\n\n其餘7%的該等金融資產的公平值，是以估值方法估計，而所用的參數並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第3級參數）。有關金融資產共2,756.31億港元，主要包括非上市投資基金。\n\n鑑於所涉數額龐大及涉及估計，按公平值列帳的金融 資產及金融負債的估值屬關鍵審計事項。\n\n就按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值，審計程序包括：\n\n- 了解不同類別金融資產及金融負債的估值程序，包括相關監控措施；\n- 評價及測試監控措施，包括電腦系統的相關應用程式監控措施；\n- 就金融資產及金融負債的估值、存在、權利與責任及完整性取得函證；\n- 若使用市場報價，根據獨立來源核實價格；\n- 若所用估值方法的參數是以可觀察市場數據為基礎，評價估值方法是否適合及有關假設是否合理，以及根據獨立來源核實參數；及\n- 若所用估值方法的參數並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎，評價估值方法是否適合，以及有關假設與參數是否合理。\n\n# 按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.12、20及21。\n\n集團的投資物業按公平值列帳，於2018年12月31日共值253.21億港元。集團亦於3間聯營公司及20間合營公司擁有權益，該等公司主要業務為持有海外投資物業，有關權益共值443.36億港元。不論是由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有，該等投資物業的公平值均主要根據獨立專業估值師的估值釐定。該等估值涉及重大判斷及估計，包括所用的估值方法及假設。\n\n就按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值，審計程序包括：\n\n- 獲取及審視由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有的投資物業的估值報告，並核實公平值是根據有關估值報告所列的估值釐定；\n- 評估估值師的獨立性及資歷；及\n- 評價估值方法是否適合，以及有關假設與參數是否合理。\n\n# 其他資料\n\n金融管理專員須對其他資料負責。其他資料包括金融管理局2018年年報內的所有資料，但不包括財務報表及我的審計師報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見並不涵蓋其他資料，我亦不對其他資料發表任何形式的鑒證結論。\n\n就財務報表審計而言，我有責任閱讀其他資料，從而考慮其他資料是否與財務報表或我在審計過程中得悉的情況有重大矛盾，或者似乎存有重大錯誤陳述。基於我已執行的工作，如果我認為其他資料存有重大錯誤陳述，我需要報告該事實。在這方面，我沒有任何報告。\n\n# 金融管理專員及外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會就財務報表而須承擔的責任\n\n金融管理專員須負責按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》及行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示擬備真實而中肯的財務報表，及落實其認為必要的內部控制， 使財務報表不存有因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在擬備財務報表時，金融管理專員須負責評估集團持續經營的能力，以及在適用情況下披露與持續經營有關的事項，並以持續經營作為會計基礎。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會負責監督集團的財務報告過程。\n\n# 審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任\n\n我的目標是就整體財務報表是否不存有任何因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述取得合理保證，並發出包括我意見的審計師報告。合理保證是高水平的保證，但不能確保按審計署審計準則進行的審計定能發現所存有的任何重大錯誤陳述。錯誤陳述可以由欺詐或錯誤引起，如果合理預期它們個別或滙總起來可能影響財務報表使用者所作出的經濟決定，則會被視作重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在根據審計署審計準則進行審計的過程中，我會運用專業判斷並秉持專業懷疑態度。我亦會：\n\n- 識別和評估因欺詐或錯誤而導致財務報表存有重大錯誤陳述的風險；設計及執行審計程序以應對這些風險；以及取得充足和適當的審計憑證，作為我意見的基礎。由於欺詐可能涉及串謀、偽造、蓄意遺漏、虛假陳述，或凌駕內部控制的情況，因此未能發現因欺詐而導致重大錯誤陳述的風險，較未能發現因錯誤而導致者為高；\n- 了解與審計相關的內部控制，以設計適當的審計程序。然而，此舉並非旨在對集團內部控制的有效性發表意見；\n- 評價金融管理專員所採用的會計政策是否恰當，以及其作出的會計估計和相關資料披露是否合理；\n- 判定金融管理專員以持續經營作為會計基礎的做法是否恰當，並根據所得的審計憑證，判定是否存在與事件或情況有關，而且可能對集團持續經營的能力構成重大疑慮的重大不確定性。如果我認為存在重大不確定性，則有必要在審計師報告中請使用者留意財務報表中的相關資料披露。假若所披露的相關資料不足，我便須發出非無保留意見的審計師報告。我的結論是基於截至審計師報告日止所取得的審計憑證。然而，未來事件或情況可能導致集團不能繼續持續經營；\n- 評價財務報表的整體列報方式、結構和內容，包括披露資料，以及財務報表是否中肯反映交易和事項；及\n- 就集團中實體或業務活動的財務資料獲取充足和適當的審計憑證，以對財務報表發表意見。我負責指導、監督和執行集團審計。我對我的審計意見承擔全部責任。\n\n我會與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通計劃的審計範圍和時間以及重大審計發現等事項，包括我在審計期間識別出內部控制的任何重大缺陷。\n\n我亦會向外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會提交聲明，說明我已符合有關獨立性的相關道德要求，並與他們溝通所有被合理認為可能會影響我獨立性的關係和其他事項，以及在適用的情況下，相關的防範措施。\n\n從與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通的事項中，我會決定哪些事項對本期財務報表的審計最為重要，因而構成關鍵審計事項。我會在審計師報告中描述這些事項，除非法律法規不允許對某件事項作出公開披露，或在極端罕見的情況下，因為有合理預期在我報告中溝通某事項而造成的負面後果將會超過其產生的公眾利益而我決定不應在報告中溝通該事項。\n\n審計署署長\n朱乃璋\n\n2019

Auditor-General's Report\n\n# Independent Auditor's Report to the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nThis certificate confirms that I have audited the financial statements of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and its subsidiaries (\"the Group\") listed from pages 167 to 273, which include the balance sheet of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Group as at December 31, 2018, the income statement, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity, cash flow statement, and the notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nI believe that the financial statements have truly and fairly reflected, in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Accountants, the financial position of the Exchange Fund and the Group as at 31 December 2018, and their results and cash flows for the year ended on that date, and have been properly prepared in accordance with the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# The basis of opinion.\n\nI have conducted the audit in accordance with the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the audit standards of the Audit Office. The responsibilities I have undertaken in accordance with these standards are set out in the section \"Responsibilities of the Auditor in Auditing Financial Statements\" of this report. In accordance with these standards, I have remained independent of the group and fulfilled other ethical responsibilities as required by these standards. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were most important to the audit of the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018. I addressed these matters in auditing the financial statements as a whole and forming my opinion, but I do not express a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Valuation of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Measured at Fair Value\n\nPlease refer to the notes to the financial statements 2.5, 2.6 and 40.1.\n\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Group had financial assets measured at fair value totaling 3,693.59 billion Hong Kong dollars and financial liabilities totaling 1,133.83 billion Hong Kong dollars.\n\nThe fair value of 93% of these financial assets and all of these financial liabilities is based on quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets (Level 1 inputs), or estimated using valuation methods where the parameters used are based on observable market data (Level 2 inputs).\n\nThe fair value of the remaining 7% of these financial assets is estimated using valuation methods, and the parameters used are not based on observable market data (Level 3 inputs). These financial assets amount to 2,756.31 billion Hong Kong dollars and mainly consist of non-listed investment funds.\n\nGiven the large amounts involved and the reliance on estimates, the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value is a key audit matter.\n\nThe audit procedures for the valuation of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value include:\n\nUnderstand the valuation procedures for different categories of financial assets and financial liabilities, including related monitoring measures.\nEvaluate and test monitoring measures, including application-level monitoring measures for computer systems.\nObtain confirmation regarding the valuation, existence, rights and obligations, and completeness of financial assets and liabilities.\nIf market quotations are used, verify prices through independent verification.\nIf the parameters used in the valuation method are based on observable market data, evaluate whether the valuation method is appropriate and whether the related assumptions are reasonable, and verify the parameters through independent verification.\nIf the parameters used in the valuation method are not based on observable market data, evaluate whether the valuation method is appropriate and assess whether the related assumptions and parameters are reasonable.\n\n# Valuation of Investment Properties Measured at Fair Value\n\nPlease refer to Notes 2.12, 20, and 21 of the financial statements.\n\nThe Group's investment properties are accounted for at fair value, totaling HK$25.321 billion as of December 31, 2018. The Group also holds interests in 3 joint ventures and 20 associate companies, which mainly engage in holding overseas investment properties. The aggregate value of these interests amounts to HK$44.336 billion. The fair values of these investment properties, whether directly held by the Group or by joint ventures or associate companies, are primarily determined by independent professional valuers. These valuations involve significant judgments and estimates, including the valuation methods and assumptions used.\n\nRegarding the valuation of investment property accounted for at fair value, audit procedures include:\n\n- Obtain and review valuation reports of investment properties held directly by the Group or by joint ventures or co-operative enterprises, and verify that fair value is determined based on the valuations listed in the relevant valuation reports;  \n- Assess the independence and qualifications of the valuers; and  \n- Evaluate whether the valuation methods are appropriate, and whether the related assumptions and parameters are reasonable.\n\n# Other materials\n\nThe Financial Management Officer is responsible for other information. This information includes all information in the Financial Services Authority's 2018 Annual Report, excluding the financial statements and my auditor's report.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not extend to other data, and I do not provide any form of attestation conclusion regarding other data.\n\nIn the context of a financial statement audit, I have the responsibility to read other information and consider whether it contains material inconsistencies with the financial statements or with information obtained during the audit, or appears to contain material misstatements. Based on the work I have performed, if I believe that other information contains material misstatements, I need to report this fact. In this regard, I have no such reports.\n\n# Responsibilities of the financial controller and the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with respect to financial statements.\n\nThe Financial Management Officer is responsible for preparing true and fair financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and for implementing internal controls as deemed necessary to ensure that the financial statements do not contain material misstatements resulting from fraud or error, in accordance with the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance.\n\nWhen preparing financial statements, financial management officers are responsible for assessing the group’s ability to continue as a going concern, and for disclosing matters related to going concern where applicable, and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Committee under the Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the group's financial reporting process.\n\n# The responsibility of auditors in the audit of financial statements\n\nMy objective is to obtain reasonable assurance that the overall financial statements do not contain any material misstatements resulting from fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but it does not provide absolute assurance that an audit conducted in accordance with the audit standards of the Audit Office will necessarily detect any material misstatements that may exist. Material misstatements may arise from fraud or error. If it is reasonably expected that they individually or in aggregate could influence the economic decisions made by users of the financial statements, they are considered material misstatements.\n\nDuring the audit process conducted in accordance with the Audit Office's audit standards, I will apply professional judgment and maintain a professional skeptical attitude. I will also:\n\nIdentify and assess the risk that financial statements may contain material misstatements due to fraud or error; design and perform audit procedures to address these risks; and obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence to support my opinion. Since fraud may involve collusion, falsification, intentional omission, false statements, or overriding of internal controls, the risk of not detecting material misstatements due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting those due to error;  \nUnderstand the internal controls relevant to the audit in order to design appropriate audit procedures. However, this is not intended to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the group's internal controls;  \nEvaluate whether the accounting policies adopted by the Financial Management Officer are appropriate, and whether the accounting estimates and related disclosures made are reasonable;  \nDetermine whether the Financial Management Officer's use of the going concern basis of accounting is appropriate, and based on the audit evidence obtained, determine whether there are significant uncertainties related to events or circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the group's ability to continue as a going concern. If I believe that significant uncertainty exists, it is necessary to draw the users' attention to the relevant disclosures in the financial statements in the auditor's report. If the relevant disclosures are insufficient, I must issue an auditor's report with a non-unqualified opinion. My conclusion is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of the auditor's report. However, future events or circumstances may lead to the group's inability to continue as a going concern;  \nEvaluate the overall presentation, structure, and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements fairly present the transactions and events; and  \nObtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of entities or business activities within the group in order to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for directing, supervising, and performing the group audit. I bear full responsibility for my audit opinion.\n\nI will communicate with the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding the scope and timeline of the plan’s audit, as well as significant audit findings, including any material deficiencies in internal control that I identify during the audit.\n\nI will also submit a statement to the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, stating that I have met the relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and that I have communicated to them all relationships and other matters that could reasonably be considered to affect my independence, as well as any relevant safeguards where applicable.\n\nFrom discussions with the Audit Committee under the Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I will determine which matters are most important to the audit of the current financial statements, thus constituting key audit matters. I will describe these matters in the auditor’s report, unless laws and regulations do not permit public disclosure of a matter, or in extremely rare circumstances, because there is a reasonable expectation that the negative consequences of communicating a matter in my report would outweigh the public interest and I decide not to communicate that matter in the report.\n\nDirector of Audit\nZhu Nai-chang\n\nApril 4, 2019\n"}

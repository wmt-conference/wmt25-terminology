{"en":"The year of 2019 has been anything but uneventful.\n\nUS-China trade tensions remained a big wild card. Lingering uncertainties over trade talks between the world’s two largest economies rattled investor confidence and undermined international trade, manufacturing, investment and even consumption. Gone are the days when global economic expansion was a given. The global economy entered a synchronised slowdown during the year. In response to the slower growth, major central banks around the world have reversed course on their monetary policy normalisation.\n\nLocally, social incidents happening in the second half of the year dealt a further blow to the Hong Kong economy. The retail, tourism and catering sectors were among the hardest hit. For 2019 as a whole, the Hong Kong economy contracted by 1.2%, the first annual decline in a decade, while the unemployment rate rose to 3.3% from a multi-year low of 2.8% at the beginning of the year. As 2020 dawned, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak posed yet another significant threat to both global and local economies.\n\nIn the face of such an uncertain and challenging environment, it is of paramount importance to maintain monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong, as I made clear when taking over as Chief Executive of the HKMA on 1 October 2019.\n\n# Monetary and financial stability: the bedrock of an international financial centre\n\nThe Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) in place since 1983 has helped Hong Kong weather numerous challenges and shocks, demonstrating its important role as an anchor of Hong Kong’s economic prosperity and status as an international financial centre. Notwithstanding the challenging external and domestic environment during the year, the LERS continued to operate in a smooth and orderly manner, once again proving its resilience in times of uncertainty. Hong Kong’s banking system also remained sound and robust. The facts speak for themselves: the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained stable and has strengthened to the strong side of the Convertibility Zone in recent months, while bank deposits continued to grow during the year. In a nutshell, no noticeable outflow of funds from the Hong Kong dollar or the banking system was observed.\n\nThe stability of Hong Kong’s monetary and banking systems reflects not only the robustness of, but also strong confidence in, our systems. This did not happen overnight, but through years of efforts to build up buffers and strengthen surveillance, complemented by our swift response to rumours on social media platforms.\n\nOur preparations over the years for rainy days have built a solid foundation and strong buffers for Hong Kong’s monetary and banking systems. In addition to the vast foreign exchange reserves in our public coffers, our banking system has strong capital buffers, robust liquidity and very good asset quality, whether by international or historical standards. The eight rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures on property mortgages implemented since 2009 have also greatly enhanced banks’ resilience against a property market downturn.\n\nMarket surveillance and banking supervision make up the core part of our work in maintaining monetary and banking stability, and we have been strengthening our surveillance and supervisory framework from time to time. Apart from close monitoring of the credit and liquidity risks of banks, one of our new endeavours in the year was to make use of technology and granular data collected from banks to enhance our capability to monitor Hong Kong dollar funding and financial market activities in a more in-depth and timely manner. Stress tests and contingency planning have also been augmented in the light of the fast evolving economic and operating environment.\n\nIndeed, our robust regulatory regime has won strong endorsements internationally. During the year, the International Monetary Fund reaffirmed that Hong Kong was well placed to address both cyclical and structural changes, given its significant buffers. Hong Kong’s effective legal and institutional framework for combatting money laundering and terrorist financing also obtained a positive assessment from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), making Hong Kong the first in the Asia-pacific region to achieve an overall compliant result in the FATF’s Mutual Evaluation.\n\nConfidence is the foundation for the proper functioning of markets and is crucial to the safeguarding of monetary and financial stability. To maintain market confidence, we have to be on high alert for, and respond swiftly to, any malicious rumours that may potentially cast doubt on Hong Kong’s monetary or banking systems. This is particularly important given the prevalent use of social media and instant messaging nowadays. While a variety of rumours were spread on social media platforms by fearmongers during the outbreak of social unrest, our quick and clear rebuttals to these rumours through social media, in addition to traditional media, proved useful and effective in clearing the air, quelling false rumours from spreading further, and upholding international and public confidence in our systems.\n\n# Banking system: an important pillar of economic activity\n\nThe banking sector, as an essential pillar of economic activity, plays a fundamental role in ensuring the smooth running of society and the economy. Despite the challenging operating environment since the latter half of the year, banks have been working hard alongside others and doing their utmost to maintain normal operation of their core functions and continue serving businesses and the public.\n\nIn addition to basic banking services like deposits and transfers, an important function of banks is in extending credit to borrowers in support of the real economy. We are well aware of, and concerned about, the cash-flow problem facing businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), under the difficult economic conditions. While safeguarding banking stability, we have launched a number of initiatives to ensure continued funding support to SMEs. In particular, the Countercyclical Capital Buffer ratio of banks was reduced on two occasions, in October 2019 and March 2020, by a total of 150 basis points to 1.0%; the level of regulatory reserve requirement on banks was also reduced by half in April 2020. These measures release a total of around HK$1 trillion in lending capacity, providing banks with more room for lending to enterprises including SMEs. We have also set up a platform – the Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism – bringing together major banks in Hong Kong to explore and discuss specific measures to strengthen funding support for SMEs. I am pleased to see that many banks have responded proactively to our call and introduced relief measures such as principal moratorium for customers in need to ride out the storm.\n\nIn view of some SMEs’ feedback about difficulties in opening bank accounts, which is the very first step in accessing various banking services, we have made dedicated efforts to address this issue over the past few years. Our work is bearing fruit, as improvement in account opening for businesses is visible. As a further step to promote financial inclusion, the HKMA spearheaded the launch of tiered account services – Simple Bank Accounts (SBAs) with a streamlined customer due diligence process – to provide start-ups and SMEs with an alternative to traditional bank accounts. More than 2,800 SBAs have been opened so far.\n\n# International financial centre: from strength to strength\n\nWe have always been mindful of the need to strike a reasonable balance between regulation and development. Given the intense competition among financial centres, we have to work hard to strengthen Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre and thereby ensure its longer term stability. There are four key areas of work: technology, green finance, financial connectivity with the Mainland, and talent development.\n\n# Embracing technology in the digital era\n\nHong Kong has been moving fast in promoting financial technology (fintech) since the establishment of the HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office in 2016 and the introduction of the Smart Banking initiatives in 2017.\n\nOn the payment front, the vibrancy of the fintech ecosystem is evident in the strong momentum in the adoption of the Faster Payment System (FPS), the world’s first multi-currency, cross-banks and e-wallets, real-time retail payment platform. FPS registrations reached four million within a short span of 15 months, representing a high rate of penetration in a population of 7.5 million people. The Government has also adopted the FPS to provide the public with greater convenience in paying taxes, rates and water charges. More and more businesses are expected to use this fast, safe and convenient means of receiving and making payment to enhance operational efficiency.\n\nIn the banking sector, significant progress was seen in applying fintech to their banking services and business operations. According to a study conducted by the HKMA, almost 90% of the surveyed retail banks have adopted, or are planning to adopt, artificial intelligence in their business applications. With the HKMA’s facilitation, banks have been applying big data and consumer behavioural analytics in their personal credit products. They have also launched over 800 Open Application programming Interfaces in the first two phases, covering a range of banking products and services. While encouraging banks to use fintech, we did not lose sight of the need for enhanced technology risk management and consumer protection in digital banking services. Timely supervisory guidance has been provided to banks in these areas.\n\nRegulatory technology (Regtech) is another area of great interest to banks, for its potential of enabling banks to conduct regulatory compliance and risk management, particularly in anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT), more efficiently and cost-effectively. To facilitate greater industry adoption of Regtech and the building of a wider Regtech ecosystem, the HKMA organised the inaugural AML\/CFT Regtech Forum and issued its first Regtech newsletter in November to discuss possible use cases of Regtech. At the same time, the HKMA, as a banking supervisor, is exploring the use of supervisory technology (Suptech), including new data science and analytics, to enhance work effectiveness and efficiency. We have embarked on a series of studies and developed a road map for the implementation of Suptech in the next few years.\n\nFrom a broader perspective, this is only the start of the fintech journey in the banking sector. The HKMA granted eight licences to virtual banks during the year. One of the virtual banks officially launched its services in March 2020, while some other virtual banks have commenced pilot trials through the HKMA’s Fintech Supervisory Sandbox. I look forward to the launch of the other virtual banks and the introduction of more innovative and diversified banking services to the people of Hong Kong that would help raise the global competitiveness of our banking sector.\n\nMore exciting developments are also expected at the international level. After successfully completing a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) trial to connect our blockchain-based trade finance platform, eTradeConnect, with its European counterpart, we are conducting another PoC trial with the platform of the people’s Bank of China, paving the way for the digitalisation of cross-border trades. We have begun a joint research project with the Bank of Thailand to study the application of Central Bank Digital Currency to cross-border payments. The Bank for International Settlements also put its first Innovation Hub Centre into operation in Hong Kong in November to foster fintech collaboration within the central banking community. All these developments present clear evidence of Hong Kong’s leading global position in fintech development.\n\n# Promoting green and sustainable finance for a better future\n\nClimate-related risks have drawn increasing global attention in recent years. To contribute to the global efforts in addressing this challenge, the HKMA unveiled three key measures in May to promote green finance development in Hong Kong in different capacities.\n\nAs a banking supervisor, the HKMA is undertaking a three-phased approach to promoting green and sustainable banking. A framework for assessing the “greenness” of banks has been developed for industry consultation under phase I, paving the way for the formulation of supervisory expectations and requirements for the banking industry under phase II and implementation under phase III.\n\nAs the manager of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA actively advances responsible investment by integrating environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into its investment activities. Specifically, we have adopted the principle of giving priority to green and ESG investments if their long-term return is comparable to other investments on a risk-adjusted basis. After venturing into the green bond market in 2015 as one of the early investors, we will continue to grow our green bond portfolio and invest in other ESG assets. We will also join hands with like-minded investors and regulators to promote best practices on ESG through our participation in international organisations in the ESG community.\n","terms":{"\"Capital

貨幣及金融穩定：國際金融中心的基石。\n\n自一九八三年實施的聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）有助香港度過無數挑戰和衝擊，彰顯了其作為香港經濟繁榮和國際金融中心地位的基石作用。儘管在該年期間，外部和內部的環境充滿挑戰，聯匯制度依然平穩有序地運作，再次證明了其在不確定時期的韌性。香港的銀行體系同樣保持穩健和強大。事實勝於雄辯：港幣匯率保持穩定，並在近幾個月走強至聯繫匯率制度的保值範圍強方一側，而銀行存款在該年持續增長。總而言之，未觀察到任何明顯的資金流出港幣或銀行體系。\n\n香港的貨幣和銀行體系的穩定性，不僅反映出我們體系的穩健，也反映出外界對我們體系的強烈信心。這並非一朝一夕的事，而是經過多年的努力，建立緩衝機制、加強監測，並配合我們對社交媒體平台上謠言的迅速反應，才得以實現的。\n\n多年來我們為應對不測之需所做的準備，已為香港的貨幣和銀行體系奠定了堅實的基礎和強大的緩衝能力。除了公帑中龐大的外匯儲備，我們的銀行體系亦擁有強健的資本緩衝、充足的流動性及非常優良的資產質素，無論以國際或歷史標準衡量均屬優秀。自2009年起實施的八輪針對物業按揭的逆周期宏觀審慎措施，亦大大增強了銀行對物業市場下行風險的應對能力。\n\n市場監察和銀行監管是維持貨幣及銀行體系穩定工作的核心部分，我們持續加強監察及監管架構。除了密切監測銀行的信用及流動性風險外，今年我們的新重點是善用從銀行收集的科技及細粒度數據，以更深入及及時的方式提升監測港元資金流向和金融市場活動的能力。與此同時，我們亦已根據經濟和營運環境的快速演變，加強壓力測試和應變規劃。\n\n事實上，我們穩健的監管制度已獲得國際社會的高度認可。年內，國際貨幣基金組織重申香港具備充足緩衝，能夠有效應對週期性和結構性變化。香港在打擊洗錢和恐怖融資方面的有效法律和制度框架亦獲得財務行動特別組織（FATF）的正面評估，使香港成為亞太地區首個在財務行動特別組織的相互評估中取得整體合規結果的地區。\n\n信心是市場正常運作的基礎，對維護貨幣和金融穩定至關重要。為維持市場信心，我們必須對任何可能對香港貨幣或銀行體系構成疑慮的惡意謠言保持高度警惕，並迅速作出回應。尤其在社交媒體和即時通訊工具普及的今天，此點更為重要。在社會動盪期間，製造恐慌的人曾在社交媒體平台上散播各種謠言，但我們透過社交媒體及傳統媒體迅速且清晰地澄清這些謠言，證明能有效澄清事實、阻止虛假信息進一步傳播，並維護國際社會和公眾對我等體系的信心。\n\n# 銀行體系：經濟活動的重要支柱\n\n銀行體系作為經濟活動的重要支柱，在確保社會與經濟順利運作方面發揮著根本性的作用。儘管自今年下半年以來營運環境充滿挑戰，銀行業仍與各方攜手努力，竭盡所能維持核心功能的正常運作，並持續為企業和公眾提供服務。\n\n除了存款及轉帳等基本銀行服務外，銀行的重要功能在於向借款人提供信貸，以支持實體經濟。我們清楚認識並關注目前經濟環境艱難下，企業特別是中小企所面臨的現金流問題。在確保銀行體系穩定的同時，我們已推出多項措施，以保障中小企持續獲得資金支持。特別是銀行的逆周期緩衝資本比率，分別於2019年10月及2020年3月兩度調低，總共減幅150個基點至1.0%；銀行的監管儲備水平亦於2020年4月減半。這些措施釋放約港元1萬億的借貸空間，為銀行提供更多空間向企業包括中小企提供貸款。我們亦設立了一個平台——銀行業中小企貸款協調機制，集合香港主要銀行，探討具體措施以加強對中小企的資金支持。我很高興看到許多銀行積極響應我們的呼籲，為有需要的客戶推出紓緩措施，例如提供本金寬限期，協助客戶渡過難關。\n\n鑑於部分中小企業反映開設銀行帳戶存在困難，而開設銀行帳戶是獲取各項銀行服務的首要步驟，過去幾年我們已致力解決此問題。 我們的努力正在開花結果，企業開設帳戶的情況有所改善。 作為進一步促進普及金融的措施，金管局率先推出分層帳戶服務，即簡易帳戶，並採用簡化的客戶盡職審查程序，為初創企業和中小企業提供替代傳統銀行帳戶的方案。 至今已開設超過 2,800 個簡易帳戶。\n\n#國際金融中心：愈發強大\n\n我們始終深知在監管與發展之間取得合理平衡至關重要。鑒於金融中心之間的激烈競爭，我們必須努力加強香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力，從而確保其長期穩定。目前有四個重點工作領域：科技、綠色金融、與內地互聯互通，以及人才發展。\n\n# 擁抱科技於數位時代\n\n香港自二零一六年成立金融科技促進辦公室及二零一七年推出智慧銀行計劃以來，一直在積極推動金融科技發展。\n\n在支付方面，金融科技生態系統的蓬勃發展體現在快速支付系統「轉數快」的強勁發展動能上，該系統是全球首個支持多種貨幣、跨銀行及電子錢包的即時零售支付平台。在短短15個月內，「轉數快」的註冊用戶數已達四百萬，於七百五十萬人口中顯示出很高的滲透率。政府亦採用「轉數快」，為公眾提供繳納稅款、差餉及水費的更大便利。預計將有越來越多企業採用這種快速、安全及便捷的收付款方式，以提升營運效率。\n\n在銀行體系中，應用金融科技於銀行服務及業務運作方面已取得顯著進展。根據金管局進行的一項研究，近九成受訪零售銀行已採用或正計劃在業務應用中引入人工智能。在金管局的推動下，銀行已將大數據及消費者行為分析應用於個人信貸產品。銀行亦已在首兩階段推出了逾800項開放應用程式介面，涵蓋多種銀行產品及服務。在鼓勵銀行應用金融科技的同時，我們亦未忽略在數碼銀行服務中加強科技風險管理及消費者保護的必要性。有關方面已及時向銀行提供監管指導。\n\n合規科技（Regtech）是銀行界備受關注的領域之一，因其能使銀行更有效率且更具成本效益地進行監管合規及風險管理，尤其是在打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度（AML\/CFT）方面。為促進業界採用合規科技，並建構更完善的合規科技生態圈，金管局於十一月舉辦了首屆AML\/CFT合規科技論壇，並發行了首期合規科技通訊，以探討合規科技的潛在應用案例。與此同時，作為銀行業監管機構，金管局亦積極探索監管科技（Suptech）的應用，包括新興的數據科學與分析技術，以提升工作成效與效率。我們已啟動一系列研究，並制定了未來幾年實施監管科技的路線圖。\n\n從更廣闊的視角來看，這僅是銀行體系金融科技發展的起點。 金管局在今年授出八張虛擬銀行牌照。 其中一家虛擬銀行於二零二零年三月正式推出服務，而其他一些虛擬銀行已透過金管局的金融科技監管沙盒展開試行。 我期待其他虛擬銀行的推出，以及更多創新和多元化的銀行服務引入香港，以有助提升我等銀行體系的全球競爭力。\n\n更多令人振奮的發展也預期將在國際層面出現。在成功完成概念驗證（試驗），將我們的基於區塊鏈的貿易融資平台貿易聯動與其歐洲對應平台連接後，我們正在與中國人民銀行的平台進行另一次試驗，為跨境貿易的數位化鋪平道路。我們已與泰國中央銀行啟動一項聯合研究項目，以研究央行數碼貨幣在跨境支付中的應用。國際結算銀行也於十一月在香港設立了第一個創新樞紐中心，以促進中央銀行社群內的金融科技合作。所有這些發展都清楚地證明了香港在金融科技發展領域的領先全球地位。\n\n#推動綠色永續金融，共創美好未來\n\n近年來，與氣候相關的風險已引起越來越多的全球關注。為響應全球努力應對這項挑戰，金管局於五月份公布了三項重點措施，以不同方式推動香港發展綠色金融。\n\n作為銀行業監管機構，金管局正採取三階段方法推動綠色及可持續銀行業務。在第一階段，已制定一套用以評估銀行「綠色程度」的框架，並向業界諮詢，為第二階段擬訂銀行業界的監管期望及要求，以及第三階段的落實執行奠定基礎。\n\n作為外匯基金的經理，金管局積極推動負責任投資，將環境、社會及管治(ESG)因素融入其投資活動。具體而言，我們已採納以經風險調整的基礎，在長期回報與其他投資相若的情況下，優先考慮綠色及ESG投資的原則。自2015年作為早期投資者之一進入綠色債券市場以來，我們將繼續擴大我們的綠色債券組合，並投資其他ESG資產。我們亦會與志同道合的投資者和監管機構攜手合作，透過參與國際組織於環境、社會及管治社群中，推廣最佳實務。\n"}
{"en":"# Highlights of 2019\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nThe Hong Kong economy softens in 2019 amid global economic slowdown, lingering US-China trade tensions and local social incidents, while the labour market faces increasing pressures.\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector remains sound and resilient, with strong capital positions, robust liquidity and healthy asset quality.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nDespite the challenging external and internal environment, Hong Kong’s monetary system is firmly intact, as evidenced by the stable Hong Kong dollar exchange rate and the smooth functioning of the foreign exchange and money markets. This reflects not only the robustness of but also strong confidence in Hong Kong’s monetary system. \n\nA new Resolution Facility is introduced and a number of refinements are made within the HKMA’s updated Liquidity Facilities Framework.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA puts great effort in monitoring the credit and liquidity risk management of banks to maintain banking stability. Good progress is also made on promoting smart banking, including the granting of eight virtual bank licences and encouraging the adoption of regulatory technology. These efforts are complemented by strengthened supervision of banks’ technology risk management and enhanced consumer protection in digital financial services.\n\nThe HKMA streamlines investor protection measures to enhance customer experience while taking further steps to promote a customer-centric bank culture.\n\nHong Kong’s anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism regime earns positive assessment from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), making it the first FATF-member jurisdiction in the Asia-pacific region to achieve an overall compliant result in FATF’s fourth-round Mutual Evaluation.\n\nNew rules and regulations are rolled out to enhance the banking regulatory regime in line with the latest international standards. A three-phased approach is announced to promote green and sustainable banking in Hong Kong, contributing to global efforts in addressing climate change.\n\nAt the same time, the HKMA makes significant progress in operationalising the resolution regime for banks, in particular driving the build-up of a new layer of loss-absorbing capacity at domestic systemically important banks to promote financial stability.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\nThe fintech ecosystem in Hong Kong is gaining strong momentum, with good progress in the implementation of the Open Application programming Interface Framework in the banking sector, establishment of the world’s first Bank for International Settlements Innovation Hub Centre, and continued increase in the use of the Faster payment System for e-payments.\n\nHong Kong maintains a firm foothold as the global hub for offshore renminbi business. In the context of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area development, financial connectivity with the Mainland is being enhanced, and access to financial services by Hong Kong residents is made more convenient.\n\nMuch effort is made to open up new opportunities to further enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, particularly in infrastructure investment and financing, green finance and private equity funds.\n\nThe Hong Kong Academy of Finance is set up to serve as a centre of excellence for developing financial leadership and a repository of knowledge in monetary and financial research, including applied research.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\nBenefiting from a favourable investment environment, the Exchange Fund achieves the second highest investment income on record, of HK$262.2 billion, representing an investment return of 6.6%.\n\nThe HKMA deepens its effort in investment diversification, especially into the LongTerm Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The LTGP records an annualised internal rate of return of 12.6% since its inception in 2009. There is also encouraging progress in advancing responsible investment.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communication with the community and the market through traditional and social media, website, Information Centre and various other channels to facilitate public understanding of its policies and operations.\n\nWithin the institution, the HKMA attaches great importance to upholding corporate governance by supporting professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline and enhancing IT security to cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives and the increasing complexity of work.\n","terms":{"\"Capital preservation First, Long-Term Growth Next\"":["保本先行、長期增值"],"10 Years plus Caring Organisation

面臨日益增加的壓力。\n\n香港銀行業仍然穩健且具韌性，擁有強勁的資本狀況、充裕的流動性以及健康的資產質素。\n\n# 貨幣穩定\n\n儘管面對嚴峻的外部和內部環境，香港的貨幣體系依然運作良好，可見於港元匯率穩定以及外匯和資金市場運作暢順。這不僅反映了香港貨幣體系的穩健，也體現了社會對香港貨幣體系的高度信心。\n\n金管局更新了流動資金安排架構，並引入了一項新的處置資金安排，同時作出多項優化。\n\n# 銀行體系穩定\n\n金管局致力監測銀行的信貸及流動性風險管理，以維持銀行體系穩定。在推動智慧銀行方面也取得良好進展，包括頒發八項虛擬銀行牌照，並鼓勵採用合規科技。這些努力亦配合加強對銀行科技風險管理的監督，以及提升數碼金融服務的消費者保障。\n\n金管局簡化投資者保障措施以提升客戶體驗，同時進一步推動以客為本的銀行文化。\n\n香港的打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度（AML\/CFT）獲得財務行動特別組織（FATF）正面評價，使其成為亞太地區首個在FATF第四輪相互評估中展現整體合規表現的特別組織成員地區。\n\n新規則和條例已推出，以配合最新國際標準，加強銀行體系監管制度。香港宣布採取三階段的方法，推動綠色及可持續銀行業，並有助全球努力應對氣候變化。\n\n同時，金管局在落實銀行處置機制方面取得了顯著進展，特別是推動具本地系統重要性銀行（D-SIB）建立新的吸收虧損能力，以促進金融穩定。\n\n# 國際金融中心\n\n香港的金融科技生態系統正在蓬勃發展，在銀行體系中實施開放應用程式介面框架方面取得了良好進展，並已成立全球首個國際結算銀行創新樞紐中心，以及持續增加使用快速支付系統「轉數快」進行電子支付的情況。\n\n香港穩居全球離岸人民幣業務的樞紐地位。在粵港澳大灣區發展的背景下，與內地互聯互通不斷加強，香港居民使用金融服務也變得更加便捷。\n\n致力於開拓新機會，進一步提升香港金融平台的競爭力，特別是在基建投資融資、綠色金融及私募股權基金方面。\n\n金融學院的設立旨在成為培養金融業領袖人才的匯聚點，並作為貨幣與金融研究（包括應用研究）知識儲備中心。\n\n# 儲備管理\n\n受惠於良好的投資環境，外匯基金錄得歷史次高的投資收入，達港元2622億元，投資回報率為6.6%。\n\n金管局 (HKMA) 繼續加強投資多元化工作，尤其著重於長期增長組合 (LTGp)。自 2009 年起至今，長期增長組合 (LTGp) 的內部回報率年率為 12.6%。在推動負責任投資方面也取得了令人鼓舞的進展。\n\n# 機構職能\n\n金管局透過傳統及社交媒體、網站、資訊中心及其他渠道，與社會大眾及市場保持有效溝通，以促進公眾對其政策及運作的理解。\n\n在機構內，金管局非常重視維持公司治理，透過支持員工的專業發展、實施嚴謹的財政及加強資訊科技保安，以應對因推行新措施及工作日益複雜而產生的挑戰。\n"}

{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nThe Hong Kong economy contracted in 2019, reflecting global economic slowdown, lingering US-China trade conflicts and local social incidents. As economic conditions deteriorated rapidly in the second half of the year, the labour market faced increasing pressures. Inflation also increased due to a sharp rise in pork prices. Economic performance for 2020 is expected to remain challenging as the novel coronavirus outbreak hits the already weakening economy. Given the difficult economic environment, the Government and the HKMA have rolled out measures to support the economy, especially households and small and medium-sized enterprises.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Real activities\n\nFollowing a 2.9% expansion in 2018, the Hong Kong economy contracted by 1.2% in 2019, marking the first annual contraction since 2009. In particular, the economy entered into a recession in the second half of the year, with the seasonally adjusted real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) shrinking consecutively in the second, third and fourth quarters (Table 1). The decline in economic activities reflected a notable reduction in domestic demand (Chart 1). As the local social incidents weighed significantly on consumption activities and sentiments in the latter part of the year, private consumption expenditure recorded the first annual decline since 2003. Overall investment spending also dropped amid dampened business sentiments. On the external front, slowing global economic growth and additional tariffs levied amid the US-China trade tensions led to a decline in Hong Kong’s exports of goods. Exports of services also saw the largest annual decline on record because the social incidents led to a severe deterioration in inbound tourism. With smaller domestic and re-export-induced demand, imports of goods and services also worsened. On a net basis, net trade contributed positively to GDP in 2019 (Chart 1) because total imports declined even faster than total exports.\n\nIn view of the strong economic headwinds, the Government introduced several rounds of measures between August and December 2019 to alleviate the financial burden of residents, safeguard jobs and support enterprises, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as well as those in the hard-hit sectors, such as retail, food services, transport and tourism. To allow banks to be more supportive to the domestic economy and help mitigate the economic cycle, the HKMA announced on 14 October a reduction in the Countercyclical Capital Buffer ratio of banks from 2.5% to 2.0%, thereby providing banks with more flexibility to release HK$200–300 billion in bank credit to enterprises including SMEs, and also established a Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism. A new relief measure for the 80% Guarantee product of the SME Financing Guarantee Scheme (SFGS) was introduced in September, allowing SME borrowers facing weakening cash flows to apply for principal moratorium to get immediate support. Further, a new 90% loan guarantee product under the SFGS was introduced in December to provide additional support to SMEs, businesses with relatively less operating experience, as well as professionals seeking to set up their own practices, to obtain financing.\n\n# Monetary conditions\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate and money markets functioned in a smooth and orderly manner in 2019. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained broadly stable throughout the year. As the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking was triggered in March, the HKMA purchased Hong Kong dollars from, and sold US dollars to, banks at the rate of HK$7.85\/US$1, leading to a decline in the Aggregate Balance in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System. The Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained largely steady at the longer end, while short-term rates generally picked up. At the retail level, several retail banks lowered their Best Lending Rates by 12.5 basis points in late October following the decreases in the target range for the US federal funds rate. As for monetary aggregates, total bank loans increased by 6.7% in 2019, up from 4.4% in 2018, and total deposits grew by 2.9% during the year.\n\n# Inflation\n\nThe underlying inflation rate, which nets out the effects of the Government’s one-off relief measures, rose slightly to 3.0% in 2019, from 2.6% in 2018. The mild increase in inflation was mainly driven by the elevated pork prices due to the disrupted supply of fresh pork since May (Chart 2). Excluding basic food items, price pressures were held at moderate levels throughout the year. In particular, the housing component of consumer price inflation softened in tandem with an earlier consolidation of fresh-letting private residential rentals. More broadly, the mild growth in nominal wages and the slower increase in commercial rentals1 helped keep local business costs in check. Externally, import price inflation moderated, in line with lower inflation in some of Hong Kong’s major import sources amid slower global economic growth.\n\n# Labour market\n\nThe labour market remained broadly resilient in the first half of 2019 but faced mounting pressures in the second half (Chart 3). After staying at a multi-year low of 2.8% in the first two quarters, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose to 2.9% in the third quarter and 3.3% in the final quarter, with those for the consumption and tourism-related sectors recording even more visible rises amid the social incidents. Overall labour demand also shrank visibly in the latter part of the year as total employment and the number of privatesector vacancies fell. The reduction in labour demand was particularly prominent in the retail, accommodation and food services sectors, as well as import\/export trade and construction sectors. On the supply side, the labour force participation rate edged down, partly due to a cyclical response to the economic recession. As the labour market came under increasing pressures, growth in nominal wage and earnings showed signs of a slowdown towards the end of the year.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe local stock market experienced sharp fluctuations during 2019. After a market rally in the first four months, the Hang Seng Index plunged in May due in part to concerns about the re-escalation of the US-China trade tensions (Chart 4). While recouping some lost ground in June in response to major central banks’ signals of a more accommodative monetary stance, stock prices came under pressure again amid slowing global economic growth and local social incidents. Towards the end of the year, stock prices regained some upward momentum following the announcement of a “phase one” trade agreement between the US and Mainland China. The Hang Seng Index finished the year at 28,190, registering an overall gain of 9.1% for the year. By contrast, the average daily turnover declined by about 19% from a year earlier. The listings of a major Mainland tech company and a leading beer manufacturer helped expand equity funds raised through initial public offerings (IpOs) to HK$314.2 billion in 2019. Hong Kong ranked first globally in terms of funds raised through IpOs for a second straight year in 2019.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market staged a strong rebound in the first five months of 2019 but generally softened in the remainder of the year. Market sentiment improved in early 2019 partly because concerns over US-China trade tensions temporarily eased, but the sentiment was dampened afterwards by the re-escalated US-China trade tensions, prolonged social incidents and weakened domestic economic conditions. Overall housing prices moderated by 5% from the peak in May through December, though still recording an annual growth of 5% due to a 10% rebound in the first five months (Chart 4). Transaction volume in 2019 increased by 4% to 59,797 units from a year earlier, reflecting the strong trading activities in the early part of the year. Housing affordability remained stretched, with the price-toincome ratio and the income-gearing ratio staying high at 17.9 and 80.9 respectively, far above their long-term averages.2 To assist home buyers with immediate housing needs, the Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation (HKMC) in mid-October raised the cap on the value of completed residential properties eligible for a mortgage loan under the Mortgage Insurance programme.3 On the other hand, the non-residential property market faced stronger downward pressures in 2019. In particular, both prices and rentals for retail premises registered the largest declines since the global financial crisis in 2008, reflecting the worsening business conditions during the year.\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nHong Kong’s economic performance for 2020 is expected to be very challenging, with significant near-term downside risks associated with the coronavirus outbreak. Some sectors, such as retail, accommodation, food services, tourism and transport, which have yet to recover from the disruptions caused by the social incidents, will be doubly hit. However, the countercyclical fiscal measures announced in the 2020\/21 Budget, which include a one-off cash handout and a new concessionary low-interest loan under the SFGS with 100% Government guarantee, are expected to provide some support to the economy, especially households and SMEs. On 16 March 2020, the HKMA further reduced the Countercyclical Capital Buffer ratio of banks from 2.0% to 1.0%, which will allow banks to be more supportive to the domestic economy, in particular those sectors and individuals that are expected to experience additional short-term stress due to the impact arising from the coronavirus outbreak. Analysed by GDP component, private consumption and investment are likely to remain weak because of the fragile consumer and business confidence. While government consumption will contribute to economic growth, public investment expenditure is anticipated to be relatively sluggish following the completion of some major infrastructure projects. On the external front, the “phase one” trade deal between the US and Mainland China is assessed to be slightly positive for the local economy in the short term. However, Hong Kong’s external trade performance will continue to be weighed down by weak global economic growth and trade flows. In particular, the coronavirus outbreak may lead to regional supply chain disruptions and slower cross-border economic activities, in tourism for example, thereby restraining Hong Kong’s exports. The Government forecasts real GDP growth for 2020 in the range of -1.5% to 0.5%, while growth forecasts by international organisations and privatesector analysts averaged -3.3%.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nInflationary pressures are expected to moderate in 2020 because of the sub-par economic conditions, the consolidation of private residential rentals and mild imported inflation. Market consensus forecasts a headline inflation rate for 2020 of 1.8%, and the Government projects the headline and underlying inflation rates to be 1.7% and 2.5% respectively. In the labour market, the unemployment rate is likely to rise further in the near term, given the weakened economic prospects and the coronavirus outbreak. privatesector analysts expect the unemployment rate to rise to about 4.0% in 2020.\n\n# Uncertainties and risks\n\nThe subdued economic outlook for 2020 is subject to a number of uncertainties and risks, including those stemming from the slowing global economy, US-China trade relations, Mainland’s economic performance, local social incidents and the persistence of the coronavirus outbreak. In particular, a prolonged coronavirus outbreak could trigger a more visible global economic slowdown and a repricing of assets, with the resulting unfavourable macroeconomic environment and tighter financial conditions posing further downward pressures on domestic real activities. However, the more concerted effort by major central banks to ease their monetary policies may provide a cushion against the negative economic impact inflicted by the outbreak.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector was resilient in 2019 despite the challenging environment with the global economic slowdown, US-China trade tensions and local social incidents. Bank balance sheet trends were stable, as both loans and deposits grew moderately. The capital and liquidity positions of the banking sector remained solid and asset quality held up well. The banking sector remained profitable with stable average return on asset.\n","terms":{"\"Capital preservation First, Long-Term Growth Next\"":["保本先行、長期增值"],"10 Years plus Caring Organisation

經濟與金融環境\n\n香港經濟在2019年出現收縮，反映全球經濟放緩、中美貿易摩擦持續以及本地社會事件的影響。隨著年中經濟情況迅速惡化，勞工市場面臨日益增加的壓力。由於豬肉價格急劇上升，通貨膨脹亦有所增加。預計2020年的經濟表現仍將困難，新型冠狀病毒爆發進一步衝擊已經疲弱的經濟。考慮到困難的經濟環境，政府與金管局已推出措施支持經濟，特別是家庭及中小企。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 實體經濟活動\n\n繼2018年錄得2.9%的擴張後，香港經濟在2019年收縮1.2%，為自2009年以來首次出現年度收縮。尤其是在下半年，經濟陷入衰退，經季節調整後的本地生產總值（本地生產總值）連續在第二、第三和第四季下降（表1）。經濟活動的下滑反映了本地需求顯著減少（圖1）。由於本地社會事件對消費活動和營商氣氛造成重大影響，私人消費支出錄得自2003年以來首次年度下降。整體投資支出也因營商氣氛低迷而下降。在對外方面，全球經濟增長放緩以及中美貿易緊張局勢下施加的額外關稅導致香港的貨品出口下降。服務輸出也創下歷史上最大的年度下降，因為社會事件導致訪港旅遊業嚴重惡化。由於本地需求和再出口誘發的需求較小，貨品進口及服務輸入也惡化。從淨貿易來看，淨出口（貿易順差）在2019年對本地生產總值產生了積極貢獻（圖1），因為總進口下降的速度比總出口更快。\n\n鑑於強勁的經濟逆風，政府於2019年8月至12月期間推出多輪措施，以減輕居民的財政負擔、保障就業和支持企業，特別是中小企以及零售、餐飲、交通和旅遊等受影響較大的行業。為讓銀行更能支持本地經濟，並有助減輕經濟周期，金管局於10月14日宣布將銀行的逆周期緩衝資本比率由2.5%降低至2.0%，藉此為銀行提供更多彈性，釋放2000億至3000億港元的銀行貸款予企業，包括中小企，並成立銀行業中小企貸款協調機制。九月份推出了一項新的八成信貸擔保產品的救濟措施，讓現金流量轉弱的中小企借款人申請本金寬限期以獲得即時支援。此外，十二月份推出中小企融資擔保計劃下的九成信貸擔保產品，為營運經驗相對較少企業以及尋求開設診所的專業人士提供額外支持，以獲取融資。\n\n# 貨幣狀況\n\n2019年，港元匯率及貨幣市場運作順暢有序。全年來，港元匯率大致穩定。由於弱方兌換保證於三月觸發，金管局以港元7.85兌1美元的匯率向銀行購入港元，並向銀行出售美元，導致總結餘按聯繫匯率制度的設計而下降。港元銀行同業拆息在長端維持大致穩定，而短端利率則普遍上揚。在零售層面，美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍下調後，多家零售銀行於10月下旬將其最優惠貸款利率下調12.5個基點。至於貨幣總體數字，2019年銀行總貸款額增加6.7%，較2018年的4.4%為高，而全年總存款額則增長2.9%。\n\n# 物價上漲\n\n剔除政府的「一次性紓困措施」影響後，基礎通脹率在2019年略微上升至3.0%，較2018年的2.6%為高。通脹溫和上升主要受到自5月起生鮮豬肉供應受阻導致豬肉價格上漲的影響（圖表2）。撇除基本食品項目，全年的物價壓力維持在適度水平。特別是，「租金組成項目」的「消費物價指數」隨著較早期的私人住宅租金整合而有所緩和。更廣泛地說，名義工資溫和增長以及商業租金增長放緩有助於控制本地企業成本。外部方面，進口物價通脹有所緩和，與全球經濟增長放緩下部分香港主要進口來源地的通脹下降相符。\n\n# 勞工市場\n\n2019年上半年勞工市場大致保持韌性，但下半年面臨日益增加的壓力（圖表3）。在頭兩個季度維持多年來低點2.8%後，經季節性調整後的失業率在第三季上升至2.9%，第四季則進一步增至3.3%，其中消費及旅遊相關行業的失業率更因社會事件而顯著上升。整體勞動需求在年內後段亦明顯縮減，總就業人數及私人部門職位空缺數量均下降。勞動需求減少尤其明顯於零售、住宿及飲食服務業，以及進出口貿易和建造業。在供給方面，勞動人口參與率略微下降，部分原因是對經濟衰退的週期性反應。隨著勞工市場壓力不斷增加，名義工資及收入的增長在年內末段顯示出放緩跡象。\n\n# 股市\n\n本地股市在2019年經歷了劇烈波動。前四個月市場出現反彈後，由於對中美貿易摩擦升級的擔憂，恒生指數於五月急跌（圖表4）。儘管在六月因主要央行釋出更為寬鬆貨幣政策的信號而部分收復失地，但隨着全球經濟增長放緩及本地社會事件，股市再度受壓。年尾時，美國與中國內地簽署「第一階段」貿易協議後，股市重拾上漲動力。恒生指數全年以28,190點收市，全年總體上漲9.1%。相較之下，平均每日成交額較去年同期減少約19%。一家內地科技公司及一家領先啤酒製造商的上市，使透過首次公開招股集資總額擴大至2019年的港元3,142億。香港連續第二年在全球首次公開招股集資額排名首位。\n\n# 物業市場\n\n住宅物業市場在2019年前五個月出現強勁反彈，但其餘月份則普遍回落。年初市場情緒有所改善，部分原因是中美貿易摩擦的擔憂暫時緩和，但隨後因中美貿易局勢再度升級、持續的社會事件以及疲弱的本地經濟狀況而受到影響。總體而言，樓價從五月份的高峰期至十二月溫和下跌了5%，但由於首五個月反彈了10%，全年仍錄得5%的增長（見圖4）。2019年的交易量較前一年增加4%，達到59,797個單位，反映了年初的活躍交易活動。置業負擔能力仍然緊張，價收入比和收入槓桿比率分別維持在17.9和80.9的高位，遠高於其長期平均水平。為協助有即時置業需求的買家，香港按揭證券有限公司於十月中旬提高了按揭保險計劃下，符合按揭貸款條件的已落成住宅物業價值上限。另一方面，非住宅物業市場在2019年面臨更強的下行壓力。特別是，零售店面的價格和租金均錄得了自2008年全球金融危機以來的最大跌幅，反映了當年惡化的經營環境。\n\n# 經濟前景\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n預計香港2020年的經濟表現將非常具挑戰性，與冠狀病毒爆發相關的短期下行風險顯著。一些尚未從社會事件造成的中斷中恢復的行業，例如零售、住宿、飲食服務、旅遊及運輸，將遭受雙重打擊。然而，2020至21年度《財政預算案》中宣布的逆周期財政措施，包括一次性派發現金，以及在中小企融資擔保計劃下設立的特惠低息貸款（附有政府百分百擔保），預計將為經濟，特別是家庭和中小企業提供一定程度的支持。2020年3月16日，金管局進一步將銀行的逆周期緩衝資本比率從2.0%降至1.0%，這將使銀行能更積極支持本地經濟，特別是那些預計會因冠狀病毒爆發的影響而面臨額外短期壓力的行業和個人。從本地生產總值組成部分分析，私人消費和投資可能因消費者和企業信心脆弱而持續疲弱。雖然政府消費將對經濟增長作出貢獻，但公共投資開支預計會因一些主要基建項目的完成而相對緩慢。在對外方面，美國與中國內地之間的「第一階段」貿易協議在短期內被評估對本地經濟略有正面影響。然而，香港的外貿表現仍將受到全球經濟增長疲弱和貿易流量下滑的拖累。特別是冠狀病毒爆發可能導致區內供應鏈運作受阻，跨境經濟活動放緩，例如旅遊業，進而抑制香港的出口。政府預測2020年的實質本地生產總值增長將介乎-1.5%至0.5%之間，而國際組織及私營機構分析師的增長預測平均為-3.3%。\n\n# 通貨膨脹與勞工市場\n\n通貨膨脹壓力預計因經濟表現不佳、 私人住宅租賃的綜合以及溫和的進口通脹而有所緩和。市場普遍預期2020年的整體通脹率為1.8%，政府則預測整體及基本通脹率分別為1.7%和2.5%。在勞工市場， 鑒於經濟前景疲弱以及冠狀病毒爆發，失業率短期內可能進一步上升。 私營部門分析員預期2020年失業率將上升至約4.0%。\n\n# 不明朗因素及風險\n\n二零二零年的經濟前景黯淡，並受到多項不明朗因素及風險的影響，包括全球經濟放緩、中美貿易關係、內地經濟表現、本地社會事件以及冠狀病毒爆發持續存在的影響。特別是，持續的冠狀病毒爆發可能引發更明顯的全球經濟放緩及資產重新定價，由此產生的不利宏觀經濟環境及較為緊縮的金融條件，進一步對國內實體經濟活動造成下行壓力。然而，主要央行更為積極地放寬貨幣政策，或可緩解疫情對經濟造成的負面影響。\n\n# 銀行體系的表現\n\n香港銀行體系在2019年儘管面對全球經濟放緩、中美貿易緊張及本地社會事件等挑戰，仍表現出韌性。銀行資產負債表走勢穩定，貸款及存款均適度增長。銀行體系的資本及流動性狀況保持穩健，資產質素亦保持良好。銀行體系維持盈利能力，平均資產回報率穩定。\n"}
{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate and money markets functioned in a smooth and orderly manner in 2019. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained stable throughout the year and strengthened to the strong side of the Convertibility Zone towards the end of the year. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, the Linked Exchange Rate System has shown its resilience to shocks time after time.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability. This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n\n- Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks\n\n- Government-issued notes and coins in circulation the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of the clearing account balances of banks kept with the HKMA\n\n- Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs). When the demand for Hong Kong dollars is greater than the supply and the market exchange rate strengthens to the strong-side CU of HK$7.75 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to sell Hong Kong dollars to banks for US dollars upon request. The Aggregate Balance will then expand to push down Hong Kong dollar interest rates, creating monetary conditions that move the Hong Kong dollar away from the strong-side limit to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if the supply of Hong Kong dollars is greater than demand and the market exchange rate weakens to the weak-side CU of HK$7.85 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to buy Hong Kong dollars from banks upon request. The Aggregate Balance will then contract to drive Hong Kong dollar interest rates up, pushing the Hong Kong dollar away from the weak-side limit to stay within the Convertibility Zone.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2019\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nDespite uncertainties in the external environment and a slowdown in the domestic economy, the Hong Kong dollar remained stable and traded in a smooth and orderly manner in 2019. In the beginning of the year, the widening negative Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads attracted carry trade activities of selling Hong Kong dollars for US dollars, pushing the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate towards the weak-side CU of 7.85 (Chart 1). As the weakening of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate continued, the weak-side CU was eventually triggered eight times in March. Thereafter, the Hong Kong dollar continued to stay near the weak-side CU rate of 7.85. Since late May, the strong Hong Kong dollar demand arising from sizeable initial public offering (IPO) activities, corporates’ demand for dividend payment and the half-year closing had led the Hong Kong dollar to strengthen. While the Hong Kong dollar drifted lower after the half-year mark, it regained momentum from late October and stayed in the strong side of the Convertibility Zone towards the end of the year. This reflected partly equity-related demand including IPOs, and partly the unwinding of short Hong Kong dollar positions due to tightened liquidity near the year end. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market functioned normally throughout 2019.\n\nDue to the triggering of the weak-side CU, the total of the Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding EFBNs declined from HK$1,136.2 billion at the end of 2018 to HK$1,133.0 billion at the end of 2019 (Chart 2). During the year, the HKMA purchased a total of HK$22.1 billion at the request of banks at the weak-side CU of 7.85 in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), leading to a contraction of the Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) from HK$76.4 billion at the end of 2018 to HK$54.3 billion at the end of 2019. The outstanding EFBNs increased slightly from HK$1,059.8 billion to HK$1,078.7 billion during the year, reflecting the issuance of EFBNs to absorb EFBNs’ interest payments according to the established practice. The Monetary Base as a whole remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves. Total Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and Notes at HK$1,133 billion at end-2019.\n\n# Money market\n\nDuring 2019, the Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained largely steady at the longer end, while short-term rates broadly picked up (Chart 3). Short-term rates also experienced more fluctuations driven by IpO-related funding demand and seasonal liquidity needs. The reduction in the Aggregate Balance since April 2018 may have led to a higher sensitivity of the Hong Kong dollar interbank rates to changes in the supply and demand of Hong Kong dollar funding in the local market.\n\nThe Base Rate was adjusted downwards on 1 August, 19 September and 31 October by a total of 75 basis points, from 2.75% at the end of 2018 to 2.00% in early November, as the target range for the US federal funds rate moved downward three times by a total of 75 basis points from 2.25–2.50% to 1.50–1.75% during the year. On 18–26 November and 19–31 December, the Base Rate was set higher than 2.00%, reflecting a marked upward trend of the overnight and one-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs) in the last two months of the year. As such, the Base Rate closed at 2.49% at the end of 2019. The adjustment of the Base Rate was in accordance with the revised formula announced on 26 March 2009, which sets the Base Rate at either 50 basis points above the lower bound of the prevailing target range for the US federal funds rate or the average of the five-day moving averages of the overnight and one-month HIBORs, whichever is the higher. On the retail front, several retail banks lowered their Best Lending Rates by 12.5 basis points following the decrease in the target range for the US federal funds rate in late October.\n\nThe discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points widened during the first two months, broadly tracking the movements of the Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads, with the 12-month Hong Kong dollar forward points reaching about -708 pips in mid-February (Chart 4). Thereafter, along with the narrowing of the negative Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads, the discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points narrowed gradually and turned to premiums towards the end of the year. Overall, Hong Kong’s money markets operated in an orderly manner. Discount Window borrowing decreased to HK$38.3 billion in 2019 from HK$40.2 billion in 2018.\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nThe LERS has contributed significantly to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability for more than three decades and has shown its resilience in multiple regional and global financial crises. Against the backdrop of social incidents happening during the year, a number of unfounded rumours casting doubt on the LERS and financial stability of Hong Kong circulated in the social media. The HKMA acted promptly and vigorously to rebut the rumours and reassure the public through the use of both traditional and social media, reiterating that the LERS would remain in place and Hong Kong would not impose foreign exchange or capital controls. In addition, the HKMA issued a number of articles to help the public understand the LERS operation, the flow of funds and the interest rate outlook. These efforts were effective in maintaining public confidence in the LERS, as evidenced by the orderly functioning of the markets throughout the year. The Government is also firmly committed to the LERS. public confidence in the Government’s commitment and the use of the Hong Kong dollar as a means of payment and storage of value were further reinforced by the stability in the foreign exchange and money markets. In its 2019 Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund reaffirmed its long-standing support for the LERS as an anchor of Hong Kong’s financial stability, and commented that the LERS remained the appropriate exchange rate arrangement for Hong Kong underpinned by Hong Kong’s transparent rules, ample fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy, and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nA robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS. Hong Kong’s banking system is highly liquid and sound, with liquidity positions and capitalisation being well above the minimum international standards. To ensure the resilience of the banking sector, the HKMA has been closely monitoring banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and has maintained its supervisory efforts on corporate, propertyrelated and Mainland-related lending. With a smaller Aggregate Balance relative to previous years, banks have in general strengthened their liquidity management arrangements and have been more proactive in managing their day-to-day funding positions. Furthermore, the HKMA has maintained close dialogue with banks to ensure smooth recycling of liquidity in the market, especially ahead of and during the subscription periods of large IPOs. No settlement gridlocks were noted during the year, with the Discount Window continuing to function effectively and efficiently.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) moved within a range of 109.9–112.1% during 2019, without touching the Upper or Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 111.2% on 31 December (Chart 5). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. In the event of abrupt shocks, the sizeable amount of financial resources of the Exchange Fund, together with Hong Kong’s robust banking system, will provide powerful support to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\n# Other activities\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong. In 2019, the CBC considered issues including an event study on the LERS operations, the relationship between the Aggregate Balance and interest rates in Hong Kong, an improved and more flexible approach to options markets’ views about the LERS, and the impact of future IPOs on HIBORs. Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Research\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMR), formerly the Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research, pursues research studies on topics in monetary policy, banking and finance that are policy relevant. This is reflected in the wide array of topics explored by HKIMR researchers and overseas visitors and in its conferences and events. The HKIMR collaborates with major central banks and policy institutions to jointly organise policy-focused conferences. Its research visiting programmes support research projects on policy issues that are of importance to the HKMA, Hong Kong and the region.\n\nIn 2019, the HKIMR hosted 14 research scholars, published 17 working papers, and held 11 public seminars covering a broad range of economic, monetary and financial issues. It also organised three international conferences:\n\n- The Tenth Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy, titled “China’s Financial Reforms and Economic Transformation”, was held on 10–11 January in Hong Kong, organised jointly by the HKIMR, the Financial Research Institute of the people’s Bank of China and the Research Institute of Finance of the Development Research Centre of the State Council. The conference provided a world-class forum for economic experts from central banks, international institutions, academia and the financial industry to discuss issues related to the risks that Mainland’s financial sector faced in the light of changes introduced by financial reforms and Mainland’s economic development.\n","terms":{"\"Capital preservation First, Long-Term Growth

貨幣穩定\n\n2019年，港元匯率及貨幣市場運作順暢且有序。港元匯率全年保持穩定，年底更強勢地處於貨幣兌換區間的強勢一端。作為香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石，聯繫匯率制度屢次展現其應對衝擊的韌性。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的首要目標是維持貨幣穩定。這被定義為港元在外汇市場上對美元的匯率維持在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的範圍內。香港的貨幣體系特色是採用貨幣發行局制度，該制度要求貨幣基礎至少有100%由外匯基金持有的美元儲備支持，且貨幣基礎的任何變動必須與美元儲備的相應變動完全匹配。\n\n貨幣基礎（表 1），包括：\n\n負債證明書，為三家發鈔銀行發行的銀行券提供十足的擔保。\n\n政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣的總結餘，即銀行存放在金管局的結算戶口的結餘。\n\n金管局代表政府發行外匯基金票據及債券。\n\n港元的匯率穩定，透過自動利率調節機制及金管局堅定履行兌換保證來維持。當港元需求大於供應，且市場匯率升至強方兌換保證匯率港元7.75兌1美元時，金管局應銀行要求出售港元以換取美元。總結餘隨之擴大，以壓低港元利率，創造貨幣狀況，使港元匯率離開強方上限，並維持在7.75至7.85的兌換保證區間內。相反地，若港元供應大於需求，且市場匯率跌至弱方兌換保證匯率港元7.85兌1美元時，金管局應銀行要求購入港元。總結餘隨之收縮，以推高港元利率，使港元匯率離開弱方下限，並維持在兌換保證區間內。\n\n# 2019回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定性\n\n儘管外部環境存在不確定性，以及本地經濟放緩，港元在2019年仍保持穩定，匯率交投順暢有序。年初時，港元與美元的負利率差擴大，吸引了套息活動，即沽售港元以換取美元，使港元匯率接近弱方兌換保證匯率7.85（圖1）。隨後，隨著港元匯率持續走弱，三月期間弱方兌換保證匯率被觸發八次。其後，港元持續維持在7.85的弱方兌換保證匯率附近。自五月底起，由於規模龐大的新股集資活動、企業的派息以及半年結算，強勁的港元需求促使港元走強。雖然年中後港元匯率一度回落，但自十月底起，港元重新獲得動力，並在年末維持在兌換保證匯率的強方水平。這部分反映了股票相關港元需求，包括首次公開招股，以及因年底流動性收緊而導致的港元短倉交易平倉。總體而言，2019年港元匯率市場運作正常。\n\n由於觸發弱方兌換保證匯率，總結餘（貼現窗前）及未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額由2018年底的港元1,136.2億下降至2019年底的港元1,133.0億（圖2）。當年，金管局根據聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）的設計，應銀行要求，在7.85的弱方兌換保證匯率下購入總計港元22.1億，導致總結餘（貼現窗前）由2018年底的港元76.4億下降至2019年底的港元54.3億。當年未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額略有上升，由港元1,059.8億增至港元1,078.7億，反映根據既定慣例發行外匯基金票據及債券以吸收其利息支出。貨幣基礎整體仍完全由外匯儲備支持。截至2019年底，總結餘（貼現窗前）及未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額為港元1,133.0億。\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n2019年間，港元銀行同業拆息在長期端大致維持穩定，而短期利率則普遍上升（圖3）。短期利率亦因與新股集資活動相關的資金需求及季節性流動性需求而出現更多波動。自2018年4月以來總結餘的減少，可能導致港元銀行同業拆息對本地市場港元資金供需變動的敏感度提高。\n\n基本利率於8月1日、9月19日及10月31日共下調75個基點，由2018年底的2.75%降至11月初的2.00%，原因是美國聯邦基金利率目標區間在當年三次下調，總計75個基點，從2.25–2.50%降至1.50–1.75%。於11月18–26日及12月19–31日，基本利率設定在2.00%以上，反映出當年最後兩個月隔夜及一個月香港銀行同業拆息（香港銀行同業拆息）顯著上升的趨勢。因此，基本利率在2019年底收報2.49%。基本利率的調整符合於2009年3月26日公布的修訂公式，該公式將基本利率設定為現行美國聯邦基金利率目標區間下限以上50個基點，或隔夜及一個月香港銀行同業拆息五日移動平均值的平均值，取較高者。在零售方面，多家零售銀行在10月底美國聯邦基金利率目標區間下降後，將最優惠貸款利率下調12.5個基點。\n\n在首兩個月，港元遠期匯率點子 的折讓擴大，大致追隨港元兌美元利率差的走勢，2月至中期12個月的港元遠期匯率點子 達到約 -708 個點子（圖表 4）。此後，隨著港元兌美元負利率差的縮窄，港元遠期匯率點子 的折讓逐漸收窄，並在年底轉為溢價。總體而言，香港貨幣市場運作井然有序。 貼現窗 借款於2019年減少至港元 383 億元，較2018年的港元 402 億元減少。\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n聯匯制度在過去三十多年來對香港的貨幣及金融穩定作出重大貢獻，並在多次區域及全球金融危機中展現其韌性。在本年度社會事件的背景下，一些無根據的謠言在社交媒體上流傳，質疑聯匯制度及香港的金融穩定。金管局迅速而積極地透過傳統媒體及社交媒體駁斥謠言，向公眾保證聯匯制度將繼續實施，香港亦不會實施外匯或資本管制。此外，金管局亦發佈多篇文章，協助公眾了解聯匯制度的運作、資金流動情況及利率展望。這些努力有效維持了公眾對聯匯制度的信心，這從全年市場有序運作中可見一斑。政府亦堅定支持聯匯制度，政府對此承諾的公眾信心，以及港元作為支付手段和價值儲藏工具的地位，亦因外匯及貨幣市場的穩定而進一步加強。在國際貨幣基金組織2019年與香港的第四條磋商中，國際貨幣基金組織重申其對聯匯制度作為香港金融穩定基石的長期支持，並指出聯匯制度仍然是香港合適的貨幣制度，因為香港擁有透明的規則、充足的財政及外匯儲備、強大的金融監管與監督、靈活的經濟及謹慎的財政架構。\n\n健全的銀行體系對聯匯制度的正常運作至關重要。香港的銀行體系流動性高且穩健，流動性水平和資本充足率均遠高於國際最低標準。為確保銀行體系的韌性，金管局一直密切監測銀行對信貸、流動性及利率風險的管理，以及壓力測試結果，並持續加強對企業貸款、樓宇按揭貸款及內地相關貸款的監管。與往年相比，總結餘規模較小，銀行一般已加強流動性管理安排，並更積極管理日常資金頭寸。此外，金管局持續與銀行保持密切對話，以確保市場流動性順暢迴圈，尤其是在大型首次公開招股的認購期前後。今年並未出現交收阻滯的情況，貼現窗亦持續有效率地運作。\n\n為提高貨幣發行局帳目的透明度，自一九九八年十月起，已將外匯基金的特定部分資產撥作支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（定義為支持資產除以貨幣基礎）在2019年期間在109.9–112.1%的範圍內波動，而未觸及上限或下限觸發水平。該比率於12月31日收於111.2%（圖5）。在聯匯制度下，雖然外匯基金的特定資產已被指定為支持組合，但所有外匯基金資產均可支持港元匯率。若發生突發衝擊，外匯基金龐大的財政資源，加上香港穩健的銀行體系，將為香港的貨幣和金融穩定提供強大的支持。\n\n# 其他活動\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會的貨幣發行委員會（貨幣發行委員會）監察及檢討與香港貨幣及金融穩定相關的議題。於2019年，貨幣發行委員會審議的議題包括一份關於聯匯制度運作的事件研究方法，總結餘與香港利率的關係、改善及更靈活處理期權市場對聯匯制度的看法，以及未來首次公開招股對香港銀行同業拆息的影響。貨幣發行委員會就這些議題的討論記錄，以及提交予貨幣發行委員會的貨幣發行局運作報告，均已於金管局網站發佈。\n\n# 研究\n\n香港貨幣及金融研究中心（研究中心），前身為香港金融研究中心，致力於針對貨幣政策、銀行及金融等議題進行政策相關的研究。這體現在研究中心研究人員及海外訪客所探討的廣泛主題，以及中心舉辦的研討會和活動中。研究中心與主要中央銀行和政策機構合作，共同舉辦以政策為主題的研討會。其研究訪問計劃支持針對金管局、香港及地區重要的政策議題的研究項目。\n\n二零一九年，研究中心接待了十四位研究學者，發表了十七篇工作論文，並舉辦了十一次公開研討會，涵蓋了廣泛的經濟、貨幣和金融議題。此外，中心還組織了三次國際會議：\n\n第10屆中國經濟年度國際研討會「中國的金融改革與經濟轉型」於1月10至11日在香港舉行，由研究中心、中國人民銀行金融研究所及國務院發展研究中心金融研究所聯合舉辦。該研討會為來自中央銀行、國際機構、學術界及金融業的經濟專家提供了一個世界級的平台，就金融改革及內地經濟發展所引致的內地金融部門所面臨的風險等議題進行探討。\n"}
{"en":"# Banking Stability\n\nThe banking sector in Hong Kong remained sound and stable in 2019, notwithstanding the headwinds brought by the weakening global and local economies. Thanks to the concerted efforts of the industry, the banking sector continued to operate normally amidst the social events. Efforts were taken to ensure that inconvenience caused to the public was kept to a minimum. During the year, the HKMA focused its supervision on the credit and liquidity risk management of authorized institutions. In view of escalating cyber threats and the industry’s growing dependency on technology, the HKMA stepped up the supervision of authorized institutions’ technology risk management. On conduct supervision, the HKMA streamlined its investor protection measures to enhance customer experience while according protection to customers. We also enhanced consumer protection in digital financial services and continued to promote a customer-centric corporate culture.\n\nOn anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT), 2019 marked the conclusion of the Financial Action Task Force’s Fourth Round Mutual Evaluation of Hong Kong’s AML\/CFT regime, which was assessed as compliant and effective overall, and earned positive recognition particularly for the banking sector’s good understanding of risks and the HKMA’s risk-based supervisory work in AML\/CFT. The HKMA has continued to participate in the public-private partnership for intelligence sharing on fraud and money laundering, and its active support for the adoption of AML\/CFT regulatory technology in the banking sector.\n\nOn banking development, the HKMA granted banking licences to eight virtual banks in 2019 and announced a three-phased approach to facilitate the development of green and sustainable banking in Hong Kong. The HKMA has been in close collaboration with the banking industry to optimise supervisory policies and processes and to carry out capacity-building initiatives that facilitate talent development.\n\nMeanwhile, substantial progress was made on the local implementation of international supervisory standards, including capital adequacy standards, disclosure standards, liquidity standards and large exposure standards. The HKMA also continued its work to ensure there would be a credible resolution regime for authorized institutions, including implementing rules on loss-absorbing capacity requirements to enhance the resolvability of authorized institutions.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this objective is contingent upon the financial system being highly resilient and capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their businesses and, in extremis, by failing in a disorderly manner. The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring banks are resilient to shocks and are able to recover their positions in response to crises, ultimately helping to prevent failures. The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks in Hong Kong. It is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs). The Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs).\n\nHowever, the Monetary Authority cannot ensure, nor is the Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework designed to ensure, a zero-risk financial system. Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that, in the event of an AI becoming non-viable, its failure can be managed in an orderly manner. To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong has been established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs. To ensure that the resolution regime in Hong Kong is operational, it is important to lay down resolution legislation and policy standards, undertake resolution planning to remove impediments to AIs’ resolvability and develop the HKMA’s operational capability to resolve a failing AI. In order to carry out these tasks effectively, the HKMA adopts an internationally harmonised and co-ordinated approach.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2019\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nIn 2019, 196 off-site reviews were conducted covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL rating assessment, corporate governance, risk management and fintech strategies. As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance, 26 meetings were held with the boards of directors or board-level committees of AIs. Furthermore, 32 tripartite meetings were held among the HKMA, the AIs and their external auditors.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA conducts regular on-site examinations supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk. A total of 405 on-site examinations and thematic reviews were conducted during the year. Credit risk management remained a key focus of these examinations and reviews. Another major focus was in technology risk and operational risk management. The HKMA also increased the number of on-site examinations and thematic reviews targeted at liquidity and market risk management as well as the implementation of the Basel capital adequacy framework. At the same time, specialist teams performed on-site examinations and thematic reviews of AIs’ activities in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses.\n\nTable 1 contains an overall summary of the HKMA’s supervisory activities in 2019.\n\n# Supervision of credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nBank lending increased moderately in 2019. Total loans grew by 6.7%, compared with 4.4% in 2018. As shown in Table 2, loans for use in Hong Kong and loans for use outside Hong Kong registered growth of 7.7% and 5.8% respectively.\n\nMainland-related lending grew by 7.4% to HK$4,564 billion as at the end of 2019 (Table 3).\n\nThe asset quality of AIs remained healthy. Retail banks’ classified loan ratio edged down from 0.51% at the end of 2018 to 0.48% at the end of 2019, well below the long-run historical average of 2% since 2000. For the banking industry as a whole, the classified loan ratio increased slightly from 0.55% to 0.57%. Specifically in terms of Mainland-related lending, retail banks’ classified loan ratio increased from 0.63% in 2018 to 0.79% in 2019, which was still low by historical standard. For the banking industry as a whole, the ratio increased to 0.75% from 0.55% a year ago.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA devoted increased supervisory efforts in ensuring that AIs continued to adopt prudent credit risk management standards amid the uncertain economic environment. Solvency stress tests were enhanced to incorporate more comprehensive risk coverage and more severe stress assumptions. The results of the enhanced stress tests continued to indicate that banks generally had sufficient capital buffers to withstand extreme shocks. Targeted and thematic examinations were conducted to evaluate the credit risk management practices of AIs in different areas, such as lending to corporates engaged in high-risk business, complex financing arrangements, and collateralised lending to private banking and wealth management customers. Recognising that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) would more likely face greater challenges during economic downturns, the HKMA established a Banking Sector SME Lending Co-ordination Mechanism in October, with a view to encouraging banks to continue to support SMEs’ financing needs to the extent permitted by prudent risk management principles.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nThe resilience of the Hong Kong banking sector to withstand a downturn in the property market has been strengthened significantly by the eight rounds of countercyclical macro-prudential measures introduced by the HKMA since 2009. The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of new residential mortgage loans fell to 53% in December 2019 from 64% in September 2009, before the countercyclical measures were first introduced. The average debt servicing ratio (DSR) of new mortgages also decreased to 36% in December 2019 from 41% in August 2010, when a cap on DSR was first applied (Chart 1).\n\n# Supervision of operational and technology risk\n\nThe HKMA adopts a three-phased approach to implement the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework under the Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative (CFI). phase One assessment, involving all the major banks, was completed in 2018. The remaining AIs covered in the second and third phases have substantially completed the assessment as scheduled. The HKMA has also embarked on a comprehensive review of the CFI to fine-tune the initiative given the experience gained in the past years.\n\nIn October, the HKMA issued a revised Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module on “Risk Management of E-banking”. The revision sought to provide the industry with greater flexibility to meet changing customer expectations on electronic banking services. The HKMA also published a set of high-level principles on the use of artificial intelligence in order to provide guidance for the industry.\n\nSince the social events started in June, the HKMA have maintained close dialogue with the industry to monitor the impact on banking operations and services. Banks were requested to replenish automated teller machines (ATMs) more frequently and repair vandalised facilities as soon as practicable. The HKMA also acted quickly to refute malicious rumours that sought to undermine the public’s confidence in the banking system. Thanks to concerted efforts by the banking industry, the affected bank branches and facilities quickly resumed normal services and the inconvenience caused to the public was kept to a minimum. In view of the rising operational risk posed by the social events, banks were asked to take additional precautionary measures to strengthen their operational resilience.\n\n# Supervision of liquidity and market risk management\n\nDuring the year, a round of thematic reviews was conducted to assess AIs’ capability to cope with liquidity shocks. The reviews focused on the robustness of AIs’ liquidity stress testing programmes and contingency funding management. The HKMA also assessed AIs’ compliance with the regulatory requirements on the calculation of the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) to ensure the prudence and accuracy of the inputs used for the calculation.\n\nAs algorithmic trading gained popularity in the banking industry, the HKMA conducted a round of thematic reviews to evaluate AIs’ risk management practices in this area. Considering that the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) might cease to be published after end-2021, the HKMA reminded AIs to get prepared for the transition to alternative reference rates and conducted a survey to monitor their preparedness for the transition.\n\n# Combating money laundering and terrorist financing (ML\/TF)\n\nThe HKMA carries out risk-based supervision of AIs’ AML\/CFT systems. During the year, 18 on-site examinations and 61 off-site reviews were conducted, including targeted thematic reviews on private banking and the governance of the use of new technology. The HKMA shared with the industry the observations and best practices drawn from a thematic review of AIs’ application of risk-based AML\/CFT controls for SMEs, in order to assist AIs to adopt appropriate account opening processes and delivery of services for SMEs.\n\n# Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Mutual Evaluation (ME) Report on Hong Kong\n\nA highlight of 2019 for the HKMA and Hong Kong’s overall AML\/CFT regime was the publication of the FATF ME Report on Hong Kong in September. The Report represents one of the best overall results to date in the FATF’s fourth-round ME of its member jurisdictions. Hong Kong scored six “Substantial” ratings out of 11 “Immediate Outcomes” in the assessment of the effectiveness of its AML\/CFT regime, and a high mark for the technical compliance aspect of the ME.\n\nThe Report favourably assessed the HKMA’s risk-based approach to AML\/CFT supervision, noting that the HKMA had a good understanding of ML\/TF risks in the banking sector and a reasonable understanding of risks in the stored value facility (SVF) sector. The Report also positively assessed the collective AML\/CFT efforts of the banking sector, such as the increased use of data analytics by larger AIs, the fact that the great majority of suspicious transaction reports were filed by AIs, and the sector’s proactive participation in the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce (FMLIT).\n\nThe Report recommended several areas for improvement, including the understanding of some higher-risk areas, such as foreign corruption and tax crimes, and developing sectors such as SVFs. Work has already started to address these recommendations; the HKMA published an updated ML\/TF Risk Assessment on the SVF sector in July and has commenced thematic on-site examinations on private banking and the governance of the use of new technology.\n","terms":{"\"Capital preservation First, Long-Term Growth Next\"":["保本先行、長期增值"],"10 Years plus Caring Organisation

銀行體系穩定\n\n香港銀行體系在2019年保持穩健及穩定，儘管面對全球及本地經濟疲軟帶來的逆風。多虧行業的協同努力，銀行體系在社會事件的背景下持續正常運作。採取措施以確保對公眾造成的不便降至最低。當年，金管局將監管重點放在認可機構的信貸及流動性風險管理上。考慮到網絡威脅不斷升級，以及行業對科技的依賴不斷增加，金管局加強了對認可機構科技風險管理的監管。在行為監管方面，金管局簡化投資者保障措施，以提升客戶體驗同時保障客戶權益。我們亦加強了數碼金融服務中的消費者保障，並持續推動以客戶為中心的企業文化。\n\n在打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度（AML\/CFT）方面，2019年標誌著《財務行動特別組織》的第四輪相互評估完成，對香港的打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度進行了整體評估，結果認為符合要求且有效，並特別肯定了《銀行體系》對風險的良好理解，以及《金管局》在打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度方面的風險為本的監管工作。 《金管局》持續參與針對欺詐及洗錢的情報分享公私營合作夥伴關係，並積極支持《銀行體系》採用合規科技。\n\n在銀行業發展方面，金管局於二零一九年向八間虛擬銀行發出銀行牌照，並宣布三階段路線圖以促進香港綠色及可持續銀行業的發展。金管局一直與銀行業界緊密合作，優化監管政策及程序，並推行提升人才專業能力的措施以促進人才發展。\n\n與此同時，在本地實施國際監管標準方面取得了顯著進展，包括資本充足標準、披露標準、流動性標準和大額風險承擔標準。金管局亦繼續致力確保為認可機構建立一個可信的處置機制，包括實施有關吸收虧損能力的要求，以提升認可機構的可重整性。\n\n# 目標\n\n金管局的主要目標是促進銀行體系的安全與穩定。實現此目標取決於金融體系具備高度穩健性，並能夠提供香港經濟所需的關鍵金融服務。\n\n銀行透過其業務運作方式，甚至在極端情況下以不整頓的方式倒閉，都可能影響系統的穩定性。金融管理專員作為監管機構，在確保銀行能夠抵禦衝擊並在危機中恢復其地位，最終有助於防止倒閉，從而在維護金融穩定方面發揮關鍵作用。金融管理專員負責香港銀行的審慎監管。其職責是授權香港的持牌銀行、受限制牌照銀行和存款公司，這些機構統稱為認可機構。金融管理專員亦負責指定和監管某些金融市場基建。\n\n然而，金融管理專員無法保證，亦非香港的審慎監管框架旨在確保零風險的金融體系。相反，金融管理專員作為處置機制權威機構，致力於確保當認可機構出現不可行的情況時，其破產可以有秩序地處理。為此，香港已建立金融機構的處置機制，金融管理專員在該機制下是認可機構的處置權威機構。為了確保香港的處置機制能夠運作，制定處置法規和政策標準、進行處置規劃以消除認可機構可處置性的障礙，以及發展金管局處理陷入困境的認可機構的運營能力至關重要。為了有效執行這些任務，金管局採取了國際協調一致的方法。\n\n# 2019回顧\n\n# 監督活動概覽\n\n2019年，共進行了196次非現場審查，涵蓋範圍廣泛的議題，包括CAMEL評估、公司治理、風險管理及金融科技策略。為持續推動強化風險治理，金管局與認可機構的董事會或董事層委員會舉行了26場會議。此外，金管局、認可機構及其外部核數師之間亦舉行了32場三方會議。\n\n除了離地審核外，金管局定期進行現場審查，並配合對風險較高範疇的專題評估。年內共進行了 405 項現場審查和專題評估。信貸風險管理持續是這些審查和評估的重點，科技風險及營運風險管理亦是另一個主要關注點。為加強流動性及市場風險管理，以及巴塞爾資本充足架構的落實，金管局同時增加了相關的現場審查和專題評估。此外，專門團隊亦對認可機構在證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（強積金）相關業務的活動進行現場審查和專題評估。\n\n表一概括了金管局在2019年的監管活動。\n\n# 信用風險監管\n\n#信貸增長與資產質素\n\n2019年銀行貸款增幅溫和。總貸款額增長6.7%，較2018年的4.4%有所上升。如表2所示，用於香港的貸款及用於香港境外的貸款分別增長7.7%及5.8%。\n\n截至2019年末，內地相關貸款增長7.4%，達到4,564 港元（表3）。\n\n認可機構的資產質素仍然保持健康。零售銀行的特定分類貸款比率由2018年底的0.51%略微下降至2019年底的0.48%，遠低於自2000年以來的長期歷史平均值2%。就銀行業界整體而言，特定分類貸款比率從0.55%略微上升至0.57%。就內地相關貸款而言，零售銀行的特定分類貸款比率從2018年的0.63%上升至2019年的0.79%，雖然仍低於歷史標準。就銀行業界整體而言，該比率從一年前的0.55%上升至0.75%。\n\n年內，金管局加強監管力度，確保認可機構在不明朗的經濟環境下繼續採取審慎的信貸風險管理標準。償債壓力測試的覆蓋範圍和壓力假設均得到加強，以涵蓋更全面的風險。經加強後的壓力測試結果繼續顯示，銀行普遍擁有足夠的資本緩衝，以抵禦極端衝擊。針對性和主題性檢查已進行，以評估認可機構在不同領域的信貸風險管理實務，例如向從事高風險業務的公司貸款、複雜融資安排，以及向私人銀行和財富管理客戶提供的有抵押貸款。鑒於中小企在經濟下行期間可能面臨更大的挑戰，金管局於十月成立銀行業中小企貸款協調機制，旨在鼓勵銀行在審慎風險管理原則允許的範圍內，繼續支持中小企的融資需求。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n香港銀行業對物業市場下行的抗風險能力，因金管局自2009年起推行的八輪逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施而顯著增強。新住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數，在2009年9月實施逆周期措施前為64%，至2019年12月已降至53%。新按揭貸款的平均供款與入息比率，亦在2010年8月首次實施供款與入息比率上限後，由41%降至2019年12月的36%（圖1）。\n\n# 營運及科技風險監控\n\n金管局采取三階段方法，根據網絡防衛計劃實施網絡防衛評估框架。第一階段評估，包括所有主要銀行，於2018年完成。覆蓋於第二及第三階段的剩餘認可機構已按時完成評估。金管局亦開展對網絡防衛計劃的全面檢討，以基於過去幾年的經驗精準調整該計劃。\n\n十月，金管局發佈了經修訂的《監管政策手冊》（SPM）中關於「電子銀行風險管理」的章節。 修訂旨在為業界提供更大的彈性，以滿足客戶對電子銀行服務不斷變化的期望。 金管局亦發佈了一系列高層原則，以指導業界使用人工智能。\n\n自六月社會事件爆發以來，金管局一直與銀行業界保持密切溝通，以監測事件對銀行營運及服務的影響。銀行被要求更頻繁地補充自動櫃員機，並盡快修復遭破壞的設施。金管局亦迅速採取行動，駁斥企圖削弱公眾對銀行體系信心的惡意謠言。 歸功於銀行業界的共同努力，受影響的銀行分行及設施迅速恢復正常服務，對公眾造成的不便亦減至最低。 鑒於社會事件帶來的營運風險日益增加，銀行被要求採取額外預防措施，以加強其營運韌性。\n\n# 流動性及市場風險管理的監督\n\n本年度，金管局進行了一輪專題評估，以評估認可機構應對流動性衝擊的能力。評估重點為認可機構流動性壓力測試計劃的穩健性及應急融資管理。金管局亦評估認可機構在計算流動性覆蓋比率（LCR）方面是否符合相關監管要求，以確保計算所用數據的謹慎性和準確性。\n\n隨著程式交易在銀行業界日益普及，金管局進行了一輪專題評估，以評估認可機構在這方面的風險管理措施。 考慮到倫敦銀行同業拆息 (LIBOR) 可能在2021年底後停止發布，金管局提醒認可機構做好過渡至備用參考利率的準備，並進行了一項調查以監測它們的準備情況。\n\n# 打擊洗錢及恐怖主義資金籌集（ML\/TF）\n\n金管局對認可機構的打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度（AML\/CFT）系統進行風險為本的監管。當年進行了18次現場審查及61次非現場審查，其中包括針對私人銀行業務及新技術應用治理的專題評估。金管局與業界分享了有關認可機構就中小企業應用風險為本的打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集監控措施的專題評估所得的觀察結果及最佳實務，以協助認可機構採用適合中小企業的開戶程序及服務提供方式。\n\n# 財務行動特別組織（FATF）相互評估（ME）報告：香港\n\n金管局及香港整體打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度於2019年的亮點，是《相互評估報告》於九月發布。該報告代表至今為止，財務行動特別組織在對其成員司法管轄區的第四輪相互評估中取得的最佳整體結果之一。香港在對其打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度的有效性評估中，獲得了11項「即時結果」中的六項「實質」評級，並且在相互評估的技術合規方面也獲得了高分。\n\n報告對金管局以風險為本的方法監督打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度（AML\/CFT）的成效表示肯定，並指出金管局對銀行體系內的洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險有充分了解，對儲值支付工具（SVF）行業的風險也有合理的認識。報告亦正面評價銀行體系在打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集方面的整體努力，例如較大型認可機構增加運用數據分析，絕大多數可疑交易報告均由認可機構提交，以及銀行體系積極參與反訛騙及洗黑錢情報工作組（情報工作組）。\n\n報告建議在幾個方面進行改進，包括加深對一些高風險領域的認識，例如境外貪污及稅務罪行，以及推動如儲值支付工具等領域的發展。相關工作已開始落實；金管局於七月發布了更新的洗錢及恐怖融資風險評估，內容涵蓋儲值支付工具領域，並已展開針對私人銀行業務及新技術應用治理的主題性現場審查。\n"}
{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nHong Kong is a globally competitive international financial centre. The implementation of the Smart Banking initiatives has been in good progress to further develop Hong Kong as a fintech hub. Capitalising on opportunities arising from the opening up of the Mainland financial markets, much headway has been made to promote financial collaboration in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, especially in easing Hong Kong residents’ cross-border access to financial and banking services in the Area.\n\nAt the same time, much effort has been made to open up new opportunities to further strengthen the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, including infrastructure investment and financing, green finance and private equity funds. The Hong Kong Academy of Finance was set up to enhance Hong Kong’s soft power in a sustainable manner.\n\nIn the central banking and regulatory community, the HKMA plays a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees, which is a clear recognition of Hong Kong’s expertise and commitment to international work.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nTo strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia, the HKMA puts great effort into implementing the seven Smart Banking initiatives that were announced in September 2017, with an aim to facilitate the development and use of fintech in the banking and payment industries. The key progress of these initiatives during the year included:\n\n- expanding the adoption of the Faster Payment System (FPS);\n- facilitating the implementation of phases I and II of the Open Application programming Interface (Open API) Framework in the banking sector;\n- further enhancing fintech research and talent\ndevelopment;\n- stepping up cross-border collaboration in fintech; granting eight virtual bank licences;\n- facilitating the industry’s increasing use of Fintech Supervisory Sandbox (FSS) 2.0 for launching fintech initiatives; and\n- further facilitating the adoption of regulatory technology (Regtech) through the Banking Made Easy initiative.\n\nThe HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO), together with the banking departments of the HKMA, plays a pivotal role in driving the implementation of these initiatives.\n\nHong Kong plays an indispensable role in facilitating international investors’ allocation of renminbi assets, with its unparalleled access to the onshore markets through the Stock Connect and Bond Connect schemes. This was evident by the tripling of the number of registered investors and daily turnover under Bond Connect over the past year. Further enhancements have been introduced to both Bond Connect and Stock Connect, providing more convenience and flexibility for international investors to invest in onshore securities in the Mainland. The HKMA also worked closely with Mainland authorities to explore and implement a series of financial facilitation measures for Hong Kong residents to access financial and banking services across the border in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), including a prospective, two-way wealth management connect scheme. Hong Kong maintains a firm foothold as the global hub for offshore renminbi business. According to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Triennial Survey of Foreign Exchange (FX) and Derivatives Market Turnover, Hong Kong continued to be the largest offshore renminbi FX centre in the world.\n\nContinuous efforts were put into opening up new opportunities to further enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. To promote the development of the fund business in Hong Kong, the HKMA worked closely with the Government and industry to provide a more favourable tax and regulatory environment for fund formation. A number of large-scale events and targeted outreach activities were organised to promote Hong Kong as a hub for green finance, infrastructure investment and financing and corporate treasury centres (CTCs). In an effort to enhance Hong Kong’s soft power, the Hong Kong Academy of Finance (AoF) was set up in June to develop financial leadership and promote research collaboration.\n\nIn the central banking and regulatory community, the HKMA plays a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees. The HKMA chaired the Standing Committee on Supervisory and Regulatory Cooperation (SRC) of the Financial Stability Board (FSB) until 31 August 2019. Currently, the HKMA is chairing the Supervision and Implementation Group (SIG) of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), and the Working Group on Financial Markets (WGFM) established under the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP). The HKMA is also co-chairing the Non-Bank Monitoring Experts Group (NMEG) of the FSB with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure lays a solid foundation for Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre. The four interbank Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) and the Hong Kong Trade Repository (HKTR) achieved 100% system availability in 2019, beating the target of 99.95%. Through its accounts set up with the two Mainland central securities depositories, the CMU facilitates the settlement of transactions conducted under Bond Connect Northbound Trading and the holding of Mainland debt securities on behalf of relevant CMU members.\n\nThe FPS, which serves as an extension of Hong Kong dollar RTGS system to enable the public to make instant retail fund transfers and payments across different banks and stored value facilities (SVFs) on a round-the-clock basis, ran smoothly in its first year of operation. Users’ adoption of the facility had increased steadily, as manifested in the four million registrations and tripling of transaction volumes by the end of 2019. The FPS brings new opportunities to the retail payment industry and promotes fintech innovation.\n\nTo ensure the general safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA has designated and is overseeing a total of six retail payment systems (RPSs) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO). The HKMA also issued two new SVF licences in May, bringing the total number of SVF licensees to 18. SVF licensees continued to launch new products and services actively during the year to diversify customer choices and enhance user experience.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2019\n\n# Hong Kong as a Fintech Hub in Asia\n\n# Smart Banking initiatives\n\nThe seven Smart Banking initiatives were announced by the HKMA in September 2017 with the aim of helping the banking sector achieve higher standards of operation and embrace the enormous opportunities brought about by the convergence of banking and technology. During the year, considerable progress was made in implementing these initiatives and transforming the fintech ecosystem of Hong Kong.\n\n# Faster Payment System\n\nThe launch of the FPS in September 2018 was a major milestone in the financial infrastructure development of Hong Kong in the digital era. The FPS further promotes the adoption of e-payment in Hong Kong by providing efficient and convenient payment services to the general public and corporates. Since the launch of the FPS, the number of participating service providers had increased to 30 banks and 11 SVFs, with the addition of nine banks and one SVF, by the end of 2019.\n\nUsage of the FPS has also grown steadily. As of 31 December 2019, the FPS recorded four million registrations (Chart 1) and processed 44 million transactions involving an aggregate amount of HK$748.5 billion and RMB17 billion. In December 2019, average daily turnover reached 168,000 transactions worth HK$2.4 billion and RMB38 million (Chart 2), as compared with 51,000 transactions during its first full month of operation in October 2018.\n\nFaster payment System recorded: \n- 4 million registrations as of 31 December 2019\n- 44 million transactions as of 31 December 2019\n- 168,000 transactions worth HK$2.4 billion and RMB38 million of average daily turnover in December 2019\n\nThe HKMA works with the industry to extend FPS usage from person-to-person payments to bill payments and other merchant payments. For example, enhancements were made to enable merchants to use a variety of proxy identifiers and accept partial or over-payments via a QR code. A technical specification was developed to facilitate the invocation of a mobile banking or SVF e-wallet mobile application (app) from a business mobile app for FPS payment. This would greatly improve customer experience in making merchant and business payments via the FPS using mobile devices.\n\nThe HKMA also works closely with relevant Government departments to assist them in using the FPS to accept bill payments from the public. From 1 November, bills issued by the Inland Revenue Department, the Rating and Valuation Department and the Water Supplies Department were printed with an FPS QR code so that the public could scan the QR code easily with supporting mobile banking or SVF e-wallet apps to make payment. The HKMA will continue working with various Government departments and public bodies to explore other potential use cases which can make it convenient for the public to make payment via the FPS.\n\nTo raise public awareness of the FPS, the HKMA has developed a new series of education and publicity materials, such as Announcements in the public Interest for broadcast on television and radio, as well as videos and electronic banners for digital platforms. The HKMA also participated in trade fairs to promote the FPS to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and corporates. Various FPS participating banks and SVFs launched promotion campaigns and offered incentives to encourage customers to register with the FPS and to use it for fund transfer and bill payment.\n\nIn addition, the HKMA engaged a number of industry organisations and institutions to provide briefings on the FPS so as to introduce its functionalities and the potential benefits it may bring to different businesses in collecting and making payment.\n\nThe Government has adopted FPS for bill payments on taxes, rates and Government rent and water charges.\n\n# Open Application Programming Interface\n\nThe HKMA continued to facilitate the banking sector’s development and adoption of Open API in accordance with the four-phase approach of the Open API Framework. Under phase I, 20 retail banks opened up over 500 Open API endpoints in January, covering information of banking products and services. Under phase II, the banks opened up in October over 300 APIs to support applications for banking products and services.\n\n# Research and talent development\n\nOn trade finance, a proof-of-concept (PoC) study on linking up eTradeConnect and we.trade was completed in the first quarter of the year. In November, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between the subsidiaries of Hong Kong Interbank Clearing Limited and the Institute of Digital Currency of the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) to conduct a PoC study on linking up eTradeConnect and the PBoC Trade Finance platform to provide firms in both Hong Kong and Mainland China with more convenient trade finance services.\n\nOn Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), the HKMA and the Bank of Thailand embarked on a joint research project named project Inthanon-LionRock to study the application of CBDC to cross-border payments, with a view to facilitating HKD-THB payment-versus-payment (pvp) among banks in Hong Kong and Thailand.\n\nHKMA Executive Director (Financial Infrastructure), Mr Colin Pou (first from left), together with Director-General of the Institute of Digital Currency of the PBoC, Mr Mu Changchun (first from right), witness the signing ceremony of an MoU to conduct a PoC trial on linking up eTradeConnect and the PBoC Trade Finance Platform. The MoU is signed between Chief Executive Officer of the Hong Kong Trade Finance Platform Company Limited, Ms Haster Tang (second from left), and Deputy Director-General of the Institute of Digital Currency of the PBoC and Director of the Shenzhen Fintech Institute, Mr Di Gang (second from right).\n\nOn artificial intelligence (AI), the HKMA carried out a study on the application of AI technology in the Hong Kong banking industry. Key findings of an industry-wide AI survey were published in November, followed by the issuance of the full report, titled “Reshaping Banking with Artificial Intelligence”, in December.\n\nThe report “Reshaping Banking with Artificial Intelligence” is published in December.\n\nA fact sheet is published to highlight the key facts and figures derived from a survey on the use of AI in the Hong Kong banking industry.\n\nIn an effort to enlarge the fintech talent pool, the HKMA continued to run the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme 2.0 in collaboration with its strategic partners to nurture young talent at various stages of their career development. Over 220 students benefited from the programme last year.\n","terms":{"\"Capital preservation First, Long-Term Growth Next\"":["保本先行、長期增值"],"10 Years plus Caring Organisation

加強跨國金融科技合作；頒發八個虛擬銀行牌照；\n- 協助業界更廣泛應用金融科技監管沙盒（沙盒）2.0 來推行金融科技計劃；以及\n- 透過「銀行易」計劃進一步推動合規科技（Regtech）的應用。\n\n金融科技促進辦公室（FFO）與金管局的銀行部門共同發揮關鍵作用，推動這些措施的落實。\n\n香港在協助國際投資者配置人民幣資產方面扮演不可或缺的角色，憑藉滬港通及債券通等互聯互通機制，提供無與倫比的在岸市場通道。過往一年內，債券通的註冊投資者數目及每日成交額均實現三倍增長，充分體現了這一點。債券通及滬港通亦進一步推出優化措施，為國際投資者投資內地境內證券提供更大便利與靈活性。金管局亦與內地當局密切合作，探討並落實一系列金融便利化措施，讓香港居民可更便捷地跨境使用粵港澳大灣區的金融及銀行服務，包括預期的理財通機制。香港穩守全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐地位。根據國際結算銀行（國際結算銀行）三年一度的外匯與衍生工具市場成交額調查，香港繼續為全球最大離岸人民幣外匯中心。\n\n持續努力開拓新機會，進一步提升香港金融平台的競爭力。為促進香港基金業務的發展，金管局與政府及業界緊密合作，為基金設立提供更為有利的稅務及監管環境。為推廣香港作為綠色金融樞紐，金管局組織了一系列大型活動及針對性宣傳推廣活動，以促進基建投資及融資，以及企業財資中心（企業財資中心）的發展。為增強香港的軟實力，金融學院（金融學院）於六月成立，致力於培育金融業領袖人才並推動研究合作。\n\n在中央銀行及監管領域，金管局在多個地區及國際委員會中扮演著領導角色。金管局直至2019年8月31日，曾擔任金融穩定理事會（金融穩定理事會）的監管合作常設委員會（監管合作常設委員會）的主席。目前，金管局正擔任巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（巴塞爾委員會）的監管及實施準則小組（監管及實施準則小組）的主席，以及東亞及太平洋地區中央銀行會議(EMEAP)設立的金融市場工作小組（金融市場工作小組）。金管局同時與美國證券交易委員會共同擔任金融穩定理事會的非銀行監察專家小組（非銀行監察專家小組）的共同主席。\n\n香港的金融基建安全高效的運作，為香港作為國際金融中心的角色奠定了堅實的基礎。四個銀行間即時支付結算系統（RTGS系統）、中央貨幣市場單位的（CMU）及香港交易資料儲存庫（香港儲存庫）於2019年達致100%系統可用率，超出99.95%的目標。透過與兩間內地中央證券登記存管機構設立的帳戶，中央貨幣市場單位促進了透過債券通北向通進行的交易結算，以及代表相關中央貨幣市場單位成員持有內地債務證券。\n\n快速支付系統「轉數快」作為香港元實時結算系統的延伸，使公眾可於24小時不間斷地透過不同銀行及儲值支付工具進行即時零售資金轉帳及支付，該系統在運作第一年表現順利。用戶對該項服務的採用率穩步上升，至2019年底已累計四百萬註冊用戶，交易量亦增長三倍。快速支付系統「轉數快」為零售支付行業帶來新機遇，並推動金融科技創新。\n\n為確保本地零售支付業界的整體安全及效率，金管局根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》指定並監管共六個零售支付系統（RPSs）。金管局亦於五月份發出兩項新的儲值支付工具牌照，使儲值支付工具持牌人數目增至18間。儲值支付工具持牌人當年積極推出新產品及服務，以多元化客戶選擇並提升用戶體驗。\n\n# 2019回顧\n\n# 香港作為亞洲的金融科技樞紐\n\n# 智慧銀行舉措\n\n七項智慧銀行措施於二零一七年九月由金管局公佈，旨在協助銀行體系達到更高的營運標準，並擁抱銀行與科技融合所帶來的巨大機遇。年內，在落實這些措施和轉型香港金融科技生態系統方面取得了顯著進展。\n\n#快速支付系統「轉數快」\n\n二零一八年九月推出快速支付系統「轉數快」是香港在數碼時代金融基建發展的重要里程碑。快速支付系統「轉數快」進一步推動香港的電子支付普及，為市民和企業提供高效便捷的支付服務。截至二零一九年末，參與服務供應商已增加至三十間銀行和十一個儲值支付工具，新增了九間銀行和一個儲值支付工具。\n\n快速支付系統「轉數快」的使用量亦穩定增長。截至2019年12月31日，快速支付系統「轉數快」錄得四百萬登記（圖1），並處理了涉及總額為港元7485億元及人民幣170億元的4400萬宗交易。2019年12月，平均每日成交量達168,000宗，涉及金額為港元24億元及人民幣3800萬元（圖2），相比其於2018年10月首次全面運作的首個完整月份的51,000宗交易，已見顯著增長。\n\n快速支付系統「轉數快」紀錄：\n- 截至2019年12月31日累計註冊用戶400萬\n- 截至2019年12月31日累計交易筆數4,400萬\n- 2019年12月平均每日交易額為168,000筆，總值港元24億及人民幣3,800萬\n\n金管局與業界合作，將快速支付系統「轉數快」的應用範圍從個人對個人的支付擴展至賬單支付及其他商戶支付。例如，已進行改進，使商戶能夠使用多種代理識別碼，並透過二維碼接受部分付款或過額付款。為此，制定了一項技術規範，以促進從企業移動應用程式啟動移動銀行或儲值支付工具電子錢包應用程式（app），用於快速支付系統「轉數快」的支付。這將大幅改善客戶透過快速支付系統「轉數快」使用移動設備進行商戶及企業支付的體驗。\n\n金管局亦與相關政府部門緊密合作，協助他們使用快速支付系統「轉數快」以接受公眾的賬單付款。自11月1日起，由稅務局、差餉物業估價署及水務署發出的賬單均印有快速支付系統「轉數快」的QR碼，以便公眾可透過支援的流動銀行應用程式或儲值支付工具電子錢包輕鬆掃描QR碼進行付款。金管局將繼續與各政府部門及公共機構合作，探索其他潛在應用場景，以方便公眾透過快速支付系統「轉數快」進行付款。\n\n為提高公眾對快速支付系統「轉數快」的認識，金管局已開發一系列新的教育及宣傳資料，例如用於電視及電台廣播的公眾利益公告，以及用於數碼平台的視頻和電子橫幅。金管局亦參與貿易博覽會，向中小企及企業推廣轉數快。多間參與轉數快的銀行及儲值支付工具亦推出了推廣活動，並提供優惠，以鼓勵客戶登記使用轉數快，並用作資金轉帳及繳費。\n\n此外，金管局聯同多個業界組織和機構，就快速支付系統「轉數快」提供簡介，以介紹其功能以及它可能為不同企業在收款和付款方面帶來的潛在效益。\n\n政府已採用快速支付系統「轉數快」用於繳付稅款、地稅及政府租金和水費。\n\n# 開放應用程式介面\n\n金管局繼續按照開放API框架的四階段方法，推動銀行體系發展及採用開放API。在第一階段，20間零售銀行於1月開放超過500個開放API接口，涵蓋銀行產品及服務的資訊。在第二階段，銀行於10月開放超過300個API，以支援銀行產品及服務的應用。\n\n# 研究與人才發展\n\n在貿易融資方面，一項關於連接貿易聯動及we.trade的概念驗證試驗已於年初完成。十一月，香港銀行同業結算有限公司旗下子公司與中國人民銀行（人民銀行）數字貨幣研究所簽訂諒解備忘錄，以進行一項概念驗證試驗，將貿易聯動與人民銀行貿易金融平台連接起來，為香港和中國內地的企業提供更便捷的貿易融資服務。\n\n關於央行數碼貨幣（央行數碼貨幣），金管局與泰國中央銀行啟動了名為Inthanon-LionRock的聯合研究項目，旨在研究央行數碼貨幣在跨境支付中的應用，並促進香港和泰國銀行之間的港幣和泰銖的外匯交易同步交收（外匯交易同步交收）。\n\n金管局助理總裁（金融基建）彭志豪先生（左側第一位），與中國人民銀行（人民銀行）數字貨幣研究所所長穆長春先生（右側第一位），共同見證香港貿易聯動與人民銀行貿易金融平台連結的試驗簽署儀式。諒解備忘錄由香港貿易融資平台有限公司總裁唐慧星女士（左側第二位）與中國人民銀行數字貨幣研究所副所長兼深圳金融科技研究院院長迪剛先生（右側第二位）簽署。\n\n在香港的人工智能（AI）方面，金管局進行了一項研究，探討人工智能技術在銀行業界的應用。十一月發表了全行業AI調查的重點發現，隨後於十二月發佈了題為「Reshaping Banking withArtificial Intelligence」的完整報告。\n\n報告《Reshaping Banking withArtificial Intelligence》於十二月發布。\n\n一份簡報文件已發布，重點突出從有關香港銀行業界使用人工智能的調查中得出的關鍵事實和數據。\n\n為擴大金融科技人才庫，金管局繼續與其戰略夥伴合作推行金融科技人才培育計劃升級版，以培育不同職業發展階段的年輕人才。去年有超過220名學生受惠於該計劃。\n"}
{"en":"# Reserves Management\n\nGlobal financial markets performed better than expected in 2019 as the effect of accommodative monetary policies from major central banks outweighed concerns about the global growth slowdown and US-China trade tensions. Global equity markets rebounded following a significant correction in the fourth quarter of 2018, while major government bond yields declined and bond prices went up. Under such a favourable environment, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$262.2 billion in 2019, representing an investment return of 6.6%.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The HKMA, under the delegated authority of the Financial Secretary (FS) and within the terms of the delegation, is responsible to the FS for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(a) to preserve capital;\n(b) to ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(c) to ensure that sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) subject to (a)–(c), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund.\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP). The BP holds highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under Currency Board arrangements. The IP invests primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of its assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA diversifies part of the Exchange Fund’s investments in a prudent and incremental manner into a wider variety of asset classes. This includes emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The cap for the market value of investments under the LTGP is set at the aggregate of one-third of the accumulated surplus of the Exchange Fund and the portion of the Future Fund and placements by subsidiaries of the Exchange Fund linked to the LTGP.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007, holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that have been acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes. This Portfolio is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of its unique nature.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by fiscal reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP, with the major exception of the Future Fund, which links its interest rate to both the IP and the LTGP with reference to the portfolio mix. As at the end of 2019, the portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 40:60.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation. The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents long-term asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark (or strategic) allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and tracking error limit are determined by the FS in consultation with the EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may assume positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nThe HKMA set up the Exchange Fund Investment Office (EFIO) in August 2018 to house its investment and related risk management functions. Staff members of the EFIO directly manage about 71% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, comprising the entire BP and part of the IP. This part of the IP includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 29% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes. The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to realise sustainable returns, draw on diverse and complementary investment styles, and gain their market insights and technical expertise in investment.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is determined primarily by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe growing complexity of the investment environment underlines the importance of risk management. Stringent controls and investment guidelines are in place for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and compliance with guidelines and regulations is closely monitored. As the investment environment has become more complex, risk assessment has been strengthened to support the Exchange Fund’s increased level of investment diversification. Risk-control tools are deployed to assess market risks under both normal and adverse market conditions. Detailed performance attribution analyses are also conducted to identify sources of performance, enabling the HKMA to assess how to make the best use of the investment skills of both internal and external managers.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nThe HKMA is supportive of responsible investment (RI) by weaving environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into the investment process for both public and private market investments of the Exchange Fund.\n\nIn terms of public market investments, the HKMA implements both process-related and investment-related measures. One process-related measure taken by the HKMA is the adoption of the Principles of Responsible Ownership (PRO) issued by the Securities and Futures Commission in 2016, which help investors determine how best to meet their ownership responsibilities in relation to their investments in Hong Kong-listed companies. In managing the Exchange Fund, the HKMA has developed internal guidelines on ESG factors covering the process of selection, appointment and monitoring of external fund managers. The appointed external fund managers for the HKMA’s Hong Kong equities and Mainland active equities portfolios are required to adhere to the pRO in managing the investments on a “comply-or-explain” basis, and external fund managers appointed to manage the HKMA’s portfolios in developed market equities need to adhere to internationally recognised ESG standards. Apart from externally managed funds, ESG factors are also incorporated into the credit risk analysis of the HKMA’s internally managed bond investment.\n\nAs for ESG investments in the public market, the HKMA has invested in green bonds since 2015 as one of the early investors in this market, and participates in the Managed Co-Lending Portfolio Programme, which is run by the International Finance Corporation with a focus on sustainable investments across emerging markets. Going forward, the HKMA will continue to grow its green bond portfolio by either direct investment or investing in green bond funds. The HKMA also plans to construct ESGthemed mandates in equities investment by adopting an ESG equities index as a benchmark for passive portfolios and engaging active equities managers who apply ESG factors in their investment decisions.\n\nWith respect to private market investments, the HKMA examines the ESG policies and practices of general partners as part of its due diligence process. In particular, ESG risk evaluation is conducted as a mandatory part of due diligence in all LTGP investments. For the LTGP, the HKMA invests in projects with sustainable features; for instance, the HKMA has invested in renewables since 2013 in direct and co-investments in the energy sector, as well as green buildings and warehouses with green and sustainable features in its real estate portfolio. Going forward, the HKMA will continue to source projects with sustainable features and include green accreditation as a predominant factor in real estate investment.\n\nThe HKMA will monitor the development of ESG standards closely and assess how these standards can be further integrated into its investment process. The process is facilitated by its collaboration with like-minded investors and relevant international organisations. In particular, being a signatory of the UN-supported principles for Responsible Investment, which is the world’s leading proponent of RI, the HKMA expects to participate in the formulation of ESG best practices and to motivate other investors in adopting RI. Besides, the HKMA is also a member of FCLTGlobal, a not-for-profit organisation that works to encourage a longer-term focus in business and investment decision-making through workshops and research studies. In 2019, the HKMA also became a supporter of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures.\n\nFor more details about the HKMA’s RI policy framework, see the Corporate Social Responsibility chapter.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2019\n\nDespite concerns about the global growth slowdown and US-China trade tensions, global financial markets performed well in 2019 on the back of accommodative monetary policies from major central banks. Following a significant correction in the fourth quarter of 2018, global equity markets rallied in 2019. In the bond markets, major government bond yields declined markedly while bond prices went up in the first three quarters of 2019 as a result of monetary easing. Although bond prices retreated in the fourth quarter amid a slight rebound in yields, the overall gains in the bond markets were still satisfactory in 2019.\n\nIn the currency markets, major currencies performed differently against the US dollar. After declining by 3.8% in the third quarter due to an escalation of US-China trade tensions, the renminbi recovered part of its earlier losses in the fourth quarter given easing trade tensions. Overall, the renminbi depreciated by 1.4% against the US dollar. While the pound fell by 3.2% in the third quarter due to the heightened risk of a no-deal Brexit, it had since rebounded significantly as more clarity on Brexit emerged in the fourth quarter, eventually gaining 4.0% against the US dollar.\n\nThe performances of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2019 are shown in Table 1.\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$262.2 billion in 2019. This comprised gains on bonds of HK$114.5 billion, gains on Hong Kong equities of HK$22.1 billion, gains on other equities of HK$100.7 billion, a negative currency translation effect of HK$13.0 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets, and gains of HK$37.9 billion on other investments held by the investment holding subsidiaries of the Fund. Separately, the Strategic portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$2.5 billion.\n\nThe total assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,206.7 billion at the year end. The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$335.1 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$233.4 billion and real estate at HK$101.7 billion. Outstanding investment commitments reached HK$219.3 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund in 2019, excluding the Strategic portfolio, was 6.6%. Specifically, the IP achieved a rate of return of 9.7%, while the Bp gained 2.5%. The LTGP has recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 12.6% since its inception in 2009.\n","terms":{"\"Capital preservation First, Long-Term Growth Next\"":["保本先行、長期增值"],"10 Years plus

儲備管理\n\n環球金融市場在2019年的表現好過預期，因為主要央行寬鬆貨幣政策的效果蓋過了對全球經濟增長放緩及美中貿易緊張局勢的擔憂。環球股市在2018年第四季經歷顯著修正後出現反彈，同時主要政府債券收益率下跌，債券價格上升。在這有利的環境下，外匯基金在2019年的投資收入達港元2622億元，投資回報率為6.6%。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n外匯基金的首要目標，如《外匯基金條例》所訂明，是影響港元匯價，無論是直接或間接的方式。基金亦可用以維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定和完整性，以協助香港保持國際金融中心的地位。金管局根據財政司司長的委任權限，並在委任範圍內，向財政司司長負責外匯基金的管理及投資。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標與組合架構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會（外匯基金諮詢委員會）已為外匯基金設定以下投資目標：\n\n(a) 以維護本金；\n(b) 確保貨幣基礎，隨時均由高流動性的美元資產完全備抵；\n(c) 確保有足夠的流動性，以維持貨幣及金融穩定；及\n(d) 考量 (a) 至 (c)，以達成一項投資回報，有助於維護基金長期購買力。\n\n這些目標充分考慮了外匯基金的法定目標，並已納入基金的組合架構及目標資產配置之中。\n\n廣義而言，外匯基金主要有兩個組合：支持組合（BP）及投資組合（IP）。支持組合持有高流動性的美元資產，以符合貨幣發行局制度的要求，為貨幣基礎提供充分支持。投資組合則主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債券及股票市場，以維持資產價值及長期購買力。\n\n為更佳地管理風險並提升中長期的回報，金管局以審慎及漸進的方式，將部分外匯基金的投資分散到更廣泛的資產類別。這包括新興巿場及內地債券和股票、私募股權（包括基建）以及房地產投資。新興巿場及內地債券和股票由投資組合持有，私募股權和房地產投資則由長期增長組合持有。長期增長組合的投資市值上限設定為外匯基金累計盈餘的三分之一，以及與長期增長組合相關的未來基金和外匯基金附屬公司的投資總額。\n\n策略性資產組合於二零零七年成立，持有香港交易及結算所有限公司股份，這些股份由政府代表外匯基金出資購入，以達致策略性目的。由於其獨特性質，此資產組合並未納入對基金投資表現的評估之中。\n\n#於外匯基金的存款\n\n外匯基金有時會接受財政儲備存款、政府資金及法定組織的存款。利率通常與投資組合的表現掛鉤，但未來基金為主要例外，其利率與投資組合及長期增長組合均掛鉤，並根據組合配置比例而定。截至2019年底，未來基金在投資組合與長期增長組合之間的組合配置比例約為40:60。\n\n# 投資過程\n\n外匯基金的投資過程是以兩種資產配置決策為基礎：策略性資產配置及戰略性資產配置。策略性資產配置反映在投資基準上，代表根據外匯基金的投資目標所作出的長期資產配置。在策略性配置的指導下，資產會進行戰略性配置，以期取得超越基準的回報。這意味著實際配置往往與基準（或策略性）配置有所不同。實際配置與基準配置之間的差異稱為「戰略性偏離」。雖然基準及循跡誤差上限是由財政司司長與外匯基金諮詢委員會磋商後確定，但戰略性決策及戰略性偏離的允許範圍則由金管局在授權下作出決定。在戰略性偏離的允許範圍內，投資組合經理可根據短期市場變動採取相應的投資立場。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局於二零一八年八月成立外匯基金投資辦公室（外匯基金投資辦公室），以集中其投資及相關風險管理職能。外匯基金投資辦公室的員工直接管理外匯基金約百分之七十一的投資，包括全部支持組合及部分投資組合。這部分投資組合包括投資於全球固定收益市場的一系列投資組合，以及實施宏觀風險管理策略的各種衍生工具覆疊投資組合。\n\n# 外聘投資經理的使用\n\n除了內部管理資產外，金管局還聘請外聘投資經理管理外匯基金約29%的資產，包括其所有上市股票組合及其他特別資產。聘請外聘投資經理的目的是利用市場上最佳的專業投資技術以實現可持續回報，借助多樣化且互補的投資方式，並獲得他們在市場洞察力和投資技術專長。\n\n與外聘投資經理相關的支出包括基金管理費和保管費、交易成本，以及預扣稅及其他稅項。這些支出主要由市場因素決定，並可能逐年波動。\n\n# 風險管理與合規\n\n投資環境日益複雜，凸顯風險管理的重要性。針對內部及外聘投資經理管理的投資組合，均已設有嚴格的監控措施及投資指引，並密切監察對指引及規則的遵守情況。隨著投資環境變得更加複雜，風險評估亦已加強，以支持外匯基金投資組合多元化程度的提升。風險管控工具被用來評估在正常及不利市場情況下的市場風險。同時亦進行詳細的投資表現因素分析，以識別表現來源，使金管局能夠評估如何最有效地運用內部及外聘投資經理的投資技能。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n金管局支持負責任投資，將環境、社會及管治(ESG)因素融入外匯基金的公開及私募市場投資流程。\n\n在公開市場投資方面，金管局實施了與程序及投資相關的措施。其中一項與程序相關的措施是金管局採用了證券及期貨事務監察委員會於2016年發佈的《負責任的擁有權原則》（pRO），協助投資者釐清如何最佳履行其對香港上市公司投資的擁有權責任。在外匯基金的管理方面，金管局已制定涵蓋外部基金經理選拔、委任及監察程序的ESG因素內部指引。金管局所委任的管理香港股票組合及中國股票主動投資管理組合的外部基金經理，在管理投資時需按照「遵守或解釋」的基礎遵循《負責任的擁有權原則》；而被委任管理金管局已發展市場股票組合的外部基金經理，則需遵守國際公認的ESG標準。除外部管理的基金外，ESG因素亦納入金管局內部管理的債券投資的信貸風險分析中。\n\n有關公眾市場的ESG投資，金管局自2015年起已投資綠色債券，為此市場的早期投資者之一，並參與由國際金融公司推行的聯合貸款組合管理計劃，專注於跨新興市場的可持續項目投資。展望未來，金管局將透過直接投資或投資綠色債券基金，持續擴大其綠色債券組合。金管局亦計劃建立ESG主題的股票投資策略，採用ESG股票指數作為被動投資組合的新基準，並聘請應用ESG因素於投資決策的股票投資經理。\n\n關於私募市場投資，金管局在其盡職調查過程中會審視專責合夥人的環境、社會及管治政策與實踐。特別是，在所有長期增長組合的投資中，ESG風險評估是盡職調查的必備環節。針對長期增長組合，金管局投資於具可持續性的項目；例如，自2013年起，金管局已透過直接及合作投資於可再生能源項目，以及在其房地產投資組合中投資具綠色及可持續特徵的綠色建築物及倉庫。展望未來，金管局將持續尋找具可持續性的項目，並在房地產投資中將綠色認證作為主要考量因素。\n\n金管局會密切關注環境、社會及管治標準的發展，並評估這些標準如何進一步融入其投資過程。此過程有賴於其與理念相近的投資者及相關國際組織的合作。特別是，作為聯合國支持的負責任投資原則的簽署機構，而該原則是全球負責任投資的領先倡導者，金管局預期會參與制定環境、社會及管治的最佳實踐，並鼓勵其他投資者採納負責任投資。此外，金管局亦是FCLTGlobal的成員，該組織是一個非營利機構，透過研討會及研究項目，致力於促進企業及投資決策中更長遠的觀點。2019年，金管局亦成為氣候相關財務資訊披露工作組的支持者。\n\n有關金管局的責任投資政策架構的更多細節，請參閱企業社會責任章節。\n\n# 外匯基金表現情況\n\n# 2019年的金融市場\n\n儘管存在對全球經濟增長放緩及美中貿易緊張局勢的擔憂，2019年環球金融市場在主要央行實施寬鬆貨幣政策的支持下表現良好。在2018年第四季度經歷顯著回調後，環球股市在2019年出現強勁反彈。在債券市場方面，主要政府債券收益率在2019年前三個季度顯著下降，債券價格則因貨幣寬鬆政策而上漲。儘管第四季度收益率小幅回升導致債券價格回調，但整體而言，2019年債券市場的表現仍令人滿意。\n\n在貨幣市場中，主要貨幣對美元的表現各不相同。由於美中貿易緊張局勢升級，人民幣在第三季下跌了3.8%，但在第四季隨著貿易緊張局勢緩和，人民幣收復了部分先前的跌幅。整體而言，人民幣對美元貶值了1.4%。雖然由於無協議脫歐風險升高，英鎊在第三季下跌了3.2%，但隨著第四季脫歐問題出現更多明朗化跡象，英鎊已大幅反彈，最終對美元升值了4.0%。\n\n2019年主要貨幣、債券及股票市場的表現如表1所示。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n外匯基金於2019年錄得投資收益262.2 港元。 其中，債券收益為114.5 港元，香港股票組合收益為22.1 港元，其他股票收益為100.7 港元，非港元資產的負匯兌換影響為13.0 港元，以及基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資收益為37.9 港元。 另外，策略性資產組合錄得升值收益2.5 港元。\n\n外匯基金的總資產於年底達至港元4,206.7億。長期增長組合下的投資市值總計為港元335.1億，其中私募股權為港元233.4億，房地產為港元101.7億。已承擔尚未提取作投資的總額達港元219.3億。\n\n外匯基金 2019 年的投資回報，不包括策略性資產組合，為 6.6%。 具體而言，投資組合 (Ip) 實現了 9.7% 的回報率，而支持組合 (Bp) 則增長了 2.5%。長期增長組合 (LTGp) 自 2009 年成立以來，已錄得 12.6% 的內部回報率年率。\n"}
{"en":"# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communication with the community and the market through the traditional media, social media platforms, its website, the Information Centre and various other channels to facilitate public understanding about its policies and operations. Within the institution, conscientious efforts are made to improve the HKMA’s corporate governance by supporting the professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline, enhancing information technology security, and promoting a culture of innovation to cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives and the increasing complexity of work.\n\n# ENGAGING THE COMMUNITY\n\n# Media relations and social media\n\nThe HKMA works closely with the media to enhance transparency and promote public understanding about its policies and work. During the year, 125 open press events were held, comprising 10 press conferences, 12 stand-up interviews and 103 other public functions. A further 25 media interviews were arranged. A total of 466 bilingual press releases were issued and a large number of media enquiries were handled every day.\n\nTo raise awareness of the HKMA’s key functions, the HKMA organised media briefings and educational workshops for local and overseas media as well as key opinion leaders in the community to facilitate understanding on a wide range of topics, such as the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), virtual banking, green finance, and Hong Kong as a competitive international financial centre.\n\nSince July 2018, the HKMA has launched various social media channels to strengthen public education and communication. Five social media channels are currently in operation: Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter and YouTube, reaching out to a total of over 45,000 followers as at end-December 2019. Amid the social incidents in the second half of 2019, the HKMA made use of social media to rebut unfounded rumours regarding banking operations and financial stability, a move which proved to be highly effective in disseminating facts and preventing the rumours from spreading further.\n\n# Public enquiries\n\nThe Public Enquiry Service provides an effective means for the public to better understand the key functions and operations of the HKMA. A total of 9,742 enquiries were handled in 2019, about half of which were related to banking policies and regulations, consumer banking, and notes and coins. Some of the notable enquiries raised were about the Coin Collection programme, banking products and services, banking-related guidelines and circulars, the Faster Payment System (FPS), and monetary and economic statistics.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received since 2016 and Chart 2 provides a breakdown by enquiry nature in 2019.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Eddie Yue, speaks at the Hong Kong Association of Banks Distinguished Speaker Luncheon.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Eddie Yue (left), and HKMA's then Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan, meet with media after the announcement of the appointment of Mr Eddie Yue as the next Chief Executive of the HKMA.\n\n# Publications\n\nApart from the HKMA Annual Report, in 2019 the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report, four issues of the Quarterly Bulletin, and regular updates of the Monthly Statistical Bulletin to provide up-to-date and thematic information and analyses on monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. In addition, the HKMA published 19 inSight articles, covering various topics related to its work. The inSight articles provide a useful channel for the HKMA to elucidate the rationale behind its major new initiatives or policies, and provide timely response to topical issues which are of interest to the public.\n\n# HKMA website\n\nThe HKMA official website (www.hkma.gov.hk) presents more than 40,000 pages of content in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, and is the public access gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It also contains the register of authorized institutions (AIs) and local representative offices and the register of the securities staff of AIs, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the register of stored value facility (SVF) licensees under the payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance. The HKMA official website underwent a major revamp and was relaunched in September with a new design layout, enriched content, an enhanced navigation structure, and more convenient search functions. The revamped website enables users to search information more easily and conveniently based on their own preferences. In particular, the revamped website carries a new section on “Smart Consumers”, where the public can find useful information and smart tips on a wide range of banking and related products or services. This is in line with the HKMA’s long-standing efforts to promote “smart and responsible” use of banking services.\n\nThe HKMA launches its revamped website.\n\nThe revamped HKMA website carries a new section on “Smart Consumers”.\n\nThe HKMA has been opening up financial data and important information published on its website via Open Application Programming Interface (Open API) by phases since 2018. By 2019, the HKMA has opened up 130 sets of Open ApIs on the HKMA’s website as originally planned. The HKMA embraces the development and application of Open API.\n\n# HKMA Information Centre\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre is an important resource introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters. It consists of an exhibition area and a library, and is open to the public six days a week. The exhibition area describes the HKMA’s work and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong. It also contains reading materials and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nThe HKMA completed the last phase of revamp of its Information Centre — the Historical Timeline — during the year. The revamped Historical Timeline, featuring multimedia and digital display panels for visitors to review the major monetary and financial events in Hong Kong and globally in a more interactive manner, was re-opened to the public in October.\n\nThe first section of the Historical Timeline is made up of a multimedia display panel presenting major events from 1842 to 1993.\n\nThe second section of the Historical Timeline is a digital display panel presenting major events from 1993, when the HKMA was established, to the present.\n\nThe Information Centre organises guided tours for visitors. During the year, it received more than 48,000 visitors and hosted over 480 guided tours for schools and other groups (Chart 3). More than 753,000 people have visited the Information Centre since it opened in December 2003.\n\nGuided tours of the Information Centre are organised for schools and other group visitors.\n\nThe library, situated next to the exhibition area, houses more than 26,000 books, journals and other publications for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs and central banking topics. It also maintains the register of AIs and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\n# Public and consumer education\n\nTo reach out to the community and raise public awareness of the HKMA’s work, the HKMA organised a public education seminar for over 400 secondary school students and teachers in 2019. Topics covered in the seminar included an introduction to the work of the HKMA, Hong Kong’s banknotes, the FPS, SVFs, fintech and the Deposit Protection Scheme. More than 60,000 teachers and students have participated in this programme since its launch in 1998.\n\nStudents and teachers from secondary schools in different districts attend the 2019 public education seminar.\n\nThe focus of the HKMA’s consumer education initiatives during the year was on educating the public to protect their “personal digital keys”, a concept introduced to help the public visualise the significance of safeguarding information for accessing their online accounts. The central message was that in the digital world, account login details and personal information related to internet banking and other digital financial services were as important as the keys to their home, and should be well protected. Extensive promotion was arranged across different media, including the TV, radio, mobile applications, social media, and other digital and out-of-home platforms, to highlight smart tips on how to protect personal digital keys.\n\nThe Flagship Campaign on Personal Digital Keys is conducted via extensive cross-media promotion.\n\nSustained initiatives were also carried out to educate the public to be smart and responsible financial consumers. For example, members of the public were urged to stay vigilant of bogus phone calls purportedly from banks, and of investment scams promoted on social media. Issues to note when handling personal credit products, in particular personal loans taken out during the tax season, were also promoted.\n\nTo enhance financial literacy among secondary school students, the HKMA co-organised the “Hong Kong Liberal Studies Financial Literacy Championship” with various stakeholders for the fifth year. Infographics were newly used in the Championship this year to help students better understand sophisticated financial concepts. An online quiz was conducted, attracting 10,450 submissions and culminating in the grand final competition, which was held at the HKMA for the first time. \n\nThe Championship, attracting over 10,000 online submissions, ends with a live competition at the HKMA.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA kicked off the Second phase of its Cross-generation Outreach Educational programme, which was organised jointly with an education institution. The programme comprised bank simulation games, parents’ talks and train-the-trainer workshops, targeting kindergarten pupils, their parents and teachers, as well as young adults. Other initiatives on youth education included producing comic storybooks for primary school students and parents jointly with a professional association, as well as delivering talks to tertiary school students.\n\nThe HKMA continued to support the Investor and Financial Education Council in promoting financial literacy and capacity in Hong Kong, and will explore further collaboration with different stakeholders to maximise the impact of consumer education.\n\nThe Achievement Ceremony for the First Phase of the Crossgeneration Outreach Programme is held alongside the launch of the Second Phase.\n\nKindergarten pupils participate in the bank simulation game.\n\nComic storybooks are produced jointly with a professional association to disseminate smart tips on using banking and financial services to primary school students and their parents.\n\n# OUR PEOPLE\n\nWhile the HKMA is an integral part of the Government, it employs staff on terms different from those of the civil service to attract people with the right experience and expertise. The HKMA recruits, develops and maintains a highly professional workforce to support its policy objectives and respond flexibly to changing work priorities.\n\nThe establishment of the HKMA in 2019 was 1,005. During the year, the HKMA conducted a cross-departmental re-engineering exercise to enhance the efficiency of various work processes and redeploy existing resources to support new initiatives. As a result of this rigorous exercise, the overall establishment of the HKMA in 2020 remains unchanged at 1,005. Resources have been redeployed to undertake the following new tasks:\n\n# Banking and Financial Stability\n- Develop and implement a supervisory regime for virtual banks and cope with the increasingly complex prudential supervision standards\n- Enhance supervisory capacity for the new regulatory regime for insurance intermediaries\n- Step up ongoing monitoring of banks’ culture reform, and conduct ongoing supervision of banks and other relevant entities providing trust services\n\n# Reserves Management\n- Strengthen investment and risk management and other necessary support for the further expansion and diversification of the Exchange Fund’s investment activities\n\n# Hong Kong as an International Financial Centre\n- Support reforms that enhance the international competitiveness of Hong Kong’s tax regime regarding different financial services sectors\n- Enhance the daily qualitative market surveillance and analyses of Trade Repository data\n\nTable 1 gives a breakdown of the establishment and strength of the HKMA.\n\n# Remuneration policies and pay review mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary (FS) determines the pay and conditions of service for HKMA staff on the advice of the Governance Sub-Committee (GSC) through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC), taking into account the prevailing market rates and practices. Remuneration comprises a total cash package and a provident fund scheme, with minimal benefits in kind. the cash package consists of monthly fixed pay (or basic pay) and variable pay that may be awarded to individual staff members as a lump sum once a year, depending on performance.\n\nPay for HKMA staff is reviewed annually by the FS in the light of recommendations made to him by the GSC through the eFAC, taking into account the GSC’s assessment of the performance of the HKMA in the preceding year, the pay-survey findings of the financial sector conducted by independent human resources consultants, and any other relevant factors. Special pay adjustments may be made from time to time to reward individual meritorious staff members and to maintain the competitiveness of their pay.\n","terms":{"\"Capital preservation First,

機構職能\n\n金管局透過傳統媒體、社交媒體平台、其網站、資訊中心及各種其他渠道，與社區及市場保持有效溝通，以促進公眾對其政策及運作的了解。在機構內部，致力改善金管局的企業管治，包括支持員工專業發展、建立嚴謹的財政制度、加強資訊科技保安，以及推動創新文化，以應對新措施實施及工作日益複雜所帶來的挑戰。\n\n# 聯繫社區\n\n# 傳媒關係與社交媒體\n\n金管局與傳媒緊密合作，以提升透明度並促進公眾對其政策及工作的理解。年內共舉辦125場公開新聞活動，包括10場新聞發佈會、12場即席訪問及103場其他公開活動。此外，還安排了25場媒體訪問。全年共發佈466份雙語新聞稿，並每日處理大量媒體查詢。\n\n為提高各界對金管局主要職能的認識，金管局舉辦了針對本地及海外傳媒以及社區意見領袖的簡報會和教育研討會，以促進他們對多項主題的了解，例如聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）、虛擬銀行、綠色金融，以及香港作為具競爭力的國際金融中心的地位。\n\n自二零一八年七月起，金管局已推出多個社交媒體渠道，以加強公眾教育和溝通。目前共有五個社交媒體渠道在運作：Facebook、Instagram、LinkedIn、Twitter及YouTube，截至二零一九年十二月尾，已覆蓋超過四萬五千名關注者。在二零一九年下半年社會事件期間，金管局利用社交媒體闢謠，澄清有關銀行營運及金融穩定的不實傳聞，此舉在傳播事實及阻止謠言進一步散播方面效果顯著。\n\n# 公眾問詢\n\n公眾查詢服務為公眾提供了一個有效途徑，以更了解金管局的主要職能和運作。二零一九年共處理了九千七百四十二項查詢，其中約一半與銀行業政策及規例、銀行消費者事宜以及紙幣和硬幣有關。部分顯著的查詢內容包括硬幣收集計劃、銀行產品及服務、銀行業相關指引及通告、快速支付系統「轉數快」、以及貨幣與經濟數據。\n\n圖1顯示自2016年起收到的公眾查詢數量，而圖2則提供2019年按查詢類型的分類說明。\n\n金管局行政總裁余偉文出席香港銀行公會卓越人士講座暨午餐會發言。\n\n金管局總裁余偉文（左）與金管局前總裁陳家強，於宣布余偉文獲委任為下任金管局總裁後與傳媒會面。\n\n# 出版品\n\n除了《金管局年報》外，金管局於2019年共發布了兩期《貨幣與金融穩定情況半年度報告》、四期《季報》以及定期更新的《金融數據月報》，以提供香港貨幣、銀行及經濟議題的最新及主題性資訊和分析。此外，金管局還發布了19篇《匯思文章》，涵蓋與其工作相關的各項議題。這些《匯思文章》為金管局闡述其主要新規劃或政策背後的理由，並及時回應公眾關注的時事議題，提供了一個有用的途徑。\n\n# 金管局網站\n\n金管局官方網站（www.hkma.gov.hk）提供超過四萬頁的英文、繁體中文和簡體中文內容，是公眾獲取有關金管局最新資訊的主要入口。 該網站亦載有根據《銀行業條例》第20條規定維持的認可機構及本地代表辦事處的登記冊，以及根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》維持的儲值支付工具持牌人的登記冊，還有認可機構證券業務員工的登記冊。 金管局官方網站最近進行了重大翻新，並於九月重新推出，採用全新設計佈局、更豐富的內容、更完善的導航結構以及更便捷的搜尋功能。 翻新的網站讓用戶可以更輕鬆、更方便地根據個人喜好搜尋資訊。 特別是，翻新的網站增加了一個「智醒消費者」專區，公眾可以在其中找到有關廣泛的銀行及相關產品或服務的有用資訊和實用提示。 這符合金管局一直以來致力推廣「明智和負責任」使用銀行服務的努力。\n\n金管局推出全新網站。\n\n金管局網站推出全新版面，設有「智醒消費者」專區。\n\n金管局自2018年起分階段透過開放應用程式介面（開放API）開放其網站上發布的金融數據及重要資訊。至2019年，金管局已按原計劃在其網站上開放了130組開放API。金管局積極推動開放API的發展與應用。\n\n# 金管局資訊中心\n\n位於國際金融中心2期55樓的金管局資訊中心是向公眾介紹金管局工作及推廣貨幣與銀行業事宜知識的重要資源。中心設有展覽區及圖書館，並於週一至週六開放公眾使用。展覽區介紹金管局的工作以及香港貨幣及銀行業的發展情況，亦提供有關香港貨幣、銀行及金融事務的參考資料及展品，供公眾研究之用。\n\n金管局在年內完成了其資訊中心——歷史長廊的最後一期翻新工程。翻新的歷史長廊，設有互動式多媒體及數位顯示屏，讓遊客能以更互動的方式回顧香港及全球的主要貨幣及金融事件，並於十月重新開放予公眾。\n\n歷史長廊的第一部分由多元展板組成，展示1842年至1993年的重大事件。\n\n歷史長廊的第二部分是一個電子展板，展示了自一九九三年金管局成立至今的重大事件。\n\n資訊中心為遊客安排導覽行程。在過去一年，中心接待了超過四萬八千名遊客，並為學校和其他團體舉辦了超過四百八十個導覽行程（圖表三）。自二零零三年十二月開幕以來，已有超過七十五萬三千人次參觀資訊中心。\n\n資訊中心為學校及其他團體訪客安排導覽服務。\n\n圖書館位於展覽區旁，藏有超過二萬六千本書籍、期刊及其他出版物，供研究香港貨幣、銀行業和金融事務以及中央銀行議題之用。它亦根據《銀行業條例》第20條的規定，保存認可機構及其本地代表辦事處的登記冊，以及認可機構證券業務員工的登記冊。\n\n#公眾與消費者教育\n\n為向社會宣傳及提高公眾對金管局工作的認識，金管局於2019年舉辦了一場公眾教育研討會，邀請了超過400名中學生及教師參加。研討會涵蓋的主題包括金管局的工作介紹、香港的紙幣、快速支付系統「轉數快」、儲值支付工具、金融科技及存款保障計劃。自1998年推出以來，已有超過六萬名教師和學生參與了此計劃。\n\n來自不同地區中學的學生和老師參加了2019年的公共教育研討會。\n\n金管局本年度消費者教育的重點，是教育公眾保護其「個人數碼鎖匙」，這個概念旨在幫助大家了解保護登入網上帳戶的資訊的重要性。核心訊息是，在數碼世界中，與「網上銀行」及其他數碼金融服務相關的帳戶登錄資料和個人資料，猶如家中的鑰匙般重要，務必妥善保護。為此，金管局透過電視、電台、手機應用程式、社交媒體及其他數碼和戶外平台進行廣泛宣傳，重點介紹保護「個人數碼鎖匙」的竅門。\n\n個人數碼鎖匙的大型推廣計劃透過廣泛的跨媒體宣傳進行推廣。\n\n亦持續推行各項措施，以教育大眾成為精明且負責任的金融消費者。例如，呼籲民眾提高警覺，提防冒充銀行來電的詐騙電話，以及在社交媒體上推廣的投資詐騙。同時也宣導處理個人信貸產品時應注意的事項，特別是在報稅期間申請的個人貸款。\n\n為提升中學生的金融知識，金管局與各相關機構連續第五年合辦「全港通識理財問答比賽」。今年比賽首次引入資訊圖表，以幫助學生更易理解複雜的金融概念。賽事同時舉行網上測驗，吸引逾10,450人次參與，最終於金管局首次舉行決賽。\n\n賽事吸引了超過一萬份線上投稿，最終將在金管局舉行現場競賽。\n\n在年內，金管局啟動了其童心親親理財學堂的第二階段，與一間教育機構合辦。此計劃包括模擬銀行遊戲、家長講座和教師專業培訓工作坊，目標對象為幼稚園學童、他們的家長和老師，以及年輕成人。其他關於青少年教育的舉措包括與一間專業機構合作，為小學學生和家長製作漫畫故事書，以及向大專院校學生進行講座。\n\n金管局繼續支持投資者及理財教育委員會推動香港的金融知識及理財能力，並會與不同持份者進一步合作，以加強消費者教育的成效。\n\n跨代傳承計劃第一階段成果典禮與第二階段啟動禮同時舉行。\n\n幼稚園學童參與銀行模擬遊戲。\n\n漫畫故事書由與專業協會合作製作，旨在向小學生及其家長普及使用銀行和金融服務的實用技巧。\n\n# 我們的員工\n\n雖然金管局是政府的重要組成部分，但其僱用員工的條件與公務員制度不同，以吸引具備適當經驗和專業知識的人才。金管局透過招募、培訓及維持一支高度專業化的員工隊伍，以支持其政策目標，並靈活應對不斷變化的工作重點。\n\n二零一九年金管局的編制為一千零五人。當年，金管局推行跨部門流程再造計劃，以提升各工作流程的效率，並重新配置現有資源以支援新舉措。由於此嚴謹的計劃，金管局二零二零年的總體編制維持不變，仍為一千零五人。現有資源已重新配置，以執行以下新任務：\n\n# 銀行業與金融穩定  \n- 研發並實施針對虛擬銀行的監管制度，以應對日益複雜的審慎監管標準  \n- 提升對保險中介機構新監管制度的監管能力  \n- 加強對銀行文化改革的持續監管，並對銀行及其他提供信託服務的相關機構進行持續監管\n\n# 儲備管理\n- 加強投資及風險管理，以及為外匯基金投資活動的進一步擴張和多元化提供其他必要支持。\n\n# 香港作為國際金融中心\n- 支持改革以提升香港稅務安排在不同金融服務範疇的國際競爭力。\n- 加強日常質性市場監察，以及對交易資料儲存庫數據的分析。\n\n表一列出了金管局的設立和規模。\n\n# 薪酬政策與薪資審核機制\n\n財政司司長根據管治委員會的建議，透過外匯基金諮詢委員會決定金管局員工的薪酬及服務條件，並會考慮現行市場薪酬水平及慣例。薪酬包括現金總額及公積金，實物福利極少。現金總額包括每月固定薪金（或基本薪金）及可能根據表現，每年以一次過形式授予個別員工的變動薪金。\n\n金管局員工薪酬每年由財政司司長根據管治委員會透過外匯基金諮詢委員會提出的建議進行審閱，並考慮管治委員會對金管局上一年度表現的評估、獨立人力資源顧問機構針對金融界進行的薪酬調查結果，以及其他相關因素。為嘉勵表現卓越的個別員工，並維持其薪酬的競爭力，可不時作出特別薪酬調整。\n"}
{"en":"# Corporate Social Responsibility\n\nThe HKMA is committed to fulfilling its corporate social responsibility, and aims to be a responsible and sustainable organisation. This commitment is manifested in various areas, including promoting a sustainable and environment-friendly marketplace, supporting the wider community, protecting the environment and nurturing a caring workplace.\n\n# MARKETPLACE\n\n# Green and sustainable banking\n\nClimate change is one of the major risks threatening the well-being of mankind and the sustainability of the world economy. The financial sector in which banks operate, being an integral part of the society, will also be impacted and hence should be more proactive in managing climate risks. The HKMA is committed to exploring ways to address this challenge. Against this background, the HKMA unveiled in May a number of measures for promoting the development of green finance in Hong Kong, including the adoption of a three-phased approach to promote green and sustainable banking.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nAs the investment manager of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA believes that the concept of responsible investment (RI) is highly relevant to its investment work. As the HKMA is one of the world’s largest asset owners, it will have a major impact on how fund managers pick assets.\n\n# Our Beliefs\n\nThe HKMA sees RI as an investment approach that takes into account the impact of various environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors on long-term investment returns and their sustainability. The HKMA believes that, by putting an appropriate emphasis on RI and sustainable long-term economic performance, it can better achieve the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund and reduce risks associated with the ESG-related matters of its underlying investments.\n\n# Our Principles\n\nThe HKMA’s guiding principle is that priority will generally be given to ESG investments if the long-term risk-adjusted return is comparable with other investments. Where appropriate, the HKMA adopts in its investment process the following RI principles that underpin its beliefs as a responsible long-term investor:\n\n# Integration\n\nThe HKMA incorporates ESG factors into its investment analysis processes to identify risks and opportunities, as it believes that these factors can materially affect the long-term value of its investments. Specifically, the HKMA has been integrating ESG factors into its investment process for both public and private market investments. For public market investments, the HKMA incorporates ESG factors in its credit risk analysis of bond investment. External managers that share the HKMA’s RI beliefs are selected and appointed. The HKMA communicates its RI beliefs to all its external managers and expects them to align in such a way that the overall sustainable long-term economic performance target is attainable. For private market investments, the ESG policies and practices of the HKMA’s general partners are examined as part of its due diligence process.\n\n# Active ownership\n\nThe HKMA exercises shareholder rights in its public equity holding in a manner that helps safeguard the long-term value of its investments. The HKMA believes that responsible corporate behaviour guided by ESG factors will help create shareholder value in the long term. The HKMA’s asset managers are expected to help the HKMA discharge its ownership responsibilities in the underlying investments by adopting active ownership through exercising voting rights and engaging with the corporates concerned.\n\n# Collaboration\n\nThe HKMA seeks to join hands with like-minded investors and regulators to promote good practices for the long-term management of investments. It participates in and speaks at public events to share views and encourage the investment community to adopt RI.\n\nSee the Reserves Management chapter for more details about the HKMA’s work on RI during the year.\n\n# Promoting financial inclusion\n\nThe HKMA attaches great importance to financial inclusion and has been making significant effort in promoting access to basic banking services by different segments of the society to meet the basic daily needs of the general public and the operational needs of legitimate businesses. In particular, the HKMA has been working closely with the banking industry on the following priority areas:\n\n- Encouraging banks to launch more physical banking facilities and develop digital and innovative channels for the delivery of basic banking services to serve the general public, particularly residents of remote areas and public housing estates, and the elderly;\n\n- Facilitating and monitoring the accessibility of bank accounts to individuals and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs);\n\n- Enhancing the accessibility of banking services to specific customer groups, for example, customers with disabilities and ethnic minorities;\n\n- Facilitating and monitoring the accessibility of bank credit to SMEs; and\n\n- Granting authorization to eight virtual banks, which will play an active role in promoting financial inclusion in delivering their banking services.\n\n# COMMUNITY\n\n# Promoting financial literacy\n\nThe HKMA promotes financial literacy through various channels. Apart from running educational programmes to promote smart and responsible use of banking and financial services by the public, the HKMA features on its revamped official website a new dedicated section on “Smart Consumers”, where the public can find useful information and smart tips on a wide range of banking and related products and services. Social media platforms such as Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube, Instagram and Twitter are used in addition to the HKMA official website and publications to provide up-to-date information on banking and financial affairs.\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre, serving as the HKMA’s major public education and research resource since 2003, introduces the work of the HKMA to the community and promotes public awareness of monetary and banking matters. Educational guided tours are offered daily for group visitors from schools and non-profit making organisations. public education seminars and other activities are also organised for students to enhance their financial knowledge and literacy. In addition, the HKMA works closely with the Investor and Financial Education Council to promote financial literacy in Hong Kong via its financial education platform, The Chin Family.\n\nSee the Corporate Functions chapter for more details about the HKMA’s work on promoting financial literacy during the year. See the Banking Stability chapter for more details about the HKMA’s work on promoting financial inclusion during the year.\n\n# Addressing the needs of special groups \n\n# Accessibility of Hong Kong banknotes\n\nThe 2018 Series of Banknotes retains accessibility features used in the previous series of banknotes to help the visually impaired differentiate between the denominations. These accessibility features include Braille, tactile lines and high-tactility numerals.\n\nTo help the visually impaired differentiate between the denomination of the banknotes, a mobile app, sponsored by the HKMA and developed by the Hong Kong Society for the Blind, uses the phone’s camera to scan the banknote patterns for the denomination. The app is available for download from Apple App Store and Google play Store for free. A note-measuring template sponsored by the HKMA and the three note-issuing banks has also been introduced to measure the length of the note. It can measure both the 2018 Series and the notes currently in circulation. The template is embossed with Braille on one side and symbols on the other. It is freely distributed at voluntary agencies serving the visually impaired community.\n\n# Coin Collection Programme\n\nUnder the Coin Collection programme, the HKMA collaborates with the Hong Kong Council of Social Service to deploy the Coin Carts to collect coins on flag days for non-governmental organisations.\n\n# Accessibility of public information\n\nThe revamped HKMA official website was launched in September. The revamped website has enhanced navigation structure to facilitate easy and convenient search by users based on their own preferences. In particular, the website contains a dedicated webpage “Information in Other Languages” under the “Smart Consumers” section, which provides useful information on banking services in seven languages commonly used by the ethnic minority community, namely Bahasa Indonesia, Hindi, Nepali, Punjabi, Tagalog, Thai and Urdu.\n\nThe HKMA is committed to ensuring that its website conforms to the maximum extent possible to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 Level AA standard, to facilitate barrier-free access to its online information by people with special needs.\n\n# volunteer and charitable activities\n\nThe HKMA supports community services by taking part in volunteer and charitable activities. The Senior Citizen Home Safety Association awarded the Community Engagement Crystal Award to the HKMA for participating in the 2018 Love & Peace of Mind Corporate Engagement Programme.\n\nCharitable events participated in by the HKMA Volunteer Team in 2019\n\n“Yo! Let’s Walk the Road” by the Youth Outreach.\n\nArtists and representatives from the social enterprise, Arts with the Disabled Association Hong Kong, visit the HKMA office, where its artworks are displayed.\n\nHKMA staff members take part actively in Blood Donation Day, Territory-Wide Flag Day, Community Chest’s Green Day, Love Teeth Day, Skip Lunch Day, Dress Casual Day and regular campaigns that collect clothes, toys and other reusable items for donation to charities.\n\nHKMA staff members take part actively in Blood Donation Day, organised by the Hong Kong Red Cross.\n\n# Caring organisation\n\nIn recognition of its commitment to care for the community, the HKMA was accredited with the “10 Years Plus Caring Organisation Logo” by the Hong Kong Council of Social Service for the 13th consecutive year.\n\n# ENVIRONMENT\n\n# Green office measures\n\nThe HKMA has an established environmental policy to protect and preserve the environment. The policy and implementation measures are promulgated among its staff regularly. Green office measures include:\n\n# Paper\/Photocopying\/Printing\n\n- Encouraging the use of recycled paper and envelopes;\nDistributing electronic copies instead of hard copies of documents;\n- printing on both sides of the paper;\n- Using colour printing and copying only when necessary;\n- Avoiding the use of paper cups; and \n- Using environmentally friendly paper and ink for the HKMA’s Annual Report.\n\n# Electricity\n\n- Switching off PCs, printers, lights, audio-visual systems and other electrical appliances when these devices are not in use. Reactivating the preset power-saving mode installed in most equipment, such as water dispensers, electric punching machines and shredders, after use outside their preset operating hours; and \n- Reviewing regularly the need for additional air-conditioning beyond normal business hours.\n\n# Recycling\n\n- Making good use of recycled bins to collect different categories of waste, including paper, cans, bottles, batteries, CDs and ink cartridges.\n\n# WORKPLACE\n\n# Diversity and inclusion\n\n# Equal Opportunities Policy\n\nThe HKMA is an equal opportunities employer. It believes that everyone should be able to work in an environment free of discrimination, harassment, vilification and victimisation. The equal opportunities policy applies to job advertisements, recruitment, terms and conditions of employment, performance assessment, promotion, transfer, training, dismissal, grievance procedures and general conduct.\n\n# Key statistics on diversity\n\npeople are central to the work of the HKMA. We value the diversity of our workforce, which has a balanced gender representation and a spectrum of different age groups.\n\nFemale representation at the senior management levels, that is, Executive Director and above, made up 31% as of February 2020.\n\n# Human capital key statistics on 1 January 2020\n\n# Quality workplace\n\nTo cater for projected operational needs, the HKMA renovated the offices during the year to create an open layout, increase capacity and allow for more efficient use of space. Breakout areas and ergonomic furniture are part of the new office design. To enhance the staff’s physical health, height-adjustable desks were offered to staff members, allowing them to change their postures easily throughout the day between sitting and standing.\n\nHeight-adjustable desks improve office ergonomics.\n\n# Staff well-being\n\nThe HKMA promotes work-life balance and cares about the health and work safety of the staff. Regular talks on healthy lifestyles, stress management and workplace safety are organised and indoor air quality is monitored. Annual on-site medical check-ups and flu vaccinations are arranged. The HKMA also sponsors a professional counselling service comprising experienced psychologists and social workers.\n\nThroughout the year, different activities are organised to enhance the staff’s physical wellness, promote their sense of belonging, and foster co-operation and team spirit. Interest classes are held for staff members and their families. Inter-organisational and cross-divisional activities such as basketball and football competitions with fellow regulators provide opportunities to socialise.\n","terms":{"\"Capital preservation First,

企業社會責任\n\n金管局致力履行其企業社會責任，並力求成為負責任及可持續發展的機構。這項承諾體現在多個方面，包括推動可持續及環保的市場，支持更廣泛的社區，保護環境以及營造關懷的工作環境。\n\n# 市場\n\n# 綠色與永續的銀行業\n\n氣候變遷是威脅人類福祉及世界經濟可持續發展的主要風險之一。銀行從事的金融業作為社會的重要組成部分，亦將受到影響，因此應更積極地管理氣候風險。金管局致力於探討應對此挑戰的方法。基於此背景，金管局於五月份公布了一系列促進香港綠色金融發展的措施，包括採用三階段方法推動綠色及可持續銀行業的發展。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n作為外匯基金的投資管理機構，金管局認為負責任投資（RI）的概念與其投資工作高度相關。由於金管局是全球最大的資產擁有者之一，其對基金經理配置資產的方式將產生重大影響。\n\n# 金管局的信念\n\n金管局認為責任投資是一種投資方式，它考慮了各種環境、社會及管治(ESG)因素對長期投資回報及其可持續性的影響。金管局相信，透過適當重視責任投資及可持續的長遠經濟表現，可以更好地實現外匯基金的投資目標，並降低其相關投資與ESG相關的風險。\n\n# 金管局的原則\n\n金管局的指導原則是，若長期經風險調整後的收益與其他投資相若，則一般會優先考慮ESG投資。在適當的情況下，金管局在其投資過程中會採用以下負責任投資原則，這些原則體現了其作為負責任長期投資者的信念：\n\n# 整合\n\n金管局將環境、社會及管治因素納入其投資分析程序，以識別風險和機會，因為金管局認為這些因素會對其投資的長期價值產生重大影響。具體而言，金管局已將環境、社會及管治因素整合到公開市場投資和私募市場投資的投資過程中。對於公開市場投資，金管局在其債券的信用風險分析中納入環境、社會及管治因素。會選擇和委任與金管局RI信念相符的外聘投資經理。金管局向其所有外聘投資經理傳達其RI信念，並期望他們能夠在某種程度上與金管局保持一致，以實現整體可持續的長期經濟表現目標。對於私募市場投資，金管局會審查其專責合夥人的環境、社會及管治政策和實務，作為其盡職調查程序的一部分。\n\n# 主動行使資產擁有權\n\n金管局在上市公司股票上主動行使股東權利，以協助維護其投資的長期利益。金管局認為，以ESG因素引導的責任企業行為將有助於從長遠來看創造股東的長期利益。金管局的經理預期將協助金管局在相關投資中履行其資產擁有權責任，透過行使投票權及與相關企業溝通，實踐主動行使資產擁有權。\n\n# 合作\n\n金管局希望與志同道合的投資者及監管機構攜手合作，推動投資長期管理的良好實踐。金管局參與並在公開活動上發言，分享觀點，鼓勵投資界採用責任投資（RI）。\n\n請參閱儲備管理一章，以了解金管局今年在利率影響方面的具體工作。\n\n# 推動普及金融\n\n金管局非常重視普及金融，並一直致力於推動不同社會群體接觸基本銀行服務，以滿足大眾的日常基本需求及合規企業的運作需要。特別是在以下優先領域，金管局與銀行業界緊密合作：\n\n鼓勵銀行推出更多實體銀行服務設施，並發展數碼及創新渠道以提供基本銀行服務，以服務廣大公眾，特別是遠郊地區及公共屋邨居民，以及長者；\n\n促進並監控個人及中小企開設銀行帳戶的便利性。\n\n- 提升特定客户群体（例如残障人士和少数民族）获取银行服务的便利性；\n\n促進並監控中小企業取得銀行貸款的便利性；以及\n\n授予八家虛擬銀行授權，它們將在推廣普及金融方面發揮積極作用，提供銀行服務。\n\n# 社區\n\n# 推廣金融知識\n\n金管局透過多種渠道推廣金融知識。除了舉辦教育項目，鼓勵公眾明智且負責任地使用銀行及金融服務外，金管局在其重新設計的官方網站上設有全新專區「智醒消費者」，公眾可以在此找到關於銀行及相關產品和服務的實用資訊和貼士。除了金管局官方網站及刊物外，還利用Facebook、LinkedIn、YouTube、Instagram及Twitter等社交媒體平台，提供銀行及金融事務的最新資訊。\n\n自2003年起，金管局資訊中心作為金管局的主要公眾教育及研究資源，向社區介紹金管局的工作，並促進公眾對貨幣與銀行業事宜的認識。中心每日為來自學校及非牟利機構的團體提供導覽服務。此外，亦會為學生舉辦公眾教育講座及其他活動，以提升其金融知識及金融素養。金管局亦與投資者及理財教育委員會緊密合作，透過理財教育平台「錢家有道」在香港推廣金融知識。\n\n如欲了解更多關於金管局在本年度推動金融知識的資料，請參閱機構職能一章。如欲了解更多關於金管局在本年度推動普及金融的資料，請參閱銀行體系穩定一章。\n\n# 關注特殊群體的需求\n\n# 香港鈔票的無障礙設施\n\n2018鈔票系列保留了前一版鈔票所使用的輔助功能，以協助視障人士區分鈔票面額。這些輔助功能包括點字、手感線及凹凸銀碼。\n\n為協助視障人士識別紙幣面額，一款由金管局贊助、香港盲人輔導會開發的手機應用程式，利用手機鏡頭掃描紙幣圖案以識別面額。此應用程式可從 Apple App Store 及 Google Play Store

{"en":"# The Exchange Fund\n\n- Report of the Director of Audit\n- Exchange Fund Financial Statements\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 187 to 293, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2019, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2019, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards. My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report. I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2019. These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.5, 2.6 and 38.1 to the financial statements.\n\nAs at 31 December 2019, the Group had financial assets totalling HK$3,874,223 million and financial liabilities totalling HK$1,158,686 million valued at fair value.\n\nFor 91% of these financial assets and all these financial liabilities, their fair values were quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 inputs) or were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data (Level 2 inputs).\n\nFor the remaining 9% of these financial assets, their fair values were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data (Level 3 inputs). Such financial assets totalled HK$338,758 million, including mainly unlisted investment funds.\n\nGiven the substantial amount and the estimations involved, valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value was a key audit matter.\n\nThe audit procedures on valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value included:\n\n- obtaining an understanding of the procedures, including relevant controls, for valuing different categories of financial assets and financial liabilities;\n\n- evaluating and testing the controls, including relevant application controls of the computer systems;\n\n- obtaining external confirmations on the valuation, existence, rights and obligations and completeness of the financial assets and financial liabilities;\n\n- where quoted market prices were used, verifying the prices to independent sources;\n\n- where valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions, and verifying the inputs to independent sources; and\n\n- where valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Valuation of investment properties at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.11, 18 and 19 to the financial statements.\n\nThe Group’s investment properties were stated at their fair values, totalling HK$22,481 million as at 31 December 2019. The Group also had interests in twenty two joint ventures totalling HK$44,506 million, whose principal activities were holding overseas investment properties. The fair values of these investment properties, whether held by the Group directly or by joint ventures, were mainly determined based on valuations by independent professional valuers. Such valuations involved significant judgments and estimates, including the valuation methodologies and the assumptions used.\n\nThe audit procedures on valuation of investment properties at fair value included:\n\n- obtaining and reviewing the valuation reports of investment properties held by the Group directly or by joint ventures, and verifying that the fair values were based on the valuations stated in the valuation reports;\n\n- assessing the independence and qualifications of the valuers; and\n\n- evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises all the information included in the 2019 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICpA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. I also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nJohn Chu\nDirector of

觀點\n\n我證明我已審計外匯基金及其附屬機構（「集團」）的財務報表，載於第187至293頁，該財務報表包括外匯基金及集團截至2019年12月31日的資產負債表，以及其收支帳目、全面收益表、權益變動表、現金流量表，以及有關財務報表附註，包括重要會計政策的摘要。\n\n依我之見，財務報表真實且公允地反映基金及集團截至2019年12月31日之財務狀況，以及該會計年度之財務表現及現金流量，並已根據香港會計師公會（「香港會計師公會」）頒佈之香港財務報告準則（「香港財務報告準則」）編製，並已根據《外匯基金條例》（第66章）第7條所頒佈之行政長官指示適當編製。\n\n# 意見的依據\n\n我根據香港特別行政區行政長官根據《外匯基金條例》第7條所發出的指示及審計署的審計準則進行審計。根據這些準則，我的職責已在我的報告中「財務報表審計的會計師職責」一節中進一步說明。我根據這些準則保持獨立於集團，並已按照這些準則履行其他倫理責任。我相信我所取得的審計憑證足夠且適當，足以作為我意見的基礎。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項係指根據我的專業判斷，在截至2019年12月31日止年度財務報表審計過程中最具重要性之事項。這些事項係在審計財務報表整體的過程中處理，並在形成我的審計意見時予以考慮，我並未就這些事項提供獨立意見。\n\n# 金融資產及金融負債按公平值計價\n\n請參閱財務報表的附註 2.5、2.6 及 38.1。\n\n於二零一九年十二月三十一日，集團的金融資產總額為港元三千八百七十四億二千二百萬，金融負債總額為港元一千一百五十八億六千八百六十萬，並以公平值估值。\n\n對於這些金融資產的91%以及所有這些金融負債，其公允價值為活躍市場中相同資產或負債的報價（第一層輸入值），或透過基於可觀察市場數據的估值方法進行估算（第二層輸入值）。\n\n其餘9%的這些金融資產，其公允價值是透過估值方法估算，而這些方法所使用的輸入值並非基於可觀察市場數據（第三層輸入值）。此類金融資產總值為港元3387.58億，主要包括非上市投資基金。\n\n鑒於數量龐大且牽涉到估計，以公平值評估金融資產和金融負債是關鍵審計事項。\n\n對按公平值計量的金融資產和金融負債進行評估的審計程序包括：\n\n了解用於評估不同類別金融資產和金融負債的程序，包括相關監控措施；\n\n評估和測試監控措施，包括電腦系統的相關應用程式監控措施；\n\n取得有關金融資產及金融負債之評價、存在性、權利與義務及完整性之函證；\n\n當採用報價的市場價格時，需將價格與獨立來源進行核對；\n\n- 在使用以可觀察市場數據為基礎的估值方法時，評估估值方法的適當性及假設的合理性，並核對輸入資料是否來自獨立來源；\n\n在採用非以可觀察市場數據為基礎的估值方法時，評估估值方法的適當性以及假設和輸入數據的合理性。\n\n# 投資物業按公平值計價\n\n請參閱財務報表的附註 2.11、18 及 19。\n\n集團的投資物業按其公允價值列賬，於二零一九年十二月三十一日達港元二萬二千四百八十一萬港元。集團亦於二十二家合營公司中擁有權益，總額為港元四萬四千五百零六萬港元，其主要業務為持有海外投資物業。 這些投資物業的公允價值，無論是由集團直接持有或由合營公司持有，主要根據獨立專業估值師的估值確定。 該等估值涉及重大的判斷和估計，包括估值方法和所用假設。\n\n對按公平值評估的投資物業進行估值的審計程序包括：\n\n取得及審閱集團或合營公司持有的投資物業的估值報告，並核實公允價值乃基於估值報告中所列的估值。\n\n評估估價師的獨立性及資格；以及\n\n評估估值方法的適當性及假設及輸入資料的合理性。\n\n# 其他資訊\n\n金融管理專員負責其他資訊。其他資訊包括香港金融管理專員2019年年度報告中所載的所有資訊，除財務報表及我的審計師報告外。\n\n我對財務報表的意見並不涵蓋其他資訊，我亦不會就該等資訊表達任何形式的保證結論。\n\n就我對財務報表的審計而言，我的責任是閱讀其他資訊，並評估其是否與財務報表或我在審計中獲得的知識存在重大不一致，或是否存在重大錯誤陳述。若根據我所執行的工作，我認為此資訊存在重大錯誤陳述，我將報告此事實。目前，我沒有任何需要報告的事項。\n\n# 金融管理專員與外匯基金諮詢委員會審核委員會就財務報表的職責\n\n金融管理專員須根據香港會計師公會頒佈的香港財務報告準則，以及行政長官根據《外匯基金條例》第7條作出的指示，編製真實及公允的財務報表，並建立金融管理專員認為必要以確保財務報表免受重大錯誤陳述影響的內部控制機制，不論該等錯誤陳述是因欺詐還是錯誤所致。\n\n在編製財務報表時，金融管理專員須評估集團持續經營的能力，並根據適用情況披露與持續經營相關的事項，以及採用持續經營為基礎的會計方法。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會審核委員會負責監督集團的財務報告流程。\n\n# 审計師對財務報表審計的責任\n\n我的目標是取得合理保證，以確認財務報表整體是否不存在重大錯誤陳述，無論是因舞弊或錯誤所致，並出具包含我意見的審計師報告。合理保證是一種高水平的保證，但並不能保證根據審計署的審計準則進行的審計始終能發現存在的重大錯誤陳述。錯誤陳述可能源自舞弊或錯誤，若個別或合計起來，可能合理預期會影響使用者基於這些財務報表所作出的經濟決策，則視為重大錯誤陳述。\n\n作為遵循審計署的審計準則的審計工作的一部分，我會運用專業判斷，並在整個審計過程中保持專業懷疑態度。我同時也會：\n\n識別及評估財務報表重大錯誤陳述的風險，不論是由於舞弊或錯誤所致，設計及執行對應於這些風險的審計程序，並獲取足夠及適當的審計憑證，作為我發表意見的基礎。因舞弊導致的重大錯誤陳述未被發現的風險，高於因錯誤導致的風險，因為舞弊可能涉及串謀、偽造、故意遺漏、虛假陳述或凌駕於內部控制之上；\n\n取得與審計相關的內部控制了解，以設計適應情況的審計程序，但並非用以就集團內部控制有效性發表意見；\n\n評估金融管理專員所採用會計政策的適當性及所作出會計估計及相關披露的合理性。\n\n對金融管理專員採用持續經營基礎的會計處理是否恰當作出結論，並根據取得的審計憑證，判斷是否存在與可能對集團持續經營能力產生重大懷疑的事件或情況相關的重大不確定性。若我認為存在重大不確定性，則必須在審計師報告中引起注意財務報表中相關的披露內容，若該等披露不充分，則需修改我的意見。我的結論基於截至審計師報告日期所取得的審計憑證。然而，未來的事件或情況可能會導致集團無法持續經營；\n\n評估財務報表的整體呈報、結構及內容，包括披露事項，並確認財務報表是否以達到公正呈報的方式反映其底層交易及事項；並取得足夠且適當的審計憑證，以對集團內各實體或業務活動的財務資訊發表意見。我負責集團審計的指揮、監督及執行，我對我的審計意見負有完全責任。\n\n我與外匯基金諮詢委員會的審核委員會就審計的計劃範圍和時間安排，以及重要的審計發現（包括我在審計過程中發現的任何重大的內部控制缺陷）等事項進行溝通。\n\n我亦向外匯基金諮詢委員會的審核委員會提供一份聲明，確認我已遵守有關獨立性的相關道德要求，並向他們通報所有可能合理地被認為影響我獨立性的關係及其他事項，以及在適用情況下，相關的保障措施。\n\n根據與外匯基金諮詢委員會審核委員會溝通的事項，我確定本期財務報表審計中具有最重大意義的事項，因此這些即為關鍵審計事項。除非法律或法規禁止公開披露有關事項，或在極為罕見的情況下，我認為披露該事項的不利後果合理預期會超過此類披露所帶來的公共利益好處，否則我會在審計師報告中說明這些事項。\n\n朱約翰\n審計署署長\n\n審計署\n26樓\n入境大廈\n7 Gloucester Road\n灣仔，香港\n\n2020年4月3日\n"}

{"zh":"# 總裁報告\n\n2016年的全球政經舞台上「黑天鵝」身影頻仍，英國脫歐公投和美國總統大選結果固然令各種民調淪為笑柄，但更出乎意料的卻是金融市場的反應。以美國大選為例，特朗普當選消息令美股三大指數的期貨在開市前急挫，但開市不久美股指數隨即反彈，此後凱歌高奏，屢創新高。連串事件，凸顯了傳統智慧和思維對預測市場能力的局限性，也標誌着未來環球局勢發展的重大不確定性。\n\n過去一年，多項主要金融數據都反映市場情緒異常敏感：美國十年期國庫債券收益率在7月跌至1.36厘歷史低位後，在美國總統大選後的12月中旬飆升至2.6厘。反映美元兌一籃子貨幣走勢的美匯指數在年底升至14年高位；紐約原油期貨價格由年初每桶26美元低位反彈至年底的54美元。本港股市方面，恒生指數全年微升86點，但期內峰谷差逾6,000點。外圍形勢驚濤駭浪，更形金融體系尤其是貨幣和銀行體系穩定的重要和可貴。\n\n2016年1月，國際對沖基金部署狙擊人民幣和港元的傳言甚囂塵上，人心虛怯。金管局迅即向市場發放明確、堅定的訊息，我們絕對有信心、有能力捍衛聯匯制度和香港的金融體系穩定，適時穩住了市場信心。綜觀2016年全年，港元長時間貼近強方兌換保證。由於銀行體系資金非常充裕，即使去年12月和今年3月美國聯儲局加息，對港元利率和匯率並未有明顯的即時影響。\n\n香港銀行體系繼續穩步發展，去年整體貸款錄得6.5%溫和增長，資產質素保持良好，不良貸款比率維持在0.85%的健康水平，遠低於2000年以來約2%的長期平均水平。銀行體系的資本充足率和流動性比率均保持在高於法定要求的高水平。在樓宇按揭業務方面，經過七輪逆周期措施，新造住宅物業按揭平均成數從2009年9月的64%下降至2016年底的51%，平均供款與入息比率也從2010年8月的41%下降至2016年底的34%，為樓市周期一旦逆轉而令銀行體系受到衝擊時，提供了所需的緩衝。金管局會繼續密切留意樓市的發展，因應周期變化而採取合適措施，以保持銀行體系穩定。\n\n進一步強化銀行體系穩定的立法工作去年取得令人鼓舞的進展。優化存款保障制度和針對金融機構「大得不能倒」風險的兩條法例，及時在上屆立法會任期屆滿前順利通過。前者加快存款保障金的發放速度，簡化發放程序，有助加強存戶對銀行體系的信心；後者則為包括銀行在內的金融機構建立處置機制，防範這些機構一旦倒閉而引發的系統性金融風險，並盡量避免動用公帑為它們「包底埋單」。金管局已在今年4月1日設立處置機制辦公室，落實執行法例的要求和跟進工作。\n\n銀行業素有「百業之母」之稱，是實體經濟和普羅市民日常生活倚重的儲蓄、支付渠道和信貸來源。年內，部分中小企業界代表反映融資有困難。金管局即時與銀行界溝通，希望銀行在維持審慎風險管理的情況下，盡可能為中小企的營運和發展繼續提供資金支援。我們又透過轄下香港按揭證券公司，加強向工商界推廣政府的「中小企融資擔保計劃」，並與銀行業界緊密溝通，以釋除疑慮、釐清誤解及理順處理壞帳的索償程序，從而提高銀行參與該計劃的意願。多管齊下，收到了一定成效，根據金管局對銀行進行的調查，中小企整體信貸額度在去年保持平穩，超過九成企業的信貸額度得以維持甚至增加。同時，「中小企融資擔保計劃」的申請數字亦明顯上升。\n\n近年來金管局大力推動普及金融，就是考慮到基本銀行服務已是營商和日常生活不可或缺的環節。去年當我們得知有些海外公司和初創企業在香港開戶遇到困難後，旋即展開跟進工作，與多個國際商會和企業協會聯繫，並跟銀行業界深入溝通，對症下藥。去年9月我向香港所有銀行簽發通告，闡釋應如何理解金管局針對反洗錢和恐怖分子資金籌集活動的「風險為本」監管原則，如何將這項原則應用在開戶申請和對現有客戶的盡職審查措施上，強調銀行不應對所有客戶採用「一刀切」的要求和程序。經我們與銀行和商界協商後，企業開戶情況有所改善，但仍有進步空間，這也是我們今年工作重點之一。\n\n普及金融還涉及銀行分行服務的覆蓋面。金管局一直鼓勵銀行在營商圖利之餘，也要顧及市民的基本銀行服務需要。金融科技一日千里，銀行提供服務的渠道也更趨多元化。除了日益普及的網上銀行服務外，去年多家銀行紛紛推出流動銀行車或視像櫃員機服務，提供較傳統櫃員機更貼身、更全面的銀行服務。在我們的推動下，多家銀行也計劃在偏遠地區設立實體分行，加強對當區居民的服務。\n\n金融中心的發展就如逆水行舟，因此，金管局多年來不斷為香港金融業發展尋求新的契機，開拓新的領域。2016年可說是成果豐碩的一年，當中又以金融科技(Fintech)和基建融資為亮點。\n\n在金融科技方面，香港的零售支付服務在2016年進入新時代。金管局去年發出13個儲值支付工具牌照，通過發牌和恒常監管制度為零售支付服務創造有利的營商環境，配以一系列公眾教育宣傳，讓消費者在享受新科技帶來的便捷之餘，權益也得到合理保障。\n\n此外，去年3月金管局成立了金融科技促進辦公室，以此平台推動與銀行業相關的金融科技發展。幾個月間，我們推出多項新猷，包括「網絡防衛計劃」(Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative)，為強化銀行體系網絡安全建立風險評估、資訊共享和人才培訓三足鼎立的新平台。我們並與香港應用科技研究院（應科院）合作，開展分布式分類帳技術(distributed ledger technology)專項研究，探討該技術在香港銀行業應用的可行性，並在應科院設立金融科技創新中心(Fintech Innovation Hub)，為銀行業界和金融科技界提供技術支援。金管局的銀行監管部門還設立「金融科技監管沙盒」(Fintech Supervisory Sandbox)，讓銀行在較小和可控範圍內測試新技術的應用，為新產品、新服務的開發提速。自去年9月至今年3月，已有6家銀行共14項新技術項目使用沙盒進行測試，部分項目亦已相繼推出市場，為市民帶來更多金融科技的新產品。\n\n世界各地對基建融資的需求巨大，特別是「一帶一路」倡議提出以來，基建融資更成中外矚目的議題。香港是亞洲的國際金融中心，在基建融資領域極具優勢。去年7月金管局成立了基建融資促進辦公室(Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office，簡稱IFFO)，搭建一個嶄新和獨特的平台，匯聚60多家世界級的多邊機構、機構投資者、銀行、保險公司和其他金融機構、基建項目的建設和營運方、各類專業機構等，就基建投融資課題互通訊息、交流經驗、尋求合作機會。IFFO成立至今已舉辦十多場大型會議、研討會和工作坊，金管局並分別與國際金融公司(International Finance Corporation)、全球基礎設施中心(Global Infrastructure Hub)、國家開發銀行(China Development Bank)和中國進出口銀行(The Export-Import Bank of China)簽署了共同促進基建投融資活動的《諒解備忘錄》。起步時間雖然不長，但為香港未來作為基建投融資中心奠下堅實的基礎。\n\n拆牆鬆綁是提升競爭力的不二法門。年內，金管局積極參與和支援特區政府修訂稅務條例，向在港經營集團內部財資業務的企業提供有利的稅務環境。我們並積極接觸跨國企業，吸引它們來港發展或擴充企業財資活動，藉此進一步強化香港金融市場的功能。\n\n去年的離岸人民幣市場處於調整期。受市場波動和對人民幣匯率預期等因素影響，全球離岸人民幣資金池規模普遍收縮。儘管如此，香港仍穩執離岸人民幣業務的牛耳，保持全球最大的人民幣資金池，經香港結算的人民幣維持在日均約8,600億元人民幣高位。為進一步優化香港離岸人民幣市場的流動性安排，去年10月我們將一級流動性提供行由7家增至9家，支援雙邊流動資金的總額度由原來的140億元人民幣增至180億元，確保在離岸人民幣市場資金出現緊絀的情況下，仍可保持市場有序運作。去年12月股票市場「深港通」開通，令香港的人民幣業務再添動力。金管局亦正與內地有關當局研究「債券通」方案，進一步便利兩地投資者參與債券市場，並優化債券市場基礎設施的聯繫。\n\n儘管去年全球投資環境充斥着各種不穩因素，但有賴於過去一段時間所採取的多項防禦性部署，外匯基金去年錄得681億港元投資收入。自1994年以來外匯基金的複合年度投資回報率達4.8%，高於同期2.1%的本地通脹率。\n\n外匯基金將繼續推動多元化投資，包括進一步擴展資產類別，加大對於信貸資產、抵禦通脹類投資產品和新興市場的投資。而作為多元化投資旗艦的「長期增長組合」，透過私募股權和房地產項目等投資於另類資產。該組合自2009年啟動以來一直保持不俗的成績，成立至今的平均內部回報率年率約12%，而隨着政府「未來基金」部分投放於該組合，我們加快了投資步伐，去年底「長期增長組合」的資產規模約1,818億港元，已批出但未提取作投資的總額約1,338億港元。外匯基金將繼續恪守「保本先行、長期增值」的投資策略，在保持充裕的流動性和備用資金的前提下，尋求長遠穩定的回報。\n","terms":{"10年Plus同心展關懷標誌":["10

referendum in the UK and the unexpected results of the US presidential election rendered various polls laughable, what was even more surprising was the reaction of financial markets. Taking the US election as an example, news of Donald Trump's election victory caused a sharp decline in the futures of the three major US stock indices before the market opened. However, shortly after the market opened, the stock indices quickly rebounded and subsequently continued to rise, repeatedly setting new highs. This series of events highlighted the limitations of traditional wisdom and thinking in predicting market behavior, and also signaled the significant uncertainties in the future development of the global situation.\n\nOver the past year, several key financial data points have reflected unusually sensitive market sentiment: the yield on U.S. ten-year Treasury bonds fell to a historic low of 1.36% in July, then surged to 2.6% in mid-December after the U.S. presidential election. The U.S. Dollar Index, which reflects the trend of the dollar against a basket of currencies, rose to a 14-year high at year-end; New York crude oil futures prices rebounded from a low of $26 per barrel at the beginning of the year to $54 per barrel by year-end. As for the Hong Kong stock market, the Hang Seng Index rose slightly by 86 points throughout the year, but the difference between its peak and trough exceeded 6,000 points. The turbulent external situation further highlights the importance and value of stability within the financial system, particularly the monetary and banking systems.\n\nIn January 2016, rumors of international hedge funds targeting the Renminbi and Hong Kong dollar spread widely, causing public anxiety. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority swiftly issued clear and firm messages to the market, emphasizing our absolute confidence and capability in defending the linked exchange rate system and the stability of Hong Kong’s financial system, thereby stabilizing market confidence in a timely manner. Throughout 2016, the Hong Kong dollar remained closely aligned with the strong-side exchange rate guarantee for an extended period. Due to ample liquidity in the banking system, even the U.S. Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes in December 2015 and March 2016 had no significant immediate impact on the Hong Kong dollar’s interest rates or exchange rate.\n\nThe Hong Kong banking system continues to develop steadily. Overall loans recorded a modest growth of 6.5% last year, with asset quality remaining strong. The non-performing loan ratio remained at a healthy level of 0.85%, far below the long-term average of about 2% since 2000. The banking system's capital adequacy ratio and liquidity ratio both remained at high levels above regulatory requirements. In the property mortgage sector, following seven rounds of countercyclical measures, the average loan-to-value ratio for new residential mortgages fell from 64% in September 2009 to 51% by the end of 2016. The average debt-to-income ratio also decreased from 41% in August 2010 to 34% by the end of 2016, providing the necessary buffer should the property market cycle reverse and impact the banking system. The HKMA will continue to closely monitor the property market's development and take appropriate measures in response to cyclical changes to maintain the stability of the banking system.\n\nLegislative efforts to further strengthen the stability of the banking system made encouraging progress last year. Two pieces of legislation aimed at optimizing the deposit protection system and addressing the risks posed by \"too big to fail\" financial institutions were smoothly passed before the end of the previous Legislative Council term. The first measure accelerates the disbursement of deposit protection funds and simplifies the process, helping to enhance depositors' confidence in the banking system. The second establishes a resolution mechanism for financial institutions, including banks, to prevent systemic financial risks that could arise from their failure, and to minimize the need for public funds to bail them out. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has already established a Resolution Mechanism Office on April 1st of this year to implement the requirements of the legislation and oversee related follow-up work.\n\nThe banking industry is often referred to as the \"mother of all industries,\" serving as a crucial channel for savings, payments, and credit for the real economy and the general public. This year, some representatives from the small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) sector reported difficulties in obtaining financing. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) immediately communicated with the banking sector, encouraging banks to continue providing financial support for the operations and development of SMEs while maintaining prudent risk management. We also used our subsidiary, the Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation, to actively promote the government's \"SME Financing Guarantee Scheme\" to the business community, and maintained close communication with the banking sector to dispel concerns, clarify misunderstandings, and streamline the claims process for bad debts, thereby increasing banks' willingness to participate in the scheme. Through these combined efforts, some positive results have been achieved. According to the HKMA's survey of banks, the overall credit facilities extended to SMEs remained stable last year, with over 90% of businesses maintaining or even increasing their credit limits. At the same time, the number of applications for the \"SME Financing Guarantee Scheme\" has also risen significantly.\n\nIn recent years, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has vigorously promoted financial inclusion, recognizing that basic banking services have become indispensable for business operations and daily life. Last year, when we learned that some overseas companies and startups faced difficulties in opening accounts in Hong Kong, we immediately initiated follow-up actions, contacting multiple international chambers of commerce and business associations, and engaging in in-depth communication with the banking sector to address the issues. In September last year, I issued a notice to all banks in Hong Kong, explaining how to understand the HKMA's \"risk-based\" regulatory approach to anti-money laundering and terrorist financing activities, how to apply this principle to account opening applications and due diligence measures for existing customers, and emphasizing that banks should not apply a one-size-fits-all approach to all customers. After consultations with banks and the business community, the situation regarding corporate account openings has improved somewhat, but there is still room for improvement, which is also one of our key priorities this year.\n\nFinancial inclusion also involves the coverage of bank branch services. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has consistently encouraged banks, while pursuing commercial profits, to also consider the basic banking service needs of the public. With rapid advancements in fintech, the channels through which banks provide services have become increasingly diversified. In addition to the growing popularity of online banking services, several banks launched mobile banking units or video ATMs last year, offering more personalized and comprehensive banking services than traditional ATMs. Under our initiative, multiple banks have also planned to establish physical branches in remote areas to enhance services for local residents.\n\nThe development of a financial center is like rowing a boat against the current; therefore, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has continuously sought new opportunities and explored new areas for the development of Hong Kong's financial industry over the years. 2016 can be considered a year of fruitful results, with financial technology (Fintech) and infrastructure financing as highlights.\n\nIn the field of financial technology, Hong Kong's retail payment services entered a new era in 2016. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued 13 stored value payment tool licenses last year, creating a favorable business environment for retail payment services through licensing and regular regulatory mechanisms. Combined with a series of public education and promotional campaigns, consumers can enjoy the convenience brought by new technologies while their rights are properly protected.\n\n此外，去年3月金管局成立了金融科技促進辦公室，以此平台推動與銀行業相關的金融科技發展。幾個月間，我們推出多項新猷，包括「網絡防衛計劃」(Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative)，為強化銀行體系網絡安全建立風險評估、資訊共享和人才培訓的強大基礎。我們並與香港應用科技研究院（AStRI）合作，開展分布式分類帳技術專項研究，探討該技術在香港銀行業應用的可行性，並在AStRI設立金融科技創新中心，為銀行業界和金融科技界提供技術支援。金管局的銀行監管部門還設立「金融科技監管沙盒」(FSS)，讓銀行在較小和可控範圍內測試新技術的應用，為新產品、新服務的開發提速。自去年9月至今年3月，已有6家銀行共14項新技術項目使用沙盒進行測試，部分項目亦已相繼推出市場，為市民帶來更多金融科技的新產品。\n\nThe global demand for infrastructure financing is immense, especially since the launch of the Belt and Road Initiative, which has made infrastructure financing a focal point of international attention. As Asia's international financial center, Hong Kong holds significant advantages in the infrastructure financing sector. In July last year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority established the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO), creating a novel and unique platform that brings together over 60 world-class multilateral institutions, asset owners, banks, insurance companies, other financial institutions, infrastructure project developers and operators, and various professional organizations to exchange information, share experiences, and explore collaboration opportunities on infrastructure investment and financing issues. Since its establishment, IFFO has organized more than a dozen large conferences, seminars, and workshops. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has also signed Memorandums of understanding with the International Finance Corporation, the Global Infrastructure Hub, the China Development Bank, and the Export-Import Bank of China to jointly promote infrastructure investment and financing activities. Although IFFO has only been in operation for a short period, it has laid a solid foundation for Hong Kong's future role as a hub for infrastructure financing.\n\nDismantling barriers and easing restrictions is the surest way to enhance competitiveness. This year, the Monetary Authority actively participated in and supported the government in revising tax regulations, providing favorable tax environments for enterprises operating group treasury activities in Hong Kong. We have also actively engaged with multinational corporations to attract them to develop or expand their treasury operations in Hong Kong, thereby further strengthening the functions of Hong Kong's financial market.\n\nThe offshore RMB market was in a period of adjustment last year. Influenced by market volatility and expectations regarding the RMB exchange rate, the size of global offshore RMB funds pools generally contracted. Nevertheless, Hong Kong maintained its leading position in offshore RMB business, sustaining the world's largest RMB funds pool, with RMB settled through Hong Kong averaging approximately 860 billion yuan per day. To further optimize liquidity arrangements in Hong Kong's offshore RMB market, in October last year we increased the number of primary liquidity providers from seven to nine, raising the total quota for bilateral liquidity support from 14 billion yuan to 18 billion yuan, ensuring the market can continue to operate smoothly even during liquidity shortages. In December last year, the \"Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect\" was launched, providing further impetus to Hong Kong's RMB business. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is also working with relevant mainland authorities to study the \"Bond Connect\" initiative, aiming to further facilitate participation of investors from both sides in the bond market and enhance the connectivity of bond market infrastructure.\n\nDespite the global investment environment being fraught with various unstable factors last year, the Exchange Fund recorded HK$68.1 billion in investment income, thanks to a series of defensive measures taken over the past period. Since 1994, the Fund's compound annual investment return rate has reached 4.8%, surpassing the local inflation rate of 2.1% during the same period.\n\nThe Foreign Exchange Fund will continue to promote diversified investments, including further expanding asset classes and increasing investments in credit assets, inflation-protected investment products, and emerging markets. As the flagship of diversified investments, the \"long-term growth portfolio\" invests in alternative assets such as private equity and real estate projects. Since its launch in 2009, the portfolio has consistently delivered strong performance, with an average annual internal rate of return of approximately 12% over its lifetime. With part of the government's \"Future Fund\" allocated to this portfolio, we have accelerated our investment pace. As of the end of last year, the asset size of the \"long-term growth portfolio\" was approximately HK$181.8 billion, with total approved but undrawn funds for investment amounting to approximately HK$133.8 billion. The Foreign Exchange Fund will continue to adhere to the investment strategy of \"Capital preservation first, long-term growth next,\" seeking long-term stable returns while maintaining ample liquidity and contingency reserves.\n"}

Throughout the year, the local stock market and residential property market have fluctuated, with housing affordability remaining tight.\n\nDespite increased global market risks and shocks, the Hong Kong banking system remains stable. Bank capital and liquidity conditions remain good; asset quality has slightly deteriorated but remains at a healthy level.\n\n# Currency Stability\n\nDespite facing a volatile external environment, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate has remained stable, reflecting the ability of the currency board system to withstand external shocks.\n\nThe money market continued to operate smoothly, with ample interbank liquidity. In December, following the Federal Reserve's decision to raise the federal funds rate target range, Hong Kong's benchmark interest rate was increased by 25 basis points to 1.00 percent.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA has strengthened the risk management framework of banks, as well as credit, liquidity, and technology risk management. The HKMA has also taken specific actions to promote financial inclusion and address the difficulties businesses face in opening and maintaining bank accounts in Hong Kong.\n\nIn terms of regulatory policy, significant progress has been made in Hong Kong's preparations to implement international regulatory and accounting standards, including the resolution framework under the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance.\n\n# Hong Kong's Status as an International Financial Center\n\nHong Kong maintains its position as a global offshore RMB business hub and asset management center. The tax system has been further improved, creating a more favorable environment to attract multinational corporations to establish corporate treasury centers in Hong Kong.\n\nTo develop Hong Kong into an infrastructure financing center and a fintech hub, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) established the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office and the Fintech Facilitation Office. The HKMA has successfully implemented the regulatory framework for stored value payment instruments and retail payment systems, and has issued 13 licenses for stored value payment instruments.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\nDespite the challenging investment environment, which was rife with black swan events, the foreign exchange fund achieved an overall investment return of 2%, thanks to a series of defensive measures implemented over the past few years that enhanced its resilience.\n\nThe Monetary Authority is accelerating the pace of diversified investments, particularly those in long-term growth portfolios.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) maintains effective communication with the public and the market through the media, public education activities, and various other channels, enhancing public understanding of the HKMA’s policies and operations.\n\nThe Monetary Authority continues to strengthen institutional governance, including promoting staff professional development, strictly controlling finances, and enhancing information technology security, in order to address the challenges posed by the implementation of new measures and increasingly demanding workloads.\n"}

概覽\n\n香港經濟增長在2016年放緩，實質本地生產總值增長由2015年的2.4%降至1.9%（表1）。淨出口是主要拖累，當中訪港旅遊業疲弱令服務輸出受壓（圖1）。本地需求動力亦放緩，但繼續為整體經濟增長提供主要支持。勞工市場大致保持穩定，失業率維持於3.3至3.4%的低位。由於本地成本及外部價格壓力減退，消費物價通脹進一步放緩。面對波動的外圍環境及多變的市場氣氛，資產市場增添起伏。鑑於住宅物業市場再度暢旺，政府於11月實施新印花稅措施。\n\n儘管外圍環境波動及美元利率上升，本港外匯及貨幣市場繼續運作暢順。港元現貨匯率於1月份略為轉弱後一直在7.75附近水平徘徊。年內兌換保證並無被觸發，總結餘與未償還外匯基金票據及債券合計幾乎維持不變，約為1.2萬億港元。繼美國於12月中加息後，金管局基本利率由0.75厘上調至1厘。香港銀行同業拆息及較長期債券收益率維持在相對較低水平，但在接近年底時稍升，部分反映美元相應拆息及收益率的走勢。整體銀行貸款增長在2016年加快至6.5%。雖然整體貸款質素略為轉差，但特定分類貸款比率仍然維持在極低水平。\n\n圖 1 組成部分對實質本地生產總值增長的貢獻\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n表 1 按開支項目計的實質本地生產總值增長（比對上期）\n\n註：本地固定資本形成總額經季節因素調整的按季增減幅度不詳。\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 本地需求\n\n本地需求的增長力度在2016年略為減弱。儘管穩定的就業及收入狀況繼續為私人消費帶來支持，但其增速仍降至1.6%，部分反映經濟不明朗因素加劇。政府消費增長亦略為減慢至3.3%。本地固定資本形成總額繼續按季大幅上落（圖2），累計全年收縮0.5%。私營部門機器及設備購置成為主要拖累，在營商前景欠佳下連續第3年收縮，而樓宇及建造活動則因住屋動工項目增加而轉殷。\n\n圖 2 本地需求\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 外部需求\n\n香港出口在接近2016年底時有回穩跡象，但綜合全年表現仍然乏力（圖3）。貨品出口較2015年的低基數上升1.7%。香港對先進經濟體的出口仍然呆滯；但在區內貿易流動轉趨穩定下，香港對中國內地、印度、韓國、新加坡及台灣的出口則較2015年好轉。\n\n部分反映零售銷售在近年急速增長後轉趨正常化，香港服務輸出在2016年顯著收縮3.1%。貨品進口在2015年收縮後於2016年收復部分失地，服務輸入則部分受惠於本地居民外遊意欲而持續增長。2016年整體貿易順差收窄，拖累本地經濟增長。\n\n圖 3 貨品出口及服務輸出\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 通脹\n\n通脹壓力在2016年仍然受控。剔除政府一次性紓緩措施的影響後，基本通脹率由2015年的2.5%下降至2016年的2.3%（圖4）。在早前新訂私人住宅租金下調所帶來的傳遞效應下，綜合消費物價指數中的租金組成項目通脹回落。受惠於全球商品價格偏軟及港元強勢，進口價格通脹受到遏抑。另一方面，在勞工成本穩定增長及租金成本壓力（尤其零售範疇）有所紓緩下，本地成本壓力保持溫和。\n\n圖 4 基本消費物價通脹\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 勞工市場\n\n勞工市場在2016年大致保持穩定，勞工供求升幅相若。按行業分析，旅遊相關行業的勞工市場狀況轉差，其他行業則大致平穩。整體而言，經季節因素調整失業率由2015年的3.3%稍升至3.4%（圖5）。在勞工市場穩定下，名義工資在首3季上升3.8%，而2015年的升幅為4.6%。首3季實質工資亦上升0.9%，而2015年的升幅為1.5%。\n\n圖 5 勞工市場狀況\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 股市\n\n香港股市在2016年大幅上落。受到人民幣貶值壓力及內地股市波動所影響，恒生指數於2月份跌至3年來的低位（圖6）。本港股市在3月份跟隨美國及其他主要股市顯著造好而回升。儘管英國脫歐公投觸發市場波動，但在外界預期美國聯邦儲備局會放緩加息步伐及其他主要央行推行貨幣寬鬆政策下，市場氣氛迅速改善。恒生指數於9月份升至24,100點的一年高位。然而，受到美國總統選舉結果及預計美國會加快加息步伐所影響，本港股市在第4季再度受壓。整體而言，恒生指數於2016年微升0.4%，在2015年則下跌7.2%。平均每日成交額由上年的1,056億港元降至669億港元，而本港股市集資總額亦由上年的11,156億港元減少至4,901億港元。\n\n圖 6 資產價格\n資料來源：差餉物業估價署及香港交易及結算所有限公司。\n\n# 物業市場\n\n住宅物業市場在2016年略為波動。物業成交量於第1季錄得歷史新低後，在其後數月有所回升，但在11月推出新印花稅措施後再度下挫。整體而言，成交量在2016年稍跌至54,701宗。另一方面，樓價自第2季起上升並超越2015年9月的高位，2016年的累計升幅為7.8%（圖6）。置業負擔能力依然偏緊，樓價與收入比率為15.9，超越1997年的歷史高位；而收入槓桿比率為72.0%，遠高於長期平均水平。2 由於銀行推出具競爭力的按揭計劃，按揭利率稍為回落，於接近年底時則跟隨香港銀行同業拆息上升而略為回升。工商物業市場方面，全年交投大致保持穩定。由於非住宅物業價格較2015年高位回落，相應租金收益率較上年微升，但仍處於低位。\n\n# 經濟前景\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n預期2017年實質本地生產總值增長將保持溫和。政府預測經濟增長幅度介乎2至3%之間，私營機構分析員預測增幅平均為2.0%。外圍方面，隨着環球宏觀經濟及金融環境變得不明朗，全球經濟及貿易增長或會保持溫和；再加上港元實質有效匯率因美元強勢而上升，將會抑制香港的出口表現。本地方面，雖然穩定的就業及收入狀況會支持消費，但受利率上升所拖累，預期私人消費會溫和增長。受惠於住屋供應增加及多個基建項目展開，樓宇及建造活動應會穩步增長，但營商氣氛疲弱及利率趨升將影響商界資本投資。\n\n# 通脹及勞工市場\n\n預計2017年通脹壓力仍然溫和。一方面環球商品價格上漲及中國內地通脹趨升或會令進口價格上升，另一方面港元轉強卻可能會令上述壓力受到遏抑。在溫和的經濟動力下，本地成本壓力仍可受控，但由於新訂住宅租金於2017年初上升，綜合消費物價指數中的租金組成項目通脹可能會稍升。市場共識預測2017年整體通脹率為1.9%，政府預期基本通脹率為2.0%。雖然不明朗因素加劇或會影響招聘意欲，私營機構分析員預計2017年失業率會維持於3.4%。\n\n# 不明朗因素及風險\n\n2017年經濟前景會受制於眾多不明朗因素，當中來自外圍環境的影響尤甚。美國新一屆政府政策的不確定性，將令環球經濟前景變得不明朗，當中可能出現的保護主義政策亦會對全球貿易帶來阻力。英國脫歐進程及歐洲幾個主要國家舉行大選，亦可能導致資產市場波動，並影響港元資金流向。此外，美國利率正常化將會令本地貨幣狀況收緊，並對實質經濟及資產價格構成下調壓力；當中樓市繼續偏緊，市場前景仍然很不明朗。短期而言，按揭息率仍然偏低、就業及收入狀況穩定，以及地產發展商加推優惠（例如折扣及現金回贈）令累積的購買力獲得釋放，均可為住宅需求帶來支持。另一方面，新印花稅措施、美國可能加快加息步伐及房屋供應穩步增長，則可能繼續為樓市帶來阻力。\n\n# 銀行體系表現\n\n儘管本港經濟面對阻力，加上國際政治事件出乎意料的結果令市場波動加劇，香港銀行體系在2016年仍然穩健。認可機構的資本及流動性狀況維持良好，資產質素輕微轉差，但仍處於健康水平。\n\n# 利率走勢\n\n隨着美國利率上升，香港銀行同業拆息在11月及12月顯著上升。反映零售銀行港元資金成本的綜合利率則輕微上升（圖7）。\n\n圖 7 香港銀行同業拆息、綜合利率及最優惠貸款利率\n\n註：\n1. 香港銀行同業拆息（每月平均數）由香港銀行公會公布。\n2. 最優惠貸款利率（每月平均數）是參考香港上海滙豐銀行有限公司所報利率。\n\n# 盈利走勢\n\n零售銀行在2016年的盈利略為改善，其香港業務的整體除稅前經營溢利增長8.7%。增長主要是由外匯及衍生工具業務收入（+39.7%）、附屬公司派發的股息收入（+123.5%）及淨利息收入（+2.8%）所帶動，不過部份增長被費用及佣金收入減少(-11.3%)所抵銷。零售銀行除稅後溢利錄得44.4%的升幅，增長主要來自非經常項目。零售銀行除稅後平均資產回報率亦相應由2015 年的 1.04% 上升至 1.44%（圖 8）。\n\n圖8 零售銀行的表現\n\n2016年零售銀行淨息差為1.32%，與2015年的水平相同（圖9）。雖然零售銀行繼續將剩餘資金配置於息率較低而流動性較高的金融投資，但利息收益的減少被利息成本下降所抵銷。\n\n圖9 零售銀行淨息差\n\n零售銀行非利息收入佔總經營收入的比例為44.3%，大致維持穩定。雖然費用與佣金收入下跌11.3%，但股息收入及外匯與衍生工具業務收入分別上升123.5%及39.7%。\n","terms":{"10年Plus同心展關懷標誌":["10 years plus Caring Organisation Logo"],"2016年存款保障計劃（修訂）條例":["Deposit

Facing heightened external uncertainties, economic growth is expected to remain moderate in 2017.\n\n# Economic Review\n\n# Overview\n\nHong Kong’s economic growth slowed in 2016, with real GDP growth declining from 2.4% in 2015 to 1.9% (Table 1). Net exports were the main drag, with weak inbound tourism putting pressure on service exports (Figure 1). Domestic demand momentum also slowed, but continued to provide the main support for overall economic growth. The labor market remained largely stable, with the unemployment rate at a low of 3.3 to 3.4%. Consumer price inflation further eased as local cost pressures and external price pressures abated. Facing a volatile external environment and shifting market sentiment, asset markets experienced increased volatility. In response to a renewed boom in the residential property market, the government implemented new stamp duty measures in November.\n\nDespite external volatility and rising U.S. interest rates, Hong Kong’s foreign exchange and money markets continued to operate smoothly. The Hong Kong dollar spot rate weakened slightly in January and has since hovered around the 7.75 level. The exchange rate assurance scheme was not triggered during the year, and the aggregate balance of the Exchange Fund’s outstanding bills and bonds remained almost unchanged at approximately HK$1.2 trillion. Following the U.S. interest rate increase in mid-December, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s base rate was raised from 0.75% to 1%. Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBOR) and longer-term bond yields remained at relatively low levels, but rose slightly towards the end of the year, partly reflecting the trend in corresponding U.S. rates. Overall bank lending growth accelerated to 6.5% in 2016. Although overall loan quality deteriorated slightly, specific classified loan ratios remained at extremely low levels.\n\nFigure 1: Contribution of components to the growth of real local GDP. Data source: Government Statistics Department.\n\nTable 1: Real Local GDP Growth by Expenditure Category (Compared to the Previous Period)\n\nNote: The seasonally adjusted quarterly increase or decrease in the total amount of locally fixed capital formation is not detailed.\nSource of data: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Local demand\n\nThe pace of local demand growth moderated slightly in 2016. While stable employment and income conditions continued to support private consumption, its growth slowed to 1.6%, partly reflecting heightened economic uncertainty. Government consumption growth also eased slightly to 3.3%. Local fixed capital formation continued to fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis (Figure 2), with a cumulative annual contraction of 0.5%. Purchases of machinery and equipment by the private sector were the main drag, contracting for the third consecutive year amid weak business prospects, while building and construction activity increased due to more housing starts.\n\nFigure 2: Local Demand.\nData Source: Government Statistics Department.\n\n# External Requirements\n\nHong Kong's exports showed signs of stabilizing towards the end of 2016, but the overall performance for the year remained weak (Figure 3). Goods exports increased by 1.7% compared to the low base of 2015. Exports to advanced economies remained sluggish; however, exports to mainland China, India, South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan improved compared to 2015, as regional trade flows became more stable.\n\nPartly reflecting the normalization of retail sales after a rapid growth in recent years, Hong Kong's service exports contracted significantly by 3.1% in 2016. Goods imports, which had contracted in 2015, partially recovered in 2016, while service imports continued to grow, partly benefiting from the desire of local residents to travel abroad. The overall trade surplus narrowed in 2016, dragging down local economic growth.\n\nFigure 3: Goods Exports and Service Outputs\nSource: Government Statistics Office.\n\n# Inflation\n\nInflation pressures remained under control in 2016. After excluding the impact of government one-time relief measures, the core inflation rate fell from 2.5% in 2015 to 2.3% in 2016 (Figure 4). Due to the pass-through effect from earlier adjustments in private residential rent, the inflation component of rent in the composite consumer price index declined. Benefiting from weaker global commodity prices and a strong Hong Kong dollar, import price inflation was curbed. On the other hand, local cost pressures remained moderate, as stable growth in labor costs and eased rental cost pressures (particularly in the retail sector) offset each other.\n\nFigure 4: Basic Consumer Price Inflation. Source: Government Statistics Department.\n\n# Labor Market\n\nThe labor market remained relatively stable in 2016, with roughly equal increases in labor supply and demand. By industry, the labor market conditions in tourism-related industries deteriorated, while other industries remained largely stable. Overall, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose slightly from 3.3% in 2015 to 3.4% (Figure 5). With a stable labor market, nominal wages increased by 3.8% in the first three quarters, compared to a 4.6% increase in 2015. Real wages also increased by 0.9% in the first three quarters, compared to a 1.5% increase in 2015.\n\nFigure 5: Labor Market Conditions. Data Source: Government Statistics Department.\n\n# Stock Market\n\nThe Hong Kong stock market experienced significant fluctuations in 2016. Affected by pressure from the RMB's depreciation and volatility in the mainland stock market, the Hang Seng Index fell to a three-year low in February (Figure 6). The Hong Kong market rebounded in March, following a marked recovery in the US and other major stock markets. Although the Brexit referendum triggered market volatility, the market atmosphere quickly improved under expectations that the US Federal Reserve would slow the pace of interest rate hikes and other major central banks would implement monetary easing policies. The Hang Seng Index rose to a one-year high of 24,100 points in September. However, the Hong Kong market faced renewed pressure in the fourth quarter due to the results of the US presidential election and expectations of accelerated interest rate hikes in the US. Overall, the Hang Seng Index rose 0.4% in 2016, compared to a 7.2% decline in 2015. The average daily turnover fell from 1,056 billion HKD in the previous year to 669 billion HKD, while the total capital raised on the Hong Kong stock market also dropped from 11,156 billion HKD to 4,901 billion HKD.\n\nFigure 6: Asset Prices  \nSource: Hong Kong Valuation and Rating Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\n\n# Real Estate Market\n\nThe residential property market experienced slight fluctuations in 2016. Property transaction volume hit a historical low in the first quarter, rose slightly in the following months, but fell again after the introduction of new stamp duty measures in November. Overall, the transaction volume slightly decreased to 54,701 transactions in 2016. On the other hand, property prices rose since the second quarter and exceeded the high point in September 2015, with a cumulative increase of 7.8% in 2016 (Figure 6). Housing affordability remained tight, with the price-to-income ratio at 15.9, exceeding the historical high in 1997; the income leverage ratio was 72.0%, far above the long-term average. 2 Due to banks introducing competitive mortgage plans, mortgage rates slightly declined, but rose slightly again as the Hong Kong interbank offered rate increased near the end of the year. In the commercial property market, the transaction volume remained largely stable throughout the year. Due to non-residential property prices falling from the 2015 high, the corresponding rental yield slightly increased compared to the previous year but remained at a low level.\n\n# Economic Prospects\n\n# Economic environment\n\nWe expect real gross domestic product growth to remain moderate in 2017. The government forecasts economic growth of between 2 and 3%, while private sector economists predict an average increase of 2.0%. Externally, with the global macroeconomic and financial environment becoming increasingly uncertain, global economic and trade growth may remain moderate; furthermore, the real effective exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar has risen due to the strength of the US dollar, which will dampen Hong Kong’s export performance. Locally, while stable employment and income conditions will support consumption, private consumption is expected to grow moderately, weighed down by rising interest rates. Benefiting from increased housing supply and the commencement of several infrastructure projects, building and construction activity should grow steadily, but a weak business climate and rising interest rates will affect business capital investment.\n\n# Inflation and the labor market\n\nInflationary pressures are expected to remain moderate in 2017. On one hand, rising global commodity prices and increasing inflation in mainland China may increase import prices, while on the other hand, a stronger Hong Kong dollar may help offset these pressures. Under moderate economic momentum, local cost pressures are expected to remain under control. However, the rent component in the composite consumer price index may rise slightly due to increases in newly leased residential rents in early 2017. Market consensus forecasts an overall inflation rate of 1.9% for 2017, while the government expects the core inflation rate to be 2.0%. Although increased uncertainties may affect hiring intentions, private sector analysts expect the unemployment rate to remain at 3.4%.\n\n# Uncertain factors and risks.\n\nThe economic outlook for 2017 will be subject to numerous uncertainties, with external factors having a particularly significant impact. The uncertainty surrounding the policies of the new U.S. administration will make the global economic outlook unclear, and potential protectionist policies may also hinder global trade. The Brexit process and elections in several major European countries may also lead to asset market volatility and affect Hong Kong dollar capital flows. In addition, the normalization of U.S. interest rates will tighten local monetary conditions and exert downward pressure on the real economy and asset prices; the property market will continue to be tight, and the market outlook remains very unclear. In the short term, persistently low mortgage rates, stable employment and income conditions, and property developers offering incentives (such as discounts and cash rebates) releasing accumulated purchasing power, can all support residential demand. On the other hand, the new stamp duty measures, the possibility of the U.S. accelerating the pace of interest rate hikes, and the steady growth of housing supply may continue to hinder the property market.\n\n# Banking system performance\n\nDespite challenges faced by Hong Kong's economy, coupled with unexpected outcomes of international political events that exacerbated market volatility, Hong Kong's banking system remained resilient in 2016. The capital and liquidity positions of authorized institutions remained strong, with a slight deterioration in asset quality, though still within healthy levels.\n\n# Interest rate trends\n\nWith the rise in U.S. interest rates, the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) increased significantly in November and December. The composite interest rate, which reflects the cost of Hong Kong dollar funding for retail banks, rose slightly (Figure 7).\n\nFigure 7: Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates, Composite Interest Rates, and Prime Lending Rates\n\nNote:\n1. The Hong Kong interbank offered rates (monthly average) are published by the Hong Kong Bankers' Association.\n2. The prime lending rate (monthly average) is based on the rates quoted by HSBC Hong Kong Limited.\n\n# Profitability Trends\n\nRetail banking profitability slightly improved in 2016, with pre-tax operating profit in Hong Kong increasing by 8.7%. This growth was fueled by increases in foreign exchange and derivatives income (+39.7%), dividend income from subsidiaries (+123.5%), and net interest income (+2.8%), though partially offset by a decrease in fee and commission income (-11.3%). Post-tax profit for retail banking rose by 44.4%, primarily attributable to non-recurring items. The post-tax average return on assets also increased from 1.04% in 2015 to 1.44% (Figure 8).\n\nFigure 8: Retail Banking's Performance\n\nThe net interest margin for retail banking in 2016 was 1.32%, the same as the level in 2015 (Figure 9). Although retail banking continued to allocate remaining funds to financial investments with lower interest rates and higher liquidity, the decrease in interest income was offset by the decline in interest expense.\n\nFigure 9 Retail Bank Net Interest Spread\n\nRetail banking non-interest income accounted for 44.3% of total operating income, maintaining a relatively stable level. Although fees and commission income declined by 11.3%, dividend income and foreign exchange and derivatives business income increased by 123.5% and 39.7% respectively.\n"}
{"zh":"# 貨幣穩定\n\n儘管外圍環境波動及美元息率上升，港元匯率在2016年仍然保持穩定。香港貨幣市場亦繼續運作暢順，銀行同業流動資金充裕。聯繫匯率制度繼續展現高度承受衝擊的能力，是香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的主要目標是維持貨幣穩定，即確保港元匯價穩定，使港元在外匯市場兌美元的匯率保持在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的區間內。該貨幣體制主要採用貨幣發行局制度，規定由外匯基金所持的美元儲備向貨幣基礎提供最少百分之百的支持；貨幣基礎若有變動，美元儲備亦必須作出相應增減，與貨幣基礎的變動百分之百配合。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n- 負債證明書（為3間發鈔銀行發行的銀行紙幣提供十足支持）\n- 政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣\n- 銀行在金管局所持結算戶口的結餘總額（即總結餘）\n- 金管局代表政府發行的外匯基金票據及債券。\n\n表1 貨幣基礎\n\n金管局透過自動利率調節機制及履行兌換保證的堅決承諾來維持港元匯率的穩定。若市場對港元的需求大過供應，令市場匯率轉強至7.75港元兌1美元的強方兌換保證匯率，金管局會向銀行沽出港元、買入美元，使總結餘增加及港元利率下跌，從而令港元匯率從強方兌換保證匯率水平回復至7.75到7.85的兌換範圍內。相反，若港元供過於求，令市場匯率轉弱至7.85港元兌1美元的弱方兌換保證匯率，金管局會向銀行買入港元，使總結餘減少及推高港元利率，港元匯率隨之由弱方兌換保證匯率水平回復至兌換範圍內。\n\n# 2016年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n港元匯率在2016年首兩個月略有波動後，於年內餘下時間一直窄幅徘徊。港元在2016年初兌美元顯著轉弱，由1月4日的7.7510降至1月20日的7.8196（圖1）。港元匯率轉弱符合聯繫匯率制度的正常運作，反映美國在2015年12月加息後港元與美元的負息差擴濶。此外，其他市場相關因素，包括香港股市出現拋售、內地及香港經濟前景不及以前樂觀、人民幣匯率波動增加，以及亞洲貨幣普遍疲弱，均導致港元需求減弱。受到市場氣氛改善支持，港元匯率在2月略為轉強，並自3月起一直在7.753至7.776之間窄幅徘徊，即使英國脫歐公投及美國總統選舉引發市場波動亦未受影響。由於市場預期美國會在夏季加息，港元匯率於5月出現短暫的轉弱壓力。整體而言，港元外匯市場在2016年一直正常運作。\n\n圖 1 2016年市場匯率\n\n由於兌換保證沒有被觸發，因此總結餘及未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額在2016年沒有明顯變動，大致維持在12,222億港元左右（圖2）。年內金管局增發總值1,320億港元的外匯基金票據，以滿足銀行在流動性管理方面的龐大需求，令總結餘相應減少至2016年底的2,596億港元。增發外匯基金票據符合貨幣發行局制度的原則，這是由於增發外匯基金票據只屬貨幣基礎組成部分之間的轉移，即由總結餘移至未償還外匯基金票據及債券，貨幣基礎仍然由外匯儲備提供十足支持。\n\n圖 2 2016年總結餘及未償還外匯基金票據及債券\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n香港銀行同業拆息在2016年大部分時間維持在較低水平（圖3）。香港銀行同業拆息在1、2月期間因金融市場波動加劇而面對一些上升壓力，但在3月隨着金融環境回復平靜而轉趨穩定。於第2及第3季，儘管市場關注英國脫歐公投結果以及美國貨幣市場基金改革，香港銀行同業拆息仍大致保持穩定。部分受到年底資金需求影響，以及港元拆息追回美元拆息的升幅，香港銀行同業拆息在第4季錄得較大升幅。儘管如此，短期銀行同業拆息在2016年大致維持在低於基本利率的水平。\n\n因應美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍於12月14日（美國時間）由0.25至0.50厘上調至0.50至0.75厘，基本利率於12月15日由0.75厘上調至1.00厘。基本利率的調整是按照於2009年3月26日宣布的經修訂計算公式作出。按照該公式，基本利率定於美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍下限加50基點的水平，或隔夜與1個月香港銀行同業拆息的5天移動平均數的平均值水平，兩者以較高者為準。\n\n圖 3 2016年香港銀行同業拆息\n\n港元遠期匯率點子在1月出現大幅溢價，大致跟隨港元與美元息差的走勢，以及部分反映投資者為其港股組合作出外匯對沖的需求（圖4）。遠期匯率溢價在2月開始收窄。隨着市況轉趨穩定，港元遠期匯率點子在3至11月期間大致保持穩定，其後在12月因港元與美元息差收窄而再度上升。整體而言，香港貨幣市場運作暢順，銀行同業流動資金充裕。貼現窗借貸在2016年並不活躍，僅涉及53億港元。\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n儘管經歷多次區內以至全球金融危機，聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）過去數十年來一直是香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石。2016年初市場波動加劇，再度引起有關港元轉弱及情況有如亞洲金融危機時期的評論。為增進各界對聯匯制度的認識，金管局向公眾闡釋聯匯制度的技術細節，並指出香港金融體系有能力抵禦衝擊。政府亦重申堅決維持聯匯制度。外匯及貨幣市場穩定，進一步鞏固公眾對政府維持聯匯制度的決心以及港元作為支付及保值貨幣的信心。國際貨幣基金組織在與香港進行年度第四條磋商時，明確表示聯匯制度是最適合香港的貨幣制度，指出香港靈活的經濟結構、充裕的財政及儲備緩衝、以及穩健有效的金融監管是聯匯制度的後盾。\n\n圖 4 2016年美元兌港元遠期匯率點子\n\n鑑於穩健的銀行體系對聯匯制度的正常運作具關鍵作用，金管局繼續密切監察銀行的信用、流動性及利率風險管理以及壓力測試結果，並加強對銀行個人、企業及內地相關貸款的監管，以確保銀行體系具備應付衝擊的能力。面對美國貨幣政策正常化，香港銀行同業拆息開始上升，金管局提醒市民保持警覺，並作好準備以應付可能出現的市場波動及風險。\n\n為提高貨幣發行局帳目的透明度，自1998年10月起，外匯基金已有部分資產被指定用作支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（即支持資產相對貨幣基礎的比率）於2016年在106.3至107.5%之間的窄幅上落，並無觸及上限或下限。該比率於2016年12月31日為106.7%（圖5）。在聯匯制度下，雖然已指定某些外匯基金資產作為支持組合，但外匯基金的全部資產均可用作支持港元匯率。外匯基金的龐大財政資源，能在面對突如其來的衝擊時為香港貨幣及金融穩定提供強力後盾。\n\n圖5 2016年支持比率每日變動\n\n# 研究工作\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的貨幣發行委員會負責監察和探討與香港貨幣及金融穩定有關的課題。在2016年，貨幣發行委員會探討的課題包括香港與中國內地及美國經濟增長同步性、港元貨幣外部需求及香港的金融狀況指數。貨幣發行委員會會議紀錄及金管局向其呈交的貨幣發行局制度運作報告，均載於金管局網站。\n\n香港金融研究中心繼續支持貨幣政策、銀行業及金融範疇的研究工作。在2016年，研究中心合共邀請18位學者到訪，並發表20份工作論文。\n\n年內研究中心舉辦6項國際會議及研討會，主要包括：\n- 於1月舉辦「第7屆中國經濟年度國際研討會」，主題為「中國對全球經濟的影響日益加深」，其間發表8份涵蓋廣泛議題的研究論文，包括中國增長再平衡及增長潛力、來自中國的經濟外溢效應、人民幣對全球及區內的影響，以及人民幣市場之間的利差交易走勢及資訊流動。\n- 於3月與香港科技大學及慶應大學合辦「科技大學與慶應大學及研究中心匯率及宏觀經濟研討會」，內容涵蓋多個不同經濟議題，包括全球經濟失衡、匯率動態變化、資本管制及貨幣政策。\n- 於8月與香港城市大學合辦「房地產與金融穩定研討會」，會上發表的論文內容涵蓋年齡、人口與住屋需求；大額投資者對資產質素的影響；香港房屋價格動態變動；住屋市場負擔能力；按揭規例對家庭生命周期置業決定的影響，以及中國內地的住宅物業市場。\n- 於10月與金管局及國際結算銀行合辦有關亞太區經濟體系的研討會，主題為「在動盪不穩的全球環境下區內經濟體系的抗震能力」。研討會吸引多間央行的高層、主要學者及來自國際組織與私人機構的專家出席，就亞太區經濟體系最迫切的事項進行互動式圓桌討論，交流意見。探討的議題涵蓋廣泛，包括亞洲的金融失衡狀況、資金流、內地經濟放緩對區內其他地方的外溢效應，以及亞洲潛在增長受到的影響及前景。\n\n研究中心亦於8月舉辦「第14屆年度夏季研討會」，並於9月舉辦「第14屆中國內地經濟研討會」，探討內地銀行的資產質素及金融穩定事項。上述會議及研討會吸引學術界、金融服務界及各地央行代表參加。研究中心亦於年內舉辦21場公開小型研討會，探討廣泛的經濟、貨幣及金融議題。\n\n# 紙幣及硬幣\n\n截至2016年底，流通銀行紙幣（指發鈔銀行發行的紙幣）總值4,078億港元，較上年增加13.2%（圖6、7及8）。政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣總值118億港元，較上年增加5.3%（圖9及10）。在政府發行的紙幣及硬幣中，10港元流通紙幣總值44億港元，當中塑質鈔票佔86%。\n","terms":{"10年Plus同心展關懷標誌":["10 years plus Caring

The Hong Kong currency market continued to operate smoothly, with ample liquidity among banks. The linked exchange rate system continued to demonstrate a high capacity to absorb shocks and remains the cornerstone of monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong.\n\n# Objective\n\nThe primary objective of Hong Kong's monetary policy is to maintain monetary stability, ensuring the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar remains stable, keeping the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar against the US dollar within the range of 7.75 to 7.85 Hong Kong dollars to 1 US dollar. This monetary system mainly adopts the currency issuance bureau system, which stipulates that the dollar reserves held by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority must provide at least 100% support to the monetary base; if the monetary base changes, the dollar reserves must also be adjusted accordingly, fully matching the changes in the monetary base.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n- Certificates of indebtedness (providing full backing for banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks)\n- government-issued notes and coins\n- the aggregate balance of clearing accounts maintained by banks with the HKMA (i.e. the total balance)\n- Exchange Fund bills and bonds issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nTable 1 Monetary Base\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority maintains the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate through its automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and a firm commitment to the exchange rate guarantee. If demand for Hong Kong dollars exceeds supply, causing the market exchange rate to strengthen to the strong-side exchange rate guarantee level of 7.75 Hong Kong dollars to 1 U.S. dollar, the HKMA will sell Hong Kong dollars and buy U.S. dollars from banks, increasing total reserves and lowering Hong Kong dollar interest rates, thereby bringing the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate back within the exchange rate band of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if there is an excess supply of Hong Kong dollars, causing the market exchange rate to weaken to the weak-side exchange rate guarantee level of 7.85 Hong Kong dollars to 1 U.S. dollar, the HKMA will buy Hong Kong dollars from banks, reducing total reserves and raising Hong Kong dollar interest rates, thereby bringing the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate back within the exchange rate band.\n\n# 2016 Retrospective\n\n# Exchange Rate Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate experienced minor fluctuations in the first two months of 2016 before stabilizing within a narrow range for the remainder of the year. The Hong Kong dollar weakened significantly against the US dollar in early 2016, declining from 7.7510 on January 4 to 7.8196 on January 20 (Figure 1). This movement aligned with the normal operation of the linked exchange rate system, reflecting a widening negative interest rate differential between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar following the US Federal Reserve’s December 2015 interest rate hike. Contributing factors included selling pressure in the Hong Kong stock market, a less optimistic economic outlook for mainland China and Hong Kong, increased volatility in the Renminbi exchange rate, and broader weakness in Asian currencies, all of which reduced demand for the Hong Kong dollar. Supported by improving market sentiment, the Hong Kong dollar briefly strengthened in February and subsequently remained within a narrow range of 7.753 to 7.776 from March onwards, remaining resilient even to market volatility triggered by the UK’s Brexit referendum and the US presidential election. Market expectations of a US interest rate hike in the summer led to temporary downward pressure on the Hong Kong dollar in May. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar foreign exchange market operated normally throughout 2016.\n\nFigure 1: 2016 market exchange rates\n\nSince the exchange guarantee was not triggered, the total surplus and the total amount of outstanding foreign exchange fund notes and bonds remained largely unchanged in 2016, staying at around HKD 122.22 billion (Figure 2). During the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued an additional HKD 13.2 billion worth of foreign exchange fund notes to meet the substantial liquidity management needs of banks, which reduced the total surplus to HKD 25.96 billion by the end of 2016. The issuance of additional foreign exchange fund notes is in line with the principles of the currency board system, as the issuance merely represents a transfer within the components of the monetary base, from the total surplus to outstanding foreign exchange fund notes and bonds, while the monetary base remains fully supported by foreign exchange reserves.\n\nFigure 2 Summary of 2016 Outstanding and Unpaid Foreign Exchange Fund Notes and Bonds\n\n# Currency Market\n\nHong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) remained at relatively low levels for most of 2016 (Figure 3). During January and February, HIBOR faced some upward pressure due to heightened financial market volatility, but stabilized in March as the financial environment calmed down. In the second and third quarters, despite market concerns over the outcome of the UK's Brexit referendum and reforms in the US money market funds, HIBOR remained largely stable. In the fourth quarter, HIBOR recorded a significant increase, partly due to year-end funding demand and the catch-up of Hong Kong dollar rates with the rise in US dollar rates. Nevertheless, short-term interbank rates remained generally below the basic interest rate throughout 2016.\n\nIn response to the increase in the U.S. Federal Funds Rate target range from 0.25 to 0.50 percentage points to 0.50 to 0.75 percentage points on December 14 (U.S. time), the benchmark interest rate was raised from 0.75 percentage points to 1.00 percentage points on December 15. This adjustment to the benchmark interest rate was made in accordance with the revised calculation formula announced on March 26, 2009. Under this formula, the benchmark interest rate is set at the lower bound of the U.S. Federal Funds Rate target range plus 50 basis points, or the average of the 5-day moving average of the overnight and 1-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR), whichever is higher.\n\nFigure 3: Hong Kong Interbank Offer Rate (HIBOR) in 2016\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar forward rate points experienced a significant premium in January, largely following the trend of the interest rate differential between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar, and partially reflecting investors' demand for foreign exchange hedging for their Hong Kong stock portfolios (Figure 4). The forward rate premium began to narrow in February. As market conditions became more stable, Hong Kong dollar forward rate points remained largely stable from March to November, and then rose again in December due to the narrowing of the interest rate differential between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar. Overall, the Hong Kong money market operated smoothly with ample interbank liquidity. Discount window lending was not active in 2016, involving only HKD 5.3 billion.\n\n# Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nDespite experiencing multiple regional and global financial crises, the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has remained the cornerstone of monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong over the past decades. In early 2016, market volatility intensified, once again prompting comments suggesting a weakening Hong Kong dollar and a situation similar to that during the Asian financial crisis. To enhance public understanding of the LERS, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority explained the technical details of the system and emphasized the capability of Hong Kong's financial system to withstand shocks. The government also reaffirmed its firm commitment to maintaining the LERS. The stability of the foreign exchange and money markets further reinforced public confidence in the government's determination to uphold the LERS and in the Hong Kong dollar as a medium of exchange and store of value. During the annual Article IV consultation with the International Monetary Fund, the IMF clearly stated that the LERS is the most suitable monetary system for Hong Kong, pointing out that Hong Kong's flexible economic structure, ample fiscal and reserve buffers, and sound and effective financial regulation serve as the foundation of the LERS.\n\nFigure 4: Forward Exchange Rate Points of the US Dollar against the Hong Kong Dollar in 2016\n\nGiven the critical role of a sound banking system in the normal functioning of the linked exchange rate system, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to closely monitor banks' credit, liquidity, and interest rate risk management, as well as the results of stress tests. It also strengthens oversight of banks' personal, corporate, and mainland-related lending to ensure the banking system's ability to withstand shocks. Facing the normalization of U.S. monetary policy, Hong Kong interbank rates have begun to rise. The HKMA urges the public to remain vigilant and prepare for potential market volatility and risks.\n\nTo enhance the transparency of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's accounts, since October 1998, certain assets of the Exchange Fund have been designated to support the currency base. The backing ratio (i.e., the ratio of supporting assets to the currency base) fluctuated narrowly between 106.3% and 107.5% in 2016, without reaching either the upper or lower limits. The ratio stood at 106.7% on December 31, 2016 (Figure 5). Under the linked exchange rate system, although certain Exchange Fund assets have been designated as part of the support portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets can be used to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. The substantial financial resources of the Exchange Fund can provide strong support for Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability in the face of sudden shocks.\n\nFigure 5: Daily fluctuations in support ratio for 2016.\n\n# Research work\n\nThe Monetary Board Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for monitoring and examining issues related to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. In 2016, the topics examined by the Monetary Board Committee included the synchronization of economic growth between Hong Kong, mainland China, and the United States, external demand for the Hong Kong dollar, and Hong Kong’s financial conditions index. The minutes of the Monetary Board Committee meetings and the reports on the operation of the currency board system submitted to it by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) are available on the HKMA website.\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research continues to support research on monetary policy, banking, and the financial sector. In 2016, the Institute hosted a total of 18 scholars and published 20 working papers.\n\nThe research center hosted six international conferences and seminars during the year, including the following:  \n- In January, it organized **The Seventh Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy**, themed **\"China's Deepening Influence on the Global Economy.\"** During the conference, eight research papers were presented, covering a wide range of topics including China's growth rebalancing and growth potential, economic spillover effects from China, the impact of the RMB on the global and regional economies, and trends in interest rate differentials and information flows across RMB markets.  \n- In March, it co-hosted the **HKUST-Keio-HKIMR Conference on Exchange Rates and Macroeconomics** with the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) and Keio University. The conference covered multiple economic topics, including global economic imbalances, **exchange rate dynamics**, **capital flows**, and monetary policy.  \n- In August, it co-hosted the **Real Estate and Financial Stability Conference** with the City University of Hong Kong. The papers presented addressed topics such as age, population, and housing demand; the impact of large investors on asset quality; dynamics of Hong Kong housing prices; housing affordability; the influence of mortgage regulations on household lifecycle housing decisions; and the mainland Chinese residential property market.  \n- In October, it co-hosted a conference on the Asia-Pacific economic system with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), themed **\"Resilience of the Regional Economic System in a Volatile Global Environment.\"** The conference attracted senior officials from several central banks, leading scholars, and experts from international organizations and private institutions, who engaged in interactive roundtable discussions on the most pressing issues facing the Asia-Pacific economic system. Topics discussed included financial imbalances in Asia, **capital flows**, spillover effects from China's economic slowdown on other regions, and the impact on and outlook for Asia's potential growth.\n\nThe Research Center also held the \"14th Annual Summer Conference\" in August and the \"14th China Mainland Economic Conference\" in September, discussing the asset quality of mainland banks and financial stability issues. The aforementioned conferences attracted participants from academia, the financial services sector, and central bank representatives from various regions. The Research Center also hosted 21 public small-scale seminars throughout the year, exploring a wide range of economic, monetary, and financial issues.\n\n# Banknotes and coins\n\nAs of the end of 2016, the total value of circulating banknotes (referring to banknotes issued by issuing banks) amounted to 407.8 billion Hong Kong dollars, representing an increase of 13.2% compared to the previous year (Figures 6, 7, and 8). The total value of circulating banknotes and coins issued by the government was 11.8 billion Hong Kong dollars, an increase of 5.3% compared to the previous year (Figures 9 and 10). Among the government-issued banknotes and coins, the total value of 10 Hong Kong dollar circulating banknotes was 4.4 billion Hong Kong dollars, of which 86% were polymer notes.\n"}
{"zh":"# 銀行體系穩定\n\n儘管環球市場風險及震盪增加，香港銀行體系在2016年仍維持穩健。金管局在年內加強監管認可機構的風險管治架構，以及信用與流動性風險管理系統的成效。鑑於網絡攻擊日趨頻繁，金管局亦加強監管認可機構的科技風險管理。為貫徹金管局致力打擊金融罪行的目標，認可機構打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集監控措施的成效，繼續是金管局的監管重點。在監管認可機構的操守方面，金管局採取實質行動，推動以客為本的企業文化及促進普及金融，和應對海外中小企及初創企業在香港開立及維持銀行帳戶方面遇到的困難。金管局亦加強監管認可機構銷售投資及保險產品的手法，以進一步提升對客戶的保障。\n\n在監管政策方面，金管局就香港實施國際監管及會計標準的準備工作取得重大進展；當中包括穩定資金淨額比率、大額風險承擔限額、國際財務報告準則第9號及《金融機構（處置機制）條例》下的處置框架。\n\n# 2016年回顧\n\n# 監管工作概覽\n\n金管局在2016年共進行188次非現場審查，涵蓋範圍廣泛，包括認可機構的CAMEL評級、企業管治、業務運作及風險管理。金管局加強與認可機構董事局的聯繫，以強化銀行業的風險管治及企業文化。除與董事局或董事局委員會舉行會議外，亦另行與獨立非執行董事（獨立非執董）會面，就企業文化及風險管治事宜交換意見。金管局亦與認可機構及其外聘審計師舉行三方聯席會議。此外，金管局就認可機構的薪酬制度是否有助促進有效的風險管理進行評估。\n\n在資本充足水平方面，金管局審視認可機構的資本計劃，包括其未來數年的資本目標，以便就2019年全面實施《巴塞爾協定三》緩衝資本作好準備。認可機構的償付能力壓力測試亦因應當前宏觀經濟環境作出改進。金管局又審慎評估各主要零售銀行的恢復計劃，並就需要改善的環節提出意見。\n\n除了非現場審查工作外，金管局繼續以專題評估配合定期現場審查，而專題評估主要適用於被評定為較高風險的範疇。這種監管方法讓金管局更有效地調配監管資源，以應對認可機構所面對的各項新增及主要風險。金管局在2016年共進行377次現場審查及專題評估。這些審查與評估的重點仍是信用風險管理與監控，尤其涉及內地相關業務的信用風險；另一個重點是打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集監控措施。金管局又增加對流動性風險、業務操作風險及科技風險管理的現場審查及專題評估次數。年內專項審查小組亦對認可機構的證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（強積金）相關業務進行現場審查。\n\n表1載有金管局於2016年的監管工作概要。\n\n# 信用風險的監管\n\n# 信貸增長及資產質素\n\n銀行貸款在2016年增長溫和。未償還貸款總額全年增加6.5%；2015年的增幅則為3.5%（表2）。由於客戶存款的增幅超過銀行貸款的增幅，整體貸存比率由2015年底的70.1%降至2016年底的68.4%。\n\n表 2 貸款及墊款的增長\n\n內地相關貸款總額在2016年底增加7%至35,640億港元（表3），其中包括在香港註冊的銀行設於內地的附屬公司入帳的5,450億港元貸款。\n\n銀行業的資產質素在2016年維持穩健。儘管零售銀行的特定分類貸款比率由2015年底的0.69%微升至2016年底的0.72%，但仍遠低於2000年以來的長期平均水平2.4%。同期，整體銀行業的特定分類貸款比率由0.73%上升至0.85%。年內銀行業的內地相關貸款的資產質素呈相若走勢；同期，零售銀行這些貸款的特定分類貸款比率由0.78%微升至0.82%，整體銀行業的相關比率亦由一年前的0.77%微升至0.80%。\n\n金管局投入大量監管資源，以確保認可機構繼續採用審慎的信貸審批標準，並維持有效的貸款分類及撥備制度。金管局在監管過程中亦特別關注認可機構對中國內地民營企業的風險承擔持續增加，以及為增加收益而投資於債務證券所引起的信用風險。此外，金管局就認可機構分銷高風險投資產品的信用風險管理進行專題評估。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n金管局繼續密切留意認可機構的物業貸款業務。住宅物業價格於2015年9月開始出現調整，但其後於2016年3月再度上升，全年上升8%。新造住宅物業按揭貸款的平均按揭成數，由2009年9月金管局尚未推出首輪物業貸款逆周期措施時的64%，降至2016年12月的51%。新造住宅物業按揭貸款的平均供款與入息比率亦由2010年8月首度推出供款與入息比率上限時的41%，降至2016年12月的34%（圖1）。\n\n圖 1 新造住宅物業按揭貸款的平均按揭成數及供款與入息比率\n金管局推出首輪物業貸款逆周期措施前推出供款與入息比率上限\n\n根據金管局於2015年2月推出的第七輪逆周期措施，使用內部評級基準計算法計算信用風險資本要求的認可機構須將15%信用風險加權下限的應用，由新造按揭貸款延伸至整個住宅按揭貸款組合。這項規定於2016年6月生效。\n\n年內有更多地產發展商向物業買家直接提供按揭貸款，其按揭成數往往高於金管局對認可機構實施審慎要求下許可的水平。金管局密切留意有關發展，並定期與認可機構溝通，以評估銀行有否繼續有效管理對地產發展商的風險承擔。此外，土地註冊處應金管局要求，同意向認可機構提供電子提示服務。使用這項服務的認可機構，當有其他按揭文書就其承按的物業交付土地註冊處辦理註冊時，會收到該處發出的電子提示訊息。這項服務將有助應對按揭借款人未有事先獲得承按認可機構同意下，擅自以同一物業借取額外按揭貸款的情況。土地註冊處已於2017年第1季推出電子提示服務。\n\n# 業務操作及科技風險的監管\n\n與其他國際金融中心一樣，香港面對的網絡威脅與日俱增。金管局於2016年接到認可機構通報發現未經授權股票交易及試圖入侵其支付系統的個案，並隨即採取行動應對這些攻擊造成的風險。金管局發出電子銀行服務提示，提醒公眾慎防網上股票交易騙案，並建議公眾採取預防措施。金管局又向認可機構發出通告，就進一步加強網上銀行服務監控可採取的保安措施提供指引。有關試圖入侵銀行支付系統的個案，金管局在香港首次發現相關個案時已提醒認可機構留意這類騙案，並在警方協助下說明這類騙案的犯案手法，以及要求認可機構在加強支付操作的監控措施時須顧及有關手法。\n\n為進一步提升銀行體系應對網絡風險的能力，金管局於2016年5月推出網絡防衛計劃。此計劃由三項支柱組成，即網絡防衛評估框架、專業培訓計劃及網絡風險資訊共享平台（詳見「香港的國際金融中心地位」一章「金融科技促進辦公室」部分）。金管局在12月向認可機構發出通告，列載網絡防衛評估框架的實施時間表。\n\n金融科技在銀行業的應用於2016年長足發展，多間認可機構推出新的金融科技產品，其中個人小額支付服務、非接觸式流動支付及生物認證這幾個範疇的發展尤為顯著。金管局在9月推出「金融科技監管沙盒」，讓認可機構能在受控環境中就其金融科技項目先作試行，而無需完全符合金管局的監管規定。有關安排讓認可機構在正式推出金融科技服務前，可及早收集真實數據及用戶意見，以便作出適當修改。截至2016年底，共有6項使用金融科技監管沙盒的申請獲批，有關的新金融科技產品涉及生物認證、證券交易及用於按揭估值的區塊鏈。金管局又在11月上調無需雙重認證的網上銀行個人小額支付服務的交易上限至每個帳戶每日5,000港元，以應付日益增加的簡便個人支付服務需求。\n\n2016年發生多宗與物業相關的騙案，當中涉及騙徒假扮業主，試圖藉申請按揭貸款或出售有關物業謀取利益。雖然這些騙案並不涉及認可機構，但金管局仍與警方及香港銀行公會（銀行公會）緊密合作，就偵測及防止這些騙案在銀行業內發生向認可機構提供指引。年內金管局出版兩期《操作事故通訊》，與業界分享從認可機構發生過的操作事故中汲取的教訓。金管局亦對認可機構的業務操作風險管理制度、詐騙管理方法、信託╱託管業務操作及防範違規或未經授權交易活動的風險管理及監控措施進行現場審查及專題評估。\n\n# 財資業務及流動性風險的監管\n\n2016年發生數宗重大政治事件，引致金融市場在年內多次大幅波動。與此同時，美國利率繼續緩慢地正常化，聯邦公開市場委員會於12月決定調高聯邦基金利率，是全球金融危機以來的第二次。為應對這些政治事件作好準備，金管局與境外監管機構繼續保持緊密聯繫，並評估事件對香港銀行體系的影響，以及要求銀行保持警覺並加強其風險管理以應對不利的市場發展。\n\n在流動性風險管理方面，金管局進行額外的流動性壓力測試，以評估銀行體系應對可能發生的嚴峻壓力情境的能力，並對認可機構作出跟進，以加強其應對能力。金管局在2015年針對利率風險管理進行一輪現場審查後，再進行額外的現場審查，以評估認可機構的市場風險管理，並要求在監控方面存有不足的認可機構作出糾正。\n\n# 打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集活動\n\n金管局的風險為本打擊洗錢監管包括現場審查及非現場審查（包括就特定事件與認可機構進行的監管聯繫），主要針對洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險較高的範疇。審查內容涵蓋認可機構對洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險的評估、風險為本方法的落實情況，以及交易監察與制裁合規的制度和程序。金管局的專項監管人員在2016年共進行17次現場審查及30次非現場審查。\n\n在政策發展方面，金管局優先處理某些行業及人士在開立銀行帳戶方面遇到困難的情況，並發出指引與「常見問題」，以釐清若干客戶盡職審查的規定，以及金管局就風險為本方法的監管期望。與此同時，金管局繼續與業內公會緊密合作，發出指引以協助認可機構處理某些範疇的風險，例如貿易相關的洗錢活動。\n","terms":{"10年Plus同心展關懷標誌":["10

The HKMA strengthened its supervision of the risk governance frameworks and the effectiveness of credit and liquidity risk management systems of authorized institutions during the year. Given the increasing frequency of cyberattacks, the HKMA also enhanced its oversight of the technology risk management practices of authorized institutions. To align with the HKMA's commitment to combating financial crimes, the effectiveness of authorized institutions' measures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing continued to be a regulatory focus. In regulating the conduct of authorized institutions, the HKMA took concrete actions to promote customer-centric corporate culture and advance financial inclusion, as well as address difficulties faced by overseas SMEs and startups in opening and maintaining bank accounts in Hong Kong. The HKMA also strengthened its regulation of the methods used by authorized institutions to sell investment and insurance products to further enhance customer protection.\n\nIn terms of regulatory policies, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has made significant progress in preparing for the implementation of international regulatory and accounting standards, including the net stable funding ratio, large exposure limits, IFRS 9, and the resolution framework under the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance.\n\n# 2016 Retrospective\n\n# Overview of Supervisory Work\n\nThe HKMA conducted 188 on-site inspections in 2016, covering a wide range of areas including the CAMEL rating of authorized institutions, corporate governance, business operations, and risk management. The HKMA strengthened its communication with the boards of authorized institutions to enhance risk management and corporate culture in the banking sector. In addition to holding meetings with the boards or board committees, the HKMA also met separately with independent non-executive directors to exchange views on corporate culture and risk management. The HKMA also held trilateral meetings with authorized institutions and their external auditors. Furthermore, the HKMA assessed whether the remuneration systems of authorized institutions contribute to effective risk management.\n\nIn terms of capital adequacy levels, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) reviews the capital plans of authorized institutions, including their capital targets for the coming years, to prepare for the full implementation of Basel III's buffer capital requirements in 2019. Solvency stress tests for authorized institutions have also been improved in response to the current macroeconomic environment. The HKMA also carefully assesses the recovery plans of major retail banks and provides feedback on areas requiring improvement.\n\nIn addition to off-site reviews, the HKMA continues to conduct thematic assessments in conjunction with regular on-site inspections, with thematic assessments primarily applied to areas assessed as higher risk. This regulatory approach enables the HKMA to more effectively allocate regulatory resources to address the various new and significant risks faced by authorized institutions. In 2016, the HKMA conducted a total of 377 on-site inspections and thematic assessments. The focus of these inspections and assessments remained on credit risk management and monitoring, particularly concerning credit risks related to mainland China business; another key focus was combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The HKMA also increased the number of on-site inspections and thematic assessments related to liquidity risk, operational risk, and technology risk management. During the year, specialized review teams also conducted on-site inspections of authorized institutions' securities, investment products, insurance, and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses.\n\nTable 1 outlines the Financial Supervisory Commission’s regulatory work summary for 2016.\n\n# Supervision of Credit Risk\n\n# Loan growth and asset quality\n\nBank loans grew moderately in 2016. The total outstanding loan amount increased by 6.5% for the year, compared to an increase of 3.5% in 2015 (Table 2). Because the growth rate of customer deposits exceeded that of bank loans, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio decreased from 70.1% at the end of 2015 to 68.4% at the end of 2016.\n\nTable 2: Growth of Loans and Advances\n\nThe total amount of related loans in mainland China increased by 7% to HKD 356.4 billion by the end of 2016 (Table 3), including HKD 54.5 billion in loans accounted for by subsidiaries of banks registered in Hong Kong operating on the mainland.\n\nThe asset quality of the banking sector remained robust in 2016. Although the specific classified loan ratio for retail banking rose slightly from 0.69% at the end of 2015 to 0.72% at the end of 2016, it remained significantly below the long-term average of 2.4% since 2000. During the same period, the specific classified loan ratio for the overall banking sector increased from 0.73% to 0.85%. The asset quality of mainland-related loans in the banking sector showed a similar trend during the year; meanwhile, the specific classified loan ratio for these loans in retail banking rose slightly from 0.78% to 0.82%, and the related ratio for the overall banking sector also rose slightly from 0.77% a year earlier to 0.80%.\n\nThe HKMA has allocated substantial regulatory resources to ensure that authorized institutions continue to adopt prudent credit approval standards and maintain effective loan classification and provisioning systems. During the regulatory process, the HKMA has also closely monitored the increasing risk exposure of authorized institutions towards mainland Chinese private enterprises, as well as the credit risks arising from investments in debt securities aimed at boosting returns. In addition, the HKMA has conducted a special assessment on the credit risk management of authorized institutions in distributing high-risk investment products.\n\n# Property Mortgage Lending\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to closely monitor the property loan business of authorized institutions. Residential property prices began to decline in September 2015, but rebounded in March 2016, rising 8% for the year. The average loan-to-value ratio for new residential mortgage loans fell from 64% in September 2009, before the HKMA introduced its first countercyclical property loan measures, to 51% in December 2016. The average debt-to-income ratio for new residential mortgage loans also fell from 41% in August 2010, when the debt-to-income ratio ceiling was first introduced, to 34% in December 2016 (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 shows the average mortgage loan amount and debt-to-income ratio for newly constructed residential properties.\nThe Financial Services and Markets Commission introduced the debt-to-income ratio limit before launching the first round of countercyclical measures for property loans.\n\nAccording to the seventh round of countercyclical measures introduced by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) in February 2015, authorized institutions using the internal ratings-based approach to calculate credit risk capital requirements must extend the application of the 15% credit risk weighted asset floor from newly originated mortgage loans to their entire residential mortgage loan portfolio. This requirement took effect in June 2016.\n\nMore real estate developers are directly offering mortgage loans to property buyers during the year, with loan-to-value ratios often exceeding the levels permitted under the prudential requirements imposed by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on authorized institutions. The HKMA is closely monitoring this development and regularly communicating with authorized institutions to assess whether banks continue to effectively manage risks associated with real estate developers. In addition, at the request of the HKMA, the Land Registry has agreed to provide an electronic alert service to authorized institutions. When authorized institutions use this service, they will receive electronic alerts from the Land Registry whenever other mortgage documents related to properties they have mortgaged are submitted for registration. This service will help address situations where mortgage borrowers take out additional mortgages on the same property without prior approval from the authorized institution holding the mortgage. The Land Registry launched the electronic alert service in the first quarter of 2017.\n\n# Supervision of Business Operations and Technology Risks\n\nLike other international financial centers, Hong Kong faces increasingly severe cyber threats. In 2016, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) received reports from authorized institutions regarding unauthorized stock trading and attempts to breach their payment systems, and promptly took action to address the risks posed by these attacks. The HKMA issued electronic banking service alerts, warning the public to be cautious of online stock trading scams and recommending preventive measures. It also issued notices to authorized institutions, providing guidance on security measures that could be adopted to further strengthen monitoring of online banking services. Regarding cases involving attempts to breach bank payment systems, the HKMA had already alerted authorized institutions to be vigilant against such scams upon the first discovery of similar cases in Hong Kong. With the assistance of the police, the HKMA explained the methods used in these fraudulent activities and required authorized institutions to take these methods into account when enhancing monitoring measures for payment operations.\n\nTo further enhance the banking sector's ability to address cyber risks, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) launched the Cybersecurity Initiative in May 2016. This initiative comprises three pillars: the Cybersecurity Assessment Framework, a Professional Training Program, and a Cybersecurity Risk Information Sharing Platform (see the section on the \"Fintech Facilitation Office\" in the chapter titled \"Hong Kong's Status as an International Financial Center\"). In December, the HKMA issued a notice to authorized institutions outlining the implementation timeline for the Cybersecurity Assessment Framework.\n\nThe application of Fintech in the banking sector has seen significant development since 2016, with several authorized institutions launching new Fintech products. Developments in areas such as personal micropayment services, contactless mobile payments, and biometric authentication have been particularly notable. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority launched the Fintech Supervisory Sandbox in September, allowing authorized institutions to pilot their Fintech projects in a controlled environment without fully complying with the HKMA’s regulatory requirements. This arrangement allows authorized institutions to collect real-world data and user feedback early on, so they can make appropriate modifications before formally launching Fintech services. As of the end of 2016, a total of six applications for the Fintech Supervisory Sandbox had been approved, involving new Fintech products related to biometric authentication, securities trading, and blockchain for mortgage valuations. In November, the HKMA also raised the transaction limit for online banking personal micropayment services without dual authentication to HK$5,000 per account per day to meet the growing demand for convenient personal payment services.\n\nIn 2016, there were numerous fraud cases related to properties, involving fraudsters posing as property owners attempting to obtain benefits by applying for mortgage loans or selling the properties. Although these fraud cases did not involve authorized institutions, the HKMA continued to work closely with the Police and the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB) to provide guidance to authorized institutions on detecting and preventing these fraud cases from occurring within the banking sector. The HKMA published two issues of Operational Incidents Watch throughout the year to share lessons learned from operational incidents that had occurred in authorized institutions. The HKMA also conducted on-site inspections and thematic assessments of authorized institutions’ business operation risk management systems, fraud management approaches, trust\/custody business operations, and risk management and monitoring measures for preventing irregularities or unauthorized transactions.\n\n# Supervision of Capital and Liquidity Risk Management\n\nIn 2016, several major political events occurred, causing significant fluctuations in financial markets throughout the year. At the same time, U.S. interest rates continued to normalize, and the Federal Open Market Committee decided in December to raise the federal funds rate, the second such increase since the global financial crisis. To prepare for these events, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority maintained close contact with overseas regulators, assessed the impact on Hong Kong's banking system, and urged banks to remain vigilant and strengthen their risk management to address potential market challenges.\n\nIn terms of liquidity risk management, the Financial Supervisory Authority conducted additional liquidity stress tests to assess the banking system’s ability to withstand severe stress scenarios and followed up with licensed institutions to strengthen their resilience. Following a round of on-site reviews in 2015 focusing on interest rate risk management, the Financial Supervisory Authority conducted additional on-site reviews to assess the market risk management of licensed institutions and required licensed institutions with deficiencies in monitoring to make corrections.\n\n# Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority's risk-based anti-money laundering supervision includes on-site and off-site reviews (including regulatory communications with authorized institutions regarding specific incidents), primarily targeting areas with higher money laundering and terrorist financing risks. The reviews cover authorized institutions' assessments of money laundering and terrorist financing risks, the implementation of the risk-based approach, as well as their systems and procedures for transaction monitoring and sanctions compliance. In 2016, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's dedicated regulatory staff conducted 17 on-site reviews and 30 off-site reviews.\n\nIn terms of policy development, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) prioritizes addressing difficulties certain industries and individuals encounter when opening bank accounts, and issues guidelines and \"Frequently Asked Questions\" to clarify specific customer due diligence requirements, as well as the HKMA's regulatory expectations regarding a risk-based approach. At the same time, the HKMA continues to work closely with industry associations to issue guidance to help authorized institutions manage risks in certain areas, such as trade-related money laundering activities.\n"}
{"zh":"# 香港的國際金融中心地位\n\n香港維持其作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位。去年的稅務修訂有助營造有利環境，吸引跨國公司在港設立企業財資中心。為發展香港成為基建融資中心與金融科技樞紐，金管局在年內成立基建融資促進辦公室及金融科技促進辦公室。年內金管局向儲值支付工具發行人批出13個牌照。香港穩健的財政表現及龐大的對外資產淨值，繼續獲得信貸評級機構確認，其中標準普爾維持對香港AAA的評級。\n\n# 概覽\n\n受到環球金融市場波動及人民幣匯率前景不確定性影響，2016年全球離岸人民幣業務有所放緩。儘管如此，香港維持其作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位，處理全球約七成人民幣支付交易。深港股票市場交易互聯互通機制「深港通」於12月推出，標誌着內地資本帳開放的另一里程碑，並且是提升香港的國際金融中心地位的重要一步。金管局亦透過擴大對市場的人民幣流動性支援及推出措施增加人民幣市場流動性的透明度，強化金融基建。\n\n金管局於7月成立基建融資促進辦公室(IFFO)，透過匯聚主要持份者促進基建發展，並發展香港成為基建融資中心。截至2017年1月底，已有超過60間機構加入IFFO成為合作夥伴。年內金管局亦成功推動法例修訂的通過，以消除稅務不對稱及提供稅務優惠，鼓勵跨國及內地公司在香港設立企業財資中心，為金融及專業服務行業帶來更多商機。在香港駐設業務的機構投資者數目亦逐漸增加，其中作為全球第三大主權基金的阿布扎比投資局於10月宣布在香港成立海外辦事處，是該機構唯一設於阿布扎比以外的辦事處。\n\n國際貨幣基金組織（基金組織）在去年的第四條磋商討論中對我們致力鞏固香港作為國際金融中心的地位給予正面評價。年內金管局積極參與國際討論，致力推進全球與區內金融穩定。金管局亦與國際信貸評級機構保持緊密溝通，有關工作有助香港的信貸評級在2016年獲得主要信貸評級機構確認。\n\n香港金融基建的安全有效運作與持續發展，對鞏固香港作為國際金融中心及全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的競爭力發揮重要作用。處理銀行同業交易的4個即時支付結算(RTGS)系統及債務工具中央結算系統（CMU系統）在2016年達到100%的系統可供使用率，高於99.95%的目標水平。\n\n金管局在2016年進一步加強香港的零售支付金融基建。年內根據2016年11月全面生效的《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（《支付條例》）批出總共13個儲值支付工具牌照。電子支票服務涵蓋範圍亦已擴展至香港和廣東省（包括深圳）之間的跨境支付。\n\n為促進香港金融科技的發展，金管局於3月成立金融科技促進辦公室。年內實施的多項重要措施均取得理想進展。\n\n金管局推出一系列措施加強銀行業軟實力，包括(i)推出提升董事專業能力計劃；(ii)訂立整體業界的銀行從業員專業資歷架構；及(iii)推行消費者教育計劃。\n\n# 2016年回顧\n\n# 離岸人民幣業務\n\n2016年環球金融市場波動及人民幣匯率前景不確定性令全球離岸人民幣業務有所放緩。截至年底，香港人民幣客戶存款及存款證餘額合共為6,251億元人民幣，較上年減少38%（圖1）。年內離岸人民幣債券發行量降至528億元人民幣，經香港銀行處理的人民幣貿易結算額亦降至45,421億元人民幣。另一方面，香港銀行截至年底的人民幣貸款餘額為2,948億元人民幣，與上年相若（圖2）。人民幣RTGS系統的交易額維持於高位，於2016年平均每日處理的交易額為8,636億元人民幣。由此可見，儘管人民幣資金池有所縮減，但仍繼續支持大量人民幣金融中介活動在香港進行。根據環球銀行金融電信協會(SWIFT)統計數字，2016年香港處理約七成人民幣支付交易，足以證明香港作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位。\n\n圖1 人民幣客戶存款及存款證\n\n圖2 人民幣融資活動\n\n年內金管局與內地有關當局緊密合作爭取更大政策空間，推展香港人民幣業務。年內推出多項新措施，包括進一步加大內地銀行間債券市場及外匯市場對外開放，以及在12月推出「深港通」。因應跨境投資渠道及市場對流動性管理需求增加，金管局擴大人民幣流動資金安排。於10月，金管局將一級流動性提供行的數目由7間增加至9間，有關計劃的總額度亦由140億元人民幣增加至180億元人民幣。金管局人民幣流動資金安排使用情況的透明度亦提高，有助參加行更有效管理流動資金。\n\n在3月公布的國家「十三五」規劃再次肯定香港作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位，顯示中央政府支持香港進一步發展離岸人民幣業務。\n\n與此同時，金管局繼續加強與其他經濟體的合作，發展離岸人民幣業務。金管局亦積極參加各類活動，推廣香港作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐及內地「走出去策略跳板的主要角色，包括參與業界組織及私營機構舉辦的本地活動，以及在中國內地、德國、哈薩克斯坦和英國等地的境外活動。\n\n# 內地與香港關於建立更緊密經貿關係的安排\n\n在《內地與香港關於建立更緊密經貿關係的安排》框架下有關內地與香港基本實現服務貿易自由化的新協議，於2015年簽署。金管局繼續密切留意現行安排下的措施的實施情況，並與政府當局合作探討進步擴大內地市場對香港金融業的開放及便利措施。\n\n# 基建融資促進辦公室(IFFO)\n\n# IFFO的使命\n\nIFFO的使命是透過匯聚主要持份者，共同促進基建投融資。IFFO的職能是：\n- 提供一個資訊交流和經驗分享的平台；\n- 提升基建投融資方面的技能和知識；\n- 推廣市場及產品發展；\n- 及促進基建投融資活動。\n\n金管局總裁陳德霖先生（左七）於IFFO啟動儀式上聯同其他嘉賓祝酒。\n\n金管局於7月成立IFFO，其使命是透過匯聚主要持份者共同促進基建投融資。截至2017年1月底，已有超過60間來自中國內地、香港及海外的機構加入IFFO成為合作夥伴，當中包括多邊金融機構及發展銀行、公營機構投資者、私營機構投資者、資產管理公司、銀行、保險公司、基建項目發展及營運機構、專業服務公司及國際貿易協會（表1）。\n\nIFFO自成立以來取得良好進展。為致力提升技能，IFFO於10月聯同世界銀行集團旗下國際金融公司和瀚亞投資主辦行政人員工作坊，主題為「私營資金參與新興市場基建項目的投融資」。該工作坊獲得參與者非常正面的回應，有助增長知識及建立網絡。IFFO另於11月舉辦高層研討會，並邀請亞洲基礎設施投資銀行行長金立群先生主講及分享基建項目規劃、營運與管理的經驗。於7月，IFFO分別與國際金融公司及全球基礎設施中心簽訂《諒解備忘錄》，建立合作框架。另於12月分別與國家開發銀行及中國進出口銀行簽訂《諒解備忘錄》，透過IFFO平台促進該兩間銀行的基建項目融資。這些活動有助加強香港作為基建融資中心的地位及國際形象。\n\n金管局總裁陳德霖先生（前左）與國際金融公司執行副總裁兼首席執行官菲利普• 勒奧魯先生（前右）簽署《諒解備忘錄》，促成兩者合作利用IFFO平台，為區內基建投融資營造更有效率及有利的市場環境。\n\n金管局總裁陳德霖先生（前左）與全球基礎設施中心首席執行官Chris Heathcote先生（前右）簽署《諒解備忘錄》，建立策略性合作框架，促進基建項目融資。\n\n金管局總裁陳德霖先生（左）與國家開發銀行董事長胡懷邦先生簽署《諒解備忘錄》，加強該行與金管局的合作。\n\n# 企業財資中心\n\n為進一步吸引跨國公司在香港設立企業財資中心，金管局與政府當局合作，營造一個對企業財資中心有利的稅務環境。具體上，《2016年稅務（修訂）（第2號）條例》（《修訂條例》）於6月通過，容許企業在符合指明條件下，在計算利得稅時可獲扣減經營集團內部融資業務的利息支出，以及就合資格企業財資中心指明財資業務的利潤，寬減利得稅百分之五十（即降至8.25%）。表2簡載《修訂條例》部分要點：\n\n除立法工作外，金管局亦積極向跨國和內地企業推廣在香港設立企業財資中心的優勢。截至年底，金管局已接觸近400間公司、金融機構及行業組織。金管局亦於11月與香港中國企業協會簽署《諒解備忘錄》，協助香港的中資企業進一步了解及更多利用我們的企業財資中心平台。\n\n# 推廣資產管理業務\n\n金管局繼續致力推廣香港作為資產管理中心。根據證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會），從事資產管理的持牌法團數目於2016年底為1,300間，按年增加近15%。根據《亞洲創業投資期刊》，2016年在香港的私募基金公司（包括證監會持牌法團及非證監會持牌法團）數目亦增加4.6%，至431間。迄今全球百大資產管理公司中有接近70間，以及內地二十大互惠基金公司中的大多數，已在香港設有業務或相聯公司。在香港駐設業務的機構投資者數目亦逐漸增加，其中作為全球第三大主權基金的阿布扎比投資局於10月宣布在香港成立海外辦事處，是該機構於阿布扎比以外設立的唯一辦事處。\n\n# 引入開放式基金型公司結構\n\n為吸引基金來港註冊，金管局繼續與政府及業界合作，營造更有利的稅務及監管環境。於6月，《2016年證券及期貨（修訂）條例草案》獲得通過，引入開放式基金型公司結構，令香港的基金註冊平台更多元化，並為基金經理營造更靈活的經營環境，從而加強香港作為國際資產管理中心的競爭力。\n\n# 伊斯蘭金融\n\n金管局繼續致力增加市場對伊斯蘭金融的認識和了解，包括聯同業界公會舉辦及參與伊斯蘭金融研討會及講座，並與市場參與者分享有關發行伊斯蘭債券的經驗，鼓勵它們使用香港的平台。繼成功發行上兩批伊斯蘭債券後，金管局與政府一直緊密合作，在市場條件合適時推出第三批伊斯蘭債券。\n","terms":{"10年Plus同心展關懷標誌":["10 years plus Caring

Last year’s tax reforms helped create a favorable environment to attract multinational corporations to establish corporate treasury centers in Hong Kong. To develop Hong Kong into an infrastructure financing center and a fintech hub, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority established the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office and the Fintech Facilitation Office during the year. The HKMA issued 13 licenses to stored value payment tool issuers during the year. Hong Kong’s sound fiscal performance and substantial net foreign assets continue to be confirmed by credit rating agencies, with Standard & Poor’s maintaining its AAA rating for Hong Kong.\n\n# Overview\n\nAffected by global financial market volatility and uncertainty over the RMB exchange rate outlook, offshore RMB business slowed down globally in 2016. Nevertheless, Hong Kong maintained its position as the global offshore RMB business hub, processing approximately seven out of ten RMB payment transactions globally. The Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect, launched in December, marked another milestone in China's capital account opening and represented an important step in enhancing Hong Kong's status as an international financial center. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority also strengthened financial infrastructure by expanding RMB liquidity support to the market and introducing measures to increase the transparency of RMB market liquidity.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) established the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO) in July to promote infrastructure development by bringing together key stakeholders and to develop Hong Kong into a hub for infrastructure financing. As of the end of January 2017, more than 60 institutions had joined IFFO as partners. During the year, the HKMA also successfully pushed through legislative amendments to eliminate tax asymmetries and provide tax incentives, encouraging multinational and mainland companies to establish corporate treasury centers in Hong Kong, thereby creating more business opportunities for the financial and professional services sectors. The number of institutional investors operating in Hong Kong has also been gradually increasing. Among them, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, the world's third-largest sovereign fund, announced in October the establishment of an overseas office in Hong Kong, which is the only office located outside of Abu Dhabi.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) gave a positive assessment of our commitment to consolidating Hong Kong’s position as an international financial center during last year’s Article IV consultation discussions. This year, the HKMA has actively participated in international discussions, striving to promote global and regional financial stability. The HKMA has also maintained close communication with international credit rating agencies, work that helped Hong Kong’s credit ratings to be affirmed by major credit rating agencies in 2016.\n\nThe safe and effective operation and continued development of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure play a vital role in consolidating Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial center and a global hub for offshore RMB business. The four real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems for interbank transactions and the Central Securities Clearing System (CMU) achieved 100% system availability in 2016, exceeding the target level of 99.95%.\n\nThe HKMA further strengthened Hong Kong's retail payment financial infrastructure in 2016. During the year, a total of 13 stored value facility licenses were issued in accordance with the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (the \"Payment Ordinance\"), which came into full effect in November 2016. The scope of electronic cheque services has also been extended to cross-border payments between Hong Kong and Guangdong Province (including Shenzhen).\n\nTo promote the development of Hong Kong's fintech industry, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) established the Fintech Facilitation Office in March. Several key initiatives implemented this year have made satisfactory progress.\n\nThe Monetary Authority has introduced a series of measures to strengthen the soft power of the banking industry, including (i) launching a program to enhance the professional capabilities of directors; (ii) establishing an overall professional qualification framework for banking practitioners across the industry; and (iii) implementing a consumer education program.\n\n# 2016 Retrospective\n\n# Offshore Renminbi Business\n\nThe volatility in global financial markets in 2016 and the uncertainty in the outlook for the RMB exchange rate led to a slowdown in offshore RMB activities. As of the end of the year, the combined balance of RMB customer deposits and deposit certificates in Hong Kong amounted to 625.1 billion RMB, a 38% decrease compared to the previous year (Figure 1). The issuance of offshore RMB bonds during the year dropped to 52.8 billion RMB, and the amount of RMB trade settlements processed through Hong Kong banks also declined to 45,421 billion RMB. On the other hand, the balance of RMB loans held by Hong Kong banks as of the end of the year was 2,948 billion RMB, similar to the previous year (Figure 2). The transaction volume of the RMB RTGS system remained at a high level, with an average daily processing volume of 8,636 billion RMB in 2016. This shows that although the RMB funding pool has shrunk, it continues to support a significant amount of RMB financial intermediation activities in Hong Kong. According to statistics from SWIFT, Hong Kong handled about 70% of RMB payment transactions in 2016, which demonstrates Hong Kong's position as the global offshore RMB business hub.\n\nFigure 1: Renminbi client deposits and deposit certificates\n\nFigure 2: RMB Financing Activities\n\nWithin the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) worked closely with relevant mainland authorities to secure greater policy space for developing RMB business in Hong Kong. Several new measures were introduced during the year, including further expanding the opening-up of the mainland interbank bond market and foreign exchange market, as well as launching the \"Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect\" in December. In response to increased demand for cross-border investment channels and liquidity management, the HKMA expanded its RMB liquidity arrangements. In October, the HKMA increased the number of primary liquidity providers from seven to nine, and the total quota of the arrangement was also raised from 14 billion RMB to 18 billion RMB. The HKMA also enhanced the transparency of its RMB liquidity arrangements, helping participating banks more effectively manage their liquidity.\n\nThe national \"13th Five-Year Plan,\" published in March, reaffirmed Hong Kong's status as the global offshore RMB business hub, demonstrating the central government's support for Hong Kong to further develop its offshore RMB business.\n\nAt the same time, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to strengthen cooperation with other economies to develop offshore RMB business. The HKMA is also actively participating in various activities to promote Hong Kong's role as the global offshore RMB hub and as a key platform for China's \"going global\" strategy. These activities include participating in local events organized by industry groups and private institutions, as well as overseas events in mainland China, Germany, Kazakhstan, and the United Kingdom.\n\n# Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement between the Mainland and Hong Kong\n\nThe new agreement under the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA) between the Mainland and Hong Kong, regarding the substantial liberalization of trade in services, was signed in 2015. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to closely monitor the implementation of measures under the current arrangement and collaborates with government authorities to explore further expanding market access and facilitating measures for Hong Kong’s financial sector in the Mainland market.\n\n# Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO)\n\n# IFFO’s mission\n\nIFFO’s mission is to promote infrastructure investment and financing by bringing together key stakeholders. IFFO’s functions are:\n- To provide a platform for information exchange and experience sharing;\n- To enhance skills and knowledge in infrastructure investment and financing;\n- To promote market and product development;\n- And to facilitate infrastructure investment and financing activities.\n\nEddie Yue, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (seventh from the left), toasting with other guests at the IFFO launch ceremony.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority established IFFO in July, with the mission of promoting infrastructure investment and financing by bringing together key stakeholders. As of the end of January 2017, more than 60 institutions from mainland China, Hong Kong, and overseas had joined IFFO as partners, including multilateral financial institutions and development banks, public sector investors, private sector investors, asset management companies, banks, insurance companies, infrastructure project developers and operators, professional service firms, and international trade associations (Table 1).\n\nSince its establishment, IFFO has made steady progress. To enhance skills, IFFO organized an executive workshop in October, co-hosted with the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and Hanwha Investment & Securities, focusing on \"private participation in infrastructure project finance in emerging markets.\" The workshop received very positive feedback, helping participants gain knowledge and build networks. In November, IFFO held a senior executive seminar, inviting Mr. Jin Liqun, President of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, to speak and share his experience in infrastructure project planning, operation, and management. In July, IFFO signed Memorandums of Understanding with the International Finance Corporation and the Global Infrastructure Center, establishing a cooperation framework. In December, IFFO also signed Memorandums of Understanding with the China Development Bank and the China Export-Import Bank, leveraging the IFFO platform to facilitate infrastructure financing for these two banks. These activities have helped strengthen Hong Kong's position and international reputation as an infrastructure financing hub.\n\nThe Financial Services and Markets Commission Chairman Mr. Chen Der-lin (left) and World Bank Group Executive Vice President and CEO Philippe Le Houerou (right) signed Memorandums of Understanding, facilitating cooperation through the IFFO platform to create a more efficient and favorable market environment for regional infrastructure investment and financing.\n\nThe Financial Services and Markets Commission Chairman Mr. Chen Der-lin (left) and Global Infrastructure Hub CEO Mr. Chris Heathcote (right) signed a Memorandums of Understanding to establish a strategic cooperation framework to promote infrastructure project financing.\n\nMr. Chen Der-lin, Chairman of the Financial Supervisory Commission (left), and Mr. Hu Huai-bang, Chairman of the Export-Import Bank of China, signed Memorandums of Understanding to strengthen cooperation between the bank and the Financial Supervisory Commission.\n\n# Corporate Treasury Centres\n\nTo further attract multinational companies to establish enterprise financial centers in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has collaborated with government authorities to create a favorable tax environment for enterprise financial centers. Specifically, the Tax (Amendment) (No. 2) Ordinance 2016 (Revised tax Regime) was passed in June, allowing companies to deduct interest expenses incurred in operating internal financing activities of their group under specified conditions. Additionally, a 50% reduction in profits tax (i.e., down to 8.25%) applies to profits derived from specified financial services of eligible enterprise financial centers. Table 2 summarizes key points of the Revised tax Regime:\n\nIn addition to legislative work, the HKMA has also been actively promoting the advantages of establishing corporate treasury centres in Hong Kong to multinational and Mainland enterprises. As of the end of the year, the HKMA had contacted nearly 400 companies, financial institutions, and industry organizations. The HKMA also signed a MOU with the Hong Kong China Enterprises Association in November to help Hong Kong-based Chinese-funded enterprises further understand and make greater use of our corporate treasury centre platform.\n\n# Promote Asset Management Services\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to promote Hong Kong as an asset management center. According to the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), the number of licensed institutions engaged in asset management reached 1,300 by the end of 2016, representing an annual increase of nearly 15%. According to the Asian Venture Capital Journal, the number of private fund companies in Hong Kong (including SFC-licensed and non-SFC-licensed institutions) also increased by 4.6% to 431 in 2016. To date, nearly 70 of the world's top 100 asset management companies, as well as most of the top 20 mutual fund companies in mainland China, have established a presence or affiliated companies in Hong Kong. The number of institutional investors with a presence in Hong Kong is also gradually increasing. Among them, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, the world's third-largest sovereign wealth fund, announced in October the establishment of an overseas office in Hong Kong – its only office outside of Abu Dhabi.\n\n# Introducing Open-End Fund Corporate Structure\n\nTo attract fund registration in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to collaborate with the government and industry to create a more favorable tax and regulatory environment. In June, the \"Securities and Futures (Amendment) Bill 2016\" was passed, introducing the open-ended fund company structure, diversifying Hong Kong’s fund registration platform and creating a more flexible operating environment for fund managers, strengthening Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international asset management center.\n\n# Islamic Finance\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to be committed to increasing market awareness and understanding of Islamic finance, including co-organizing and participating in Islamic finance seminars and talks with industry associations, and sharing experiences with market participants regarding the issuance of Islamic bonds, encouraging them to utilize the Hong Kong platform. Following the successful issuance of the first two tranches of Islamic bonds, the HKMA has been working closely with the government to launch a third tranche of Islamic bonds when market conditions are favorable.\n"}
{"zh":"# 儲備管理\n\n2016年是充滿意外和黑天鵝事件的一年，環球金融市場出現大波動和震盪。2016年年初市場憂慮內地經濟硬着陸及全球增長放緩，促使環球股市大幅下挫。6月英國脫歐公投和11月美國大選結果亦出人意表。儘管投資環境困難，金管局在過去幾年已採取連串防禦措施，增強外匯基金的抗震能力，因此外匯基金在2016年仍錄得2% 的整體投資回報。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》，外匯基金的首要目的是直接或間接影響港元匯價，亦可運用於保持香港貨幣及金融體系穩定健全，藉此保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。外匯基金由財政司司長掌有控制權，並投資於其經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後認為合適的證券或其他資產。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標及組合結構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會為外匯基金制定下列投資目標：\n(a) 保障資本；\n(b) 確保整體貨幣基礎在任何時候都由流通性極高的美元資產提供十足支持；\n(c) 確保流動資金足以維持貨幣及金融穩定；以及\n(d) 在符合上述(a)至(c)項的前提下盡量爭取投資回報，以保障基金的長期購買力。\n\n以上目標全面顧及外匯基金的法定目的，並已於外匯基金的組合結構及目標資產分布中反映。\n\n外匯基金大致上分成兩個主要組合：支持組合及投資組合。支持組合持有流通性極高的美元資產，按照貨幣發行局制度的規定為貨幣基礎提供十足支持。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債市及股市，以保障資產的價值及長期購買力。這兩個組合整體債券與股票的長線目標分布比率為71比29。以目標貨幣比重計，91%的資產分配予美元及港元，其餘9%分配予其他貨幣。\n\n為能更妥善管理風險及提高中長期回報，金管局以審慎及循序漸進方式將外匯基金的部分資產分散投資至較多元化的資產類別，包括新興巿場及內地債券與股票、私募股權，以及海外投資物業。新興巿場及內地債券與股票由投資組合持有，私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合持有。長期增長組合的市值上限為外匯基金累計盈餘的三分之一，但因應部分未來基金投放於長期資產，市值上限還有增加的空間。\n\n策略性資產組合於2007年設立，以持有政府基於策略性目的而為外匯基金帳目購入的香港交易及結算所有限公司股份。由於這個組合性質獨特，因此外匯基金的投資表現評估並無將其包括在內。\n\n# 於外匯基金的存款\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定組織的存款，利率一般與投資組合的表現掛鈎2，惟未來基金存款則除外。未來基金存款的利率與投資組合及長期增長組合的表現掛鈎，實際利率視乎組合比重而定。於2016年底，未來基金在投資組合與長期增長組合的比重為80：20。預期截至2018年底，未來基金存款中與長期增長組合掛鈎的部分會逐步增加至約50%。\n\n# 投資程序\n\n外匯基金的投資程序分別以策略性資產分布及戰略性資產分布作基礎。策略性資產分布，即投資基準反映的分布情況，顯示外匯基金為達到投資目標而可以作出的最佳長線資產分布。外匯基金以策略性分布作為指引，對資產進行戰略性分布，以爭取超越基準的回報。因此，實際分布往往會與基準分布（亦即策略性分布）有所偏離，而實際與基準分布之間的差距稱為「戰略性偏離」。財政司司長經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後制定投資基準及戰略性偏離的限度，金管局獲授權決定戰略性資產分布。投資組合經理可在戰略性偏離的限度內選持倉盤，從短期市場變化中獲利。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局儲備管理部職員直接管理外匯基金約74%的投資，其中包括整個支持組合及部分投資組合。該部分投資組合投資於環球定息市場，並透過衍生工具執行外匯基金的宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 外聘投資經理\n\n除透過內部職員管理資產外，金管局亦僱用外聘投資經理負責管理外匯基金約26%的資產，其中包括所有上市股票組合及其他特別資產。僱用外聘投資經理的目的，是要運用市場上最佳的專業投資技術為外匯基金投資，並讓外匯基金受惠於多元化的投資方式，以及讓內部專業人員汲取市場知識與資訊。\n\n僱用外聘投資經理的相關支出包括基金管理與託管費、交易費、預扣稅及其他稅項。這些支出主要受市場因素影響而每年不同。\n\n金管局支持證券及期貨事務監察委員會於2016年3月7日發布的《負責任的擁有權原則》（《原則》）。《原則》屬自願性質，旨在協助投資者釐定如何以最佳方法履行其於香港上市公司的投資的擁有權責任。就外匯基金的管理而言，金管局鼓勵獲委任負責管理香港股票組合的外聘基金經理在管理有關投資時採納《原則》。\n\n# 風險管理及監察\n\n近年金融市場波動極大，凸顯風險管理的重要。金管局為內部及外聘投資經理所管理的投資組合均訂立嚴格管控措施及投資指引，並密切監察對指引及法規的遵守情況；另亦採用風險管控工具來評估在正常及極度不利市況下的市場風險。金管局亦進行詳細的投資表現因素分析，務求能最有效地運用內部及外聘投資經理的投資管理技術。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2016年的金融市場\n\n2016年環球金融市場出現大波動和震盪。股票市場方面，1月市場憂慮內地經濟硬着陸及全球增長放緩，促使香港及其他主要股市大幅下挫，直至2月中旬市場才穩定下來。6月英國脫歐公投及11月美國大選結果相繼出人意表，但股市在經歷短暫下挫後迅速收復失地。全年計，環球股市普遍表現理想。\n\n債券市場方面，第1季商品價格進一步下跌加深市場對全球增長放緩及低通脹的憂慮，加上第2季英國脫歐公投帶來的不明朗因素及市場對中央銀行維持寬鬆政策的預期，加大了市場對安全資產的需求，支持政府債市於2016年上半年有不俗表現。其中10年期美國國庫券收益率在7月跌至1.36%的歷史低位。然而，在下半年由於市場對美國加息的預期升溫，尤其在美國總統選舉後，美國國庫券收益率飆升。其他主要政府債券的收益率亦上升，但升幅較小。\n\n貨幣市場方面，美元在2016年繼續走強，美元匯價指數升至14年來的高位。美元持續強勢，是受到美元與其他主要貨幣的利率差距擴大所支持。雖然日圓兌美元於2016年上升約3%，歐元兌美元下跌約3%。在英國脫歐公投結果帶來的不明朗因素持續困擾下，英鎊兌美元於年內亦下跌16%，是自2008年以來的最大跌幅。\n\n表1列載主要貨幣、債巿及股市在2016年的表現。\n\n表1 2016年市場回報\n股市表現按照年內指數價格變動計算。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n儘管金融市場大幅波動，外匯基金在2016年仍錄得681億港元投資收入，包括外地股票收益286億港元、香港股票收益53億港元、債券收益331億港元、外匯基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資收益169億港元，以及非港元資產外匯估值下調158億港元。由於去年美元匯價急升，外匯基金非美元投資轉作港元時無可避免出現外匯估值下調。另一方面，策略性資產組合錄得7億港元估值虧損。\n\n於2016年年底，外匯基金的資產總額達36,187億港元。長期增長組合投資的市值總計1,818億港元，當中包括私募股權1,168億港元及房地產650億港元，已承擔但尚未提取作投資的總額為1,338億港元。\n\n儘管投資環境挑戰不絕，外匯基金在2016年仍錄得2%的投資回報率（不包括策略性資產組合）。長期增長組合自2009年開展投資以來的內部回報率年率約為12%。\n\n由於外圍投資環境持續惡化，過去幾年金管局已作出一系列防禦部署，包括縮短債券組合年期、增持現金及大幅減持非美元及非港元資產。我們亦加快多元化投資的步伐，特別是長期增長組合的投資。這些部署大大增強外匯基金的抗震能力。\n\n圖1列明外匯基金由1994至2016年的年度回報率。表2顯示外匯基金在2016年的投資回報率及不同年期的平均投資回報率。外匯基金在過去3年的平均回報率為0.9%、過去5年為2.0%、過去10年為2.6%，以及由1994年起為4.8%。表3列載外匯基金資產於2016年12月31日的貨幣比重。\n\n圖

volatility and turbulence. At the beginning of 2016, market concerns over the hard landing of the domestic economy and the slowdown in global growth led to a significant decline in global stock markets. The UK referendum on leaving the EU in June and the US election results in November were also unexpected. Despite the challenging investment environment, the Monetary Authority had implemented a series of defensive measures over the past few years to enhance the resilience of the foreign exchange fund, resulting in a 2% overall investment return for the foreign exchange fund in 2016.\n\n# Exchange Fund\n\nAccording to the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the primary objective of the Exchange Fund is to influence the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar directly or indirectly, and may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of the monetary and financial system in Hong Kong, thereby maintaining Hong Kong’s position as an international financial centre. The Exchange Fund is controlled by the Financial Secretary and invests in securities or other assets considered appropriate after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee.\n\n# Foreign exchange fund management.\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nThe Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee has set the following investment objectives for the Foreign Exchange Fund:\n(a) To safeguard capital;\n(b) To ensure that the overall monetary base is at all times fully backed by highly liquid U.S. dollar assets;\n(c) To ensure that sufficient liquidity is available to maintain monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) To seek investment returns as far as possible, subject to the above (a) to (c), in order to protect the Fund's long-term purchasing power.\n\nThe aforementioned objectives fully take into account the statutory purposes of the foreign exchange fund and have been reflected in the fund's portfolio structure and target asset allocation.\n\nThe foreign exchange fund is broadly divided into two main portfolios: supporting portfolio and investment portfolio. The supporting portfolio holds highly liquid U.S. dollar assets, providing ample backing for the currency base as stipulated by the currency issuance system. The investment portfolio primarily invests in the bond and stock markets of member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to safeguard asset value and long-term purchasing power. The overall long-term target distribution ratio of bonds and stocks for these two portfolios is 71 to 29. Measured by target currency weighting, 91% of assets are allocated to the U.S. dollar and Hong Kong dollar, with the remaining 9% allocated to other currencies.\n\nTo more effectively manage risks and enhance long-term returns, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is dispersing a portion of the Foreign Exchange Fund's assets into more diversified asset categories in a prudent and gradual manner, including emerging market and mainland bonds and equities, private equity, and overseas real estate investments. Emerging market and mainland bonds and equities are held by the investment portfolio, while private equity and real estate investments are held by the long-term growth portfolio. The market value cap of the long-term growth portfolio is set at one-third of the Foreign Exchange Fund's accumulated surplus, but there is still room for increasing the cap due to some future fund allocations to long-term assets.\n\nThe Strategic Asset Portfolio was established in 2007 to hold shares of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited purchased by the government for strategic purposes under the foreign exchange fund account. Due to its unique nature, the investment performance assessment of the foreign exchange fund does not include this portfolio.\n\n# Deposits in the Foreign Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund occasionally accepts deposits from the Fiscal Reserves, government funds, and statutory bodies, with interest rates generally linked to the performance of the investment portfolio, except for future fund deposits. The interest rates on future fund deposits are linked to the performance of both the investment portfolio and the long-term growth portfolio, with the actual interest rate depending on the portfolio weighting. As of the end of 2016, the weighting of future fund deposits between the investment portfolio and the long-term growth portfolio was 80:20. It is expected that by the end of 2018, the portion of future fund deposits linked to the long-term growth portfolio will gradually increase to approximately 50%.\n\n# Investment Process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is based on both strategic asset allocation and tactical asset allocation. Strategic asset allocation, which reflects the investment benchmark, shows the optimal long-term asset allocation that the Exchange Fund can make in order to achieve its investment objectives. The Exchange Fund uses strategic allocation as a guide to carry out tactical allocation in order to seek returns that exceed the benchmark. Therefore, the actual allocation often deviates from the benchmark allocation (i.e., the strategic allocation), and the difference between the actual allocation and the benchmark allocation is referred to as \"tactical deviations.\" The Financial Secretary sets the investment benchmark and the limits of tactical deviations after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is authorized to determine the strategic asset allocation. Portfolio managers can hold positions within the limits of tactical deviations to profit from short-term market fluctuations.\n\n# Investment Management\n\n# Direct Investment\n\nStaff of the Currency Authority's Reserve Management Department directly manage approximately 74% of the Foreign Exchange Fund's investments, including the entire support portfolio and part of the investment portfolio. This portion of the investment portfolio is invested in the global fixed-income market and executes the Foreign Exchange Fund's macro risk management strategy through derivative instruments.\n\n# External Managers\n\nBesides managing assets through internal staff, the Financial Supervisory Commission also hires external investment managers to manage approximately 26% of the foreign exchange fund's assets, including all listed stock portfolios and other special assets. The purpose of hiring external investment managers is to utilize the best professional investment techniques available in the market for the foreign exchange fund's investments, and to allow the foreign exchange fund to benefit from diversified investment approaches, as well as to allow internal professionals to learn market knowledge and information.\n\nThe related expenses of hiring an external investment manager include fund management and custody fees, transaction fees, withholding and other taxes. These expenses are primarily influenced by market factors and vary each year.\n\nThe HKMA supports the Securities and Futures Ordinance's \"Principles of Responsible Ownership\" (\"Principles\"), published by the Securities and Futures Affairs Committee on March 7, 2016. The Principles are voluntary in nature and aim to assist investors in determining how to best fulfill their ownership responsibilities in their investments in Hong Kong-listed companies. In terms of the management of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA encourages externally appointed fund managers responsible for managing Hong Kong equity portfolios to adopt the Principles when managing such investments.\n\n# Risk Management and Compliance\n\nIn recent years, financial markets have experienced significant volatility, highlighting the importance of risk management. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has established strict control measures and investment guidelines for investment portfolios managed by both internal and externally hired investment managers, and closely monitors compliance with these guidelines and regulations. Additionally, the HKMA employs risk management tools to assess market risks under normal and extremely adverse market conditions. The HKMA also conducts a detailed analysis of investment performance factors to ensure the most effective utilization of the investment management capabilities of both internal and external investment managers.\n\n# Foreign exchange fund performance\n\n# The financial markets in 2016.\n\nIn 2016, global financial markets experienced significant volatility. Stock markets reacted to concerns in January about a potential economic slowdown in China and globally, leading to sharp declines in Hong Kong and other major markets, which stabilized by mid-February. Unexpected outcomes – the UK’s Brexit referendum in June and the US presidential election in November – initially caused brief downturns, but markets quickly recovered. Overall, global stock markets performed well throughout the year.\n\nIn the bond market, further declines in commodity prices in the first quarter deepened concerns about a slowdown in global growth and low inflation. Combined with uncertainties arising from the UK Brexit referendum in the second quarter and market expectations that central banks would maintain loose monetary policies, these factors increased demand for safe assets, supporting the government bond market's strong performance in the first half of 2016. The yield on 10-year US Treasury bonds fell to a historical low of 1.36% in July. However, in the second half of the year, rising market expectations of US interest rate hikes, particularly after the US presidential election, caused US Treasury yields to surge. Yields on other major government bonds also rose, but to a lesser extent.\n\nIn the foreign exchange market, the US dollar continued to strengthen in 2016, with the dollar exchange rate index reaching a 14-year high. The dollar's continued strength was supported by the widening interest rate differential between the dollar and other major currencies. Although the yen against the dollar rose by about 3% in 2016, the euro against the dollar fell by about 3%. The pound against the dollar also fell by 16% during the year, marking the largest decline since 2008, amid ongoing uncertainty caused by the Brexit referendum results.\n\nTable 1 shows the performance of major currencies, bond markets, and stock markets in 2016.\n\nTable 1: 2016 Market Returns. Stock market performance is calculated based on index price changes during the year.\n\n# Foreign exchange fund performance\n\nDespite significant volatility in the financial markets, the Exchange Fund still recorded investment income of HKD 68.1 billion in 2016, including equity income of HKD 28.6 billion from overseas stocks, HKD 5.3 billion from Hong Kong stocks, bond income of HKD 33.1 billion, other investment income of HKD 16.9 billion from investments held by subsidiaries of the Exchange Fund, and a foreign exchange valuation adjustment of HKD 15.8 billion due to non-Hong Kong dollar assets. Due to the sharp rise in the US dollar exchange rate last year, a foreign exchange valuation adjustment was unavoidable when non-US dollar investments of the Exchange Fund were converted to Hong Kong dollars. On the other hand, the strategic asset portfolio recorded a valuation loss of HKD 7 billion.\n\nBy the end of 2016, the total assets of the Foreign Exchange Fund reached 36,187 billion Hong Kong dollars. The total market value of long-term growth portfolio investments amounted to 1,818 billion Hong Kong dollars, which included 1,168 billion Hong Kong dollars in private equity and 650 billion Hong Kong dollars in real estate. The total amount committed but not yet drawn down for investment was 1,338 billion Hong Kong dollars.\n\nDespite persistent challenges in the investment environment, the foreign exchange fund still achieved an investment return of 2% in 2016 (excluding strategic asset allocation). The long-term growth portfolio’s annualized internal rate of return since commencing investments in 2009 is approximately 12%.\n\nDue to the continued deterioration of the external investment environment, the Financial Supervisory Commission has made a series of defensive arrangements in recent years, including shortening the maturity of bond portfolios, increasing holdings of cash, and significantly reducing holdings of non-US dollar and non-Hong Kong dollar assets. We have also accelerated the pace of diversified investments, particularly in long-term growth portfolios. These arrangements have greatly enhanced the resilience of the foreign exchange fund.\n\nFigure 1 shows the annual return rates of the Foreign Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2016. Table 2 displays the investment return rate of the Foreign Exchange Fund in 2016 and the average investment return rates for different periods. The average return rate of the Foreign Exchange Fund over the past 3 years was 0.9%, over the past 5 years was 2.0%, over the past 10 years was 2.6%, and from 1994 onwards was 4.8%. Table 3 lists the currency composition of the Foreign Exchange Fund's assets as of December 31, 2016.\n\nFigure 1 Foreign exchange fund investment returns (1994 to 2016)\n\n1.

促進銀行及金融體系穩定，包括：\n    - 加強監理能力，以管理銀行日益增加的科技風險及新的金融科技項目，以及應對銀行在區內及業務上的擴展；\n    - 加強打擊清洗黑錢及恐怖分子資金籌集活動的監管及執法工作，並為2018年打擊清洗黑錢財務特別行動組織相互評估計劃作好準備；\n    - 作好實施《金融機構（處置機制）條例》的規劃及籌備工作，以根據國際標準處理金融業「大到不能倒」的問題；及\n    - 加強監理能力以配合有關資本及市場風險的新國際標準，並增撥資源處理消費者保障事宜及銀行投訴。\n- 因應進一步推動外匯基金投資產品多元化所牽涉的更多投資工作，加強投資、風險管理及其他相關支援，同時強化策略性資產分配及投資程序，以應對挑戰日增的投資環境。\n- 制定及實施人才發展計劃，並加強相關資源，確保金管局具備所需的人力資源應對市場發展及未來的挑戰。\n- 加強貨幣政策方面的研究及貨幣統計資料的處理，以及提供資源處理就儲值支付工具及零售支付系統的牌照╱指定及相關監管事宜而作出的查詢及投訴。\n\n表1按部門列出金管局的職位編制及實際職員人數。\n表1 2017年1月1日金管局職位編制及實際職員人數\n\n金管局調配臨時資源以應付其他工作，並借調員工至國際或本地機構，例如國際貨幣基金組織（基金組織）及金融發展局，為香港或金管局有份參與的工作或政策提供協助。此外，金管局派調員工到香港存款保障委員會及財資市場公會，以提供全職或協助性質的運作支援。\n\n# 薪酬福利政策及薪酬檢討機制\n\n財政司司長透過外匯基金諮詢委員會聽取其轄下管治委員會提供的意見，並參考市場薪酬水平及做法，決定金管局員工的薪酬及服務條件。薪酬組合包括現金薪酬及公積金，另設一些基本福利。現金薪酬包括每月固定薪酬（即基本薪酬）及根據員工工作表現每年一次過發放的浮動薪酬。\n\n財政司司長每年檢討金管局員工薪酬時，會透過外匯基金諮詢委員會聽取其轄下管治委員會的建議，並考慮管治委員會對金管局過去一年的表現評估、獨立人力資源顧問公司進行的金融業薪酬調查結果，以及其他相關因素。個別工作表現優秀的員工的薪酬亦可能獲得特別調整，以保持其薪酬競爭力。\n\n金管局按個別員工的工作表現，分配獲批准用作調整年度固定薪酬或發放浮動薪酬的款項；而用於專業投資人員的浮動薪酬制度，則旨在加強其投資表現與薪酬的連繫。助理總裁或以上職級員工的固定薪酬調整或浮動薪酬的發放，是由財政司司長經參考管治委員會的意見後批准，有關員工在會議討論到其薪酬的議案時會避席。主管及以下職級員工的固定薪酬調整或浮動薪酬的發放，則由金管局總裁根據財政司司長授權，並按照獲批准用作支付薪酬的整筆款項來決定。\n\n# 高層人員薪酬\n\n表2列載2016年高層人員的薪酬資料。\n\n1. 除累積年假外，服務不足1年的員工所得的實際薪酬會化作全年計算，以得出有關職級的平均全年薪酬。2. 本表所載員工人數包括服務不足1年的員工。高級助理總裁職級人數包括香港按揭證券有限公司總裁在內。3. 其他福利包括公積金、醫療及人壽保險，以及年內累積的年假。這些福利會因應個別高層人員的服務條件而有所不同。\n","terms":{"10年Plus同心展關懷標誌":["10 years plus Caring Organisation Logo"],"2016年存款保障計劃（修訂）條例":["Deposit Protection Scheme (Amendment) Ordinance

education activities and various other channels, enhancing public understanding of the HKMA’s policies and operations. Throughout the year, the HKMA continued to strengthen institutional governance, including promoting staff to enhance their professional capabilities, strictly controlling finances and strengthening information technology security, in order to meet the challenges brought about by the implementation of new measures and an increasingly heavy workload.\n\n# Institutional Development Through Public Engagement\n\n# Public communication\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority maintains close contact with the media to enhance its transparency and improve public understanding of its policies and operations. In 2016, the HKMA held a total of 81 public media events, including 14 press conferences, 13 site visits, and 54 other public events, and arranged 30 media interviews. During the year, 326 bilingual press releases were issued, and numerous media inquiries were handled daily.\n\nWithin the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) established two important offices: the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO) and the Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO). To explain the functions and work plans of these offices, the HKMA conducted several public communication initiatives. Additionally, the HKMA held press briefings and seminars to enhance public understanding of its operations and measures in areas such as financial inclusion, Reserves Management, Fintech Supervisory Sandbox, cybersecurity, and small and medium-sized enterprise financing.\n\nMr. Norman Chan, Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, met with journalists during his visit to Beijing as part of the Hong Kong Bankers' Association's annual trip in December 2016.\n\n# Public Inquiry\n\nThe public enquiry service is an effective channel for citizens to obtain information on the functions and operations of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). This service handled 10,170 inquiries in 2016, representing a 12% increase compared to 2015. Approximately half of the inquiries concerned banking policies and regulations, monetary and economic issues, and banking consumer matters, particularly banking products and services, the coin collection programme, banking-related guidelines and circulars, stored-value payment tools and retail payment systems, prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing, and prudent regulation of property mortgage loans.\n\nFigure 1 shows the number of public inquiries received each year since 2013, and Figure 2 lists the proportion of different types of inquiries in 2016.\n\n#Publications\n\nIn addition to the Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report and four issues of the Quarterly Report during the year. It also regularly updates the data in the Monthly Statistical Bulletin, providing the latest and in-depth information and analysis on monetary, banking, and economic matters in Hong Kong. Furthermore, the HKMA published 32 inSight articles in 2016, a significant increase from 14 articles in 2015, analyzing various topical issues related to the HKMA's work.\n\nThe HKMA \"2015 Annual Report\" won the Silver Award in the \"Non-profit and Charitable Organizations\" category in the 2016 Hong Kong Institute of Management's Best Annual Report Awards.\n\n# Public Education Programme\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority Information Centre is located on the 55th floor of International Finance Centre Phase 2, and aims to introduce the work of the HKMA to the public and enhance public understanding of monetary and banking matters. The Information Centre comprises an exhibition hall and a library, and is open to the public for visits and use six days a week. The exhibition hall showcases the work of the HKMA, as well as the development of the monetary and banking sectors in Hong Kong. Reading materials and exhibits are also available for research on Hong Kong’s currency, banking, and financial affairs.\n\nThe information center’s policy exhibition area, which explains the work of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and introduces related financial knowledge, underwent renovation work in the fourth quarter of 2016, enriching the exhibition content and adding a variety of interactive elements. In particular, interactive games that combine learning with play have been added to explain financial concepts in an accessible and engaging manner. There are also visually appealing touch-screen displays that provide a more comprehensive and in-depth introduction to the work of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, striving to provide visitors with a completely new experience. In addition, the renovated information center features a mosaic artwork depicting the Victoria Harbour skyline, created with over 130,000 Hong Kong coins. The newly revamped policy exhibition area reopened to the public on February 24, 2017.\n\n# Monetary Authority website\n\nThe HKMA's institutional website (www.hkma.gov.hk) provides over 50,000 pages of information in English and both traditional and simplified Chinese, conveniently enabling the public to access the latest information from the HKMA. The website also hosts the \"Register of Securities Staff of Authorized Institutions\" and the \"Register of AIs and local Representative offices,\" maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the \"Register of SVF licensees,\" maintained under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance. The website features dedicated special pages and prominent quick links to highlight new measures from the HKMA, such as the regulatory regime for stored value facilities (SVFs), IFFO and FFO, and important timely matters, such as warnings about phone scams and the parking locations of coin collection trucks under the Coin Collection Scheme.\n\nThe new look of the Information Center's policy exhibition area.\n\nA mosaic depicting the Victoria Harbour skyline created using Hong Kong coins.\n\nThe Information Center provides guided tours for visitors. During the year, the Information Center welcomed over 56,200 visitors and provided more than 580 guided tours for schools and other groups (Figure 3). Since its opening in December 2003, the Information Center has cumulatively welcomed over 586,600 visitors.\n\nThe library adjacent to the exhibition hall houses over 23,000 books, journals, and other publications for in-depth research on topics such as Hong Kong currency, banking, finance, and central banking. The library also maintains electronic records of authorized institutions and their local representative offices, as well as employees engaged in securities business, as stipulated in Section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nTo maintain close ties with the community and enhance public understanding of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s work, the HKMA continues to hold public education seminars. In 2016, the HKMA held three public seminars, attracting over 1,750 secondary school students and teachers. The topics included the linked exchange rate system, Banking Stability, banknotes in Hong Kong, smart tips for using banking products and services, and the Deposit Insurance Scheme. Since these educational seminars were launched in 1998, over 56,400 members of the public have participated.\n\nStudents and teachers from various district high schools attended one of the public education lectures.\n\nFigure 3: Types of groups visiting the Information Center in 2016.\n\n# Human resources\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority hires, trains, and maintains a professional and high-caliber workforce to fulfill policy objectives and flexibly respond to changes in work priorities. As part of the government structure, the HKMA hires employees under non-civil service terms to attract talent with appropriate experience and specialized knowledge. As a public institution, the HKMA strives to maintain a streamlined and flexible organizational structure and, as much as possible, implements new measures and handles increasing workloads by reallocating existing staff.\n\n# Hand-crafted\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) had a staffing level of 875 people at the beginning of 2016. In the second half of 2016, 12 additional positions were created to fulfill the HKMA's regulatory functions under the new insurance regulatory regime. Therefore, the HKMA's staffing level was 887 people by the end of 2016.\n\nTo ensure sufficient resources for implementing new legislation and policies, continuing ongoing pilot programs, and managing the increasingly complex workload, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s (HKMA) overall staffing increased by 40 to 927 in 2017 (an increase of 4.5%). The newly added positions are responsible for the following functions:\n- Promoting the stability of the banking and financial system, including:\n    - Enhancing supervisory capabilities to manage the increasing technology risks in banks and new fintech initiatives, as well as addressing banks’ expansion within the region and their business operations;\n    - Strengthening regulatory and law enforcement efforts to combat money laundering and terrorist financing activities, and preparing for the 2018 Financial Action Task Force mutual evaluation program;\n    - Planning and preparing for the implementation of the Financial Institutions (Resolution) ordinance to address the “too big to fail” issue in the financial sector in accordance with international standards; and\n    - Enhancing supervisory capabilities to align with new international standards on capital and market risks, and allocating additional resources to handle consumer protection matters and bank complaints.\n- Strengthening investment, risk management, and related support in response to the increased investment work involved in further diversifying the Exchange Fund’s investment portfolio, while enhancing strategic asset allocation and investment processes to cope with the increasingly challenging investment environment.\n- Developing and implementing talent development programs and strengthening related resources to ensure the HKMA has the necessary human resources to address market developments and future challenges.\n- Strengthening research on monetary policy and the processing of monetary statistics, as well as providing resources to handle inquiries and complaints regarding the licensing\/designation and related regulation of stored value payment tools and retail payment systems.\n\nTable 1 lists the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's position structure and actual staff numbers by department.  \nTable 1: Hong Kong Monetary Authority Position Structure and Actual Staff Numbers as of January 1, 2017\n\nThe HKMA allocates temporary resources to handle other tasks and lends staff to international or local institutions, such as the IMF (IMF) and the Financial Development Bureau, to assist with work or policies related to Hong Kong or the HKMA. Additionally, the HKMA assigns staff to the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Corporation and the Financial and Treasury Bureau's Market Association to provide full-time or supportive operational support.\n\n# Compensation and Benefits Policy and Compensation Review Mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary determines the salaries and service conditions of Hong Kong Monetary Authority employees by seeking opinions from its governing committees through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, and taking into account market salary levels and practices. The compensation package includes cash compensation and a mandatory provident fund, along with some basic benefits. Cash compensation comprises a fixed monthly salary (i.e., basic salary) and a variable salary paid annually based on employee performance.\n\nThe Financial Secretary reviews the salaries of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) staff annually, and will hear recommendations from its Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, taking into account the governance committee's assessment of the HKMA’s performance over the past year, the results of a compensation survey of the financial industry conducted by an independent human resources consulting firm, and other relevant factors. The salaries of individual employees with outstanding performance may also be adjusted to maintain their compensation competitiveness.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) allocates funds approved for adjusting annual fixed salaries or disbursing variable pay to individual employees based on their individual work performance. The variable pay system for professional investment staff is designed to strengthen the link between their investment performance and their compensation. Adjustments to fixed salaries or disbursement of variable pay for employees at the level of Deputy Governor or above are approved by the Financial Secretary after consulting the Governance Committee. Such employees will be absent from meetings when their salary proposals are discussed. For employees at the level of Director or below, adjustments to fixed salaries or disbursement of variable pay are decided by the HKMA Governor, based on the lump sum approved for salary payments, under the authority delegated by the Financial Secretary.\n\n# Executive Compensation\n\nTable 2 shows the compensation information for senior management in 2016.\n\n1. In addition to accumulated annual leave, the actual compensation received by employees with less than one year of service is calculated on an annual basis to determine the average annual compensation for the respective position. 2. The number of employees listed in this table includes those with less than one year of service. The number of Senior Assistant Managing Directors includes the Managing Directors of Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation. 3. Other benefits include provident fund, medical and life insurance, as well as accumulated annual leave during the year. These benefits may vary according to the service conditions of individual senior personnel.\n"}
{"zh":"# 外匯基金\n\n# 審計署署長報告\n\n# 香港特別行政區政府審昇計毐署\n\n# 獨立審計師報告致財政司司長\n\n# 意見\n\n茲證明我已審計列載於第149至237頁外匯基金及其附屬公司（「集團」）的財務報表，該等財務報表包括外匯基金及集團於2016年12月31日的資產負債表與截至該日止年度的收支帳目、全面收益表、權益變動表和現金流量表，以及財務報表的附註，包括主要會計政策概要。\n\n我認為，該等財務報表已按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》真實而公平地反映外匯基金及集團於2016年12月31日的財務狀況及截至該日止年度的財務表現和現金流量，並已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》 （第66章）第7條下所發出的指示妥為擬備。\n\n# 意見的基礎\n\n我已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示及審計署的審計準則進行審計。我根據該等準則而須承擔的責任，詳載於本報告「審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任」部分。根據該等準則，我獨立於集團，並已按該等準則履行其他道德責任。我相信，我所獲得的審計憑證是充足和適當地為我的審計意見提供基礎。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項是根據我的專業判斷，對截至2016年12月31日止年度財務報表的審計最為重要的事項。我對整體財務報表進行審計及形成意見時處理了這些事項，而我不會對這些事項提供單獨的意見。\n\n# 審計署署長報告（續）\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n我在審計中如何處理有關事項\n\n# 按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.5、2.6及36.1。\n\n於2016年12月31日，集團按公平值列帳的金融資產共31,989.75億港元，金融負債共9,639.77億港元。\n\n95%的該等金融資產及所有該等金融負債的公平值為相同資產或負債於活躍市場的報價（第1級參數），或是以估值方法估計，而所用的參數是以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第2級參數）。\n\n其餘5%的該等金融資產的公平值，是以估值方法估計，而所用的參數並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第3級參數）。有關金融資產共1,758.86億港元，主要包括非上市投資基金。\n\n鑑於所涉數額龐大及涉及估計，按公平值列帳的金融資產及金 融負債的估值屬關鍵審計事項。\n\n就按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值，審計程序包括：\n- 了解不同類別金融資產及金融負債的估值程序，包括相關監控措施；\n- 評價及測試監控措施，包括電腦系統的相關應用程式監控措施；\n- 就金融資產及金融負債的估值、存在、權利與責任及完整性取得函證；\n- 若使用市場報價，根據獨立來源核實價格；\n- 若所用估值方法的參數是以可觀察市場數據為基礎，評價估值方法是否適合及有關假設是否合理，以及根據獨立來源核實參數；及\n- 若所用估值方法的參數並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎，評價估值方法是否適合，以及有關假設與參數是否合理。\n\n# 未來基金存款\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.6、2.16.1、4(b)、23及28。\n\n在以往年度，財政儲備的絕大部分存款均須於要求時償還，並按每年參考投資組合過去的投資回報釐定的固定息率計算利息。\n\n政府於2016年1月1日在財政儲備內設立未來基金。未來基金存款包含來自土地基金結餘的首筆資金（為數2,197.30億港元），以及從政府一般收入帳目轉撥的恆常注資（金額由財政司司長指示）。未來基金存款的利息按綜合息率計算，而該綜合息率是參考上文提及與投資組合的表現掛鈎的固定息率及與長期增長組合（持有私募股權及房地產投資）的表現掛鈎的年度回報率，每年在加權平均基礎上釐定。除財政司司長另有指示外，未來基金的存款連同所賺取的利息應在2025年12月31日償還。\n\n於2016年12月31日，未來基金的存款共2,245.30億港元。有關存款的累計利息為100.71億港元。由於涉及數額龐大及存款條件有重大改變，需要格外關注有關存款及所賺取的利息的計量、列報方式及披露資料。\n\n就未來基金存款，審計程序包括：\n- 評價計量有關存款及所賺取的利息所用的會計政策是否恰當；\n- 審視與長期增長組合的表現掛鈎的年度回報率的計算方法；\n- 核實參考投資組合以往的表現釐定的固定息率、與長期增長組合的表現掛鈎的年度回報率及參考該兩項息率釐定的綜合息率的計算；\n- 核實以綜合息率計算的應計利息數額；及\n- 審視有關存款及所賺取的利息在財務報表中的列報方式及披露資料。\n\n# 按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.12、17及18。\n\n集團的投資物業按公平值列帳，於2016年12月31日共值227.23億港元。集團亦於3間聯營公司及14間合營公司擁有權益，該等公司主要業務為持有海外投資物業，有關權益共值320.83億港元。不論是由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有，該等投資物業的公平值均主要根據獨立專業估值師的估值釐定。該等估值涉及重大判斷及估計，包括所用的估值方法及假設。\n\n就按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值，審計程序包括：\n- 獲取及審視由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有的投資物業的估值報告，並核實公平值是根據有關估值報告所列的估值釐定；\n- 評估估值師的獨立性及資歷；及\n- 評價估值方法是否適合，以及有關假設與參數是否合理。\n\n# 其他資料\n\n金融管理專員須對其他資料負責。其他資料包括金融管理局2016年年報內的所有資料，但不包括財務報表及我的審計師報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見並不涵蓋其他資料，我亦不對其他資料發表任何形式的鑒證結論。\n\n就財務報表審計而言，我有責任閱讀其他資料，從而考慮其他資料是否與財務報表或我在審計過程中得悉的情況有重大矛盾，或者似乎存有重大錯誤陳述。基於我已執行的工作，如果我認為其他資料存有重大錯誤陳述，我需要報告該事實。在這方面，我沒有任何報告。\n\n# 金融管理專員及外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會就財務報表而須承擔的責任\n\n金融管理專員須負責按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》及行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示擬備真實而公平的財務報表，及落實其認為必要的內部控制，使財務報表不存有因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在擬備財務報表時，金融管理專員須負責評估集團持續經營的能力， 以及在適用情況下披露與持續經營有關的事項，並以持續經營作為會計基礎。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會負責監督集團的財務報告過程。\n\n# 審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任\n\n我的目標是就整體財務報表是否不存有任何因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述取得合理保證，並發出包括我意見的審計師報告。合理保證是高水平的保證，但不能確保按審計署審計準則進行的審計定能發現所存有的任何重大錯誤陳述。錯誤陳述可以由欺詐或錯誤引起，如果合理預期它們個別或滙總起來可能影響財務報表使用者所作出的經濟決定，則會被視作重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在根據審計署審計準則進行審計的過程中，我會運用專業判斷並秉持專業懷疑態度。我亦會：\n- 識別和評估因欺詐或錯誤而導致財務報表存有重大錯誤陳述的風險；設計及執行審計程序以應對這些風險；以及取得充足和適當的審計憑證，作為我意見的基礎。由於欺詐可能涉及串謀、偽造、蓄意遺漏、虛假陳述，或凌駕內部控制的情況，因此未能發現因欺詐而導致重大錯誤陳述的風險，較未能發現因錯誤而導致者為高；\n- 了解與審計相關的內部控制，以設計適當的審計程序。然而，此舉並非旨在對集團內部控制的有效性發表意見；\n- 評價金融管理專員所採用的會計政策是否恰當，以及其作出的會計估計和相關資料披露是否合理；\n- 判定金融管理專員以持續經營作為會計基礎的做法是否恰當，並根據所得的審計憑證，判定是否存在與事件或情況有關，而且可能對集團持續經營的能力構成重大疑慮的重大不確定性。如果我認為存在重大不確定性，則有必要在審計師報告中請使用者留意財務報表中的相關資料披露。假若所披露的相關資料不足，我便須發出非無保留意見的審計師報告。我的結論是基於截至審計師報告日止所取得的審計憑證。然而，未來事件或情況可能導致集團不能繼續持續經營；\n- 評價財務報表的整體列報方式、結構和內容，包括披露資料，以及財務報表是否公允反映交易和事項；及\n- 就集團中實體或業務活動的財務資料獲取充足和適當的審計憑證，以對財務報表發表意見。我負責指導、監督和執行集團審計。我對我的審計意見承擔全部責任。\n\n我會與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通計劃的審計範圍和時間以及重大審計發現等事項，包括我在審計期間識別出內部控制的任何重大缺陷。\n","terms":{"10年Plus同心展關懷標誌":["10 years plus Caring

Auditor's Report to the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI hereby certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and its subsidiaries (\"the Group\") contained in pages 149 to 237, which include the balance sheets of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Group as at December 31, 2016, the income statements, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity, cash flow statements, and the notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies, for the year ended on that date.\n\nI believe that the financial statements have fairly and adequately reflected, in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Accountants, the financial position of the Exchange Fund and the Group as at December 31, 2016, and their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended, and have been properly prepared in accordance with the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under Section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Chapter 66).\n\n# The basis of opinion.\n\nI have conducted the audit in accordance with the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under Section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the auditing standards of the Audit Department. The responsibilities I must bear according to these standards are detailed in this report's section \"Responsibilities of the Auditor Regarding the Audit of Financial Statements.\" According to these standards, I am independent of the group and have fulfilled other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these standards. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.\n\n# Key Audit Matter\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were most important to the audit of the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016. I addressed these matters in auditing the financial statements as a whole and forming my opinion, but I do not express a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Auditor General's Report (Continued)\n\n# Key Audit Matter\n\nHow should I handle relevant matters during an audit?\n\n# Valuation of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Measured at Fair Value\n\nPlease refer to the notes to the financial statements, Sections 2.5, 2.6, and 36.1.\n\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Group's financial assets, booked at fair value, totaled 31,989.75 billion HKD, while financial liabilities totaled 9,639.77 billion HKD.\n\n95% of the fair values of such financial assets and all such financial liabilities are based on quoted prices for the same assets or liabilities in active markets (level 1 inputs), or estimated using valuation techniques, and the parameters used are based on observable market data (level 2 inputs).\n\nThe fair value of the remaining 5% of such financial assets is estimated using valuation techniques, and the parameters used are not based on observable market data (level 3 inputs). The total amount of such financial assets is HKD 17,588.6 million, mainly consisting of unlisted investment funds.\n\nGiven the significant amounts involved and the reliance on estimates, the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value is a key audit matter.\n\nThe audit procedures for the valuation of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value include:\n- Understanding the valuation processes for different categories of financial assets and liabilities, including related monitoring measures;\n- Evaluating and testing the monitoring measures, including related application controls for computer systems;\n- Obtaining confirmations regarding the valuation, existence, rights and obligations, and completeness of financial assets and liabilities;\n- Verifying prices based on independent sources if market quotations are used;\n- Evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methods and the reasonableness of related assumptions, as well as verifying the parameters based on independent sources, if the parameters used in the valuation methods are based on observable market data; and\n- Evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methods and the reasonableness of related assumptions and parameters if the parameters used in the valuation methods are not based on observable market data.\n\n# Future fund deposits\n\nPlease refer to Notes 2.6, 2.16.1, 4(b), 23, and 28 of the financial statements.\n\nIn previous years, the majority of deposits in the fiscal reserve were required to be repaid upon request, and interest was calculated at a fixed interest rate determined annually based on the past investment returns of the investment portfolio.\n\nThe government established the Future Fund within the fiscal reserves on January 1, 2016. The Future Fund’s deposits include initial funding from the Land Fund surplus (amounting to HK$219.73 billion) and regular contributions transferred from the government’s general revenue account (the amount of which is directed by the Financial Secretary). Interest on the Future Fund’s deposits is calculated based on a composite interest rate, which is determined annually on a weighted average basis, referencing a fixed interest rate linked to the performance of the investment portfolio mentioned above and an annual return rate linked to the performance of the long-term growth portfolio (holding private equity and real estate investments). Unless otherwise directed by the Financial Secretary, the deposits of the Future Fund, together with any accrued interest, should be repaid by December 31, 2025.\n\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Future Fund held a total of HK$224.53 billion in deposits. The accumulated interest earned on these deposits was HK$10.071 billion. Due to the large amounts involved and significant changes in the deposit terms, particular attention needs to be paid to the measurement, presentation, and disclosure of information regarding these deposits and the interest earned.\n\nFor future fund deposits, the audit procedures include:\n- Evaluating whether the accounting policies used for measuring the deposits and the interest earned are appropriate;\n- Reviewing the calculation method of the annual return rate linked to the performance of the long-term growth portfolio;\n- Verifying the calculation of the fixed interest rate based on the past performance of the investment portfolio, the annual return rate linked to the long-term growth portfolio, and the composite interest rate based on these two rates;\n- Verifying the amount of accrued interest calculated using the composite interest rate; and\n- Reviewing the presentation method and disclosure information of the deposits and interest earned in the financial statements.\n\n# Valuation of Investment Properties Measured at Fair Value\n\nPlease refer to Notes 2.12, 17, and 18 of the financial statements.\n\nThe Group's investment properties are accounted for at fair value, totaling HK$22.723 billion as of December 31, 2016. The Group also holds interests in 3 joint ventures and 14 associate companies, which mainly engage in holding overseas investment properties. The aggregate value of these interests amounts to HK$32.083 billion. The fair values of these investment properties, whether directly held by the Group or by joint ventures or associate companies, are primarily determined by independent professional valuers. These valuations involve significant judgments and estimates, including the valuation methods and assumptions used.\n\nRegarding the valuation of investment properties measured at fair value, the audit procedures include:\n- Obtaining and reviewing valuation reports for investment properties directly held by the Group or held by associates or joint ventures, and verifying that fair value is determined based on the valuation as stated in the relevant valuation reports;\n- Assessing the independence and qualifications of the valuers; and\n- Evaluating whether the valuation methods are appropriate, and whether the related assumptions and parameters are reasonable.\n\n# Other materials\n\nThe Financial Controller is responsible for other information. This other information includes all information in the 2016 Annual Report of the Financial Services Commission, except for the financial statements and my auditor's report.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not include other information, and I do not provide any form of attestation conclusion on other information.\n\nRegarding the audit of financial statements, I have a responsibility to read other information in order to consider whether such information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or with circumstances known to me during the audit process, or appears to contain material misstatements. Based on the work I have performed, if I conclude that other information contains material misstatements, I need to report that fact. In this regard, I have nothing to report.\n\n# Responsibilities of the financial controller and the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with respect to financial statements.\n\nThe Financial Management Officer must be responsible for preparing true and fair financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRSs) promulgated by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance. The officer must also implement internal controls deemed necessary to ensure that the financial statements do not contain material misstatements resulting from fraud or error.\n\nWhen preparing financial statements, financial management officers are responsible for assessing the group’s ability to continue as a going concern, and for disclosing matters related to going concern where applicable, and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Committee under the Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditors bear responsibilities regarding the audit of financial statements.\n\nMy objective is to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements as a whole do not contain any material misstatements resulting from fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but it does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the audit standards of the audit office will necessarily detect any material misstatements that may exist. A misstatement may be caused by fraud or error, and it is considered material if it is reasonably expected that it, individually or in aggregate, could influence the economic decisions made by users of the financial statements.\n\nDuring the audit process conducted in accordance with the Audit Office's auditing standards, I will apply professional judgment and maintain a professional skeptical attitude. I will also:  \n- Identify and assess the risk of material misstatements in the financial statements due to fraud or error; design and perform audit procedures to address these risks; and obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence to support my opinion. Since fraud may involve collusion, falsification, intentional omission, false statements, or overriding of internal controls, the risk of not detecting material misstatements due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting those due to error;  \n- Understand the internal controls relevant to the audit in order to design appropriate audit procedures. However, this is not intended to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the group's internal controls;  \n- Evaluate whether the accounting policies adopted by the Financial Management Officer are appropriate, and whether the accounting estimates and related disclosures made are reasonable;  \n- Determine whether the Financial Management Officer's use of the going concern basis for accounting is appropriate, and based on the audit evidence obtained, determine whether there are significant uncertainties related to events or circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the group's ability to continue as a going concern. If I believe that significant uncertainty exists, it is necessary to draw the users' attention to the relevant disclosures in the financial statements in the auditor's report. If the disclosures are insufficient, I will issue an auditor's report with a non-unqualified opinion. My conclusion is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of the auditor's report. However, future events or circumstances may lead to the group's inability to continue as a going concern;  \n- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure, and content of the financial statements, including disclosures, and whether the financial statements fairly present the transactions and events; and  \n- Obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of entities or business activities within the group in order to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for directing, supervising, and performing the group audit. I bear full responsibility for my audit opinion.\n\nI will communicate with the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding the scope and timeline of the plan’s audit, as well as significant audit findings, including any material deficiencies in internal controls that I identify during the audit.\n"}

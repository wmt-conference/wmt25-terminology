{"en":"# Chief Executive’s Statement\n\nIn 2017, the global economy and financial markets performed much better than expected: the real economy saw steady growth; inflation remained subdued; the three interest rate hikes and the reduction in the balance sheet by the US Federal Reserve during the year did not result in capital outflows from emerging market economies or a strengthening of the US dollar. Amid bullish sentiment, global stock markets, including the three major US stock indices, kept hitting new highs. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index surged by 34%. The Hang Seng Index gained nearly 8,000 points (or 36%) in 2017 and surpassed the 30,000-point level to reach an all-time high in January 2018.\n\nMany investors were filled with optimism, even exuberance, in such a favourable environment. However, this was until early February this year when the latest data showed a higher than expected wage increase in the US, prompting investors to reappraise inflation risks and triggering significant corrections to global stock markets. The Dow Jones Index fell more than 1,000 points in two days during the second week of February, and the Hang Seng Index dropped more than 3,000 points in the same week. The 10-year US Treasury yield surged to as high as 2.95%. The swift reversal of fund flows indicated that the record high market valuation was not built on a solid foundation. It also reminded us of the importance of a sound and robust financial system for Hong Kong to meet the challenges brought by asset market volatility and capital outflows.\n\n# Banking system resilience boosted by precautionary measures\n\nAs the saying goes, “prevention is better than cure”. The HKMA implemented further risk mitigation measures in 2017 to safeguard the stability of Hong Kong’s banking and financial systems. In May, we introduced the eighth round of countercyclical measures for banks’ mortgage loans and strengthened banks’ credit risk management on lending to property developers, with the aim of enhancing the banking system’s resilience to shocks arising from any downturn in the property market. With the several rounds of measures, the average loan-to-value ratio of new residential mortgage loans fell to 49% at the end of 2017 from 64% in September 2009, while the average debt servicing ratio also declined to 35% from 41% in August 2010.\n\nIn 2017, we established the Resolution Office to implement international standards on the resolution of non-viable financial institutions that are considered “too big to fail”. This will help prevent a recurrence of a global financial crisis similar to the one in 2008 where public money was used to save failing financial institutions, and will minimise the impact of their closures on the financial system, the economy and the community at large.\n\nRobust risk management is the cornerstone of steady and sustainable development of the banking sector. The liquidity ratio and capital adequacy ratio of Hong Kong’s banking system are well above the applicable statutory requirements and among the highest in the world. This undoubtedly reflects the high resilience of Hong Kong’s banking system. Indeed, the banking sector registered strong growth in 2017, with total loans increasing by 16%, while the asset quality also held up well. The classified loan ratio of retail banks fell to 0.54% from 0.72% in 2016, well below the long-term average of 2.2% since 2000. The banking industry’s overall return on equity (based on pre-tax operating profits) reached 11.74% in 2017, a very healthy level compared with other international financial centres.\n\n# Sound banking the key to long-term financial stability\n\nThe 2008 global financial crisis revealed the limitations of relying solely on rules and regulations to restrain the financial industry from pursuing profitability without regard to their primary responsibilities. In light of this, the HKMA has stepped up the promotion of “sound banking” practices in recent years, encouraging banks to develop and pursue good corporate culture and values. In particular, to address the issue of bank staff pursuing short-term profits at the expense of the long-term interests of their customers or banks, we are encouraging banks to put in place appropriate incentive systems that are in line with their corporate culture and values. As part of this campaign, we arranged the inaugural Annual Conference for Independent Non-Executive Directors (INEDs) in March 2017 to highlight the importance of establishing a good banking culture and to empower the INEDs to perform their oversight and monitoring roles more effectively.\n\nWith the support of the banking industry, 2017 was a successful year for the HKMA in the advancement of financial inclusion. Six physical bank branches and three mobile branches began operating in remote areas. The Hong Kong Association of Banks worked out an arrangement with EPS and a convenience store chain to launch a pilot scheme allowing the elderly to withdraw cash from the stores in remote areas without the need to make purchases. Hongkong Post is also launching this year a cash withdrawal service for the elderly at seven Post Offices mainly on outlying islands and in the New Territories. Regarding account opening, the HKMA last year set up a webpage and an email account with a dedicated team to follow up public enquiries or complaints relating to the opening of bank accounts. Thanks to the concerted efforts of various stakeholders, there has been a significant improvement in customer experience in opening individual and corporate bank accounts.\n\n# Fintech a game changer for the banking industry\n\nIn an era of rapid technological advancement, fintech has been gradually integrated into our daily lives. In this ever changing technological environment, banks must embrace new developments and pursue innovation in their application of fintech. With the new era of Smart Banking, the HKMA launched seven initiatives in September (see page 106 for details) promoting the adoption of fintech in banking to improve the quality of banking products and services for customers. While these initiatives are independent of one another, they are complementary and will be a game changer for the future landscape of payment and banking services in Hong Kong. Customers will not only enjoy more convenient, efficient and secure payment and banking services, they will also have more choices and greater control over their financial transactions. Fintech will be the key to banks’ future business success, and moving into the new era of Smart Banking will be a great opportunity for the banks to upgrade and transform themselves.\n\n# Enormous opportunities created by the Belt and Road and the Bay Area Initiatives\n\nWith competition among international financial centres becoming more intense, a diversified financial industry is of paramount importance to Hong Kong. In 2017, the HKMA stepped up its work on enhancing Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre. Given Hong Kong’s unparalleled advantage of “having the Mainland as our hinterland while maintaining an international outlook”, the Belt and Road Initiative and the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Bay Area (Bay Area) will offer enormous opportunities for the financial and banking sectors and give new impetus to the economic growth of Hong Kong. The HKMA Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office, which was established in response to the Belt and Road Initiative, saw the number of its partners grow to around 90 since launch, laying a solid foundation for promoting Hong Kong as a financing hub for infrastructure investments. The issuance of the first Belt and Road bond in Hong Kong by the China Development Bank in 2017 highlighted the pivotal role Hong Kong can play in facilitating the financing of these infrastructure projects.\n\nIn addition to infrastructure financing, we are actively involved in the development of Hong Kong as a hub for corporate treasury centres, private equity funds and Asian derivatives businesses, by attracting multinational corporations and major financial institutions to manage their funds, assets and various financial risks in the city. These initiatives will further consolidate and upgrade Hong Kong’s financial and related professional services sectors. The HKMA also maintains close dialogue with the relevant authorities responsible for the development of the Bay Area to strengthen collaboration with a view to contributing to the financial development of the area as a world-class city cluster.\n\nOver the years, Hong Kong’s financial industry has been developing under the theme of “leveraging Hong Kong’s advantages, meeting the country’s needs”. With the introduction of the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect in 2014, the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect in 2016 and the Northbound Trading of Bond Connect in July last year, the mutual market access between the Mainland and the rest of the world through Hong Kong’s financial platform has been expanded from stock markets to bond markets. This underscores Hong Kong’s unique role as a financial intermediary in facilitating global investors’ access to the Mainland’s financial markets. In 2017, Hong Kong maintained its position as the leading global hub for offshore renminbi business. Average daily turnover of the renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement system stood at RMB900 billion. In addition, according to SWIFT statistics, more than 70% of global renminbi payment transactions were handled through Hong Kong during the year. The offshore renminbi market continued to operate smoothly and develop steadily.\n\n# Nurturing talent to strengthen the soft power of the banking industry\n\nWith the continuing growth of the financial industry, nurturing talent is crucial to its sustainable development. The HKMA attaches great importance to the soft power of the banking industry, and we have been encouraging and supporting ongoing capacity building of banking practitioners. Following the introduction of two modules on anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism and cybersecurity under the Enhanced Competency Framework, we expanded its coverage last year by including retail wealth management and treasury management to enhance the level of core competence of banking practitioners through continuing professional development. The HKMA is also committed to nurturing young talent for the banking industry. In 2017, we launched the Pilot Apprenticeship Programme for Private Wealth Management and the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme in collaboration with the industry. Given the overwhelming response, the coverage of these programmes will be further expanded in the future.\n\n# Prudent investment strategy achieving a reasonable and stable return over the medium to long term\n\nOn the back of strong global economic growth, the Exchange Fund achieved a record high investment income of HK$264 billion last year with gains across the board, including equities, bonds and foreign exchange. The overall investment return was 7.4%. The Investment Portfolio achieved a rate of return of 12.1%, while the Backing Portfolio gained 1.8%. The Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP)’s annualised internal rate of return since its inception in 2009 reached as high as 13.7%. While the investment performance last year was satisfactory, the increasingly complex investment environment requires the HKMA to continue its prudent management of the Exchange Fund. We will remain agile and nimble, monitor market developments closely and deploy defensive measures as and when appropriate. Investments under the LTGP will also be further expanded. As always, the investment principle of “capital preservation first, long-term growth next” within acceptable risk levels will be adhered to when managing the wealth for the people of Hong Kong.\n\nWhile the global real economy is extending last year’s growth momentum, uncertainties and risks still abound in 2018. These include a faster-than-expected pace of US interest rate hikes in case inflation picks up, escalating trade frictions and a deteriorating geopolitical landscape. Should these downside risks materialise, they will have significant and widespread implications for global financial markets, and knock-on effects for Hong Kong’s fund flows, asset prices and real economy. It is therefore advisable that we should all manage the risks prudently.\n\nIn the coming months, it is likely Hong Kong dollar interest rate movements will remain in the spotlight. The US Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times since December 2015. With widening spreads between Hong Kong dollar interest rates and their US dollar counterparts, there is a greater incentive for funds to flow from the Hong Kong dollar into the US dollar. The Hong Kong dollar has been under weakening pressure recently and the 7.85 weak-side Convertibility Undertaking (CU) has been triggered. As we have repeatedly stated, when the 7.85 weak-side CU is triggered, the HKMA will act as a “super money changer” by buying Hong Kong dollars and selling US dollars in the market to ensure that the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate will not weaken beyond the 7.85 level. Such operations are normal and in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System. This should not cause any concern. Indeed, the Exchange Fund currently holds more than HK$4 trillion worth of assets, of which the Hong Kong dollar Monetary Base amounts to about HK$1.7 trillion, providing a strong buffer in the event of fund outflows. Over the years, the HKMA has put in place various lines of defence to safeguard the stability of the banking and financial systems. From a positive perspective, capital outflows will lead to a gradual increase in Hong Kong dollar interest rates, which will be conducive to the normalisation of the interest rate environment in Hong Kong and hence the sustainable development of the local economy and asset markets. During this process, the HKMA will stay vigilant and make every effort to maintain monetary and banking stability in Hong Kong.\n","terms":{"10 Years Plus Caring Organisation

首席執行官聲明\n\n二〇一七年，全球經濟和金融市場表現好於預期：實體經濟見穩健增長；通脹維持溫和；美國聯邦儲備局當年三次加息及縮減資產負債表並未導致新興經濟體資金外流或美元升值。在樂觀情緒的推動下，全球股市，包括美國三大股指，持續創下新高。MSCI新興市場指數上漲了34%。恒生指數在2017年上漲了近8,000點（或36%），並於2018年一月突破30,000點水平，創下歷史新高。\n\n許多投資者在如此有利的環境下充滿樂觀，甚至欣喜若狂。然而，直到今年二月初，最新的數據顯示美國的工資增長超出預期，促使投資者重新評估通膨風險，並引發全球股市的顯著調整。道指在二月初的第二週內下跌超過一千點，恒生指數也在同一週下跌超過三千點。10年期美國國庫券收益率飆升至高達2.95%。資金流向的迅速逆轉表明，創紀錄的市場估值並非建立在堅實的基礎之上。它也提醒我們，香港需要一個健全且穩健的金融體系，以應對資產市場波動和資金外流帶來的挑戰。\n\n# 預防措施提升了銀行體系的抗禦能力。\n\n防患未然總比治病已晚。金管局於2017年實施進一步的風險管控措施，以確保香港銀行及金融體系的穩定。五月，我們為銀行的按揭貸款推出第八輪逆周期措施，並加強銀行對樓市發展商貸款的信用風險管理，旨在提升銀行體系對樓市任何下行風險的抗風險能力。透過多輪措施，新住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數由2009年9月的64%降至2017年底的49%，而平均供款與入息比率亦由2010年8月的41%降至35%。\n\n二零一七年，我們成立了處置機制辦公室，以執行國際訂立的標準，處理那些被視為「大到不能倒」的不可行的金融機構。這將有助於防止類似二零零八年環球金融危機再次發生，當時公帑被用於拯救瀕臨破產的金融機構，並將其倒閉對金融體系、經濟及社會大眾的影響降至最低。\n\n穩健的風險管理是銀行業穩步可持續發展的基石。香港銀行體系的流動性比率及資本充足率遠高於適用的法定要求，並處於全球最高水平之一。這無疑反映了香港銀行體系的高韌性。事實上，銀行業在2017年實現強勁增長，貸款總額增加16%，同時資產質素也保持良好。零售銀行的分類貸款比率由2016年的0.72%降至0.54%，遠低於自2000年以來的長期平均值2.2%。銀行業整體股東權益回報率（以除稅前經營溢利計算）在2017年達到11.74%，相較其他國際金融中心而言，是一個非常健康的水平。\n\n# 穩善金融是長期金融穩定的關鍵。\n\n二零零八年的環球金融危機揭示了僅僅依靠規則和法規來約束金融業追求盈利，而忽略其主要職責的局限性。 鑒此，金管局近年來加強了「穩善金融」的做法宣傳，鼓勵銀行發展和實踐良好的企業文化和價值觀。 尤其為了應對銀行職員追求短期利潤，而犧牲客戶或銀行長期利益的問題，我們鼓勵銀行建立適當的獎勵制度，使其與企業文化和價值觀相符。 作為這項活動的一部分，我們於二零一七年三月舉辦了首屆獨立非執行董事研討會，以強調建立良好銀行文化的的重要性，並賦予獨立董事更有效地履行其監管和監察職能。\n\n得益於銀行業的支持，金管局在普及金融方面於2017年取得了顯著進展。六間實體分行和三輛流動銀行車已開始在偏遠地區營運。香港銀行公會與易辦事及一間便利店連鎖店合作，推出一項試點計劃，讓長者可以在偏遠地區的便利店提取現金，而無需購物。香港郵政今年也將在七間郵政局（主要位於離島和新界）推出長者現金提取服務。至於開戶方面，金管局去年設立了一個網頁和電子郵件帳戶，並組建了專責小組跟進公眾對開立銀行帳戶的查詢或投訴。 由於各方利益相關者的共同努力，在開立個人和公司銀行帳戶的客戶體驗方面有了顯著改善。\n\n# 金融科技為銀行業帶來變革。\n\n在科技快速發展的時代，金融科技已逐漸融入我們的日常生活。在瞬息萬變的科技環境下，銀行必須擁抱新發展，並致力於在金融科技的應用上追求創新。隨著智慧銀行新紀元到來，金管局於九月推出七項舉措（詳見第106頁），以促進金融科技在銀行業的應用，從而提升銀行產品及服務的質素。雖然這些舉措彼此獨立，但它們相輔相成，並將徹底改變香港支付和銀行服務的未來格局。客戶不僅可以享受更便捷、高效和安全的支付和銀行服務，他們還將擁有更多選擇和對其金融交易更大的控制權。金融科技將是銀行未來業務成功的關鍵，而進入智慧銀行新紀元將為銀行升級和轉型提供絕佳機會。\n\n# 一帶一路與灣區倡議帶來的巨大機遇\n\n隨著國際金融中心之間的競爭日趨激烈，多元化的金融產業對香港至關重要。二零一七年，金管局加強提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。鑑於香港獨有的「背靠祖國、國際視野」的優勢，「一帶一路」倡議及粵港澳大灣區（灣區）的發展將為金融和銀行業帶來巨大機遇，並為香港經濟增長注入新動力。為響應「一帶一路」倡議而設立的基建融資促進辦公室(IFFO)，自啟動以來合作夥伴數量已增至約90家，為推動香港成為基建投資融資中心奠定了堅實基礎。國家開發銀行於二零一七年在香港發行首隻一帶一路債券，凸顯了香港在促進這些基建項目融資方面所發揮的重要作用。\n\n除基建投融資外，我們亦積極參與香港作為企業財資中心、私募基金中心及亞洲衍生工具業務中心的發展，吸引跨國企業及主要金融機構在本港管理資金、資產及各類金融風險。這些舉措將進一步鞏固和提升香港的金融及相關專業服務行業。金管局亦與負責灣區發展的相關部門保持緊密溝通，以加強合作，推動該地區作為世界級城市群的金融發展。\n\n多年來，香港金融業一直以「發揮香港優勢，配合國家需要」為主題持續發展。自2014年推出滬港通、2016年推出深港通，以及去年7月啟動債券通─北向通以來，香港金融平台已將內地與世界其他地區之間的互聯互通從股市擴展至債券市場。這凸顯了香港作為中介，促進全球投資者接觸內地金融市場所具有的獨特角色。2017年，香港繼續維持為離岸人民幣業務全球主要中心的地位。人民幣即時支付結算系統的平均每日成交額達人民幣9千億元。此外，根據SWIFT統計，全年超過70%的全球人民幣支付交易均經香港處理。離岸人民幣市場持續穩健運作並穩步發展。\n\n# 培育人才以增強銀行業的軟實力\n\n隨著金融業持續發展，培育人才對其可持續發展至關重要。金管局非常重視銀行業的軟實力，我們一直鼓勵和支持銀行從業員的專業能力提升。在推行「資歷架構」下兩項關於打擊洗錢、恐怖份子資金籌集和網絡安全的課程後，我們去年擴大其覆蓋範圍，納入零售財富管理和財資管理，透過持續專業能力提升，提高銀行從業員的核心競爭力。金管局亦致力於為銀行業培養年輕人才。於2017年，我們與業界合作推出「私人財富管理人才培訓計劃」和「金融科技人才培育計劃」。鑑於反應熱烈，這些計劃的覆蓋範圍將來會進一步擴大。\n\n# 穩健投資策略，實現中長期合理且穩定的回報\n\n在全球經濟強勁增長的支持下，外匯基金上年錄得創紀錄的投資收入 2640 億港元，股本、債券及外匯等各方面均有收益。整體投資回報率為 7.4%。投資組合的回報率為 12.1%，而支持組合則升幅 1.8%。長期增長組合 (LTGP) 自開展投資以來，內部回報率年率已達至 13.7%。儘管去年投資表現令人滿意，但日益複雜的投資環境要求金管局繼續謹慎地管理外匯基金。我們將保持靈活敏捷，密切監察市場發展，並在適當時候採取防禦措施。長期增長組合的投資亦將進一步擴展。一如既往，在可接受的風險水平下，管理香港人民的財富時，將堅持“保本，長期增值”的投資原則。\n\n雖然全球實體經濟延續去年的成長動能，但2018年仍存在不少不確定性和風險。這些風險包括：若通脹回升，美國利率上調速度可能高於預期；貿易摩擦升溫以及地緣政治形勢惡化。倘若這些下行風險實現，將對全球金融市場產生重大而廣泛的影響，並對香港的資金流向、資產價格及實體經濟產生連鎖反應。因此，我們應謹慎管理風險。\n\n未來幾個月，香港利率走勢很可能仍將成為焦點。美國聯邦儲備局自2015年12月以來已六次加息。隨著香港利率與其美元利率之間的利差擴大，有更大的誘因促使資金從港元流向美元。近期港元承受下行壓力，7.85 弱方兌換保證已觸發。正如我們一再聲明，當7.85 弱方兌換保證觸發時，金管局將充當「超級找換店」，在市場上買入港元並出售美元，以確保港元匯率不會低於7.85水平。此類操作是正常現象，符合聯繫匯率制度的設計，不應引起任何擔憂。事實上，外匯基金目前持有超過4萬億港元的資產，其中港元貨幣基礎約為1.7萬億港元，在資金外流時提供強大的緩衝。多年來，金管局已建立多項防波堤，以維護銀行和金融體系的銀行體系穩定。從積極的角度來看，資金外流將導致香港利率逐步上升，有助於香港利率環境的正常化，從而促進本地經濟和資產市場的可持續發展。在此過程中，金管局將保持警惕，並竭盡全力維護香港的貨幣和銀行體系穩定。\n"}
{"en":"# Highlights of 2017\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nThe Hong Kong economy grows at a faster pace on the back of synchronised expansion of the global economy. The local stock market rallies and residential property market maintains its upward momentum, while housing affordability stretches further.\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector remains safe and sound, with strong capital and liquidity positions and healthy asset quality.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar eases against the US dollar as a result of the widening negative interest rate spreads between the two currencies. Nevertheless, the public remains highly confident in the Linked Exchange Rate System.\n\nThe money markets continue to operate smoothly with ample interbank liquidity. The Base Rate in Hong Kong is adjusted upwards by a total of 75 basis points to 1.75%, in tandem with the increase in the target range for the US federal funds rate.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA places its supervisory focus on the effectiveness of banks’ risk governance framework, including credit, liquidity and technology risk management. The eighth round of countercyclical macroprudential measures is introduced to strengthen the resilience of the banking sector against any downturn in the property market.\n\nOn the policy side, substantial progress is made on the local implementation of international supervisory standards. The resolution regime comes into operation, establishing a new line of defence for banking stability. The Resolution Office is established as part of the HKMA’s efforts to make the resolution regime operational for the Hong Kong banking sector.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\nSeven new initiatives are introduced to embrace the enormous opportunities brought about by the convergence of banking and technology and to promote Hong Kong as a fintech hub in Asia. Hong Kong’s international profile as a financing hub for infrastructure investments is raised further, thanks to a series of efforts on network and capacity building.\n\nHong Kong maintains its leading position in offshore renminbi business. The launch of the Bond Connect reinforces Hong Kong’s role as the main gateway to opportunities in Mainland China.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\nBenefiting from a favourable investment environment, the Exchange Fund achieves a record high investment income of HK$264 billion, representing an investment return of 7.4%.\n\nEfforts on investment diversification continue, especially through the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The LTGP records an annualised internal rate of return of 13.7% since its inception in 2009.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communication with the community and the market through the media, public education programmes, and other various channels to facilitate public understanding of its policies and operations.\n\nThe HKMA continues to improve corporate governance by supporting professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline, and enhancing IT security to cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives and the increasing complexity of work.\n","terms":{"10 Years Plus Caring Organisation Logo":["10年Plus同心展關懷標誌"],"10-Year US Treasury yield":["10年期美國國庫券收益率"],"10-year US Treasury yield":["美國十年期國庫債券收益率"],"10th

經濟與金融環境\n\n香港經濟在世界經濟同步擴張的帶動下，增長速度加快。本地股市上漲，住宅物業市場維持其向上勢頭，置業負擔能力持續擴大。\n\n香港銀行體系保持安全穩健，擁有強勁的資本及流動性狀況及良好的資產質素。\n\n# 貨幣穩定\n\n由於兩種貨幣之間的負利率差幅擴大，港元對美元微幅貶值。然而，公眾對聯繫匯率制度仍保持高度信心。\n\n貨幣市場繼續順利運作，銀行同業流動資金充足。香港的基本利率總體上調75個基點至1.75%，與美國聯邦基金利率目標區間的上調同步進行。\n\n# 銀行體系穩定\n\n金管局將監管重點放在銀行風險管治架構的有效性上，包括信貸、流動性及科技風險管理。為應對樓市任何下行風險，推出第八輪逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施，以增強銀行業的應對能力。\n\n在政策方面，國際監管標準的本地實施已取得實質性進展。處置機制正式啟動運作，為銀行體系穩定建立了一道新的防線。作為金管局推動處置機制在香港銀行體系內落實的重要組成部分，處置機制辦公室已成立。\n\n# 國際金融中心\n\n7項新措施旨在把握銀行業與科技結合所帶來的龐大機遇，並推動香港成為亞洲金融科技樞紐。得益於一系列構建網絡及提升技能的努力，香港作為基礎設施投資融資樞紐的國際聲譽進一步提升。\n\n香港持續保持離岸人民幣業務的領先地位。債券通的啟動進一步鞏固香港作為通往內地中國投資機會主要門戶的角色。\n\n# 儲備管理\n\n受益於有利的投資環境，外匯基金實現創紀錄的投資收入高達2640億港元，投資回報率為7.4%。\n\n持續推動投資多元化，特別是透過長期增長組合（LTGP）。LTGP 自 2009 年開展投資以來，其年率化內部回報率為 13.7%。\n\n#

{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nAgainst the backdrop of a more synchronised expansion of the global economy, Hong Kong saw faster economic growth, tighter labour market conditions and subdued inflationary pressures in 2017. Economic growth for 2018 is expected to remain solid.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Real activities\n\nAmid a more synchronised expansion of the global economy, the Hong Kong economy grew faster in 2017. Growth in real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increased to 3.8%, much higher than the 2.1% growth in 2016 and the long-term growth of about 3% over the past decade (Chart 1 and Table 1). Domestic demand firmed up, with private consumption growth accelerating and overall investment spending reviving. Stronger domestic demand reflected favourable job and income conditions, booming asset prices and improved business sentiment. Externally, Hong Kong’s exports of goods expanded at a faster pace due to increased global trade flows, and exports of services recovered because of vibrant trade and cargo flows and improving inbound tourism. Imports of goods recorded stronger growth on export-induced demand, and imports of services increased steadily amid strong travel interest among residents. On a net basis, the overall trade surplus shrank, making a negative contribution to GDP growth.\n\n\n# Monetary conditions\n\nOn the monetary front, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate generally eased against the US dollar driven primarily by interest rate arbitrage activities amid the negative interest rate differentials between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar. This reflected the normal functioning of the Linked Exchange Rate System in accordance with its design. While still at relatively low levels, Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates faced more upward pressures towards the end of 2017 due to Initial Public Offeringrelated funding demand and banks’ year-end liquidity needs. For credit growth, after two years of single-digit growth, total bank loans increased at a notably faster pace of 16.1% in 2017, reflecting improving economic conditions and positive financial market sentiment. Despite faster loan growth, there were no signs of loosening of banks’ credit underwriting standards, and overall loan quality remained good.\n\n# Inflation\n\nInflationary pressures remained well contained throughout 2017 (Chart 2). Netting out the effects of the Government’s one-off relief measures, the underlying inflation rate declined to 1.7%, down from 2.3% in 2016. In particular, the housing component of the price index increased at a milder pace, reflecting the filter-through of slower increases in fresh-letting private residential rentals in 2016. More broadly, milder increases in nominal wages and earnings amid strong output growth helped keep local cost pressures in check. Import price inflation was also tame, in line with low inflation in Hong Kong’s major import sources despite a weaker US dollar.\n\n# Labour market\n\nThe labour market tightened in 2017 along with above-par economic growth. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell from 3.4% in 2016 to 2.9% towards the end of 2017, below 3% for the first time in nearly 20 years (Chart 3). Most major economic sectors registered decreases in their respective unemployment rates, with more notable declines seen in the retail, financing and professional and business services sectors. As total employment grew faster and the number of private-sector vacancies picked up, overall labour demand continued to strengthen. The labour force also expanded, partly reflecting more active participation of older-age workers (aged 55 and above). Consistent with tighter labour market conditions and lower inflation, real wages and earnings saw faster increases.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe Hong Kong stock market had an almost uninterrupted rally in 2017. The Hang Seng Index rose by 36%, the largest annual gain since 2010 (Chart 4). The rally reflected optimism about the global economy and corporate earnings, and was in part supported by substantial fund inflows from Mainland investors through the Stock Connects. The Hang Seng Index hit a ten-year high in November and remained at high levels towards the end of 2017. Average daily turnover expanded to HK$88.3 billion from HK$66.9 billion in the previous year, and overall equity funds raised from the local market also increased to HK$581.4 billion, compared with HK$490.1 billion a year earlier.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market maintained its upward momentum throughout the year (Chart 4). Transaction volume expanded from 54,701 units a year ago to 61,591 units and housing prices increased by 14.8% in 2017. Housing affordability stretched further, with a price-toincome ratio of 16.4, higher than the previous peak in 1997, and an income-gearing ratio of 74.1, far above its long-term average.1 In view of rising property prices and the intensifying competition for mortgage business among banks, the HKMA introduced the eighth round of prudential measures in May to strengthen banks’ risk management and safeguard banking stability. Housing price growth moderated temporarily following these measures before accelerating in the fourth quarter. As for the commercial and industrial property markets, trading activities increased significantly during the year, with both transaction value and volume registering double-digit growth. With the pick-up in non-residential property prices, corresponding rental yields fell slightly compared to the previous year.\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nEconomic growth for 2018 is expected to remain solid. The Government forecasts growth in the range of 3–4%, while private-sector analysts project the economy to expand at an average rate of 3.2%. Externally, Hong Kong’s export performance will continue to benefit from the improving global growth outlook and the gradual recovery in inbound tourism. Domestically, private consumption growth is expected to hold up mainly as a result of favourable labour market conditions. As for fixed capital formation, building and construction activity should progress steadily on the back of rising housing supply and continuing infrastructure projects. While improved economic conditions will support business capital spending, headwinds may come from potential rises in interest rates.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nWith still-moderate global inflation and steady increase in local costs, inflationary pressures in Hong Kong are anticipated to remain moderate in 2018, but the inflation rate is likely to pick up gradually from the low in 2017. For example, the rental component of inflation may gather momentum in the latter part of 2018 because of feedthrough from increases in fresh-letting private residential rentals. Market consensus predicts the headline inflation rate to be a still-moderate 2.2% for 2018, and the Government projects the underlying inflation rate to be 2.5%. On the other hand, sustained economic growth, expanding building and construction activity and the gradual recovery in inbound tourism are expected to keep the labour market tight in the near future. Private-sector analysts forecast the unemployment rate to stay at about 3.0% in 2018.\n\n# Uncertainties and risks\n\nThe economic outlook for 2018 is subject to a number of uncertainties and risks including those relating to major central banks’ monetary policy normalisation and global financial market stability, as well as heightened protectionist sentiment and deteriorating geopolitical tensions. In particular, if such risks materialise to trigger reversal of fund flows in Hong Kong, local monetary conditions could tighten faster than expected, putting downward pressures on the real economy and asset prices.\n\nThe outlook for the residential property market remains uncertain. In the near term, the current favourable domestic economic conditions, perceived housing shortage, low mortgage rates and alternative sources of home financing (including mortgage loans provided by property developers and financial support from parents), will continue to support the demand for properties. However, the recent sell-off in global financial markets may dampen sentiments. Over the longer term, the property market will continue to face a number of headwinds. In particular, as the US monetary policy normalisation continues, domestic mortgage rates will rise eventually. In addition, on the back of the Government’s effort to increase the supply of land and residential properties, the housing demand-supply gap is expected to narrow gradually, which would ease the upward pressure on property prices in the longer term.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector continued to be safe and sound in 2017 notwithstanding uncertainties surrounding the global economy. The capital and liquidity positions of authorized institutions (AIs) remained strong, asset quality stayed at healthy levels, and profitability improved notably thanks to increased interest margins and robust credit growth.\n\n# Interest rate trends\n\nAs the US interest rate normalisation continued, the onemonth and three-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) fixings increased by 49 basis points and 39 basis points respectively in 2017. More notable rises were observed in the fourth quarter. Nevertheless, the Hong Kong dollar funding cost of retail banks, as measured by the composite interest rate, remained broadly stable over the year (Chart 5).\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe aggregate pre-tax operating profits of retail banks’ Hong Kong offices grew by 15.8% in 2017. The improved performance was mainly due to increases in net interest income (+20.3%) and fee and commission income (+9.4%). However, these increases were partially offset by a decline in income from foreign exchange and derivatives operations (-29.9%) and a growth in operating expenses (+8.4%). The aggregate post-tax profit of retail banks dropped by 18.1% because of certain non-recurring items recorded in 2016. The post-tax return on average assets of retail banks dropped to 1.07% from 1.44% in 2016 (Chart 6).\n\nRetail banks’ net interest margin widened to 1.45% in 2017 from 1.32% in 2016 (Chart 7) mainly due to rising market interest rates.\n\nThe proportion of retail banks’ non-interest income to total operating income decreased to 40% from 44.3% in 2016. While fee and commission income increased by 9.4%, income originated from foreign exchange and derivatives operations dropped by 29.9%.\n\nRetail banks’ cost-to-income ratio declined to 41.9% in 2017 from 43.2% in 2016, as operating costs (+8.4%) increased at a slower pace than operating income (+11.8%) (Chart 8). Retail banks’ loan impairment charges decreased to HK$7.3 billion from HK$8 billion in 2016.\n\n# Asset quality\n\nLoan quality of retail banks improved during the year, with the classified loan ratio decreasing to 0.54% from 0.72% a year earlier. The overdue and rescheduled loan ratio also decreased to 0.4% from 0.53% in 2016 (Chart 9). Similarly, the classified loan ratio and the overdue and rescheduled loan ratio of the whole banking sector decreased to 0.67% and 0.52%, from 0.85% and 0.67% respectively.\n\nThe quality of banks’ residential mortgage lending portfolios remained good, with the delinquency ratio staying at a low level of 0.03% at the end of 2017 (Chart 10). The rescheduled loan ratio was close to 0%. There was no residential mortgage loan in negative equity at the end of the year, as compared with four cases a year ago.\n\nThe delinquency ratio of credit card lending stayed low at 0.22% at the end of 2017, compared with 0.24% a year ago (Chart 10). The combined delinquent and rescheduled loan ratio edged down to 0.31% from 0.33% during the period. The charge-off ratio also fell slightly to 1.75% from 1.92% in 2016.\n\n# Balance sheet trends\n\nTotal loans of the banking sector grew by 16.1% in 2017, compared with 6.5% in 2016. Demand for credit increased, driven by optimism about the global economic outlook. As total deposits increased at a slower pace than total loans, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio rose to 73% at the end of 2017 from 68.4% a year earlier. The Hong Kong-dollar loan-to-deposit ratio also increased to 82.7% from 77.1% during the same period (Chart 11).\n\nMainland-related lending (including loans booked in Mainland subsidiaries of locally incorporated banks) increased by 17.5% in 2017, compared with a growth of 7% recorded in 2016.\n\n# Holdings of negotiable debt securities\n","terms":{"10 Years Plus Caring Organisation

經濟與金融環境\n\n在全球經濟更同步擴張的背景下，香港在2017年實現了較快的經濟增長、較緊的勞動市場情況以及較低的通脹壓力。預計2018年的經濟增長將繼續保持強勁。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 實際活動\n\n在全球經濟更協調擴張的背景下，香港經濟在2017年增長速度加快。實際本地生產總值（本地生產總值）增長率上升至3.8%，遠高於2016年的2.1%增長以及過去十年約3%的長期增值（圖1和表1）。本地需求有所回升，私人消費增長加速，整體投資支出有所復甦。更強勁的本地需求反映了良好的就業和收入狀況、蓬勃的資產價格以及改善的營商氣氛。外部方面，香港的貨品出口由於全球貨運增加而增速加快，服務輸出則由於貿易和貨運的活躍以及訪港旅遊業的改善而有所回升。貨品進口錄得更強勁的增長，受出口帶動的需求所致，服務輸入則在居民強烈的旅遊興趣下穩步上升。從淨值角度來看，總體貿易順差縮小，對本地生產總值帶來負面影響。\n\n\n# 貨幣條件\n\n在貨幣方面，香港貨幣兌美元匯率主要由於香港貨幣與美元之間的負息差所引發的套息活動而普遍走弱。這反映了聯繫匯率制度按照其設計正常運作。雖然香港銀行同業拆息仍處於相對低水平，但由於與首次公開發行相關的融資需求以及銀行年底流動性需求，2017年底香港銀行同業拆息面對較大的上調壓力。就信貸增長而言，經過兩年單位數增長後，總銀行貸款在2017年以明顯更快的增幅16.1%增長，反映經濟情況改善及財務市場情緒正面。儘管貸款增長加快，但銀行信貸審批標準並未出現放寬跡象，整體貸款質素仍然良好。\n\n# 物價上漲\n\n通脹壓力在2017年整體維持在可控範圍內（圖2）。扣除政府一次性纾困措施的影響後，基本通脹率降至1.7%，較2016年的2.3%有所下降。特別是，住宅價格指數成分的增幅較為溫和，反映2016年新出租私人住宅租金增幅放緩的滲透效應。更廣泛而言，面對強勁的產出增長，名義工資及收入增幅較溫和，有助於控制本地成本壓力。進口價格通脹亦保持溫和，與香港主要進口來源的低通脹情況一致，即使美元貶值亦然。\n\n# 勞動市場\n\n二零一七年，隨著優於預期的經濟增長，勞動市場趨緊。經季節因素調整失業率從二零一六年中的百分之三點四降至二零一七年末的百分之二點九，是近二十年來首次低於百分之三（圖3）。大多數主要經濟部門的失業率均有所下降，其中零售、融資及專業與商用服務業的下降幅度尤為顯著。由於總體就業增長加快，私營機構職位空缺增加，整體勞動需求持續增強。勞動人口亦有所擴張，部分反映了年長勞工（年滿五十五歲及以上）的參與度提高。與勞動市場趨緊和通貨膨脹率下降相符，實際工資和收入增速加快。\n\n#股市\n\n二零一七年香港股市近乎沒有間斷地持續上漲。恒生指數上升了百分之三十六，創下自二零一零年以來的最大年度升幅（圖4）。這輪上漲反映了對全球經濟和企業盈利的樂觀情緒，部分得益於通過滬港通及深港通來自內地投資者的巨額資金流入。恒生指數在十一月創下十年新高，並在二零一七年末維持在較高水平。平均每日成交額從上一年的港幣六十六點九億元擴大至港幣八十八點三億元，而本地市場籌集的集資總額也增加至港幣五百八十點四億元，較一年前的港幣四百九十點一億元有所增長。\n\n# 樓市\n\n住宅物業市場全年保持上行勢頭（圖4）。成交量由去年同期的54,701個單位增至61,591個單位，樓價在2017年上升14.8%。置業負擔能力進一步惡化，樓價與收入比率達16.4，高於1997年的歷史峰值，收入槓桿比率則為74.1，遠高於長期平均水準。鑒於樓價上漲及銀行間房貸業務競爭加劇，金管局於5月推出第八輪審慎監管措施，以加強銀行風險管理及維護銀行體系穩定。在這些措施實施後，樓價增長一度放緩，但於第四季再度加速。至於工商物業市場，全年交易活動顯著增加，成交額及成交量均錄得雙位數增長。隨著非住宅物業價格上漲，對應的租金收益率較去年同期小幅下跌。\n\n# 經濟前景\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n二零一八年的經濟增長預計將保持穩健。政府預測增長率為三至四百分之，而私營機構分析員則預測經濟平均增長率為三點二百分之。外部方面，香港的出口表現將繼續受益於改善的全球增長前景以及訪港旅遊業的逐步復甦。內部方面，私人消費增長預計將主要得益於良好的勞工市場狀況而保持穩定。至於固定資本形成，樓宇及建造活動應將在房屋供應增加和持續的基建項目支持下穩步發展。儘管改善的經濟狀況將支持企業資本開支，但利率潛在上升可能會帶來阻力。\n\n# 物價與勞動市場\n\n在全球通脹仍屬溫和、本地成本穩步上升的情況下，香港的通脹壓力預計在2018年將保持溫和，但通脹率可能從2017年的低水平逐步回升。例如，由於新租私人住宅租金上漲的傳導效應，通脹中的租金成分可能在2018年下半年加速上升。市場共識預測2018年的整體通脹率將維持在相對溫和的2.2%，而政府預計基本通脹率將為2.5%。另一方面，持續的經濟增長、樓宇及建造活動擴張，以及訪港旅遊業的逐步復甦，預計將在未來一段時間內維持勞動市場的緊張。私營機構分析員預測2018年的失業率將維持約3.0%的水平。\n\n# 不確定因素與風險\n\n2018年經濟展望面臨多項不確定性和風險，包括與主要央行貨幣政策正常化及全球金融市場穩定性相關的風險，以及保護主義情緒升溫及地緣政治緊張局勢惡化等情況。特別是，若這些風險實現並引發香港資金流向逆轉，本地貨幣條件可能比預期更快收緊，對實體經濟及資產價格造成下行壓力。\n\n住宅物業市場的前景仍然不確定。在短期內，目前有利的國內經濟情況、被認為存在的住房短缺、低按揭利率以及替代性的置業所需資金來源（包括物業發展商提供的按揭貸款及來自父母的財務支持），將繼續支撐物業需求。然而，近期全球金融市場的拋售可能會削弱市場情緒。從長遠來看，樓市將繼續面臨多項不利因素。特別是，隨著美國貨幣政策正常化持續進行，本地按揭利率最終將上升。此外，基於政府增加土地及房屋供應的努力，住房供求缺口預期將逐步收窄，這將在長遠上緩和物價上漲的壓力。\n\n# 銀行業的表現\n\n儘管全球經濟存在不確定性，香港銀行體系於2017年繼續保持安全穩健。認可機構的資本及流動性狀況保持強勁，資產質素維持健康水平，而盈利則因息差擴大及信貸增長強勁而顯著改善。\n\n#利率走勢\n\n隨著美國利率正常化持續進行，香港銀行同業拆息（HIBOR）的1個月及3個月定盤利率於2017年分別上升了49基點及39基點。第四季出現了更顯著的上升。然而，以綜合利率為指標的零售銀行港元融資成本，整體維持穩定（圖5）。\n\n# 盈利趨勢\n\n零售銀行的香港分行於2017年除稅前經營溢利總額增長了15.8%。 表現改善主要歸因於淨利息收入增加（+20.3%）和費用和佣金收入增加（+9.4%）。 然而，外匯和衍生工具業務收入減少（-29.9%）以及經營支出增長（+8.4%）部分抵消了這些增長。 零售銀行的除稅後溢利因2016年記錄的某些非經常性項目而下降了18.1%。 零售銀行的除稅後平均資產回報率從2016年的1.44%下降至1.07%（圖表6）。\n\n零售銀行的淨息差由2016年的1.32%擴大至2017年的1.45%（圖7），主要由於市場利率上漲所致。\n\n零售銀行非利息收入佔總營運收入的比例，從2016年的44.3%下降至40%。 雖然費用和佣金收入增加了9.4%，但來自外匯及衍生工具業務的收入則減少了29.9%。\n\n零售銀行的成本與收入比率由2016年的43.2%下降至2017年的41.9%，因營運成本（+8.4%）增幅低於營運收入（+11.8%）（圖8）。零售銀行的貸款減值撥備由2016年的HK$80億減少至HK$73億。\n\n# 資產質素\n\n年內零售銀行貸款質素改善，不良貸款比率由前一年0.72%下降至0.54%。逾期及經重組貸款比率亦由2016年的0.53%下降至0.4%（圖表9）。同樣地，整個銀行業的不良貸款比率及逾期及經重組貸款比率分別由0.85%及0.67%下降至0.67%及0.52%。\n\n銀行的住宅按揭貸款組合品質維持良好，截至2017年底，拖欠比率維持在0.03%的低水平（圖表10）。重組貸款比率接近0%。年底並無出現負資產的住宅按揭貸款，較一年前的四個個案為少。\n\n截至2017年底，信用卡貸款的拖欠比率維持在0.22%的低水平，較一年前的0.24%有所下降（圖表10）。合併的拖欠及重組貸款比率則由0.33%小幅降至0.31%。撇帳率亦從2016年的1.92%略微下降至1.75%。\n\n# 資產負債表走勢\n\n2017年銀行業貸款總額較2016年的增幅達16.1%，較去年的6.5%顯著上升。信貸需求增加，主要由於對全球經濟前景持樂觀態度。由於總存款增幅低於總貸款增幅，因此整體貸存比率於2017年底升至73%，較一年前的68.4%有所提高。同期內，港元貸存比率亦由77.1%上升至82.7%（圖11）。\n\n內地相關貸款（包括在內地子公司記賬的本地註冊銀行貸款）在2017年增長了17.5%，較2016年記錄的7%增長有所上升。\n\n#

{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nDespite weakening pressure on the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to operate in an orderly manner with ample liquidity. The Linked Exchange Rate System has served as a strong anchor for Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability and proved to be highly resilient against various shocks.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability. This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n- Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three noteissuing banks\n- Government-issued notes and coins in circulation\n- the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of the clearing account balances of banks kept with the HKMA\n- Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the HKMA’s firm commitment to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs). When the demand for Hong Kong dollars is greater than the supply and the market exchange rate strengthens to the strong-side CU of HK$7.75 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to sell Hong Kong dollars to banks for US dollars. The Aggregate Balance will then expand to push down Hong Kong dollar interest rates, creating monetary conditions that move the Hong Kong dollar away from the strong-side limit to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if the supply of Hong Kong dollars is greater than the demand and the market exchange rate weakens to the weak-side CU of HK$7.85 to one US dollar, the HKMA will buy Hong Kong dollars from banks. The Aggregate Balance will then contract to drive Hong Kong dollar interest rates up, pushing the Hong Kong dollar away from the weak-side limit to stay within the Convertibility Zone.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2017\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate generally saw weakening pressure in 2017 (Chart 1). Driven mainly by interest carry trade activities amid widened negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates, the Hong Kong dollar eased gradually against the US dollar, from 7.7566 on 3 January to the year-low of 7.8265 on 22 August. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate gained some strength between late September and early November, underpinned by a tightening of Hong Kong dollar liquidity due to initial public offering (IPO)-related funding demand, and traded steadily within a narrow range of 7.80–7.81. Weakening pressures on the Hong Kong dollar were seen again towards the end of the year, partly reflecting slightly improved Hong Kong dollar liquidity conditions as well as increased year-end commercial demand for the US dollar. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market functioned normally throughout 2017.\n\nAs the CUs were not triggered, the total of the Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs remained virtually unchanged at around HK$1,225.3 billion in 2017 (Chart 2). During the year, the HKMA issued a total of HK$80 billion additional Exchange Fund Bills to meet banks’ increased demand for liquidity management. This led to a contraction of the Aggregate Balance to HK$179.8 billion at the end of 2017. The issuance of additional Exchange Fund Bills was consistent with Currency Board principles, as it only represented a change in the composition of the Monetary Base, with a shift from the Aggregate Balance to the outstanding EFBNs. The Monetary Base remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\n# Money market\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates stayed soft in the first eight months of 2017 before facing more upward pressure towards the end of the year (Chart 3). Despite concerns about the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes and balance sheet normalisation, the Hong Kong dollar interbank rates generally remained soft for the first eight months. As such, the negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates widened between January and August. From September onward, the shortdated Hong Kong dollar interbank rates witnessed large pick-ups, driven mainly by IPO-related and year-end funding demand. Correspondingly, the negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates narrowed in the short-dated segment. Overall, the short-dated interbank rates traded mostly below the Base Rate in 2017.\n\nThe Base Rate was adjusted upwards on 16 March, 15 June and 14 December, by a total of 75 basis points from 1.00% to 1.75%, as the target range for the US federal funds rate moved upward three times by a total of 75 basis points from 0.50–0.75% to 1.25–1.50% during the year. The adjustment of the Base Rate was in accordance with the revised formula announced on 26 March 2009, in which the Base Rate is set at either 50 basis points above the lower bound of the prevailing target range for the US federal funds rate or the average of the five-day moving averages of the overnight and one-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs), whichever is the higher.\n\nRoughly tracking the movements of the Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads, the discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points widened gradually during the first three quarters, with the 12-month Hong Kong dollar forward points reaching about -615 pips in midSeptember (Chart 4). In the fourth quarter, the discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points narrowed slightly along with the narrowing of the negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates. Overall, Hong Kong’s money market continued to operate in an orderly manner and interbank liquidity remained ample. Discount Window borrowing increased from HK$5.3 billion in 2016 to HK$10.3 billion in 2017.\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nSince its establishment in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has served as a strong anchor for Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, and proved to be highly resilient in a series of regional and global financial crises. The Government has reasserted its full commitment to the LERS and the credibility of its commitment was further reinforced by the stability in the foreign exchange and money markets. There is also continued strong public confidence in the Hong Kong dollar as a means of payment and a storage of value. In its 2017 Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund reaffirmed its support for the LERS, commenting that the LERS remained the best exchange rate arrangement for Hong Kong. Combined with robust financial supervision and regulation, prudent fiscal management, and flexible markets, the LERS has worked well to help Hong Kong navigate successfully through both external and domestic challenges.\n\nInternational Monetary Fund: “The Linked Exchange Rate System remains the best arrangement for Hong Kong.”\n\nA sound banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS. During 2017, the HKMA continued to monitor closely banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and stepped up its supervisory efforts on corporate, property-related and mainland-related lending to bolster the resilience of the banking sector. As the US Federal Reserve continues to normalise its monetary policy, the Hong Kong dollar interest rates will gradually normalise as well. The HKMA reiterated that, under the design of the LERS, the outflow of capital, the weakening of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, the triggering of the weak-side CU and the reduction of the Monetary Base are part of the necessary process of the normalisation of Hong Kong dollar interest rates. The HKMA also reminded the public to manage their risks prudently and be well prepared for potential financial turbulence.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio, defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base, moved within a range of 106.7–108.2% during 2017, without touching the Upper or Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 108.1% on 31 December (Chart 5). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. In the event of abrupt shocks, the sizeable amount of financial resources of the Exchange Fund will provide a powerful backstop in protecting Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\n# Other activities\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to the monetary and financial stability of Hong Kong. In 2017, the CBC considered various issues, including the drivers of short-run dynamics in Hong Kong’s housing prices, the determinants of HIBOR-London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) spreads, the effect of property valuation changes on corporate borrowing in Mainland China, and the effect of mortgage debt service burden on private consumption in Hong Kong. Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and the reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research (HKIMR) continued to sponsor research in the fields of monetary policy, banking and finance. Over the past three years, the HKIMR has been re-orienting its activities towards higher policy relevance. This is reflected, in particular, in its conference activities and visiting fellowship programmes. The HKIMR has been collaborating with major central banks and policy institutions to jointly organise more policyfocused conferences. Meanwhile, a thematic research fellowship programme introduced in 2016 has been supporting more research projects related to policy issues that are of importance to the HKMA.\n\nIn 2017, the HKIMR hosted 18 research fellows and published 29 working papers. It also organised four international conferences and workshops during the year:\n- The Eighth Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy, titled “China’s Economic Rebalancing: Where is it Heading?”, was held in January in Hong Kong. The conference provided a forum for academics, policy makers and business economists to discuss important analytical and policy issues related to the Mainland economy. 11 highquality research papers were presented, covering a wide variety of issues including Mainland’s economic rebalancing, structural reform and international spillovers, issues on the renminbi exchange rate, and Mainland’s monetary policy framework and transmission.\n- The 15th HKIMR Summer Workshop was held in July. The workshop was intended to provide an opportunity for staff members of the HKIMR and the HKMA to present their research papers, and to enhance interaction between research staff and visiting fellows.\n- A joint conference organised by the HKMA and the Bank for International Settlements, titled “The Price, Real and Financial Effects of Exchange Rates”, was held in August. The conference provided a platform for in-depth and insightful discussion. A wide range of important topics were covered, including the exchange rate system, the pricing system of international trade, risk taking in the accumulation of foreign currency reserves, and foreign exchange market behaviour.\n- A conference jointly sponsored by the HKMA, the US Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta on “Unconventional Monetary Policy: Lessons Learned” was held in October. The conference reviewed lessons learned from the unconventional monetary policies (UMP) of major central banks over the past ten years. The topics included monetary policy in a low interest rate environment, UMP and its spillovers to emerging economies, UMP and bank lending, and UMP and its effects on the real economy and financial stability.\n","terms":{"10 Years Plus Caring Organisation Logo":["10年Plus同心展關懷標誌"],"10-Year US Treasury yield":["10年期美國國庫券收益率"],"10-year US Treasury yield":["美國十年期國庫債券收益率"],"10th Asian Financial

貨幣穩定\n\n儘管港元匯率面臨的壓力有所減弱，港元匯率及貨幣市場仍繼續有序運作，流動性充足。聯繫匯率制度一直作為香港貨幣及金融穩定的強大支點，並已證明其對各種衝擊具有高度抗風險能力。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的首要目標是貨幣穩定。貨幣穩定被定義為港幣在外汇市場上對美元的匯率維持在每1美元兌7.75至7.85港元的區間內。香港的貨幣體系結構以貨幣發行局制度為特徵，要求貨幣基礎至少有100%由外匯基金持有的美元儲備所支持，且貨幣基礎的變動必須與美元儲備的相應變動完全匹配。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n- 負債證明書，為三家發鈔銀行發行的銀行紙幣提供全面備兌；\n- 政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣；\n- 總結餘，為各銀行存放在金管局的清算賬戶餘額總和；\n- 金管局代表政府發行外匯基金票據及債券（外匯基金票據及債券）。\n\n港元的匯率穩定是透過自動利率調整機制以及金管局堅定履行兌換保證（兌換保證）來維持。當港元需求大於供應，且市場匯率升至強方兌換保證匯率（強方兌換保證匯率）7.75港元兌1美元時，金管局隨時準備向銀行出售港元以換取美元。總結餘（總結餘）隨後會擴大，以壓低港元利率，從而創造出使港元遠離強方上限，並回到7.75至7.85的兌換範圍（兌換範圍）內的貨幣狀況。相反地，如果港元供應大於需求，且市場匯率跌至弱方兌換保證匯率（弱方兌換保證匯率）7.85港元兌1美元時，金管局將向銀行買入港元。總結餘（總結餘）隨後會縮小，以推高港元利率，將港元從弱方下限推離，使其維持在兌換範圍（兌換範圍）內。\n\n# 2017年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定性\n\n2017年，港元兌美元匯率整體面對走弱壓力（圖1）。主要受套息活動推動，以及港元與美元利率負利差擴大的影響，港元對美元逐步貶值，從1月3日的7.7566跌至8月22日的年內低點7.8265。在9月下旬至11月上旬期間，港元兌美元匯率一度走強，因新股集資活動相關資金需求導致港元流動性收緊，匯率維持在7.80至7.81的窄幅波動。年底時，港元再度面對走弱壓力，部分反映港元流動性條件有所改善，以及商業對美元的需求增加。總體而言，2017年港元兌美元匯市運作正常。\n\n由於未觸發兌換保證，總結餘與未償還的外匯基金票據及債券總額在2017年大致維持不變，約為1,225.3億港元（圖2）。當年，金管局發行了總額80億港元的額外外匯基金票據，以應對銀行對流動性管理增加的需求。這導致總結餘在2017年底收窄至179.8億港元。發行額外外匯基金票據符合貨幣發行局原則，因為這僅代表貨幣基礎組成的變化，即從總結餘轉移至未償還的外匯基金票據及債券。貨幣基礎仍然完全由外匯儲備支持。\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n2017年前八個月，港元銀行同業拆息保持低位，但年內後期則面臨更大上行壓力（圖表3）。儘管市場對美國聯邦儲備委員會加息及資產負債表正常化的擔憂，港元銀行同業拆息在前八個月仍大致保持低位。因此，港元與美元利率之間的負差價在1月至8月間擴大。自9月起，短期港元銀行同業拆息出現顯著上升，主要由與新股集資活動及年結資金需求有關的因素推動。相應地，短期港元與美元利率之間的負差價收窄。總體而言，2017年短期銀行同業拆息大多數時間低於基本利率。\n\n基本利率分別於3月16日、6月15日及12月14日上調，總計提高75個基點，由1.00%調高至1.75%，原因是美國聯邦基金利率目標區間在當年三次上調共75個基點，由0.50–0.75%提高至1.25–1.50%。基本利率的調整是根據2009年3月26日公佈的修訂公式進行，該公式規定基本利率應設定為現行美國聯邦基金利率目標區間下限之上50個基點，或隔夜及一個月香港銀行同業拆息（HIBORs）五日移動平均值的平均數，以較高者為準。\n\n大致追蹤港幣-美元的利差走勢，香港元 遠期匯率點子 在上半年至第三季逐漸擴大，截至九月中旬，12個月期香港元 遠期匯率點子 達約-615點子（圖4）。在第四季，隨著港幣與美元的負利差收窄，香港元 遠期匯率點子 亦略為收窄。總體而言，香港的 貨幣市場 繼續有序運作，銀行同業流動資金 仍然充裕。 貼現窗借貸 從2016年的53億港元增加至2017年的103億港元。\n\n# 連結匯率制度\n\n自一九八三年設立以來，聯匯制度一直是香港貨幣及金融穩定的重要基石，並在一系列區域性和全球性金融危機中展現出高度的韌性。政府重申對聯匯制度的堅定承諾，而外匯及貨幣市場的穩定進一步鞏固了這項承諾的可信度。香港貨幣作為支付媒介及價值保藏，持續獲得公眾的強烈信心。在二零一七年與香港的第四條磋商中，國際貨幣基金組織重申支持聯匯制度，並指出聯匯制度仍然是香港最適合的匯率安排。聯匯制度配合健全的金融監管與規管、審慎的財政管理以及靈活的市場，有效協助香港成功應對內外挑戰。\n\n國際貨幣基金組織：「聯繫匯率制度仍是香港的最佳安排。」\n\n一個健全的銀行體系對聯匯制度的正常運作至關重要。2017年，金管局繼續密切監察銀行對信貸、流動性及利率風險的管理情況及壓力測試結果，並加強對企業、物業相關及內地相關貸款的監管工作，以增強銀行業的抗風險能力。隨著美國聯邦儲備系統持續推進貨幣政策正常化，港元利率亦將逐步趨於正常化。金管局重申，在聯匯制度的設計下，資金外流、港元匯率走弱、觸發弱方兌換保證匯率及貨幣基礎減少，都是港元利率正常化的必要過程。金管局亦提醒公眾謹慎管理風險，並充分準備應對潛在的財務動蕩。\n\n為提高貨幣發行局帳目的透明度，自一九九八年十月起，已將外匯基金的特定部分資產分配予支持貨幣基礎。支持比率，定義為支持資產除以貨幣基礎，於2017年期間在106.7–108.2%的範圍內波動，未觸及上浮或下浮觸發點。該比率於12月31日收報108.1%（圖5）。在聯匯制度下，雖然外匯基金的特定資產已被指定為支持組合，但所有外匯基金資產均可支持港元匯率。若遇突發衝擊，外匯基金龐大的財政資源將為維護香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供強大的後盾。\n\n# 其他活動\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會貨幣發行委員會（貨幣發行委員會）監察及審視與香港貨幣及金融穩定相關的問題。2017年，貨幣發行委員會審視了多項議題，包括影響香港樓價短期動態的因素、香港銀行同業拆息與倫敦銀行同業拆息息差的決定因素、樓宇估值變動對中國內地企業貸款的影響，以及按揭供款負擔對香港私人消費的影響。貨幣發行委員會就這些議題的討論記錄，以及提交給貨幣發行委員會的貨幣發行局運作報告，均會上載於金管局網站。\n\n香港金融研究中心（研究中心）繼續贊助貨幣政策、銀行和金融領域的研究。過去三年，研究中心一直致力將其活動轉向更具政策相關性。這體現在其研討會活動和學者計劃中，尤其如此。研究中心一直與主要中央銀行和政策研究機構合作，共同舉辦更具政策焦點的研討會。同時，於2016年推出的專題研究學者計劃一直支持更多與金管局重要政策議題相關的研究項目。\n\n2017年，香港國際金融研究中心（研究中心）接待了18位研究人員，並發表了29篇工作論文。該中心當年亦舉辦了四項國際會議：\n- 第八屆中國經濟國際會議，主題為「中國經濟再平衡：將往何處？」，於一月在香港舉行。該會議為學者、政策制定者及商業經濟學家提供了一個平台，討論與內地經濟相關的重要分析及政策議題。共有11篇高品質的研究論文發表，涵蓋內地經濟再平衡、結構性改革及國際外溢效應、人民幣匯率相關議題，以及內地貨幣政策框架與傳導機制等廣泛議題。\n- 香港國際金融研究中心（研究中心）第十五屆夏季研討會於七月舉行。該研討會旨在為研究中心及金管局的研究人員提供發表研究論文的機會，並促進研究人員與訪問學者之間的交流。\n- 由金管局與國際結算銀行聯合舉辦的主題為「匯率的價格、實體經濟與金融影響」的會議於八月舉行。該會議提供了一個深入探討的平台，涵蓋匯率制度、國際貿易的定價制度、外匯儲備積累過程中的風險承擔，以及外匯市場行為等重要議題。\n- 由金管局、美國聯邦儲備局及亞特蘭大聯邦儲備銀行共同贊助的主題為「非常規貨幣政策：所學經驗」的會議於十月舉行。該會議回顧了過去十年內主要央行所推行的非常規貨幣政策（UMP）的經驗教訓。議題包括低利率環境下的貨幣政策、UMP對新興市場經濟的外溢影響、UMP與銀行借貸，以及UMP對實體經濟與金融穩定產生的影響。\n"}
{"en":"# Banking Stability\n\nIn 2017, the HKMA continued to place its supervisory focus on the effectiveness of authorized institutions’ risk governance framework, including credit and liquidity risk management systems. During the year, another round of countercyclical macro-prudential measures was introduced to strengthen the resilience of the banking sector to cope with any downturn in the property market. With cyber threats on the rise, the HKMA stepped up the supervision of authorized institutions’ technology risk management. At the same time, the HKMA launched seven initiatives that prepare Hong Kong to move into a New Era of Smart Banking. The effectiveness of authorized institutions’ anti-money laundering and counterterrorist financing controls remained a key supervisory focus of the HKMA as part of its efforts to combat financial crimes. On conduct supervision, the HKMA took further steps to promote a customer-centric corporate culture, foster financial inclusion, and address difficulties encountered by small and medium-sized enterprises and start-up companies in opening and maintaining bank accounts in Hong Kong. Efforts were also made to enhance the supervision of authorized institutions’ sales practices for investment and insurance products to further strengthen customer protection.\n\nSubstantial progress was made on the local implementation of international supervisory and accounting standards, including capital adequacy standards, disclosure standards, the Net Stable Funding Ratio, large exposure limits, recovery planning and International Financial Reporting Standard 9. In support of the need for capacity building amid an ever-changing banking environment and evolving risk landscape, the HKMA co-ordinated with the industry to develop director empowerment programmes and the Enhanced Competency Framework for banking practitioners.\n\nThe Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance came into operation on 7 July 2017, making Hong Kong one of the few Financial Stability Board member jurisdictions with a fully cross-sectoral resolution regime for financial institutions. The Ordinance, establishing a new line of defence for financial stability, confers necessary powers on the Monetary Authority to manage, in an orderly manner, failure of a financial institution in circumstances where such failure could have adverse systemic consequences.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this objective is contingent upon the financial system being highly resilient and capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their business and, in extremis, by failing in a disorderly manner. The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring banks are resilient to shocks and are able to recover their positions in response to crises, which ultimately helps prevent failures. The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banking business, which includes the business of taking deposits, in Hong Kong. It is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposittaking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs). The Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs).\n\nHowever, the Monetary Authority cannot ensure, nor is the Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework designed to ensure, a zero-risk financial system. Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that in the event of an AI’s failure, resolution may be conducted in an orderly manner such that continuity in critical financial services provided by AIs to their customers can be maintained. To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong is established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs, amongst other financial institutions.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2017\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nIn 2017, 192 off-site reviews were conducted covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL ratings1, corporate governance, business operations and risk management of AIs. As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance at AIs, 30 meetings were held with the boards of directors or board-level committees of AIs, with the discussions focused on important risk management issues. The HKMA also conducted a survey to monitor the adoption of its recent guidance on corporate governance. 27 tripartite meetings among the HKMA, AIs and their external auditors were also held.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA continued to conduct regular on-site examinations supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk. This approach has allowed the HKMA to prioritise its supervisory resources to focus on emerging and more significant risks faced by AIs. The HKMA conducted 401 on-site examinations and thematic reviews during the year. Credit risk management and controls remained the key focus of these examinations and reviews. Another major focus was technology risk and operational risk management. The HKMA also increased the number of overseas examinations and the number of on-site examinations and thematic reviews targeted at liquidity and market risk management as well as anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML\/CFT) controls. On-site examinations of AIs’ activities in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses were also conducted by specialist teams.\n\n# Supervision of credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nTotal bank lending grew by 16.1%, compared with a growth of 6.5% in 2016. As shown in Table 2, the loan growth was broad-based.\n\nSpecifically, Mainland-related lending grew by 17.5% to HK$4,188 billion at the end of 2017 (Table 3). This included HK$644 billion of loans booked with Mainland subsidiaries of banks incorporated in Hong Kong.\n\nThe asset quality of AIs remained healthy in 2017. Retail banks’ classified loan ratio edged down from 0.72% at the end of 2016 to 0.54% at the end of 2017, well below the long-run historical average of 2.2% since 2000. For the banking industry as a whole, the classified loan ratio decreased from 0.85% to 0.67%. As regards Mainlandrelated lending, retail banks’ classified loan ratio of such lending edged down to 0.75% in 2017 from 0.82%. For the banking industry as a whole, the ratio decreased to 0.67% from 0.80% a year ago.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA stepped up its supervisory efforts to ensure that AIs continued to adopt prudent credit risk management standards. In particular, the surveillance of AIs’ exposures to major corporates was enhanced. Targeted thematic examinations were conducted, focusing on key credit risk management controls such as loan underwriting standards, the loan classification and provisioning system, credit risk governance framework and risk management for lending to property developers, asset-backed financing and insurance premium financing.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nProperty prices continued to rise in 2017. There were more loans extended by AIs involving borrowers with multiple mortgages or with income derived from outside of Hong Kong. In view of these developments, the HKMA introduced another round of countercyclical macroprudential measures on 19 May. The eighth round of measures included raising the risk-weight floor for the calculation of capital charges for new residential mortgage loans granted by AIs, lowering the applicable loan-to-value (LTV) ratio cap for property mortgage loans extended to borrowers with pre-existing mortgages, and lowering the applicable debt servicing ratio (DSR) limit for property mortgage loans extended to borrowers whose income is derived mainly from outside of Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA’s macro-prudential measures on property mortgage loans, introduced since 2009, have enhanced banks’ resilience to risks associated with the property market. The average LTV ratio of new residential mortgage loans fell to 49% in December 2017 from 64% in September 2009, before the countercyclical measures were first introduced. The average DSR also decreased to 35% in December 2017 from 41% in August 2010, when a cap on DSR was first applied (Chart 1).\n\nThe HKMA observed that some developers financed their property development projects with high gearing and some of them provided mortgages with high LTV ratios to buyers of properties. To address the risks associated with these developments, the HKMA introduced new risk management measures for lending to property developers on 12 May. These included requiring AIs to lower the financing caps for construction financing; requiring AIs to set aside more capital for their lending to property developers with a higher proportion of mortgage loans relative to equity; and performing a round of thematic examinations to ensure that banks continue to follow prudent underwriting standards in their lending to property developers.\n\nSeparately, the HKMA worked with the Land Registry in launching an e-Alert service in February. The e-Alert service provides a notification to the AI concerned whenever a further mortgage in respect of the mortgaged property is lodged with the Land Registry for registration, so that the mortgagee bank can take appropriate risk mitigating actions as appropriate.\n\n# Supervision of operational and technology risks\n\nCybersecurity threats continued to increase over the year. The HKMA stepped up its supervisory efforts in a bid to enhance the cyber resilience of the banking sector. As part of the Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative (CFI) rolled out by the HKMA in 2016, 30 AIs completed an assessment of the maturity of their cyber defences. Separately, the HKMA and the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), after extensive consultation with the banking and securities industry, jointly decided to introduce a mandatory twofactor authentication for online share trading. A round of on-site examinations focused on banks’ cybersecurity controls and operational resilience was also conducted. The HKMA further completed a round of discussions with the senior management of major banks to assess how the banks were managing strategic risks posed by potential new market entrants powered by technological advancement.\n\n# Smart Banking\n\nIn September, the HKMA announced a package of measures to assist Hong Kong’s banking sector in migrating to a new era of Smart Banking. On the supervisory front, the HKMA enhanced the Fintech Supervisory Sandbox to version 2.0, with new features including a Chatroom facility accessible by both banks and technology firms and the establishment of linkages among the sandboxes of the HKMA, the SFC and the Insurance Authority (IA), so as to provide a single point of entry for conducting trials of cross-sector fintech products.\n\nThe HKMA also launched a Banking Made Easy initiative to identify and minimise regulatory frictions with the aim of further improving customers’ experience in using fintech and digital banking services. A taskforce has been set up with the current focus on remote onboarding and account maintenance, online finance and online wealth management.\n\nA review of the existing Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks has commenced to facilitate the introduction of virtual banking in Hong Kong.\n\n# Supervision of treasury activities and liquidity risk\n\nAs the US continued to normalise its monetary policy, global fund flows might become increasingly volatile. In consideration of this, the HKMA placed increased focus on the supervision of liquidity risk during the year. The HKMA enhanced its supervisory liquidity stress testing with additional scenarios, including a more stressful but plausible scenario of fund outflows and a short-term, confidencedriven bank run scenario. The HKMA also stepped up the monitoring and analysis of individual AIs’ liquidity profiles and required selected AIs to strengthen their liquidity risk management capability.\n\nSeparately, the HKMA conducted more on-site examinations of AIs’ market risk management in respect of their debt securities portfolios. A round of thematic reviews were carried out to evaluate potential risks arising from AIs’ increased investment activities in foreign currency bonds and to assess the effectiveness of the corresponding risk management, including hedging practices.\n\n# Prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing (ML\/TF)\n\nThe Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) (Amendment) Bill 2017 was gazetted on 23 June and will come into operation in 2018. The amendment is intended to update Hong Kong’s regulatory regime for AML\/CFT in line with the latest international requirements as promulgated by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). These changes, together with updates to the statutory guideline on AML\/CFT, will help clarify and implement the risk-based approach in customer due diligence (CDD) processes for account opening and the maintenance of bona fide customers, and encourage innovation where such processes are carried out remotely.\n","terms":{"10 Years Plus Caring Organisation Logo":["10年Plus同心展關懷標誌"],"10-Year US

銀行體系穩定。\n\n2017年，金管局繼續將監管重點放在認可機構風險管治架構的有效性上，包括信貸及流動性風險管理系統。當年，金管局再推出一輪逆週期審慎監管措施，以加強銀行業應對樓市任何下行風險的韌性。面對日益增加的網絡威脅，金管局加強了對認可機構科技風險管理的監管。同時，金管局推出了七項措施，為香港邁向智慧銀行新紀元作好準備。作為打擊金融罪行的其中一環，認可機構的打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集管控措施的有效性，仍然是金管局的重點監管項目。在操守監管方面，金管局進一步採取措施，推動以客為本的企業文化，促進普及金融，並解決中小企及初創企業在香港開設及維持銀行帳戶時遇到的困難。此外，亦加強對認可機構銷售投資及保險產品的監管，以進一步加強客戶保障。\n\n本地在國際監管及會計標準的落實方面取得了顯著進展，包括資本充足標準、披露標準、穩定資金淨額比率、大額風險承擔限額、恢復規劃以及國際財務報告準則第9號。為支持應對瞬息萬變的銀行環境和不斷演變的風險格局所需的能力建設，金管局與業界合作，制定了提升董事專業能力計劃和資歷架構，以供銀行從業員使用。\n\n《金融機構（處置）條例》於二零一七年七月七日生效，使香港成為少數擁有全面跨部門金融機構處置機制的金融穩定理事會成員管轄區之一。該條例建立金融穩定的新防線，賦予金融管理專員在金融機構出現可能對系統造成不利影響的情況下，有序管理其失敗的必要權力。\n\n# 目標\n\n金管局的總體目標是促進銀行體系的安全與穩定。實現此目標取決於金融體系具備高度穩健性及能夠提供香港經濟所需的關鍵金融服務。\n\n銀行透過其業務運作方式，甚至在極端情況下以不整頓的方式倒閉，都可能影響系統的穩定性。金融管理專員作為監管機構，在確保銀行能夠抵禦衝擊並在危機中恢復其地位，從而最終有助於防止倒閉，在維護金融穩定方面發揮著關鍵作用。金融管理專員負責香港的銀行業務審慎監管，包括吸收存款業務。它負責授權香港的持牌銀行、有限制牌照銀行和吸收存款公司，這些機構統稱為認可機構。金融管理專員還負責指定和監管某些金融市場基建。\n\n然而，金融管理專員無法保證，香港的審慎監管制度亦非旨在保證零風險的金融體系。相反，金融管理專員作為處置機制當局，致力於確保認可機構倒閉時，處置程序能以有序方式進行，從而維持認可機構向客戶提供的關鍵金融服務的延續性。為此，香港已建立一套適用於金融機構的處置機制，其中金融管理專員是認可機構及其他金融機構的處置機制當局。\n\n# 2017回顧\n\n# 監督活動概覽\n\n2017年，金管局進行了192項非現場審查，涵蓋廣泛的議題，包括認可機構的CAMEL評分、公司治理、業務營運及風險管理。作為金管局持續推動認可機構加強風險治理的措施之一，金管局與認可機構的董事局或董事會級別委員會舉行了30次會談，討論重點風險管理議題。金管局亦進行了一項調查，以監測其最新公司治理指引的採用情況。此外，金管局、認可機構及其外聘核數師共舉行了27次三方會談。\n\n除遠程監管活動外，金管局繼續進行定期現場審查，並針對評估風險較高的領域補充進行專題評估。這種方法使金管局得以優先配置監管資源，專注於認可機構所面臨的潛在及更重大的風險。金管局當年共進行了401項現場審查及專題評估。信用風險管理與控制仍是這些審查及評估的重點。另一個主要重點是科技風險及業務操作風險管理。金管局亦增加了境外審查的數目，以及針對流動性及市場風險管理，以及打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集監控措施的現場審查及專題評估數目。金管局亦由專門團隊對認可機構在證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（強積金）相關業務的活動進行現場審查。\n\n# 信用風險監管\n\n#信貸增長與資產質素\n\n總體銀行借貸增長了16.1%，相比2016年的6.5%增長率。如表2所示，貸款增速涵蓋範圍廣泛。\n\n具體而言，截至2017年底，內地相關貸款增長17.5%，達到4,188億港元（表3）。 其中，有644億港元是透過在香港註冊成立的銀行在內地附屬機構簽訂的貸款。\n\n認可機構的資產質素於2017年仍然保持健康。零售銀行不良貸款比率從2016年底的0.72% 降至2017年底的0.54%，遠低於自2000年以來的長期歷史平均水平2.2%。 銀行業整體而言，不良貸款比率從0.85% 降至0.67%。 顧及與中國內地相關的貸款，零售銀行此類貸款的不良貸款比率在2017年降至0.75%，較一年前的0.82% 有所下降。 銀行業整體而言，此比率從0.80% 降至0.67%。\n\n年內，金管局加強監管力度，以確保認可機構繼續採取審慎的信用風險管理標準。特別是，對認可機構對主要企業的風險敞口監控得到加強。 進行了有針對性的主題檢查，重點關注關鍵信用風險管理控制，例如貸款批核準則、貸款分類及撥備制度、信用風險管治架構以及對房地產開發商的貸款、有抵押貸款和保險保費融資的風險管理。\n\n# 房屋抵押貸款\n\n二零一七年物業價格持續上升。認可機構的貸款額增加，涉及有多按揭或收入來源於香港以外的借款人。 鑒於此情況，金管局於五月十九日推出另一輪逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施。第八輪措施包括提高認可機構為新住宅按揭貸款計算資本充足率風險加權底線，降低適用於已擁有按揭的借款人的按揭貸款按揭成數上限，以及降低適用於主要收入來源於香港以外的借款人的按揭貸款供款與入息比率上限。\n\n自2009年起，金管局針對按揭貸款所實施的審慎監管措施，增強了銀行對樓市相關風險的應對能力。在逆周期措施首次推出前，即2009年9月，新住宅按揭貸款的平均貸款與價值比率（LTV）為64%，至2017年12月已降至49%。同時，供款與入息比率（DSR）的平均值亦由2010年8月首次實施DSR上限時的41%，降至2017年12月的35%（圖表1）。\n\n金管局觀察到，部分發展商以高槓桿為其房地產發展項目提供資金，並且部分發展商向買家提供高貸款價値比率的按揭貸款。為應對與這些發展項目相關的風險，金管局於五月十二日推出新的風險管理措施，以規管向房地產發展商的貸款。這些措施包括要求認可機構降低建築融資的融資上限；要求認可機構為向貸款與股權比率較高的房地產發展商的貸款，撥備更多資本；以及進行一輪主題檢查，以確保銀行在向房地產發展商貸款時，繼續遵守審慎的承銷標準。\n\n此外，金管局與土地註冊處於二月份合力推出電子提示服務。電子提示服務會在任何進一步關於該按揭物業的按揭於土地註冊處登記時，向相關的AI發出通知，以便承按銀行可以採取適當的風險緩解措施。\n\n# 營運及科技風險之監控\n\n網絡安全威脅在過去一年持續增加。金管局加強了監管力度，以提升銀行業的防範網絡威脅的能力。作為金管局於2016年推出的網絡防衛計劃（CFI）的一部分，30間認可機構已完成對其網絡防衛能力成熟度的評估。此外，金管局與證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）在與銀行及證券業界廣泛諮詢後，共同決定為網上股票交易強制採用雙重認證。同時，也進行了一輪現場審查，重點關注銀行網絡安全控制措施和營運韌性。金管局亦與主要銀行的高級管理層進行了一輪討論，以評估銀行如何應對科技進步所驅動的新市場參與者帶來的策略風險。\n\n# 智慧銀行\n\n九月，金管局宣布一系列措施，協助香港銀行業邁向智慧銀行新紀元。在監管方面，金管局將金融科技監管沙盒升級至2.0版本，新增功能包括銀行與科技公司均可使用的聊天室功能，以及建立金管局、證監會和保險業監管局（保監局）沙盒之間的聯繫，以便為跨領域金融科技產品的測試提供單一入口。\n\n金管局亦推出了「銀行服務便捷化」倡議，旨在識別並減輕監管要求，以進一步提升客戶使用金融科技及數碼銀行服務的體驗。目前已成立專責小組，重點關注遙距開戶及維持銀行帳戶、網上金融及網上財富管理。\n\n香港金融管理局已展開對現行《虛擬銀行的認可》指引的檢討，為在香港引入虛擬銀行提供便利。\n\n# 庫務活動及流動性風險之監管\n\n隨著美國持續調整其貨幣政策，全球資金流向可能變得日益波動。 鑒此，金管局在年內加強了對流動性風險的監管。 金管局強化了其監管上的流動性壓力測試，加入了更多情境，包括更具壓力但合理的資金流出情境，以及短期、信心驅動的銀行擠提情境。 金管局同時加大了對認可機構的流動性狀況的監測和分析，並要求部分認可機構加強其流動性風險管理能力。\n\n此外，金管局加強對認可機構在債務證券組合方面的市場風險管理進行現場審查。另進行一輪專題評估，以評估認可機構增加投資外幣債券所帶來的潛在風險，並評估相關風險管理措施的有效性，包括對沖做法。\n\n# 打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集 (ML\/TF)\n\n《2017年打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集（金融機構）（修訂）條例草案》於6月23日憲報，並將於2018年生效。此修訂旨在根據財務行動特別組織（特別組織）頒布的最新國際要求，更新香港的打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集監管制度。 這些變更，連同對打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集法定指引的更新，將有助於釐清及實施風險為本方法，以進行客戶盡職審查（CDD）程序，以開立帳戶及維持真實客戶，並鼓勵在遠程方式進行這些程序時的創新。\n"}
{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nTo consolidate Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre, the HKMA strives to enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. On fintech, the seven new initiatives aimed at facilitating the development and use of fintech in the banking and payment industries were well received by stakeholders and the public. Hong Kong’s international profile as a financing hub for infrastructure investments was raised further, thanks to a series of efforts on network and capacity building on this front. The launch of Bond Connect reinforced Hong Kong’s position as the main gateway to opportunities in Mainland China. The HKMA’s efforts on other areas such as corporate treasury centres were also bearing fruits.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nIn view of the rapid technological advancements, the HKMA in September announced the launch of seven initiatives to prepare Hong Kong to move into a new era of Smart Banking. These initiatives included:\n- developing the Faster Payment System (FPS) to achieve full connectivity of digital retail payments;\n- introducing an Open Application Programming Interface (Open API) framework;\n- enhancing fintech research and talent development;\n- stepping up cross-border collaboration in fintech;\n- upgrading our existing Fintech Supervisory Sandbox (FSS) 1.0 to Version 2.0;\n- facilitating the introduction of virtual banking; and\n- promoting a new Banking Made Easy initiative to minimise regulatory frictions in customers’ digital experience.\n\nThe HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO), together with the banking departments of the HKMA, played a pivotal role in driving the implementation of these initiatives to strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia.\n\nHong Kong’s international profile as a financing hub for infrastructure investments was raised further, as the number of partners of the HKMA Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO) grew to 87 as at 31 January 2018 from about 40 at inception. During the year, IFFO organised and participated in more than 10 seminars and workshops to facilitate experience sharing and collaborative networking among key stakeholders. In particular, IFFO steered the development of an infrastructure equity investment reference term sheet in its inaugural Debt Financing and Investors’ Roundtables with a view to enhancing infrastructure projects’ bankability and investability.\n\nBond Connect was launched in July, marking another major milestone in mutual access between the Hong Kong and Mainland capital markets, and further solidifying our gateway position for international investors seeking to enter the Mainland market. During the year, Hong Kong’s Renminbi Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (RQFII) quota was increased to RMB500 billion from RMB270 billion. Hong Kong maintained the world’s largest offshore renminbi liquidity pool, with vibrant renminbi financial intermediation activities as evidenced by a high turnover of our renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system and the lion’s share of Hong Kong’s renminbi payment activities in the world.\n\nFollowing the introduction of the tax regime for corporate treasury centres (CTCs) in 2016, the HKMA stepped up its outreach efforts with a view to attracting more multinational corporates to set up treasury centres in Hong Kong. By the end of 2017, more than 40 corporates reflected to the HKMA that they were actively planning to set up, or had set up, treasury centre operations in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA actively contributed to international discussions on issues of significance to global and regional financial stability. The Chief Executive of the HKMA became the Chair of the Standing Committee on Supervisory and Regulatory Co-operation (SRC) of the Financial Stability Board (FSB)1 in April to lead discussions on key financial stability issues.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure lays a solid foundation for Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre and global offshore renminbi business hub. The four interbank RTGS systems and the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) achieved 100% system availability in 2017, as compared to the target of 99.95%. To support Northbound Trading of Bond Connect, CMU has set up accounts with the two Mainland central securities depositories (CSDs) to facilitate the settlement of Bond Connect transactions and holding of Mainland debt securities on behalf of relevant CMU members.\n\nTo promote the general safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA designated four retail payment systems (RPSs) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO) in August to bring their operations under the HKMA’s oversight. The HKMA also conducted supervision of 16 stored value facility (SVF) licensees which actively launched new products and services that sought to offer customers more choices and better user experience. Separately, the coverage of e-Cheque and Electronic Bill Presentment and Payment (EBPP) service was further expanded to include crossboundary payments between Hong Kong and the entire Guangdong Province.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2017\n\n# Hong Kong as a fintech hub in Asia\n\n# Smart Banking Initiatives\n\nIn light of the rapid technological advancements, the HKMA in September announced seven initiatives that would prepare Hong Kong to move into a new era of Smart Banking. The initiatives aimed to help the banking sector to rise to a higher level and embrace the enormous opportunities brought about by the convergence of banking and technology.\n\n“Smart Banking would offer full interconnectivity amongst retail and corporate customers and allow financial services and transactions to be undertaken with great mobility, speed, ease and safety.”\n\nThe HKMA has been working closely with the banking industry and the fintech community, and made good progress in implementing the seven initiatives.\n\n# Faster Payment System\n\nThe FPS is a multi-currency platform that would enable the public to make round-the-clock funds transfers in a real-time manner with ease, through using mobile phone numbers or email addresses. It can support payments in Hong Kong dollars and renminbi. Banks and non-bank payment service providers can participate in the FPS, enabling full connectivity among all payment participants. With system development work close to completion, the FPS is scheduled to launch in September 2018.\n\nFurthermore, the HKMA led a working group, comprising major credit card scheme operators, banks, licensed SVF operators and merchant acquirers, to establish a common QR code standard for retail payments in Hong Kong. A common QR code standard would facilitate merchants in using a single QR code to accept QR code payment solutions from multiple payment service providers, providing greater convenience to customers and merchants. The working group has finalised the relevant technical specification, and would work out the implementation arrangements.\n\n# Open Application Programming Interface\n\nOpen API allows banks’ data to be accessed by third parties to facilitate better and easier integration of services offered by banks and other industries. Users can therefore conveniently stay on one system to enjoy integrated services in a secure environment. To facilitate the development and adoption of Open API by the banking sector, the HKMA has come up with a draft Open API framework, comprising a selection of Open API functions and deployment time frame, technical standards, third-party service provider governance, facilitation measures and maintenance models, for a two-month industry consultation.\n\n# Research and talent development\n\nOne of the major research projects was on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). Following the first DLT whitepaper in 2016, the second whitepaper on DLT was published in October 2017. The second whitepaper further explores the three Proof-of-Concept works, namely trade finance, digital identity management and mortgage application. It also offers advice on the implementation issues relating to governance, legal and compliance, and general control principles on deploying DLT for the banking and payment industries.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan, announces the release of the second whitepaper on DLT at the HKMA Fintech Day.\n\nRiding on the success of the Proof-of-Concept work on trade finance led by the HKMA, seven banks in Hong Kong decided to commercialise the prototype into a production system named Hong Kong Trade Finance Platform (HKTFP) to digitise and share trade documents and automate processes with a view to improving the overall trade process and reducing risks and fraud in the trade finance business.\n\nIn an effort to enlarge the talent pool in the fintech industry, the HKMA launched the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme in collaboration with the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute in December 2016. Response from students was positive. More than 3,000 applications from 421 applicants were received. Finally, 74 students accepted internship offers from the HKMA and 12 banks to work on fintech-related projects for six months or one year starting from July.\n\n# Cross-border collaboration\n\nAs the first step of strengthening our collaboration within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Bay Area, we are partnering with Shenzhen to promote fintech and talent developments. Specifically, the HKMA and the Office of Financial Development Service, the People’s Government of Shenzhen Municipality (OFDS) entered into an agreement in June to (i) provide reciprocal soft-landing support for fintech firms, (ii) co-organise the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Fintech Award in October to recognise and reward outstanding fintech products and solutions in the two cities; and (iii) arrange summer internships at Shenzhen fintech and techfin firms for Hong Kong students.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan (middle), signs and exchanges Memoranda of Understanding on softlanding arrangements with OFDS Director-General, Mr He Xiaojun (left), and Cyberport Chairman, Dr Lee George Lam, at the HKMA Fintech Day.\n\nE-leaflet for the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Fintech Award.\n\nThe HKMA also signed fintech co-operation agreements with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Dubai Financial Services Authority on innovation projects, referrals of innovative businesses, information sharing and exchange of expertise.\n\nIn November, the HKMA further signed a Memorandum of Understanding with MAS to jointly build the Global Trade Connectivity Network (GTCN), which would connect Singapore’s National Trade Platform to the HKTFP to form a cross-border DLT infrastructure in order to digitalise cross-border trade and trade finance processes, making them safer, more efficient and costeffective. It will be an open platform that allows other interested jurisdictions to participate in the future. The GTCN is expected to be launched in the first quarter of 2019.\n\n# Fintech Supervisory Sandbox\n\nThe FSS launched by the HKMA in September 2016 was upgraded to FSS 2.0 to expedite communication with banks and tech firms to facilitate new ideas and initiatives. Specifically, FSS 2.0 has the following new features:\n- A Fintech Supervisory Chatroom is set up to provide feedback to banks and tech firms at an early stage of their fintech projects.\n- Tech firms can access the FSS by seeking feedback from the Chatroom without going through a bank.\n- The sandboxes of the HKMA, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Insurance Authority are linked up so that there is a single point of entry for pilot trials of cross-sector fintech products.\n\nAs of end-2017, 28 new technology products have been tested in the FSS. Out of these cases, 14 pilot trials have been completed, and the relevant products have been rolled out to the market subsequently.\n\n# Banking Made Easy initiative\n\nA Banking Made Easy initiative was launched to minimise regulatory frictions hindering technological innovations. A taskforce has been set up with current focus on the following areas:\n- Remote onboarding and account maintenance\n- Online finance\n- Online wealth management\n\n# Virtual Banking\n\nVirtual banks, which operate without physical branches, are expected to provide additional impetus to the application of fintech in Hong Kong and offer a new kind of customer experience in mobile and digital banking. They may also help promote financial inclusion as they normally target the retail segment, be they individuals or small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The HKMA has commenced the review of the existing Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks with a view to facilitating the introduction of virtual banking in Hong Kong.\n\n# A New Era of Smart Banking\n\n# Supervision and Innovation\n\nThe seven initiatives unveiled by the HKMA last year to prepare Hong Kong for a new era of Smart Banking are a large-scale project involving cooperation among various departments within the HKMA. With fintech becoming an unstoppable force, Mr Raymond Chan, Executive Director (Banking Supervision) of the HKMA, indicated that the HKMA, as a regulator, must embrace this new trend by keeping abreast of the latest technological developments and adjusting its supervisory mindset and approach as appropriate, in order to take bank services and customer experience to a new level.\n","terms":{"10 Years Plus Caring Organisation Logo":["10年Plus同心展關懷標誌"],"10-Year US Treasury yield":["10年期美國國庫券收益率"],"10-year US Treasury yield":["美國十年期國庫債券收益率"],"10th Asian Financial

國際金融中心\n\n為鞏固香港作為國際金融中心的地位，金管局努力提升香港金融平台的競爭力。在金融科技方面，旨在促進金融科技在銀行及支付業發展與應用的7項新措施獲得各方及公眾的積極回應。香港作為基礎設施投資融資平台的國際形象，亦因在該領域進行一系列構建網絡及提升技能的措施而進一步提升。債券通的啟動鞏固了香港作為連接內地中國投資機會主要門戶的地位。金管局在企業財資中心等其他領域的努力亦已見成效。\n\n# 概覽\n\n鑑於科技的快速發展，金管局於九月宣布啟動七項措施，為香港邁入智慧銀行新紀元作準備。這些措施包括：\n- 發展快速支付系統（快速支付系統），以實現數碼零售支付的全面連通；\n- 引入開放應用程式介面（開放API）框架；\n- 加強金融科技研究和人才培訓；\n- 促進金融科技領域的跨境合作；\n- 升級現有的金融科技監管沙盒（金融科技監管沙盒）1.0至2.0版本；\n- 促進虛擬銀行的引入；以及\n- 推廣銀行服務更便捷的新舉措，以減少客戶數碼體驗中的監管要求。\n\n金融科技促進辦公室(FFO)與金管局的銀行部門共同發揮了關鍵作用，推動這些措施的實施，以鞏固香港作為亞洲金融科技樞紐的地位。\n\n香港作為基建投資融資樞紐的國際地位進一步提升，截至2018年1月31日，香港金融管理局基建融資促進辦公室（IFFO）的合作夥伴數目已由開展投資以來的約40家增至87家。該年度內，IFFO組織並參與了超過10場研討會及工作坊，以促進關鍵利益相關者之間的經驗分享與合作網絡建設。特別是，IFFO在其首次舉辦的債權融資及投資者圓桌會議中推動制定了一份基建股權投資參考清單，旨在提高基建項目的銀行可貸性及投資吸引力。\n\n債券通於七月推出，標誌著香港與內地資本市場互聯互通的又一重大里程碑，進一步鞏固了我們作為國際投資者進入內地市場門戶的地位。年內，香港的人民幣合格境外機構投資者(RQFII)額度從人民幣2700億元增加至人民幣5000億元。香港繼續保持全球最大離岸人民幣資金池，並有活躍的人民幣金融中介活動，這體現在我們人民幣即時支付結算(RTGS)系統交易額高，以及香港在全球人民幣支付活動中佔據主導地位。\n\n2016年企業財資中心稅務優惠制度推出後，金管局加強了推廣工作，以吸引更多跨国企業在香港設立企業財資中心。至2017年底，已有超過40間企業向金管局表示，他們正積極計劃或已經在香港設立企業財資中心業務。\n\n金管局積極參與關於對全球及區域金融穩定具有重要意義的議題的國際討論。金管局總裁於四月起擔任金融穩定理事會（金融穩定理事會）監管合作常設委員會（監管合作常設委員會）的主席，以帶領討論關鍵的金融穩定問題。\n\n香港金融基建的安全高效運作，為香港作為國際金融中心及全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐奠定了堅實基礎。香港的四個銀行同業交易的RTGS系統及債務工具中央結算系統（CMU系統）在2017年實現了100%的系統可用率，高於預設目標的99.95%。為支持債券通─北向通，CMU已在兩家內地中央證券託管機構（CSDs）開設賬戶，以促進債券通交易的結算，並代表相關CMU成員持有內地債務證券。\n\n為促進本地零售支付業的整體安全及效率，金管局於八月根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（《支付條例》）指定四個零售支付系統，將其營運納入金管局的監察範圍。金管局同時亦對十六個儲值支付工具持牌機構進行監察，這些機構積極推出新產品及服務，旨在為客戶提供更多選擇及更佳的使用體驗。另外，電子支票及電子帳單及繳費服務的覆蓋範圍進一步擴展，涵蓋香港與整個廣東省的跨境支付交易。\n\n# 2017年回顧\n\n# 香港作為亞洲金融科技樞紐\n\n# 智慧銀行創新方案\n\n鑒於科技日新月異的發展，金管局於九月宣布了七項措施，旨在為香港邁入智慧銀行新紀元做好準備。 這些措施旨在協助銀行業提升至更高的水平，並把握銀行業與科技結合所帶來的巨大機遇。\n\n智慧銀行將緊密連結零售客戶與企業客戶，讓金融服務和交易能以快速、輕鬆、安全的方式隨時隨地進行。\n\n金管局與銀行業及金融科技界緊密合作，並在落實七項舉措方面取得良好進展。\n\n# 快速支付系統\n\n快速支付系統是一個多幣種平台，將讓公眾能夠以簡易的方式，透過使用手機號碼或電子郵件地址，全天候實時進行資金轉賬。它可支援港幣和人民幣的支付。銀行及非銀行支付服務提供者均可參與快速支付系統，從而實現所有支付參與者之間的全面連接。隨著系統開發工作接近完成，快速支付系統預計將於二零一八年九月推出。\n\n此外，金管局領導一個工作小組，成員包括主要的信用卡發卡機構、銀行、持牌儲值支付工具營運商及商戶收單機構，共同制定香港零售支付的通用二維碼標準。此標準可便利商戶使用單一二維碼，接受來自多個支付服務供應商的二維碼支付方案，為客戶及商戶提供更大便利。工作小組已完成相關技術規格，並將制定實施安排。\n\n# 開放應用程式程式設計介面\n\n開放API 讓銀行數據可供第三方存取，以促進銀行及其他行業服務的整合，提升便利性。用戶可因此在單一系統內，於安全環境中享受整合服務。為推動銀行業開放API的發展及應用，金管局已擬定一份開放API框架草案，內容涵蓋一系列開放API功能、部署時間表、技術標準、第三方服務供應商治理、促進措施及維護模式，並將其提交業界諮詢，諮詢期為兩個月。\n\n# 研究與人才發展\n\n其中一個主要研究項目是關於分布式分類帳技術 (DLT)。繼 2016 年第一份 DLT白皮書之後，第二份關於 DLT 的白皮書於 2017 年 10 月發布。第二份白皮書進一步探討了三個概念驗證作品，即貿易融資、數碼身分管理和按揭申請。它也針對治理、法律合規以及在銀行和支付行業部署 DLT 的一般控制原則等實施問題提供了建議。\n\n金管局行政總裁陳德霖於金管局金融科技日宣布發布第二份白皮書。\n\n憑藉金管局帶領的貿易融資概念驗證成果，香港七家銀行決定將原型系統商業化，並將其命名為香港貿易融資平台（HKTFP），以數碼化及共享貿易文件，並自動化流程，從而改善整體貿易流程，降低貿易融資業務的風險和欺詐行為。\n\n為擴大金融科技行業的人才庫，金管局於二零一六年十二月與香港應用科技研究院合作推出了金融科技人才培育計劃。計劃得到學生的積極回應，共收到來自四百二十一名申請者的逾三千份申請。最終，有七十四名學生接受了金管局及十二家銀行的實習機會，從七月起參與金融科技相關項目，為期六個月或一年。\n\n# 跨境合作\n\n作為加強粵港澳大灣區內合作的第一步，我們正與深圳合作推動金融科技及人才發展。具體而言，金管局與深圳市人民政府金融發展服務辦公室（深圳金融辦）於六月簽訂協議，內容包括：（i）為金融科技企業提供相互的軟落地支援；（ii）於十月共同舉辦深港金融科技創新獎，以表彰及獎勵兩地優秀的金融科技產品及解決方案；以及（iii）為香港學生安排在深圳金融科技及科技金融企業的暑期實習。\n\n金管局總裁陳德霖（中）於金管局金融科技日與深圳金融辦主任何曉軍（左）及數碼港董事局主席李國雄博士簽署並交換有關軟著陸安排的備忘錄。\n\n深港金融科技創新獎電子宣傳單\n\n金管局亦與新加坡金融管理局（新加坡金管局）和迪拜金融服務管理局簽署金融科技合作協議，內容涵蓋創新項目、創新企業轉介、資訊共享以及專業知識交流。\n\n十一月，金管局進一步與新加坡金管局簽訂諒解備忘錄，共同構建全球貿易連接網絡 (GTCN)，將新加坡全國貿易平台連接至香港貿易融資平台，以形成跨境 DLT 基礎設施，藉此將跨境貿易和貿易融資流程數位化，使其更安全、更有效率且更具成本效益。 該平台將是一個開放平台，未來可讓其他感興趣的司法管轄區參與。 全球貿易連接網絡預計將於 2019 年第一季推出。\n\n# 金融科技監管沙盒\n\n由金管局於2016年9月推出的金融科技監管沙盒已升級至沙盒2.0升級版，以加快與銀行和科技公司之間的溝通，從而促進新構想和舉措。具體而言，沙盒2.0升級版具有以下新功能：\n- 設立金融科技監管聊天室，以便在金融科技項目的早期階段向銀行和科技公司提供意見回饋。\n- 科技公司可以透過向聊天室尋求意見回饋，而無需透過銀行即可進入金融科技監管沙盒。\n- 金管局、證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）和保險業監管局的監管沙盒相互連接，以便為跨領域金融科技產品的試行提供單一入口。\n\n截至2017年底，已有28項新科技產品在金融科技監管沙盒中進行測試。其中14項試行已順利完成，相關產品已陸續推出市場。\n\n# 銀行服務更便捷方案\n\n為便利銀行服務而推行的計劃旨在盡量減少阻礙科技創新的監管要求。 已經成立了一個專案小組，目前專注於以下領域：\n- 遙距開設及維持銀行帳戶\n- 網上金融\n- 網上財富管理\n\n# 虛擬銀行\n\n虛擬銀行無需設立實體分行，預期將為香港金融科技的應用提供額外動力，並為流動及數碼銀行服務帶來嶄新的客戶體驗。它們亦有助推廣普及金融，因為通常針對零售市場，無論是個人還是中小企。金管局已開始檢視現行的《虛擬銀行的認可》指引，以促進虛擬銀行在香港的引入。\n\n# 智慧銀行新紀元\n\n# 監督與創新\n\n金管局去年推出的七項措施，旨在為香港邁向智慧銀行新紀元作準備，是一項涉及金管局內各部門協作的大型計劃。隨著金融科技成為不可逆的趨勢，金管局助理總裁（銀行監理）陳瑞光表示，作為監管機構，金管局必須緊貼最新科技發展，適時調整監管思維及方法，以提升銀行服務及客戶體驗至新高度。\n"}
{"en":"# Reserves Management\n\nThe global economy and financial markets performed better than expected in 2017. Global equity markets went up on the back of synchronised economic growth in major developed and emerging market economies, strong corporate earnings, and market expectation of slow and gradual tightening of monetary policies by major central banks. While the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates three times as expected, and began to reduce its balance sheet in October, the 10- Year US Treasury yield remained stable and the US dollar weakened (rather than strengthened) against other major currencies. Under such a favourable environment, the Exchange Fund’s investment income reached a record high of HK$264 billion in 2017, representing an investment return of 7.4%.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary and may be invested in securities or other assets he considers appropriate, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC).\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nEFAC has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n(a) to preserve capital;\n(b) to ensure the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(c) to ensure sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) subject to (a)–(c), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the Fund’s long-term purchasing power.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund.\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP). The BP holds highly liquid US dollardenominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The IP is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of the assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA has been diversifying part of the Exchange Fund’s investments, in a prudent and incremental manner, into a wider variety of asset classes, including emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity and real estate. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The cap for the market value of investments under the LTGP is set at onethird of the accumulated surplus of the Exchange Fund, with further capacity arising from the allocation of part of the Future Fund to long-term assets.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007 to hold shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that were acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes, is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of the unique nature of this Portfolio.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by fiscal reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP1, with the exception of the Future Fund which links its interest rate to both the IP and the LTGP depending on the portfolio mix. As at the end of 2017, the portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 65:35. The portion of the Future Fund linked with the LTGP is expected to gradually build up to around 50% by 2018.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation. The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents the long-term optimal asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark, or strategic allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and tracking error limit are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may take positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nHKMA staff in the Reserves Management Department directly manage about 73% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, which includes the entire BP and part of the IP. This part of the IP includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 27% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes. The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to capture sustainable returns, to benefit from diverse and complementary investment styles and to share market insights and technical expertise with the Exchange Fund.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is primarily determined by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe high volatility of the financial markets subsequent to the 2008\/09 global financial crisis has highlighted the importance of risk management. Stringent controls and investment guidelines have been established for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and compliance with guidelines and regulations is closely monitored. Risk assessment has been strengthened to support the Exchange Fund’s increased pace of investment diversification. Risk-control tools are deployed to assess market risks under both normal and adverse market conditions. Detailed performance attribution analyses are also conducted to identify sources of performance, allowing the HKMA to make the best use of the investment skills of internal and external managers.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nThe HKMA is supportive of responsible investment. For instance, the HKMA supports the Principles of Responsible Ownership issued by the Securities and Futures Commission on 7 March 2016, which are voluntary and help investors determine how best to meet their ownership responsibilities in relation to their investments in Hong Kong-listed companies. For the management of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA has encouraged the appointed external fund managers for its Hong Kong equity portfolio to adopt the Principles of Responsible Ownership in managing the investments. Furthermore, the front offices and the Risk Management and Compliance Division have incorporated environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into various internal procedures for making and monitoring investment activities. The HKMA will closely monitor the development of ESG standards and assess how these standards can be further integrated into the investment process.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2017\n\nThe global economy and financial markets in 2017 performed better than expected. On the back of synchronised economic growth in major developed and emerging market economies, strong corporate earnings, and market expectation of slow and gradual tightening of monetary policies by major central banks, the global equity markets performed well. In particular, the Hong Kong equity market rose by 36%, outperforming other major equity markets.\n\nIn the bond markets, short-dated US Treasury yields shot up as the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates three times as expected, and began to reduce its balance sheet in October. Nevertheless, the 10-year US Treasury yield remained stable at about 2.4% over the year. Other major 10-Year government bond yields also ended the year little changed, with the exception of German Bunds which rose on the euro area’s solid economic growth and market expectation of the European Central Bank’s policy tightening.\n\nIn the currency markets, the US dollar weakened against other major currencies, despite the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes and the beginning of its balance sheet reduction. The depreciation of the US dollar was a result of the reviving economic growth in Europe and Japan, and market expectation of diminishing monetary policy divergence between the US and other major economies. The euro and yen appreciated by around 14% and 4% respectively against the US dollar in 2017.\n\nThe performance of major currencies as well as bond and equity markets in 2017 is shown in Table 1.\n\nTable 1 2017 market returns\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$264 billion in 2017. This comprised gains of HK$80.4 billion on overseas equities, gains of HK$58.3 billion on Hong Kong equities, gains of HK$34.4 billion on bonds, a positive currency translation effect of HK$53.5 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets and gains of HK$37.4 billion on other investments held by the investment holding subsidiaries of the Exchange Fund. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$4.5 billion.\n\nThe investment income of HK$264 billion last year is a record high for the Exchange Fund, surpassing the previous record in 2007 (HK$142.2 billion) by HK$121.8 billion.\n\nThe total assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,015.3 billion at year end. The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$235.6 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$157.2 billion and real estate at HK$78.4 billion. Outstanding investment commitments amounted to HK$162.4 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund (excluding the Strategic Portfolio) in 2017 was 7.4%. Specifically, the IP achieved a rate of return of 12.1%, while the BP gained 1.8%. The LTGP recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 13.7% since its inception in 2009.\n\nThe annual return of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2017 is set out in Chart 1. Table 2 shows the 2017 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over several different time horizons. The average return was 2.9% over the past three years, 2.5% over the past five years, 2.2% over the past ten years and 4.9% since 1994. Table 3 shows the currency mix of the Fund’s assets as at 31 December 2017.\n\nHKMA Deputy Chief Executive, Mr Eddie Yue (middle), speaks at the press conference on 2017 Exchange Fund Results.\n\nChart 1 Investment return of the Exchange Fund (1994–2017)\n\nTable 2 Investment return of the Exchange Fund in Hong Kong dollar terms\n\nTable 3 Currency mix of the Exchange Fund’s assets

儲備管理\n\n全球經濟及金融市場在2017年的表現超出預期。環球股市在主要先進及新興市場經濟體的同步經濟增長、企業盈利強勁以及市場預期主要央行將逐步且溫和地調整貨幣政策的支撐下上漲。儘管美國聯邦儲備局如期加息三次，並於十月開始縮減資產負債表，但十年期美國國庫券的殖利率仍保持穩定，而美元兌其他主要貨幣貶值（而非升值）。在如此有利的環境下，外匯基金的投資收入在2017年達到創紀錄的2640億港元，相當於7.4%的投資回報率。\n\n#外匯基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》（第66章）的規定，外匯基金的主要目標是直接或間接影響香港貨幣的匯兌價值。該基金亦可用於維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定與完整性，以協助香港保持國際金融中心的地位。外匯基金由財政司司長控制，並可在諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）後，投資於其認為適當的證券或其他資產。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標與組合結構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會已為外匯基金訂立以下投資目標：\n(a) 保本；\n(b) 確保貨幣基礎在任何時候均完全由高流動性的美元資產支持；\n(c) 確保有足夠的流動性可用於維持貨幣及金融穩定；及\n(d) 在符合(a)至(c)的前提下，實現有助於維持基金長期購買力的投資回報率。\n\n這些目標已充分考慮外匯基金的法定目的，並已納入基金的組合結構及目標資產分布中。\n\n廣義而言，外匯基金擁有兩個主要組合：支持組合（BP）及投資組合（IP）。支持組合持有高流動性以美元計值的資產，以根據貨幣發行局制度的要求，為貨幣基礎提供充分保障。投資組合則主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債券及股票市場，以維持資產價值及長期購買力。\n\n為更好地管理風險並提升中長期回報，金管局正以審慎和逐步的方式，將外匯基金的一部分投資分散至更廣泛的資產類別，包括新興市場及內地債券與股票、私募股權及房地產。新興市場及內地債券與股票由投資組合持有，而私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合（LTGP）持有。長期增長組合的投資市值上限，設定為外匯基金的累計盈餘的三分之一，並可透過將未來基金的一部分配置於長期資產來增加投資容量。\n\n於2007年設立的策略性資產組合，用以持有香港交易及結算所有限公司股份，這些股份是由政府為外匯基金的戰略目的而購入，由於此資產組合的獨特性，因此不包括在評估外匯基金的投資表現之內。\n\n# 與外匯基金的投資安排\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定組織的資金存放。利率一般與投資組合的表現掛鉤，但未來基金則根據組合比重，將其利率與投資組合及長期增長組合掛鉤。截至2017年底，未來基金在投資組合與長期增長組合之間的組合比重約為65:35。預計到2018年，與長期增長組合掛鉤的未來基金比例將逐步增加至約50%。\n\n# 投資程序\n\n外匯基金的投資程序以兩種資產配置的決策為基礎：策略性資產分布和戰略性資產分布。策略性資產分布反映在投資基準中，代表根據外匯基金的投資目標所設定的長期最佳資產分布。在策略性配置的指導下，資產會戰略性地配置，以試圖在基準之上取得超額回報。這意味著實際的配置通常與基準或策略性配置有所不同。實際配置與基準配置之間的差異稱為「戰略性偏離」。雖然基準和循跡誤差限額是由財政司司長與外匯基金諮詢委員會磋商後決定，但戰略性決策和戰略性偏離的允許範圍則是由金管局根據授權來制定。在戰略性偏離允許的範圍內，投資組合經理可以根據短期市場走勢進行投資操作。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n#直接投資\n\n金管局儲備管理部直接管理外匯基金約73%的投資，其中包括整個支持組合及部分投資組合。該部分投資組合包括投資於全球定息市場的一系列投資組合，以及實施宏觀風險管理策略的衍生工具組合。\n\n# 使用外聘投資經理\n\n除內部管理資產外，金管局聘用外聘基金經理管理約27%的外匯基金資產，包括其所有上市股票組合及其他特別資產。聘用外聘投資經理的目的是善用市場上最佳的專業投資技術，以獲取可持續的回報，並從多元且互補的投資風格中受益，同時與外匯基金分享市場洞察及技術專業知識。\n\n與外聘投資經理相關的支出包括基金管理和託管費、交易費，以及預扣和其他稅款。這些支出主要由市場因素決定，並可能逐年波動。\n\n# 風險管理與合規\n\n2008至2009年全球金融危機後金融市場的高波動性凸顯了風險管理的重要性。已為內部及外聘投資經理管理的投資組合制定嚴格的控制措施和投資指引，並嚴格監督對指引和法規的遵循情況。為支持外匯基金加快多元化投資的步伐，已加強風險評估。風險管控工具亦用於在正常及不利市場情況下評估市場風險。同時亦進行詳細的投資表現因素分析，以識別表現來源，使金管局能充分發揮內外聘投資經理的投資技能。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n金管局支持負責任投資。例如，金管局支持證券及期貨事務監察委員會於2016年3月7日發佈的《負責任的擁有權原則》，這些原則屬自願性，並協助投資者確定在對香港上市公司進行投資時，如何最好地履行其擁有權責任。在外匯基金的管理方面，金管局已鼓勵其委任的外聘基金經理在管理其香港股票組合時採用《負責任的擁有權原則》。此外，前線投資部門和風險管理及監察處已將環境、社會及管治因素納入各項內部程序，以制定和監控投資活動。金管局將密切監察這些因素的相關標準的發展，並評估如何將這些標準進一步融入投資程序。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2017年金融市場\n\n2017年全球經濟和金融市場表現好過預期。在主要先進及新興市場經濟體實現同步經濟增長、企業盈利強勁，以及市場預期主要央行將逐步緩慢收緊貨幣政策等因素推動下，環球股市表現良好。其中，香港股市上漲36%，表現優於其他主要股市。\n\n在債券市場中，短期／短香港銀行同業拆息美國國庫券收益率隨著美國聯邦儲備銀行如預期般三次升息，並於十月開始縮減其資產負債表而大幅上漲。儘管如此，10年期美國國庫券收益率在一年內仍維持在約2.4%的水平。其他主要政府債券的10年期收益率也幾乎沒有變化，但德國政府債券因歐元區強勁的經濟增長以及市場預期歐洲中央銀行將收緊政策而上漲。\n\n在貨幣市場中，儘管美國聯準會升息並開始縮減資產負債表，美元對其他主要貨幣仍走弱。美元貶值是歐洲和日本經濟復甦，以及市場預期美國與其他主要經濟體之間貨幣政策差距縮小的結果。2017年，歐元和日元對美元分別升值約14%和4%。\n\n2017年主要貨幣、債券及股權市場的表現如表1所示。\n\n表1 2017年市場回報\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n外匯基金於2017年錄得2640億港元的投資收益。其中包括海外股票的804億港元收益、香港股票的583億港元收益、債券的344億港元收益、非港元資產的正貨幣匯率變動效益535億港元，以及由外匯基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資的374億港元收益。另外，策略性資產組合錄得45億港元的估值收益。\n\n去年達 HK$264 億的投資收益是外匯基金的歷史新高，超越了 2007 年 (HK$142.2 億) 的舊紀錄，高出 HK$121.8 億。\n\n外匯基金的資產總值在年末達到四千零一十五點三億港元。長期增長組合的投資市值總計二百三十五點六億港元，其中私募股權為一千五百七十二億港元，房地產為七十八點四億港元。已承擔但尚未提取作投資的總額為一千六百二十四億港元。\n\n外匯基金（除外匯基金策略性資產組合外）於2017年的投資回報率為7.4%。具體而言，投資組合實現了12.1%的回報率，而支持組合則獲得了1.8%的回報。長期增長組合自2009年開展投資以來，其年率內部回報率為13.7%。\n\n外匯基金自一九九四年至二零一七年的年回報率列於圖表一。表二顯示了二零一七年的投資回報率，以及基金在不同時間段的平均投資回報率。過去三年平均回報率為2.9%，過去五年為2.5%，過去十年為2.2%，自1994年起為4.9%。表三顯示了基金資產截至二零一七年十二月三十一日的貨幣構成。\n\n金管局副行政總裁余偉文（中）於新聞發布會上講解二零一七年外匯基金的結果。\n\n圖表一：外匯基金的投資回報率（1994–2017）\n\n表

{"en":"# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communication with the community and the market through the media, public education programmes and other various channels to facilitate public understanding of its policies and operations. During the year, the HKMA continued to improve corporate governance by supporting professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline and enhancing IT security to cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives and the increasing complexity of work.\n\n# ENGAGING THE COMMUNITY CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT\n\n# Media relations\n\nThe HKMA works closely with the media to enhance transparency and promote public understanding about its policies and work. In 2017, 86 open press events were organised, comprising nine press conferences, 16 stand-up interviews and 61 other public functions. In addition, 42 media interviews were arranged and a total of 360 bilingual press releases were issued. It also handles a large number of media enquiries every day.\n\nTo raise awareness of the HKMA’s key functions, guided tours were organised for the media to visit the newly revamped HKMA Information Centre. Furthermore, indepth media briefings and educational workshops were conducted for local and overseas media on a wide range of topics, including the Bond Connect scheme, prudential measures for property mortgage loans, the Resolution Regime and Exchange Fund investments.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan, introduces a mosaic artwork called “Small Change, Big Ode” to the media at the HKMA Information Centre. The artwork, featuring the Victoria Harbour and the Hong Kong skyline, was created using a total of 135,811 pieces of Hong Kong coins in different denominations.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan, conducts a media interview with local newspapers regarding the key initiatives of the HKMA’s Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office and Fintech Facilitation Office.\n\n# Public enquiries\n\nThe Public Enquiry Service provides an effective means for the public to better understand the key functions and operations of the HKMA. A total of 8,752 enquiries were handled in 2017, about half of which were related to banking policies and regulations, monetary and economic issues, consumer banking issues as well as notes and coins. Notable examples included the Coin Collection Programme, banking products and services, bankingrelated guidelines and circulars, monetary and economic statistics, prudential measures for property mortgage loans, and prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received since 2014 and Chart 2 provides a breakdown in terms of the nature of enquiries received in 2017.\n\nChart 1 Total number of public enquiries\n\nChart 2 Nature of enquiries received in 2017\n\n# Publications\n\nApart from the HKMA Annual Report, in 2017 the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report and four issues of the Quarterly Bulletin, and released regular updates of the Monthly Statistical Bulletin to provide up-to-date and thematic information and analyses on monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. In addition, the HKMA issued a total of 23 inSight articles, covering various topical issues related to its work.\n\n# HKMA website\n\nThe HKMA corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk), with over 60,000 pages in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, is the public access gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It also contains the register of authorized institutions (AIs) and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the register of stored value facility (SVF) licensees under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance. Dedicated webpages and eye-catching short-cut links are designed to draw public attention to the new initiatives of the HKMA, such as account opening, the regulatory regime for SVFs, the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office and the Fintech Facilitation Office, as well as important and timely information, such as reminders on the need to remain vigilant against bogus telephone calls and the location of Coin Carts under the Coin Collection Programme.\n\n# Public Education Programme\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre is an important resource for introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters. It consists of an exhibition area and a library, and is open to the public six days a week. The exhibition area introduces the work of the HKMA and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong. It also contains reading materials and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nThe new look of the policy section of the Information Centre, which introduces the work of the HKMA and related financial concepts, was re-opened to the public on 24 February 2017 upon completion of the refurbishment work. The revamped policy section contains various interactive games and devices that integrate play into learning and explain complicated financial concepts in a simple way. Feedback from the visitors has been positive.\n\nStudents try out the educational games at the policy section of the Information Centre to learn about the work of the HKMA.\n\nGuided tours of the Information Centre are organised for visitors. During the year, it received more than 59,000 visitors and hosted over 650 guided tours for schools and other groups (Chart 3). More than 645,000 people have visited the Information Centre since it opened in December 2003.\n\nThe library, situated next to the exhibition area, houses more than 23,000 books, journals and other publications for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs and central banking topics. It also maintains the register of AIs and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nThe library in the HKMA Information Centre.\n\nTo reach out to the community and raise public awareness of the HKMA’s work, the HKMA organised four public education seminars for about 2,000 secondary school students and teachers in 2017. Topics covered in the seminars included the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, banking stability, consumer protection, the Deposit Protection Scheme, fintech, the Belt and Road Initiative and careers in the financial industry. More than 58,400 people have participated in this public education programme since its launch in 1998.\n\nStudents and teachers from secondary schools in different districts participate in one of the public education seminars.\n\nChart 3 Types of group visits to the Information Centre in 2017\n\n# HUMAN RESOURCES\n\nThe HKMA recruits, develops and maintains a highly professional workforce to support its policy objectives and respond flexibly to changing work priorities. While the HKMA is an integral part of the Government, it employs staff on terms different from those of the civil service to attract personnel with the right experience and expertise. As a public organisation, the HKMA aims to maintain a lean and flexible structure and, where possible, to redeploy staff resources to undertake new initiatives and meet increasing workload.\n\n# Organisational changes\n\nThe Resolution Office was established on 1 April 2017 to implement the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance enacted in June 2016. The Office aims to ensure that the Hong Kong resolution regime is operational for banks. This is essential to enhancing the resilience of the Hong Kong banking sector in the event of any crisis.\n\n# Staffing\n\nThe establishment of the HKMA in 2017 was 927. This will be increased by 35 to 962 in 2018 (an increase of 3.8%) to ensure that sufficient resources are provided to cope with the new initiatives and the increasing complexity and volume of existing work. The new posts are deployed to the following functions:\n\n- Enhancing banking and financial stability, which includes:\n    – enhancing capacity to support the launch of the Faster Payment System and easy banking initiatives;\n    – strengthening supervisory capacity to deal with the regional and business expansion of banks and to facilitate (i) the wider adoption of fintech in the provision of banking services and (ii) collaboration with other regulatory authorities on cyber security and fintech issues; and\n    – supporting the work of the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce to fight against fraud, money laundering and other types of financial crimes, and strengthening legal support for enforcement actions under legislation governing anti-money laundering and SVFs.\n- Strengthening investment, risk management and other related support for the further expansion and diversification of the Exchange Fund’s investment activities.\n- Stepping up global macro and financial-sector surveillance, and strengthening talent development programmes to ensure that the HKMA has the necessary human capital to meet the long-term development needs of the organisation.\n\nTable 1 gives a breakdown of the establishment and strength of the HKMA.\n\nTable 1 Establishment and strength of the HKMA on 1 January 2018\n\nTemporary resources are deployed to meet other work demands. The HKMA also transfers staff members on secondment to other international or local organisations, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Services Development Council, to assist in activities or policy initiatives in which Hong Kong or the HKMA has an interest. Some staff members are deployed on a full-time or part-time basis to provide operational support to the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board and the Treasury Markets Association.\n\n# Remuneration policies and pay review mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary (FS) determines the pay and conditions of service for HKMA staff on the advice of the Governance Sub-Committee (GSC) through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC), taking into account the prevailing market rates and practices. Remuneration comprises a total cash package and a provident fund scheme, with minimal benefits in kind. The cash package consists of monthly fixed pay (or basic pay) and variable pay, which may be awarded to individual staff members as a lump sum once a year, depending on performance.\n\nPay for HKMA staff is reviewed annually by the FS in the light of recommendations made to him by the GSC through the EFAC, taking into account the GSC’s assessment of the performance of the HKMA in the preceding year, the paysurvey findings of the financial sector conducted by independent human resources consultants, and any other relevant factors. Special pay adjustments may be made from time to time for individual meritorious staff members to maintain their pay competitiveness.\n\nAny approved annual adjustments to the fixed pay and any variable pay awards for the HKMA are distributed to individual staff members based on their performance. Investment professionals in the HKMA are subject to a variable pay system that seeks to strengthen the link between their investment performance and remuneration award. The pay adjustments and awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Executive Director and above are approved by the FS on the advice of the GSC. The staff members concerned are not present at the meetings when their pay is discussed. The pay adjustments and awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Division Head and below are determined by the Chief Executive of the HKMA under delegated authority from the FS and within the approved overall pay awards.\n\n# Remuneration of senior staff members\n\nThe remuneration packages of senior staff members in 2017 are shown in Table 2.\n\nTable 2 Remuneration packages of HKMA senior staff members in 2017\n\n# Manager Trainee (MT) and Graduate Economist (GE) programmes\n\nTo develop a pool of young talent with sharp analytical minds, strong communication skills and good team spirit for a long-term career in central banking, the HKMA runs two trainee programmes: the MT programme and the GE programme. Each programme lasts for a period of two years.\n\nThe MT programme prepares young graduates interested in central banking work to become the HKMA’s future key management staff and contribute to the financial stability and prosperity of Hong Kong. Each MT undergoes on-the-job training in two to three departments to acquire hands-on experience on the important functions of the HKMA. For the GE programme, young graduates interested in economic research are offered the opportunity to harness their research skills in two to three departments to provide important input to the policy formulation process.\n\nBoth the MT and GE programmes provide an all-rounded career development environment for the trainees. Apart from on-the-job training, the MTs and GEs also attend structured foundation central banking courses organised internally and by leading international or regional organisations. Upon successful completion of the respective programme, MTs are offered appointments as Managers and GEs as Economists to continue their pursuit of a professional career in the organisation.\n","terms":{"10 Years Plus Caring Organisation Logo":["10年Plus同心展關懷標誌"],"10-Year US Treasury yield":["10年期美國國庫券收益率"],"10-year US Treasury yield":["美國十年期國庫債券收益率"],"10th Asian Financial

機構職能\n\n金管局透過媒體、公眾教育活動及其他各種渠道，與社區及市場保持有效溝通，以促進公眾對其政策及運作的了解。本年度，金管局繼續透過支持員工專業能力發展、推行嚴謹的財政紀律及加強資訊科技保安，改善企業管治，以應對因推行新舉措及工作複雜性增加而產生的挑戰。\n\n# 參與社區企業發展\n\n# 傳媒關係\n\n金管局與傳媒保持緊密合作，以提高透明度並促進公眾對其政策及工作內容的了解。2017年，共舉辦了86項公開媒體活動，包括9場新聞發布會、16場即場訪問及61項其他公眾活動。此外，亦安排了42場傳媒訪問，並發出共360份雙語新聞發佈會。金管局亦每日處理大量傳媒查詢。\n\n為提高公眾對金管局核心職能的認知，金管局特別安排傳媒導賞服務，參觀甫翻新的金管局資訊中心。此外，金管局亦向本地及海外傳媒提供深入的傳媒簡報會和教育研討會，涵蓋多個重要議題，包括債券通計劃、物業按揭貸款審慎監管措施、處置機制及外匯基金投資。\n\n金管局總裁陳德霖先生於金管局資訊中心向媒體介紹一幅名為「細水長流，大氣磅礴」的馬賽克作品。該作品展現維多利亞港及香港天際線，由總共135,811枚不同面額的香港硬幣組成。\n\n金管局總裁陳德霖就金管局基建融資促進辦公室及金融科技促進辦公室的主要措施，接受本地報章的專訪。\n\n# 公眾問詢\n\n公眾查詢服務為公眾提供了一個有效途徑，以更深入了解金管局的主要職能和運作。二零一七年共處理了八千七百五十二宗查詢，其中約一半與銀行業政策及規例、貨幣及經濟事項、銀行消費者事宜以及紙幣和硬幣有關。顯著例子包括硬幣收集計劃、銀行產品及服務、銀行業相關指引及通告、貨幣及經濟統計資料、物業按揭貸款審慎監管措施，以及打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集。\n\n圖表1顯示自2014年起收到的公眾查詢數量。圖表2則根據2017年收到的查詢性質進行分類。\n\n圖表 1 公眾查詢總數\n\n圖表 2 2017年收到的詢問類型\n\n# 出版品\n\n除金管局年報外，2017年金管局還發表了兩期貨幣與金融穩定情況半年度報告及四期刊物《季報》，並定期更新《金融數據月報》，以提供香港貨幣、銀行及經濟問題的最新及主題性資訊和分析。此外，金管局共發佈了23篇《匯思》文章，涵蓋與其工作相關的各種熱門議題。\n\n#金管局網站\n\n香港金融管理局（金管局）的公司網站（www.hkma.gov.hk）提供超過六萬頁的英文、繁體中文及簡體中文內容，是公眾獲取有關金管局最新資訊的入口。網站亦載有根據《銀行業條例》第20條保存的認可機構（AIs）及本地代表辦事處紀錄冊，以及認可機構證券業務員工紀錄冊，還有根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（《支付條例》）保存的儲值支付工具持牌人紀錄冊。網站設有專門網頁及醒目快捷連結，旨在向公眾介紹金管局的新措施，例如開戶服務、儲值支付工具監管制度、基建融資促進辦公室及金融科技促進辦公室，以及重要及及時的資訊，例如提醒公眾提高警惕，防止接獲詐騙電話，以及硬幣收集計劃下的收銀車位置。\n\n# 公眾教育計劃\n\n位於國際金融中心二期55樓的金管局資訊中心，是向社區介紹金管局工作及提高公眾對貨幣銀行事務認識的重要資源。資訊中心包括展覽區和圖書館，並於每週六天向公眾開放。展覽區介紹金管局的工作以及香港貨幣銀行的發展情況，同時亦提供有關香港貨幣、銀行及金融事務的閱讀資料和展品。\n\n資訊中心政策專區經翻新後於2017年2月24日重新向公眾開放，介紹金管局的工作及相關金融概念。 翻新後的政策專區設有多個互動遊戲和裝置，寓教於樂，以簡單易懂的方式解釋複雜的金融概念。 訪客的回饋反應良好。\n\n學生在資訊中心的政策專區試玩教育遊戲，以了解金管局的工作。\n\n資訊中心為遊客安排導賞服務。在這一年內，資訊中心接待了超過59,000名遊客，並為學校及其他團體舉辦了超過650場導賞服務（圖表3）。自2003年12月開幕以來，已有超過645,000人參觀過資訊中心。\n\n圖書館位於展覽區旁，藏有超過二萬三千本書籍、期刊及其他刊物，供研究香港貨幣、銀行及金融事務和中央銀行事務之用。它亦根據《銀行業條例》第二十條的規定，保存認可機構及本地代表辦事處紀錄冊和認可機構證券業務員工紀錄冊。\n\n位於金管局資訊中心的圖書館。\n\n為向社會宣傳及提高對金管局工作的認識，金管局於2017年為約2,000名中學學生及教師舉辦了四場公眾教育計劃研討會。 研討會涵蓋的主題包括：聯繫匯率制度、香港銀行紙幣、銀行體系穩定、消費者保障、存款保障計劃、金融科技、一帶一路，以及金融業就業資訊。 自1998年推出以來，已有超過58,400人參與了這個公眾教育計劃。\n\n來自不同地區的中學學生和教師參與其中一場公共教育研討會。\n\n圖表3 2017年資訊中心團體參觀類型\n\n# 人力資源\n\n金管局招募、培訓及維持一支高素質的專業團隊，以支持其政策目標，並靈活應對不斷變化的重點工作。雖然金管局是政府的重要組成部分，但其僱用員工的條件與公務員體系有所不同，旨在吸引具備適當經驗和專業知識的人才。作為一個公共機構，金管局致力維持精簡靈活的架構，並在可行範圍內重新配置人力資源，以推行新計劃及應對不斷增加的工作量。\n\n# 組織架構變動\n\n處置機制辦公室於二零一七年四月一日成立，以執行二零一六年六月制定《金融機構（處置）條例》。辦公室旨在確保香港處置機制適用於銀行。這對於提升香港銀行體系在任何危機事件中的韌性至關重要。\n\n# 人力配置\n\n香港金融管理局（金管局）於2017年成立時的編制為927人。2018年將增加35人至962人（增幅為3.8%），以確保提供足夠資源，應對新的措施以及現有工作的日益複雜和增加的數量。新增職位將分配至以下職能：\n\n提升銀行及金融穩定，具體包括：\n– 增進對快速支付系統及銀行易措施的支持能力；\n– 鞏固監理能力，以應對銀行在區域及業務上的擴展，並促進（i）金融科技在銀行服務方面的更廣泛應用，以及（ii）與其他監管機構在網絡保安及金融科技事宜上的合作；及\n– 支持反訛騙及洗黑錢情報工作組的工作，以打擊詐騙、洗黑錢及其他類型的金融罪行，並加強就規管打擊洗錢及儲值支付工具的法例執行執法行動的法律支持。\n加強投資、風險管理及其他相關支持，以進一步擴展和多元化外匯基金的投資活動。\n加強環球宏觀及金融體系監察，並強化人才發展計劃，以確保金管局具備必要的資源，以滿足組織的長遠發展需要。\n\n表一列出了金管局的設立和規模。\n\n表1 2018年1月1日金管局的成立及規模\n\n調動臨時資源以應付其他工作需求。金管局亦會將職員借調至其他國際或本地機構，例如國際貨幣基金組織（國際貨幣基金組織）和金融發展局，以協助香港或金管局關注的活動或政策倡議。部分職員則以全職或兼職形式調派，為香港存款保障委員會及財資市場公會提供運作支援。\n\n# 薪酬福利政策及薪酬檢討機制\n\n財政司司長根據管治委員會的建議，透過外匯基金諮詢委員會決定金管局員工的薪酬及服務條件，並考慮現時市場的薪酬水平及慣例。薪酬包括總現金薪酬及退休金計劃，實物福利不多。總現金薪酬包括每月固定薪金（或基本薪金）及變動薪金，變動薪金可根據表現，每年一次過發放給個別員工。\n\n金管局員工薪酬每年由財政司司長根據管治委員會透過外匯基金諮詢委員會向其提出的建議審閱，並考慮管治委員會對金管局上一年度表現的評估、財務機構由獨立人力資源顧問進行的薪酬調查結果，以及任何其他相關因素。不時可就個別表現優異的員工作出特別薪酬調整，以維持其薪酬競爭力。\n\n任何經批准的年度固定薪酬調整及金管局的變動薪酬獎勵，均根據員工的表現分配予個別員工。金管局的投資專業人員遵循變動薪酬制度，旨在強化其投資表現與薪酬獎勵之間的聯繫。助理總裁（銀行監理）及以上的個別員工薪酬調整及獎勵，由財政司司長根據管治委員會的建議批准；有關員工在討論其薪酬的會議上並不在場。主管及以下職級的個別員工薪酬調整及獎勵，則由金管局總裁根據財政司司長的授權，在經批准的整體薪酬獎勵範圍內決定。\n\n#

課程\n\n為培養具備敏銳分析能力、強大溝通技巧及良好團隊精神的年輕人才，以利於其在中央銀行展開長遠的職業生涯，金管局推行兩個見習計劃：見習經理計劃及見習經濟師計劃。每個計劃為期兩年。\n\n見習經理計劃為有意從事中央銀行工作的年輕畢業生提供培訓，使其成為金管局未來的關鍵管理人員，並為香港的金融穩定與繁榮作出貢獻。每位見習經理需在兩至三個部門接受在職培訓，以獲得關於金管局重要職能的實際操作經驗。至於見習經濟師計劃，則為對經濟研究感興趣的年輕畢業生提供機會，讓他們在兩至三個部門發揮研究技能，為制定政策過程提供重要的意見。\n\n見習經理及見習經濟師計畫為學員提供全方位的職業發展環境。除了在職培訓外，見習經理及見習經濟師還會參加由機構內部及知名國際或區域組織舉辦的系統性中央銀行基礎課程。成功完成各自計畫後，見習經理將被委任為經理，見習經濟師則被委任為經濟師，以繼續在組織內發展專業職業生涯。\n"}
{"en":"# The Exchange Fund\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 157 to 243, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2017, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2017, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards.  My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report.  I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards.  I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017.  These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information.  The other information comprises all the information included in the 2017 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.  If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact.  I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.  I also:\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.  The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.  If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion.  My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report.  However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and\n- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements.  I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit.  I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nDavid Sun\nDirector of Audit\n\n11 April 2018\n\n# 1 PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES\n\nThe Monetary Authority, under delegated authority from the Financial Secretary as Controller of the Exchange Fund (the Fund), manages the Fund in accordance with the provisions of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).  The principal activities of the Fund are safeguarding the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong and maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems.\n\nThe assets of the Fund are managed as four portfolios: the Backing Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio and the Strategic Portfolio.  The assets of the Backing Portfolio fully match the Monetary Base, under Hong Kong’s Currency Board system.  The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.  The Long-Term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments.  The Strategic Portfolio holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited acquired by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) for the account of the Fund for strategic purposes. Operating segment information is set out in note 30.\n\n# 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n# 2.1 Statement of compliance\n\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with all applicable Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRSs), which is a collective term that includes all applicable individual Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, Hong Kong Accounting Standards (HKASs) and Interpretations issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), and accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong.  A summary of the significant accounting policies adopted by the Fund and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) is set out below.\n\nThe HKICPA has issued certain new and revised HKFRSs that are first effective or available for early adoption for the current accounting period.  Note 3 provides information on the changes, if any, in accounting policies resulting from initial adoption of these developments to the extent that they are relevant to the Group for the current and prior accounting periods reflected in these financial statements.\n\n# 2.2 Basis of preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe Group financial statements include the financial statements of the Group as well as the Group’s interests in associates and joint ventures.  The principal activities of the principal subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are shown in notes 16 and 17.\n\nThe measurement basis used in the preparation of the financial statements is historical cost except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair values as explained in the accounting policies set out below:\n- trading financial instruments (note 2.6.2.1);\n- financial assets and financial liabilities designated at fair value (note 2.6.2.2);\n- available-for-sale securities (note 2.6.2.5);\n- gold (note 2.11); and\n- investment properties (note 2.12).\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with HKFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure.  The estimates and associated assumptions are based on experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.  Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nNote 18 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of investment properties.  Note 36 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of financial instruments.  Apart from the accounting judgements involving these fair value estimations, there are no other critical accounting judgements involved in the application of the Group’s accounting policies.\n\n# 2.3 Subsidiaries and non-controlling interests\n\nA subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group.  The Group controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.  When assessing whether the Group has power, only substantive rights (held by the Group and other parties) are considered.\n","terms":{"10 Years Plus Caring Organisation

觀點\n\n本人謹此證明，我已審核起止於二零一七年十二月三十一日的《外匯基金》及其附屬機構（「本集團」）的財務報表，該財務報表載於第157頁至第243頁，內容包括《外匯基金》及本集團在該日期的資產負債表，以及截至該日止年度的收入及支出表、全面收益表、權益變動表及現金流量表，以及《財務報表附註》，其中包括重要的會計政策概要。\n\n在我意見中，該財務報表已根據香港會計師公會（“HKICPA”）發布的《香港財務報告準則》（“HKFRSs”）以及根據《外匯基金條例》第7條（《外匯基金條例》（第66章））行政長官所發出的指示，真實、公平地反映了基金及截至2017年12月31日的集團的財務狀況，以及截至該日止年度的財務表現及現金流量。\n\n# 意見的依據\n\n我根據《外匯基金條例》第7條所頒佈的行政長官所發出的指示及審計署審計準則進行了本次審計。根據這些準則，我的責任在報告中的「財務報表審計責任」部分有進一步說明。我根據這些準則與集團無關聯，並已根據這些準則履行了其他倫理責任。我相信我所取得的審計憑證充足且適當，足以作為我意見的基礎。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項為我在截至二零一七年十二月三十一日止年度財務報表審計過程中，根據我的專業判斷認為最為重要的事項。 這些事項已在我的財務報表整體審計範圍內加以處理，並在形成我對此的意見時予以考慮，我不會就這些事項提供獨立意見。\n\n# 其他資訊\n\n金融管理專員負責其他資訊。其他資訊包括載於《金融管理局2017年年報》內的所有資訊，但不包括財務報表及我的審計報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見並不涵蓋其他資訊，我亦不會就該等資訊發表任何形式的保證結論。\n\n在審計財務報表的過程中，我的職責是閱讀其他資訊，並評估這些資訊是否與財務報表或我在審計過程中取得的知識存在重大差異，或是否包含重大錯誤。若根據我所執行的工作，我認為這些資訊存在重大錯誤，我將會報告此情況。目前，我沒有任何需要報告的事項。\n\n# 金融管理專員及外匯基金諮詢委員會審核委員會負責財務報表的職責\n\n金融管理專員須根據香港會計師公會頒佈的香港財務報告準則及根據《外匯基金條例》第7條頒發的行政長官所發出的指示，編製真實及公允的財務報表，並實施金融管理專員認為必要的一切內部控制措施，以確保財務報表免受重大錯誤陳述的影響，無論該等錯誤陳述是因欺詐還是錯誤所致。\n\n在編製財務報表時，金融管理專員須負責評估集團持續經營的能力，並按適用情況披露與持續經營相關的事項，採用持續經營作為會計基礎。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會審核委員會負責監督集團的財務報告流程。\n\n# 會計師對財務報表審計的責任\n\n我的目標是取得合理保證，以確認財務報表整體是否不存在重大錯報，無論是因舞弊或錯誤所致，並出具包含我意見的審計師報告。合理保證係指高水平的保證，但並非表示根據審計署審計準則進行的審計必定能總能發現已存在的重大錯報。錯報可能源自舞弊或錯誤，若個別或合併起來，合理預期會影響使用者基於這些財務報表所作出的經濟決策，則視為重大。\n\n根據審計署審計準則進行審計時，我會在整個審計過程中運用專業判斷並保持專業懷疑態度。我也會：\n- 識別和評估財務報表中因舞弊或錯誤導致重大錯報的風險，設計並執行針對這些風險的審計程序，並取得足夠且適當的審計憑證，作為我發表意見的基礎。未能發現因舞弊導致的重大錯報的風險，高於因錯誤導致的重大錯報風險，因為舞弊可能涉及串通、偽造、故意遺漏、虛假陳述或繞過內部控制；\n- 為了設計適合情況的審計程序，我會了解與審計相關的內部控制，但並非為了對集團內部控制的有效性發表意見；\n- 評估金融管理專員所採用的會計政策的適當性，以及其會計估計和相關披露的合理性；\n- 就金融管理專員採用持續經營作為會計基礎的適當性作出結論，並根據所取得的審計憑證，判斷是否存在與可能對集團持續經營能力產生重大懷疑的事件或情況相關的重大不確定性。如果我認為存在重大不確定性，我必須在審計師報告中引起注意財務報表中相關的披露，或如果這些披露不充分，則修改我的意見。我的結論是基於截至審計師報告日期所取得的審計憑證。然而，未來的事件或情況可能導致集團無法持續經營；\n- 評估財務報表整體的呈現方式、結構和內容，包括披露，以及財務報表是否以實現公正呈報的方式反映其底層交易和事件；\n- 取得足夠且適當的審計憑證，以對集團內各實體或業務活動的財務資訊發表意見。我對集團審計的指揮、監督和執行負有責任。我對我的審計意見負有全部責任。\n\n我會與外匯基金諮詢委員會的審核委員會就審計的計劃範圍和時間安排，以及重要的審計發現（包括我在審計過程中發現的任何內部控制重大缺陷）等事項進行溝通。\n\n我亦向外匯基金諮詢委員會的審核委員會提交聲明，確認我已遵守有關獨立性的相關倫理要求，並向其通報所有可能影響我獨立性的關係及其他事項，以及在適用情況下，相關的保障措施。\n\n根據與外匯基金諮詢委員會審核委員會溝通的事項，我確定本期財務報表審計中最具重要性的事項，即關鍵審計事項。除非法律或法規禁止公開披露有關事項，或在極為罕見的情況下，我認為披露該事項的不利後果合理預期將高於其對公共利益的效益，否則我將在審計師報告中說明這些事項。\n\n大衛孫\n審計署署長\n\n2018年4月11日\n\n# 1 主要業務\n\n金融管理專員根據財政司司長以外匯基金管理人的授權，按照《外匯基金條例》（第66章）的規定管理外匯基金。基金的主要業務是捍衛港元匯率，以及維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定性。\n\n基金的資產分為四個組合進行管理：支持組合、投資組合、長期增長組合及策略性資產組合。支持組合的資產在香港的貨幣發行局制度下完全對應貨幣基礎。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債券及股權市場。長期增長組合持有私募股權及房地產投資。策略性資產組合持有香港交易及結算所有限公司股份，該股份由香港特別行政區政府（香港特區）為基金的戰略目的而購入。經營分部資料載於附註30。\n\n#

符合準則聲明\n\n這些財務報表已根據所有適用香港財務報告準則（香港財務報告準則）編製，而香港財務報告準則是一個統稱，涵蓋所有適用的個別香港財務報告準則、香港會計準則及由香港會計師公會發佈的解釋，以及香港普遍接受的會計準則。基金及其附屬公司（統稱為本集團）所採納的重大會計政策摘要載列如下。\n\n香港會計師公會已頒佈若干新訂或修訂的香港財務報告準則，這些準則於本期會計期間首次生效或可供提前採用。附註3提供有關因首次採納此等準則而導致會計政策變動（如有）的資訊，並說明此等變動與本集團於本期及往期會計期間所反映於這些財務報表的相關性。\n\n# 2.2 財務報表編製依據\n\n集團財務報表包括本集團的財務報表以及本集團於聯營公司和合營企業的權益。主要業務載於附註十六及十七。\n\n財務報表的編製採用歷史成本作為衡量基準，但以下資產及負債除外，它們均按公平值列示，具體說明請參閱下文的會計政策：\n- 交易用途的金融工具（附註 2.6.2.1）；\n- 指定以公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債（附註 2.6.2.2）；\n- 可供出售證券（附註 2.6.2.5）；\n- 黃金（附註 2.11）；及\n- 投資物業（附註 2.12）。\n\n按照香港財務報告準則編製財務報表，需要管理層作出判斷、估計和假設，這些會影響會計政策的應用以及資產、負債、收入和支出的報告金額。這些估計和相關假設是基於經驗及其他因素，在特定情況下被認為是合理的，其結果為評估資產和負債賬面價值提供了依據，而這些價值通常難以從其他途徑得知。實際結果可能與這些估計有所不同。\n\n會計估計及其相關假設會持續進行審查。若修正僅影響當期，則會計估計的修正應於該期間認列；若修正同時影響當期及未來期間，則應於修正期間及其後的各期認列。\n\n附註18載列有關投資性不動產公平值估計所用假設的資訊。附註36載列有關金融工具公平值估計所用假設的資訊。除涉及這些公平值估計的會計判斷外，應用本集團會計政策時，並未涉及其他關鍵會計判斷。\n\n# 2.3 子公司及非控股權益\n\n子公司是由集團控制的實體。集團控制另一實體，係因透過其與該實體的參與，而有機會獲得變動收益，或享有變動收益的權利，並具備影響該等收益的能力。評估集團是否擁有控制權時，僅考慮集團及其他相關方所持有的實質權利。\n"}

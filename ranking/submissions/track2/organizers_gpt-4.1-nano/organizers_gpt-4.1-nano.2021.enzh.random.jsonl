{"en": "# Chief Executive’s Statement\n\nThe year 2021 was a year of concurrent consolidation and development.\n\nIn 2021, the pandemic entered its second year unabated: global supply chains were disrupted, inflation pressures were on the rise, risk of premature tightening of global financial conditions increased.  Adding to the unpredictability were the emergence of mutant variants of COVID-19 and the intensification of geopolitical tensions.  Despite such a macro environment filled with uncertainties, we continued to safeguard monetary and financial stability and maintain operational resilience.\n\n2021 also brought hope for recovery with the successful rollout of COVID-19 vaccines together with the accommodative monetary and fiscal policies introduced in multiple economies.  The global economy began to recover from the severe contraction in 2020.  Locally, after having endured economic contraction in 2019 and 2020, the Hong Kong economy grew by 6.3% in 2021, thanks to the rollout of the vaccination programme and the Government’s pandemic relief measures which have lent crucial support to our economic recovery.\n\nWith financial and monetary stability maintained, as well as a steadying macro environment, 2021 gave us some room to pursue more development work.  We seized the opportunity and pressed ahead with developmental initiatives that will help our financial sector remain highly competitive. Significant progress has been made across our three strategic priorities, namely fintech, green finance and Mainland market opportunities arising from Hong Kong’s gateway role.\n\nAs we entered 2022, the global environment took a turn for the worse.  But as the saying goes, when the going gets tough, the tough get going.  We will continue to be proactive and pursue our developmental goals and priorities to be better prepared for the next challenge and to cement our status as an international financial centre.  We will also remain steadfast in our commitment to ensure the soundness of Hong Kong monetary and financial systems, as we have risen to the many challenges time and again as in the past.\n\n# Monetary and financial stability: foundation of an international financial centre\n\nSince its establishment in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has been a strong anchor of Hong Kong’s financial system and has helped Hong Kong withstand numerous shocks and challenges.  Despite the lingering uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and market concerns about the pace of US monetary tightening, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to function in an orderly manner throughout the year, reflecting the robustness of the LERS.\n\nThis confidence in our systems did not happen overnight, but is based on the solid foundation which has been built up over the years.  In its 2021 External Sector Report, the International Monetary Fund once again reiterated that the credibility of the LERS has been assured by a transparent set of rules, ample fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy, and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nThe confidence is also a result of our efforts in public and market engagement, as well as effective surveillance.  On the latter, we have leveraged technology and data analytics to strengthen our capability for more timely and comprehensive analysis on financial stability and macroprudential surveillance.\n\nThe robustness of the banking system is of paramount importance to financial stability in Hong Kong.  Two years into the COVID-19 pandemic, our banks remained resilient with liquidity positions and capitalisation faring very well by international standards.  As at end-2021, the capital adequacy ratio of local banks stood at 20.2%, well above the minimum requirement of 8%, while the average Liquidity Coverage Ratio of large banks was 151.9% in the fourth quarter of 2021, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 100%.  Despite a challenging credit landscape amid the pandemic, the asset quality of the banking sector remained largely stable during the year. The classified loan ratio of the industry was 0.88% at the end of 2021, down from 0.90% at the end of 2020, well below the long-run historical average of 1.8% since 2000.\n\n# Banking sector: a pillar of support to the economy\n\nAs always, the banking sector is an important pillar of support to economic activity.  This is ever more crucial in the face of economic fallout from the COVID-19 outbreak.  In the past year, a main challenge was to strike a balance between managing credit risk in the banking sector and maintaining the sector’s support for the real economy.  With our supervisory work over the years, banks continued to manage credit risks effectively.  At the same time, we worked closely with banks to provide the much needed relief to corporate and personal customers through the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme (PPPHS) and other relief measures.  The PPPHS, launched together with the Banking Sector Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) Lending Coordination Mechanism in 2020 allowing eligible corporate customers to defer loan principal payments by six months on a pre-approval basis, was again further extended twice during 2021 until April 2022 recognising that some economic sectors were still hard-pressed by the lingering pandemic and were in need of continued credit relief.  Subsequently, in light of a resurgence of local coronavirus infections, in February 2022, the PPPHS was further extended until the end of October 2022.  It is encouraging to see that the banking sector has joined forces with the HKMA to help relieve cash-flow pressures on corporate and individual borrowers, even whilst the sector itself is experiencing its own difficult operating conditions due to the outbreak of the pandemic.\n\nApart from the challenging credit landscape, the pandemic also brought about a more difficult operating environment and a digital landscape with escalating cyber threat. We have stepped up our efforts to enhance operational and cyber resilience of the banking sector, as well as consumer and investor protection amid increasing digitalisation and a surge in phishing scams.  In particular, the Code of Banking Practice was revised to enhance consumer protection in digital financial services.\n\nBesides supervisory work, we are dedicated to promoting financial inclusion and customer-centric culture in the banking sector.  Enhancing accessibility to banking services by customers in need has been one of our priority areas and we have been working closely with the industry to develop industry guidelines.  Further to the guidance on barrier-free banking services and provision of banking services for persons with intellectual disabilities, the industry, with the support of the HKMA, published in December 2021 a guideline to set out the principles and good practices for the banking industry in providing banking services to persons with dementia and customers in need.\n\nTo support the continued development of the banking sector in the future where the new growth opportunities and challenges require a new set of skills from the workforce, the HKMA has formulated a holistic talent development strategy — “Connecting Talent to the Future” — to groom future talent and upskill existing practitioners in a more systematic and targeted manner.  Our new strategy is built on three “connect” directions: connecting students to the banking industry, connecting practitioners to the future of banking, and connecting the key stakeholders together to enhance collaboration in implementing the strategy.  We have launched a series of outreach and promotional campaigns to attract more students to enter the banking industry. To better prepare university students to be “future ready”, we have launched the Future Banking Bridging Programme jointly with the Hong Kong Institute of Bankers, which comprises a series of courses that cover practical banking knowledge and useful soft skills that are highly in demand in the banking industry.  For the existing banking practitioners, we have been working closely with the industry on developing opportunities for upskilling through providing more in-demand training programmes.  In December 2021, the new Fintech module under the Enhanced Competency Framework for banking practitioners was launched.\n\nFinancial talent is crucial to the future development of Hong Kong as an international financial centre.  We will work hand in hand with all stakeholders with a view to strengthening the talent pool for the further development of the industry.\n\n# International financial centre: strong position underpinned by an unparalleled access to opportunities\n\nThe competitiveness of Hong Kong as an international financial centre is underpinned by the unparalleled access to opportunities it offers.  There is general consensus that global fintech adoption, opening-up of Mainland’s financial markets, and the mainstreaming of green and sustainable finance present huge opportunities for the future development of Hong Kong’s financial sector.  At the HKMA, we have dedicated substantial efforts in leveraging Hong Kong’s unique edge to capture these opportunities.  Let me talk about the fintech and Mainland opportunities first.\n\n# Comprehensive adoption of fintech\n\nThe pandemic has clearly demonstrated the power of fintech and permanently changed customers’ behaviour towards financial services.  To make sure we continue to stay at the forefront of the global fintech scene and are ready to tap all of the potential of fintech, we must build an ecosystem where the value of fintech is experienced across all levels and by all groups of people.\n\nThis vision has driven us to formulate a new strategy, “Fintech 2025”, which was unveiled in June 2021.  As its name suggests, it aspires to help the financial sector adopt technology comprehensively by 2025.  The strategy comprises five focus areas which cover the required elements to achieve a successful ecosystem, and also the right factors for the ecosystem to grow further in a virtuous cycle. The first two parts of the strategy, namely “all banks go fintech” and “future-proofing Hong Kong for Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)” mainly sought to create more demand for fintech adoption.  The other parts of the strategy relate to data, infrastructure, talent and funding, which are vital to the growth of the ecosystem.\n\nUnder this strategy, a number of new initiatives were introduced, such as the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) fintech pilot trial facility which allows financial institutions and technology firms to conduct pilot trials and obtain early feedback from regulators and users on their cross-boundary fintech initiatives, and the pilot launch of the Commercial Data Interchange which leverages the use of alternative data to facilitate SME financing.  We have also stepped up research on the application of wholesale CBDC to cross-border payments, and explored the prospect of e-HKD, which will increase Hong Kong’s readiness in terms of adopting CBDCs and in turn future-proof our city’s financial infrastructure in the decades ahead.\n\nWhile we capitalise on the new opportunities presented by technological advancement, we also continue to build on our existing achievements as well as watch out for new risks that may arise.  For example, the Faster Payment System (FPS) introduced in 2018 has grown rapidly over the years, with the number of registrations reaching 9.6 million at the end of 2021, up 40% year on year.  The average daily turnover also increased 90% from 2020, reaching about 673,000 real-time transactions in 2021.  Meanwhile, in view of the rapid development of crypto-assets particularly payment-related stablecoins, we have issued a discussion paper earlier this year to invite market feedback on the development of an appropriate regulatory framework.\n\nOur new, forward-thinking strategy will set the scene for a healthy growth of the fintech ecosystem.  As the banking sector increasingly adopts fintech to capture the opportunities it offers, this will ultimately benefit both financial institutions and Hong Kong people, while strengthening Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre.\n\n# Hong Kong as the dominant gateway to the Mainland\n\nHong Kong has always played a strategic role in linking the Mainland market with international financial markets, providing international investors with a familiar regime and platform to conduct various kinds of financial, investment and wealth management activities.  The National 14th Five-Year Plan strengthens Hong Kong’s position as an international financial centre, a global offshore renminbi business hub, as well as asset management and risk management centres. This together with global economic trends has reinforced our conviction that Hong Kong should continue to enhance its unique value as a bridge connecting the Mainland and international markets.\n\nIn 2021, we reached a milestone in enhancing connectivity, adding two new members to our family of Connect schemes, namely the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) Scheme in the GBA, and Southbound Trading under Bond Connect, essentially completing the two-way loop of mutual access in a wide spectrum of financial markets including equities, debts and wealth management.  The launch of the two schemes will bring new opportunities for Hong Kong in various aspects. By meeting the increasing diversification needs of Mainland investors, the two schemes will enlarge the customer base of our bond market and wealth management industry.  I am pleased to see that these two schemes have been operating smoothly.  The HKMA will continue to engage the Mainland authorities to further enhance these schemes over time.\n", "zh": "行長聲明\n\n2021年是一個並行發展與發展的年份。\n\n在2021年，疫情進入第二年，未見緩解：全球供應鏈受到擾亂，通脹壓力上升，全球金融環境過早收緊的風險增加。更添變數的是新病毒變種的出現以及地緣政治緊張局勢的升溫。儘管宏觀環境充滿不確定性，我們仍繼續保障貨幣金融穩定，維持營運韌性。\n\n2021年也帶來復甦的希望，隨著多個經濟體成功推行COVID-19疫苗接種及推出寬鬆貨幣和財政政策，全球經濟開始從2020年的嚴重收縮中復蘇。就本地而言，在經歷2019年和2020年的經濟收縮後，香港經濟在2021年增長了6.3%，這得益於疫苗接種計劃的推行以及政府的疫情救助措施，為我們的經濟復甦提供了關鍵支持。\n\n在維持金融及貨幣穩定、宏觀環境趨於穩定的情況下，2021年給予我們更多空間去推動發展工作。我們把握機遇，推動有助於金融行業保持高度競爭力的發展措施。在我們三大策略重點——金融科技、綠色金融和「一國兩制」港股通、南向交易等內地市場機遇——方面已取得顯著進展。\n\n隨著我們步入2022年，全球環境轉趨嚴峻。但俗話說：困難時期，勇者迎難而上。我們將繼續積極主動，追求發展目標與重點，為下一個挑戰做好更充分準備，鞏固我們作為國際金融中心的地位。我們亦將堅定承諾，確保香港貨幣與金融系統的健全，正如過去一樣屢次抵禦挑戰。\n\n# 貨幣金融穩定：國際金融中心的基石\n\n自1983年成立以來，聯匯制度（LERS）始終是香港金融體系的重要支柱，幫助香港抵禦多次衝擊與挑戰。儘管COVID-19疫情仍未解除，市場對美國貨幣收緊速度的擔憂依然存在，香港元匯市和貨幣市場全年仍有序運作，反映聯匯制度的韌性。\n\n這份信心並非一蹴而就，而是建立在多年的堅實基礎之上。國際貨幣基金組織在其2021年外部經濟報告中再次重申，聯匯制度的信譽由透明的規則、充足的財政及外匯儲備、嚴格的金融監管與監督、彈性的經濟體制以及審慎的財政框架所保障。\n\n這種信心也源自我們在公眾及市場的溝通努力以及有效的監測措施。對於後者，我們利用科技與數據分析，加強對金融穩定和宏觀審慎監測的即時性與全面性。\n\n銀行系統的韌性是香港金融穩定的重中之重。經過兩年的疫情考驗，我們的銀行在流動性與資本情況方面保持韌性，表現良好。截止2021年底，本地銀行的資本充足率為20.2%，高於8%的最低要求；主要銀行的平均流動性覆蓋比率在2021年第四季度為151.9%，亦遠高於法定最低要求100%。儘管經濟環境充滿挑戰，銀行業的資產質素整體保持穩定，行業的分類貸款比率在2021年底為0.88%，低於2020年底的0.90%，大大低於自2000年以來的長期平均值1.8%。\n\n# 銀行業：支撐經濟的支柱\n\n銀行業一直是經濟活動的重要支柱。在COVID-19疫情席捲之下，尤為重要。去年，我們面臨的主要挑戰是如何在管理信貸風險與支持實體經濟之間取得平衡。憑藉多年來的監管經驗，銀行持續有效管理信貸風險。同時，我們亦與銀行密切合作，透過預先核准的本金寬減假期計劃（PPPHS）及其他救援措施，向企業及個人客戶提供急需的緩解措施。2020年推出的PPPHS，讓符合資格的企業客戶在預先核准情況下延後六個月的本金還款，並於2021年再次延長兩次，直至2022年4月，以因應某些經濟部門仍受疫情影響，需要持續信貸援助。隨後，2022年2月，以本地新冠疫情復燃為背景，PPPHS再度延長至2022年10月底。令人欣慰的是，銀行界與金管局攜手合作，協助緩解企業及個人借款人的現金流壓力，即使銀行界本身亦面對疫情所帶來的困難經營狀況。\n\n除了信貸環境的挑戰外，疫情亦帶來更艱難的營運環境與不斷升級的網絡安全威脅。我們已加強措施，以提升銀行業的營運及網絡韌性，以及在數字化日益普及及網絡釣魚詐騙激增的情況下，加強消費者和投資者保護。特別是，我們修訂了銀行守則，以增強數字金融服務中的消費者保障。\n\n除監管工作外，我們亦致力推廣金融包容和客戶至上文化。改善需要銀行服務的顧客的可接近性，是我們的重點之一。我們正與行業緊密合作，制定行業指引。除了無障礙金融服務及支援智障人士的相關指引外，金管局於2021年12月公布了為失智症患者及有需要客戶提供銀行服務的原則和良好做法指引。\n\n為支援未來銀行業的持續發展，面對新機遇與挑戰需要新技能，金管局制定了全面的人才發展策略——「連結未來的人才」——旨在培養未來人才並系統性提升現有從業人員的專業水平。我們的策略以三大「連結」為核心：連結學生與銀行業、連結從業人員與銀行的未來，以及聯繫各利益相關者，促進合作與策略落實。我們推行多項宣傳與推廣活動，吸引更多學生進入銀行業。為更好地令大學生「未來已備」，我們聯合香港銀行學會推出未來銀行橋梁計劃，內容涵蓋實用銀行知識及高需求的軟技能。對現有從業人員，我們亦在推動提供更多在職培訓，2021年12月推出了新版銀行從業人員金融科技能力框架。\n\n金融人才對香港作為國際金融中心的未來發展至關重要。我們將攜手各方，共同加強人才儲備，推動行業持續前行。\n\n# 國際金融中心：憑藉無與倫比的機遇優勢奠定堅實基礎\n\n香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力，得益於其所提供的無與倫比的機遇。普遍認為，全球金融科技的廣泛應用、大陸金融市場的開放，以及綠色和可持續金融的推廣，為香港金融行業的未來發展提供了巨大契機。在金管局，我們積極利用香港獨特的優勢，把握這些機遇。首先談談金融科技與內地機遇。\n\n# 全面推動金融科技\n\n疫情清楚展示了金融科技的力量，並永久改變了客戶對金融服務的行為。為保持在全球金融科技舞台的領先地位，並充分挖掘金融科技的潛力，我們必須建立一個讓金融科技價值在各層面、所有群體中體驗的生態系統。\n\n這一構想促使我們制定了「金融科技2025」戰略，於2021年6月揭幕。顧名思義，旨在助力金融行業在2025年前全面採用科技。該策略包括五個焦點領域，涵蓋構建成功生態系的必要元素，以及促進生態系持續良性循環的關鍵因素。前兩個部分，即「所有銀行進入金融科技」與「未來保證香港央行數字貨幣（CBDC）」主要旨提供更多需求，推動金融科技普及；其他部分涉及數據、基礎設施、人才與資金，對促進生態系的成長至關重要。\n\n根據此策略，我們推出多項新措施，例如粵港澳大灣區（GBA）金融科技試點合作平台，讓金融機構與科技公司進行試點，並提前向監管者與用戶收集反饋；以及利用替代數據推動中小企融資的商業數據交換系統的試點啟動。我們亦加大對跨境支付的批發CBDC應用研究，並探索電子港元（e-HKD）的前景，以提升香港採用CBDC的準備度，為未來數十年城市金融基礎設施的發展提供保障。\n\n在把握科技進步帶來的新機遇的同時，我們亦會持續鞏固現有成就，並留意新風險。比如，2018年推出的快能付（FPS）多年来快速发展，至2021年底，登記用戶已達960萬，較前年增長40%。日均交易額亦由2020年的約673,000宗增加90%，2021年日均即時交易達到約673,000宗。同時，鑑於加密資產尤其是支付相關穩定幣的迅速發展，我們在今年早些時候發布討論文件，徵求市場對建立適當監管框架的意見。\n\n我們的新戰略旨在為金融科技生態提供健康的成長空間。隨著銀行業越來越多地採用金融科技捕捉機遇，最終將惠及金融機構與香港市民，亦將加強香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。\n\n# 香港作為內地的主要門戶\n\n香港一直在連結內地市場與國際金融市場方面扮演戰略角色，為國際投資者提供熟悉的制度與平台，以進行各類金融、投資及財富管理活動。國家「十四五規劃」進一步鞏固了香港作為國際金融中心、全球離岸人民幣業務中心及資產管理和風險管理中心的地位。這與全球經濟趨勢相輔相成，堅定了我們的信念：香港應持續提升其作為橋樑，連接內地與國際市場的獨特價值。\n\n2021年，我們在增強連通性方面邁出重要一步，新增兩個「互聯互通」計劃：粵港澳大灣區的「跨境理財通」及「債券通」南向交易，實現資金流動的雙向互通，涵蓋股市、債券及資產管理等領域。這兩個計劃的推出，將為香港帶來多方面新機遇。滿足內地投資者日益多元化的需求，將擴大我們債券市場及財富管理行業的用戶群。很高興看到這兩個計劃運作順利。金管局將繼續與內地當局溝通，逐步深化和擴展相關安排。"}

{"en": "# Priorities for 2022 and Beyond\n\nGlobal and local conditions deteriorated notably entering 2022. On the one hand, the escalation of the Ukraine situation and expectations of rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve triggered market volatility. On the other hand, the local economy took a hit from the new wave of COVID-19 pandemic. That said, Hong Kong’s financial system remains well-positioned to withstand adverse shocks given its resilience and buffers built up over the years. Looking ahead, the HKMA will continue to attach high importance to safeguarding monetary and financial stability. In doing so, we will endeavour to stay ahead of the curve by identifying emerging risks and responding to them in an agile manner. At the same time, the HKMA will seek opportunities that would help bolster Hong Kong’s status as a leading international financial centre. In managing the Exchange Fund in this complicated investment environment, the HKMA will continue to invest prudently, while remaining flexible, implementing defensive measures as appropriate, and maintaining a high degree of liquidity.\n\n# STABILITY AND INTEGRITY OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM\n\nThe global economic outlook remains subject to significant uncertainties.  The HKMA will keep abreast of latest developments and stay vigilant against potential risks, with the aim of upholding the resilience and stability of the financial system, which are essential for the ongoing provision of critical financial services that support the functioning of the Hong Kong economy.\n\n# Staying vigilant against potential risks\n\nLooking ahead, markets may be subject to heightened volatilities amid increased uncertainties on various fronts. On the one hand, the US Federal Reserve’s monetary policy normalisation, if continuing at a fast pace, may tighten global financial conditions visibly ahead and increase the global debt-servicing burden.  On the other hand, following the escalation of the Ukraine situation in early 2022, geopolitical uncertainties including the China–US tension may continue to stay high and trigger bouts of financial market volatility again.  Last but not least, with the evolving pandemic developments, there might be a potential downside scenario where lockdowns were to be re-imposed at a large scale, leading to persistent global supply bottlenecks and adversely affecting global growth and inflation.  Having said that, Hong Kong’s financial system is well-positioned to withstand adverse shocks given the resilience and buffers built up over the years.  The HKMA also has the capability, resources and commitment to safeguard Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nThe HKMA will continue to closely monitor risks and vulnerabilities in the domestic and external environments and stand ready to deploy appropriate measures where necessary to maintain Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. Research programmes in 2022 will study issues affecting the Hong Kong economy and assess their potential risks. Meanwhile, the HKMA’s ongoing Digitalisation Programme will help enhance its surveillance capabilities to support more holistic surveillance and comprehensive analysis of the financial system.\n\n# Maintaining banking stability\n\nAs developed markets tighten monetary policies and the impact of the pandemic lingers, the credit landscape facing the banking sector is expected to remain challenging. At the same time, rapid technological advancement and digitalisation present both opportunities and challenges to the banking sector.  Facing an ever-changing financial landscape, the HKMA strives to ensure banks’ ability to withstand shocks through its ongoing supervisory efforts. At the same time, the HKMA will also continue to enhance and refine its banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account international standards and best practices.\n\n# A risk-based supervisory focus\n\n# Credit risk\n\nIn 2022, the HKMA will step up the surveillance of banks’ credit risk exposures and take proactive steps to ensure that overall risk levels remain well contained.\n\nThe HKMA will also continue to monitor the development of the pandemic and its effect on the operating conditions of corporates, as well as maintain close dialogue with the banking and commercial sectors while keeping the various relief measures under review.\n\n# Operational and technology risks\n\nWith the issuance of the new Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module on “Operational Resilience” in May 2022, the HKMA will continue to engage the industry and understand authorized institutions’ (AIs’) progress in developing their operational resilience frameworks.  In parallel, the HKMA will seek to raise the banking sector’s cyber resilience by following up with AIs on issues revealed by the assessments under the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 and monitoring AIs’ implementation of secure tertiary data backup.  Another key supervisory focus will be evaluating and addressing the risks from AIs’ growing dependency on technology service providers.\n\nWith enhanced digital capabilities and extensive remote working experience accumulated during the pandemic, some AIs are planning to transition to a hybrid working model on a business-as-usual basis.  The HKMA will keep track of this development and assess whether the associated risks are adequately addressed by the industry.\n\n# Liquidity and market risks\n\nThe HKMA will focus on the supervision of AIs’ liquidity and market risk management in 2022.  In particular, the HKMA will continue to monitor AIs’ progress in transitioning away from the remaining London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) settings before these settings cease to be published by 30 June 2023.\n\n# Combating money laundering and terrorist financing\n\nIn 2022, the HKMA’s work on anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) will continue to focus on strengthening response to fraud and financial crime through collaboration and information sharing, pursuing closer co-operation with various stakeholders in the AML/CFT ecosystem.  Other priorities are to implement a wider range of risk-sensitive supervisory techniques, by leveraging enhanced data and supervisory technology (Suptech) capabilities, and promote the use of Regtech by banks, including transaction monitoring systems.\n\nThe HKMA will also keep working closely with the Government, the banking and stored value facility (SVF) sectors to publish an updated Hong Kong money laundering and terrorist financing risk assessment, and assist the industry in combatting new and emerging risks.  Work will also continue on understanding evolving money laundering and terrorist financing risks, implementing changes to AML law and related guidance to align with international standards, and maintaining proactive engagement with other regulators and international standard setters.\n\n# Wealth management and mandatory provident fund-related businesses\n\nIn 2022, the HKMA will carry out on-site examinations and off-site surveillance of AIs’ conduct in relation to wealth management and the selling of securities, mandatory provident fund (MPF) and other investment and insurance products, with a focus on the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) Scheme in the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area, digital advisory platforms, complex products, virtual assets and non-investment-linked long term insurance products.\n\nWhile maintaining close communication with other regulators and the banking industry, the HKMA will provide further guidance on regulatory standards in relation to the sale of investment, insurance and MPF products.  This will cover, among other things, investment services related to virtual assets and the selling of Protection Linked Plans, a new subset of investment-linked assurance scheme products with high level of insurance protection.  The HKMA, the Insurance Authority and the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority will jointly launch a mystery shopping programme on the selling practices of intermediaries in respect of Qualifying Deferred Annuity Policies and Tax-deductible Voluntary Contributions.\n\nFollowing the smooth launch of the Cross-boundary WMC, the HKMA will continue engaging the industry and relevant regulatory authorities to enhance the scheme.\n\nMoreover, the HKMA will embark on preparation work for supervising AIs’ trust business under a new SPM module and a new Code of Practice.\n\n# Oversight of financial market infrastructures\n\nThe HKMA will continue to promote the safety and efficiency of the financial market infrastructures (FMIs) under its oversight, in accordance with the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO), the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMI)1, and the various guidances issued by the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI).  It will fine-tune the FMI oversight framework taking into account the latest technological and market developments.\n\nThe HKMA will work with the FMIs on their observance of the PFMI, conducting and updating assessments as appropriate. In addition, the HKMA will continue to participate in the CPMI-IOSCO PFMI implementation monitoring and assessment exercise.  The HKMA will also participate in the work of international standard setting bodies and strengthen its oversight requirements in response to market and technology developments and in line with international practices.  The HKMA will work with relevant authorities to further strengthen co-operative oversight arrangements where appropriate.\n\n# Policy development\n\nThe HKMA will continue to enhance and refine its banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account international standards and best practices.\n\n# Implementation of Basel standards in Hong Kong\n\n# Capital standards\n\nThe HKMA will continue to enhance the capital framework with the implementation of the standards published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) in recent years, which include the following:\n\nThe Capital Requirements for Banks’ Equity Investments in Funds of December 2013 (EIF standard), which will come into effect on 1 July 2022 with the Banking (Capital) (Amendment) Rules 2022 commencing operation after negative vetting by the Legislative Council.\n\nThe revised capital standards set out in the Basel III Finalising Post-crisis Reforms of December 2017, the Minimum Capital Requirements for Market Risk of January 2019 (revised in February 2019), and the Targeted Revisions to the Credit Valuation Adjustment Risk Framework of July 2020, which are collectively referred to as the “Basel III final reform package”.  These revised capital standards set out the revised capital treatment of credit risk, market risk, credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk and operational risk, introduce an output floor requirement, and enhance the leverage ratio framework.  Amendments to the Banking (Capital) Rules (BCR) are being prepared in consultation with the industry with a view to them taking effect from 1 July 2023 as minimum requirements (except for those on market risk and CVA risk2).\n\nGiven that the capital treatment for sovereign concentration risk under the BCR was designed to complement the Basel Committee’s large exposure framework as implemented by the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules, the HKMA will propose amendments to the capital rules in parallel with relevant changes to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules.\n\n# Exposure limits\n\nThe HKMA will continue its work on the proposed amendments to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules in consultation with the industry and the Department of Justice with a target implementation date aligned with the one for the Basel III final reform package, i.e. 1 July 2023.\n\n# Disclosure standards\n\nNew or revised disclosure requirements associated with the revised capital standards in the Basel III final reform package are mainly set out in the Pillar 33 Disclosure Requirements – Updated Framework and the Revisions to Market Risk Disclosure Requirements, published by the Basel Committee in December 2018 and November 2021 respectively.  The Basel Committee also published the Revisions to Leverage Ratio Disclosure Requirements in June 2019 amending the disclosure requirements for leverage ratio to address concerns regarding potential “window-dressing” (i.e. banks reducing the volumes of certain transactions around reporting dates to artificially inflate their leverage ratios for reporting and public disclosure).  Corresponding amendments to the Banking (Disclosure) Rules to implement these new or revised disclosure requirements are also being prepared, with a view to having them take effect in Hong Kong along the same timelines as their associated revised capital standards.\n\n# Other supervisory policies and risk management guidelines\n\nTo reflect developments in regulatory requirements and international standards, the HKMA plans to update certain SPM modules, including those relevant to the implementation of the revised capital and disclosure standards in the Basel III final reform package, “Countercyclical Capital Buffer – Approach to its Implementation”, “Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book”, “New Share Subscription and Share Margin Financing” and “Stress Testing”.  The HKMA will also continue to work on the revised SPM modules on “Code of Conduct” and “Reporting Requirements Relating to Authorized Institutions’ External Auditors under the Banking Ordinance”, with an aim to finalising the revisions within 2022. Consequential to the proposed amendments to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules, the related Code of Practice and SPM modules, e.g. CR-G-8 on “Large Exposures and Risk Concentrations” and CR-G-9 on “Exposures to Connected Parties”, will be updated accordingly.\n", "zh": "2022年及以後的重點任務\n\n2022年伊始，全球及本地環境惡化明顯。一方面，烏克蘭局勢升級及市場對美國聯邦儲備局加息預期引發市場波動。另一方面，香港經濟受到新一輪新冠疫情的打擊。儘管如此，鑑於香港的韌性和多年的累積緩衝，金融系統仍然具備應對不利衝擊的有利位置。展望未來，金管局將繼續高度重視保障貨幣及金融穩定。在此過程中，我們將努力提前掌握新興風險，並以靈活的方式作出應對。同時，金管局也將尋找有助於鞏固香港作為國際金融中心的機遇。在管理外匯基金應對這一復雜投資環境時，金管局將繼續謹慎投資，保持彈性，適時採取防禦措施，並維持高度流動性。\n\n# 金融體系的穩定與完整性\n\n全球經濟展望仍充滿不確定性。金管局將密切關注最新發展，保持警覺，以維護金融體系的韌性與穩定性，這對持續提供關鍵金融服務、支持香港經濟運作至關重要。\n\n# 警惕潛在風險\n\n展望未來，由於各方面的不確定性增加，市場可能出現較高的波動。一方面，若美國聯邦儲備局快速正常化貨幣政策，可能明顯收緊全球金融環境，並增加全球債務服務負擔。另一方面，2022年初烏克蘭局勢升級後，地緣政治不確定性，包括中美緊張局勢，可能持續高企，並再次引發金融市場波動。最後，隨著疫情不斷演變，若大規模重新實行封鎖措施，將導致持續的全球供應鏈瓶頸，進而影響全球經濟增長和通脹。儘管如此，鑑於多年的韌性和緩衝，香港金融系統已經具備較強的抗壓能力。金管局亦擁有相應的能力、資源和承諾，以保障香港的貨幣和金融穩定。\n\n金管局將持續密切監測國內外環境的風險與脆弱性，並準備在必要時採取適當措施，以維持香港的貨幣及金融穩定。2022年的研究計劃將分析影響香港經濟的議題及其潛在風險。同期，金管局的數字化項目將提升監控能力，支持對金融體系的更全面監測與深度分析。\n\n# 維持銀行穩定\n\n隨著發展中市場收緊貨幣政策及疫情影響持續，銀行業面對的信貸環境預計將持續充滿挑戰。與此同時，科技迅速進步和數字化帶來機遇與挑戰。在此瞬息萬變的金融情勢下，金管局致力於確保銀行具備抵禦衝擊的能力，透過持續的監管努力。同時，金管局將不斷完善及優化其銀行監管與規範框架，並融入國際標準與最佳實踐。\n\n# 以風險為基礎的監管重點\n\n# 信貸風險\n\n2022年，金管局將加強對銀行信貸風險暴露的監測，採取主動措施以確保整體風險水平受到良好控制。金管局亦將持續監測疫情的發展及其對企業營運狀況的影響，並與銀行和商業界保持密切對話，同時審視各項救援措施。\n\n# 營運及科技風險\n\n2022年5月，金管局推出了新的“監管政策手冊”(SPM)“營運韌性”模組，將持續與業界溝通，了解授權機構在建立營運韌性框架方面的進展。同時，金管局將跟進關於網絡韌性評估框架（Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0）產生的問題，加強銀行業的網絡安全韌性，並監控其實施安全的三方資料備份。另一個重點是評估和應對授權機構對科技服務提供商日益依賴所帶來的風險。\n\n隨著數字化能力的提昇及疫情期間積累的大量遠端工作經驗，一些授權機構正計劃轉型為混合工作模式，金管局將密切追蹤此一趨勢，評估相關風險是否得到充分管控。\n\n# 流動性和市場風險\n\n2022年，金管局將專注於監管授權機構的流動性和市場風險管理，特別是持續監察其在有序退出倫敦隔夜拆借利率（LIBOR）前的過渡進展，預計於2023年6月30日停止發布。\n\n# 打擊洗錢及恐怖融資\n\n2022年，金管局在反洗錢與反恐怖融資（AML/CFT）工作方面將重點強化對詐騙和金融犯罪的回應，並加強與各利益相關方的合作與資訊共享。另有計劃推行更風險敏感的監管技術（Suptech）措施，推廣金融科技監管（Regtech）應用，例如交易監控系統。\n\n金管局亦將與政府、銀行及存款證（SVF）行業緊密合作，發布更新的香港洗錢及恐怖融資風險評估報告，並協助業界應對新的及新興風險。同時，將持續研究洗錢及恐怖融資的變化趨勢，落實AML法規與相關指引，並與國際監管機構保持積極交流。\n\n# 財富管理及強積金相關業務\n\n2022年，金管局將進行實地及非實地的監管檢查，重點關注財富管理、證券銷售、強積金（MPF）及其他投資與保險產品的合規情況，特別是粵港澳大灣區跨境財富管理連通機制（Cross-boundary WMC）、數碼顧問平台、複雜產品、虛擬資產及非投資連結長期保險產品。\n\n除了與其他監管機構和銀行業保持緊密聯繫外，金管局將進一步指導有關投資、保險及強積金產品銷售的監管標準，包括虛擬資產的投資服務及高保障的“保障掛鈎計劃”銷售規範。金管局、保險業監管局及強積金計劃局將聯合推出針對合資格遞延年金保單和稅務扣除自願款銷售行為的“神秘顧客”抽查。\n\n在跨境WMC順利推行後，金管局將持續與業界及相關監管機關合作，推動計劃完善。\n\n此外，金管局亦將著手準備管理新SPM模組及新行為守則，監管授權機構的信托業務。\n\n# 監管金融市場基礎設施\n\n金管局將持續推動其監督的金融市場基礎設施（FMIs）安全有效運作，根據支付系統及存款證（PSSVFO）、金融市場基礎設施原則（PFMI）及支付與市場基礎設施委員會（CPMI）頒布的指引，完善相關監管框架，並根據最新科技和市場發展調整措施。\n\n金管局將與FMIs合作，確保其遵守PFMI，並根據情況進行評估與更新。亦將積極參與CPMI–IOSCO PFMI執行監察與評估工作，並跟進國際標準制定機構的相關規範，提升監管要求，以配合市場與科技的變化，並與相關部門合作，進一步鞏固監管協作機制。\n\n# 政策制定\n\n金管局將繼續完善其銀行監管及政策框架，融入國際標準和最佳實踐。\n\n# 落實巴塞爾銀行監管標準\n\n# 資本要求\n\n金管局將持續完善資本框架，執行由巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（巴塞爾委員會）近年發布的標準，包括：\n\n2013年12月公布的銀行基金股權投資資本要求標準（EIF標準），將於2022年7月1日生效，並由立法會負責審核的《銀行（資本）(修訂)條例2022》正式施行。\n\n根據2017年12月發布的“巴塞爾III危機後改革最終方案”、2019年1月（2019年2月修訂）的“市場風險最低資本要求”及2020年7月“信用評價調整風險”修訂，合稱“巴塞爾III最終改革方案”。這些修訂資本標準涉及信用風險、市場風險、信用評價調整（CVA）風險及操作風險的資本處理，並引入產出底線及加強槓桿比率框架。預計《銀行（資本）規則》（BCR）將於2023年7月1日根據行業意見修訂，以作為最低要求（除市場風險和CVA風險外）。\n\n由於BCR中對主權集中風險的資本處理設計旨在配合巴塞爾委員會的重大曝險框架（透過《銀行（曝險限額）規則》實施），金管局將在相關規則修訂時同步提出修訂建議。\n\n# 曝險限額\n\n金管局將推進《銀行（曝險限額）規則》的修訂工作，並與業界及司法部門協商，目標實施日期共控於2023年7月1日，與巴塞爾III最終改革同期。\n\n# 公開披露標準\n\n與巴塞爾III最終改革方案中新或修訂的披露要求，主要列於“第三支柱披露規定—更新框架”及“市場風險披露要求修訂”，分別於2018年12月和2021年11月由巴塞爾委員會公布。巴塞爾委員會亦於2019年6月發布了“槓桿比率披露要求修訂”，旨在應對“表面調整”風險（即銀行在報告日期前透過調整交易量以人工抬高槓桿比率以達至表面合規）。相關修訂的《銀行（披露）條例》亦在準備中，預計與修訂資本標準同步在香港實施。\n\n# 其他監管政策與風險管理指引\n\n為反映監管要求和國際標準的演變，金管局計劃更新部分SPM模組，包括“逆周期資本緩衝—實施方法”、“銀行帳簿利率風險”、“新增股份認購及股份按金融資”以及“壓力測試”等內容。同時，將持續修訂“行為守則”及“關於授權機構的外部審計師之資訊披露要求”模組，力爭於2022年底前完成修訂。並隨著《銀行（曝險限額）規則》的修訂，相關的行為守則和SPM模組（如CR-G-8“重大曝險及風險集中”及CR-G-9“與關聯方的曝險”）亦將相應更新。"}
{"en": "# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nWith strong merchandise exports, reviving domestic demand and a boost from the Government’s supportive policy measures, the Hong Kong economy resumed positive growth in 2021, reversing the contraction experienced during 2019 and 2020. The labour market also improved, and inflation remained moderate albeit having edged up. While economic recovery is expected to continue after the fifth wave of COVID-19 subsides, its strength and speed are subject to uncertainties and risks, especially those surrounding the pandemic and the path of US monetary policy normalisation.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Real activities\n\nDriven by strong merchandise exports and improving domestic demand, the Hong Kong economy grew by 6.3% in 2021, ending the economic contraction in 2019 and 2020 (Table 1 and Chart 1).  Private consumption recovered, thanks to improved labour market conditions and a boost from the Government’s Consumption Voucher Scheme1. Overall investment spending also rebounded as the business environment and outlook improved2.  Externally, HongKong’s exports of goods saw strong growth for the whole year, in part supported by the continued global economic recovery.  Export of services recorded modest growth, reflecting active regional trade and cargo flows as well as stronger cross-border business and financial activities. Total imports rose appreciably, mainly because of greater domestic and re-export-induced demand.  On a net basis, external trade contributed positively to real gross domestic product (GDP) growth in 2021 (Chart 1) as total exports grew faster than imports.\n\nTable 1 Real GDP growth by expenditure component (period-over-period)\n\nNote: The seasonally-adjusted quarter-on-quarter rates of change in the gross domestic fixed capital formation are not available. Source: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Inflation\n\nInflationary pressures edged up but remained moderate during the year.  Netting out the effects of the Government’s one-off relief measures, the year-on-year underlying inflation rate3 picked up gradually to a mild 1.4% in December (Chart 2)4.  Prices of consumer items such as dining out, transport, clothing and footwear regained upward momentum as local consumption demand improved. Import prices also increased notably alongside bottlenecks in global supply chains and the surge in international energy and commodity prices.  By contrast, the housing component was a drag on overall inflation, reflecting the feed-through of the earlier decline in fresh-letting private residential rentals (Chart 2).  More broadly, slow growth in nominal wage and commercial rentals helped keep domestic business cost pressures in check.  For 2021 as a whole, the underlying and headline inflation rates5 stayed mild at 0.6% and 1.6% respectively.\n\nChart 2 Underlying consumer price inflation\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Labour market\n\nAlongside the domestic economic recovery, the labour market improved in 2021.  After reaching a 17-year high of 7.2% in February, the unemployment rate declined visibly to 4.0% in December6 (Chart 3) and the decline was broad based across most economic sectors.  Overall labour demand strengthened gradually as reflected by a pick-up in total employment (Chart 3) and private sector vacancies, though they were still below their pre-pandemic peaks.  On the other hand, the labour force shrank slightly by 1.3% in December compared with a year earlier, partly due to a modest decline in the labour force participation rate. The year-on-year growth in nominal wage and labour earnings, while moderate, showed signs of acceleration in the first three quarters of 2021, reversing the trend of deceleration during 2019–2020.\n\nChart 3 Labour market conditions\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe local stock market was broadly sluggish during the year, despite a continued rally in some major overseas equity markets (Chart 4).  Extending its rebound in late 2020, the Hang Seng Index rose to a high of 31,085 on 17 February 2021, but market sentiment had turned sharply negative since then owing to a host of factors, including concerns about the new COVID-19 virus variants, potential monetary policy tightening by major central banks and reduced inflows from southbound trading under Stock Connect7.  The Hang Seng Index closed the year at 23,398, down markedly by 14.1% from a year ago.\n\nChart 4 Asset prices\nSources: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market regained some upward momentum in the first half of 2021 alongside better economic prospects, but saw some consolidation in the second half amid weakened asset market sentiments (Chart 4).  Overall, housing prices and transaction volume still recorded an increase of 3.7% and 24.1% respectively in 2021. Household affordability also became even more stretched, partly reflecting reduced household income.  On the other hand, after going through sharp corrections in 2019 and 2020, the non-residential property markets generally improved, with prices and rentals of industrial properties generally rising to their pre-pandemic peaks, whereas those of retail and office spaces remained below their respective peaks.\n\nSee Table B: Major Economic Indicators on pages 326 to 327 for more details, including their trends during 2017–2021.\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nIn early 2022, the fifth wave of local COVID-19 infections has exerted pressures on domestic economic activities. In response, the Government introduced the fifth and the sixth rounds of the Anti-epidemic Fund and additional countercyclical measures under the 2022–23 Budget to help support the economy.  The HKMA, together with the banking sector, also extended the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme to the end of October 2022.\n\nFor 2022 as a whole, economic recovery is expected to continue, albeit at a more moderate pace compared to 2021, partly reflecting the impact of the fifth wave of COVID-19, slower global economic growth, a less favourable base effect and US monetary policy normalisation.  The Government forecasts real GDP growth for 2022 to be in the range of 1–2% and the latest growth estimates by international organisations and private sector analysts averaged 1.1%.  That said, the strength and pace of the recovery are subject to a host of uncertainties and risks, especially those surrounding the pandemic, the Ukraine situation, and the path of US monetary policy normalisation.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nAlongside rising import prices and pandemic-induced logistics disruptions, inflationary pressures are expected to edge up in the near term, but should stay broadly in check owing to soft rentals and mild local labour cost pressures. Market consensus forecasts a headline inflation rate of 2.4% in 2022, while the Government projects the headline and underlying inflation rates to be 2.1% and 2.0% respectively. The fifth wave of local COVID-19 infections has exerted pressures on the labour market in early 2022, especially for contact-intensive sectors.  Further out, labour market conditions will depend on the pandemic developments and the pace of the domestic economic recovery.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector continued to be stable in 2021.  Total banking assets expanded moderately as both loans and deposits increased.  The capital and liquidity positions of the banking sector remained robust. Asset quality stayed at a healthy level by both historical and international standards.\n\n# Balance sheet trends\n\nThe banking sector’s balance sheet grew by 1.9% in 2021. Driven by the economic recovery, total loans recorded a growth of 3.8% during the year, compared with 1.2% in 2020.  Among the total, loans for use in Hong Kong grew by 4.4%, loans for use outside Hong Kong grew by 1.1% and trade finance increased by 14.2%.  Mainland-related lending expanded by 3.6% in 2021, after remaining largely stable in 2020.\n\nOn the liability side, total deposits rose by 4.6% in 2021, compared with 5.4% in 2020.  As total deposits increased at a faster pace than total loans, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio edged down to 71.8% at the end of 2021 from 72.3% a year ago (Chart 5).\n\nChart 5 Loans and deposits of the banking sector\nSource: HKMA.\n\n# Capital adequacy\n\nThe banking sector remained well capitalised. The consolidated total capital ratio of locally incorporated authorized institutions (AIs) stood at 20.2% at the end of 2021.  The Tier 1 capital ratio was 18.2% (Chart 6). Both ratios were well above their respective international minimum requirements of 8% and 6%.\n\nThe Basel III leverage ratio was 7.9% at the end of 2021, well above the statutory minimum requirement of 3% (Chart 7).\n\n# Liquidity\n\nThe liquidity position of the banking sector was sound.  The quarterly average Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) of category 1 institutions8 was 151.9% in the fourth quarter of 2021, well\n\nabove the statutory minimum requirement of 100%. The quarterly average Liquidity Maintenance Ratio (LMR) of category 2 institutions was 59.1%, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 25% (Chart 8).\n\nChart 8 Liquidity ratios of designated AIs\nSource: HKMA.\n\nThe sources of funding of the banking sector remained stable.  The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) of category 1 institutions was 135.3% at the end of 2021, well above the statutory minimum requirement of 100%.  The Core Funding\n\nRatio (CFR) of category 2A institutions9 was 150.3% at the end of 2021, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 75% (Chart 9).\n\nChart 9 Funding ratios of designated AIs\nSource: HKMA.\n\n# Asset quality\n\nAsset quality remained stable during the year and stayed at a healthy level by both historical and international standards. The classified loan ratio was 0.88% at the end of 2021 as compared to 0.90% at the end of 2020, with the overdue and rescheduled loan ratio edging down to 0.56% from 0.57% during the period (Chart 10).  The classified loan ratio for Mainland-related lending was 0.86% at the end of 2021 as compared to 0.96% at the end of 2020.  The delinquency ratios of residential mortgage lending and credit card lending remained low at 0.04% and 0.20% respectively (Chart 11). The HKMA will continue to closely monitor the change in the asset quality of the banking sector.\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe low interest rate environment continued to weigh on the profitability of the banking sector.  The aggregate pre-tax operating profit of retail banks declined by 19.8% in 2021 (Chart 12), mainly attributable to a decrease in net interest income (-13.6%) and an increase in total operating expenses (+7.1%).  These were partly offset by an increase in income from fees and commissions (+9.6%) and a drop in loan impairment charges (-25.1%).  The net interest margin further narrowed to 0.98% in 2021 from 1.18% in 2020 (Chart 13).\n\nRetail banks’ cost-to-income ratio rose to 54.7% in 2021 from 47.0% in 2020 (Chart 14).\n", "zh": "# 經濟及金融環境\n\n在強勁的商品出口、復甦的國內需求以及政府支持政策措施的推動下，香港經濟於2021年恢復正增長，扭轉了2019年及2020年的收縮局面。勞動市場亦有所改善，通脹水平雖略有上升但仍然適中。預計在第五波新冠肺疫情平息後，經濟復甦仍將持續，但其力度與速度將受到不確定性和風險的影響，尤其是疫情發展以及美國貨幣政策正常化的變化。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 實體活動\n\n受到強勁商品出口及國內需求改善的推動，香港經濟於2021年增長6.3%，結束了2019年和2020年的經濟收縮（表1與圖1）。私人消費得以復甦，主要得益於勞動市場狀況改善及政府的消費券計劃1的推動。整體投資開支亦回升，原因是商業環境及前景改善2。對外方面，香港貨物出口全年增長強勁，部分得益於全球經濟的持續復甦。服務出口錄得適度增長，反映地區貿易及貨運流量活躍，以及跨境商業和金融活動的增強。總進口顯著上升，主要由於國內需求及轉口需求增加。從淨值來看，2021年外貿對實際國內生產總值（GDP）增長作出了正面貢獻（圖1），因為淨出口的增長速度快於進口。\n\n表1 按支出項目劃分的實質GDP增長（期比）\n\n備註：不提供季節調整後的國內固定資本形成的季度變化率。資料來源：康新統計署。\n\n# 通脹\n\n通脹壓力略微上升，但仍屬適中。在剔除政府一次性救濟措施的影響後，2021年年度核心通脹率3逐步攀升至12月的溫和1.4%（圖2）4。消費品如餐飲、交通、服裝鞋履價格重拾上升動力，反映本地消費需求的改善。由於全球供應鏈瓶頸及國際能源和商品價格的飆升，進口價格亦顯著上升。相比之下，房地產部分對整體通脹形成拖累，反映早前私人住宅租金新租的跌幅延續的傳導效應（圖2）。更廣泛來說，名義工資及商業租金的放緩增長幫助控制了本地企業成本壓力。整體來看，2021年的基本及總體通脹率5仍然溫和，分別為0.6%及1.6%。\n\n圖2 消費者物價通脹率（基本）\n資料來源：康新統計署。\n\n# 勞動市場\n\n伴隨經濟復甦，2021年勞動市場亦有所改善。在2月達到17年高的7.2%失業率後，12月明顯下降至4.0%6（圖3），且跌幅較為廣泛，涉及多個經濟行業。總體勞動需求逐步增強，反映在就業總數（圖3）及私營部門空缺數量的回升，儘管仍低於疫情前的高峰水平。另一方面，勞動人口較去年同期微跌1.3%，部分原因是勞動參與率略有下降。名義工資及勞動收入的年增雖溫和，但在2021年前三季度呈現加快跡象，逆轉了2019–2020年的放緩趨勢。\n\n圖3 勞動市場狀況\n資料來源：康新統計署。\n\n# 股市\n\n今年本地股市整體表現平淡，儘管海外部分主要股市持續反彈（圖4）。滬深指數自2020年底反彈後，在2021年2月17日升至31,085點的高位，但自此之後，因多方面因素影響，市場情緒急轉直下，包括對新變異病毒株的擔憂、主要中央銀行收緊貨幣政策的可能性以及“滬港通”下南向資金流入減少等。全年，恒生指數收於23,398點，比去年同期大跌14.1%。\n\n圖4 資產價格\n資料來源：評級及估值部及香港交易及結算所有限公司。\n\n# 房地產市場\n\n房地產市場在2021年上半年在經濟前景較佳的支撐下，部分回升，但下半年由於資產市場情緒疲弱，出現結構性調整（圖4）。整體而言，房價及成交量於2021年分別錄得3.7%及24.1%的升幅。家庭負擔能力亦進一步惡化，部分原因是家庭收入下降。另一方面，經歷2019年及2020年的大幅調整後，非住宅物業市場普遍改善，工業物業的價格及租金逐步回升至疫情前高點，而零售及寫字樓空間的價格及租金仍低於各自的高峰水準。\n\n詳見第326至327頁的表B：主要經濟指標，了解其2017–2021年的趨勢。\n\n# 經濟展望\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n2022年初，疫情第五波本地爆發對經濟活動帶來壓力。為應對，政府推出第五及第六輪抗疫基金及2022–23財政年度的額外逆周期措施，以支援經濟。香港金融管理局連同銀行業亦延長了“預先核准的本金展期計劃”至2022年10月末。\n\n展望2022年，預計經濟復甦將持續，但速度較2021年為緩，主要受到第五波疫情、全球經濟增長放緩、較低的基數效應及美國貨幣政策正常化的影響。政府預測2022年的實質GDP增長在1%至2%之間，國際組織及私人分析機構的最新預測平均為1.1%。然而，復甦力度和速度仍受多項不確定因素及風險影響，尤其是疫情、烏克蘭局勢及美國貨幣政策正常化路徑。\n\n# 通脹與勞動市場\n\n由於進口價格上升及疫情引發的物流中斷，預計短期內通脹壓力將有所上升，但由於租金走軟及本地勞動成本壓力較輕，整體仍能保持大致可控。市場普遍預測2022年的總體通脹率為2.4%，而政府則預計為2.1%（總體）與2.0%（核心）。2022年初疫情的第五波對就業市場特別是高接觸行業帶來壓力。展望未來，勞動市場狀況將依賴疫情的發展及國內經濟復甦的速度。\n\n# 銀行業表現\n\n香港銀行業在2021年保持穩健。總資產適度增加，貸款及存款同步上升。銀行業的資本及流動性狀況依然強健，資產質量保持良好，符合歷史及國際標準。\n\n# 資產負債表趨勢\n\n2021年，銀行業資產負債表增長1.9%。受經濟復甦影響，年度內貸款總額增長3.8%，高於2020年的1.2%。其中，用於香港的貸款增長4.4%，境外貸款增長1.1%，貿易融資增長14.2%。內地相關貸款則在2021年擴展3.6%，而2020年保持相對穩定。\n\n在負債方面，2021年存款總額增長4.6%，較2020年的5.4%稍低。由於存款增長速度快於貸款，整體貸存比由去年同期的72.3%小幅降至71.8%（圖5）。\n\n圖5 銀行業的貸款及存款\n資料來源：香港金融管理局。\n\n# 資本充足率\n\n銀行業保持充足資本，2021年底，境內認可機構（AIs）合併資本總額比率為20.2%，第一類資本充足率為18.2%（圖6），皆遠高於國際最低要求8%及6%。巴塞爾III杠杆比率則在2021年底為7.9%，顯著高於法定最低3%（圖7）。\n\n# 流動性\n\n銀行業流動性狀況良好。2021年第四季，第一類機構的季度平均流動性覆蓋比率（LCR）為151.9%，遠高於法定最低100%。第二類機構的季度平均流動性維持比率（LMR）為59.1%，亦大幅高於最低25%（圖8）。資金來源穩定，第一類機構的淨穩定資金比率（NSFR）在2021年底為135.3%，遠超100%的法定最低要求；而第二類A機構的核心資金比率（CFR）則為150.3%，同樣高於75%的最低標準（圖9）。\n\n圖8 指定認可機構的流動性比率\n資料來源：香港金融管理局。\n\n圖9 指定認可機構的資金比率\n資料來源：香港金融管理局。\n\n# 資產質量\n\n資產質量在全年保持穩定，並處於良好水平，無論按歷史或國際標準。到2021年底，分類貸款比率為0.88%，較2020年底的0.90%略有下降，逾期及重組貸款比率由0.57%降至0.56%（圖10）。內地相關貸款的分類貸款比率亦由0.96%降至0.86%。住宅按揭及信用卡貸款的逾期率則分別保持較低的0.04%及0.20%（圖11）。香港金融管理局將持續密切關注銀行業資產質量的變化。\n\n# 獲利能力趨勢\n\n低利率環境仍對銀行業盈利能力構成壓力。零售銀行的稅前營運利潤整體下降19.8%（圖12），主要原因是淨利息收入下降13.6%及營運開支增加7.1%。收入的增加來自手續費及佣金的9.6%，而貸款減值損失則下降25.1%。2021年的淨利息利差由2020年的1.18%收窄至0.98%（圖13）。零售銀行的成本收入比由2020年的47.0%上升至54.7%（圖14），反映盈利壓力仍在。"}
{"en": "# Monetary Stability\n\nDespite the lingering uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and increased concerns about the pace of US monetary tightening, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to trade in a smooth and orderly manner.  As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability since it was implemented in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System has shown its strength and resilience to external shocks.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability.  This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\n# The Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n\nCertificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks; Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation; the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of clearing account balances kept with the HKMA; and Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs).  With the HKMA standing ready to sell (or buy) Hong Kong dollars to (or from) banks in exchange for US dollars upon request at 7.75 (or 7.85) per US dollar, when the strong-side (or weak-side) CU is triggered, the Aggregate Balance will expand (or contract) to push down (or up) Hong Kong dollar interest rates that would help move the Hong Kong dollar back to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2021\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nDriven by equity-related demand arising from fundraising activities and the southbound Stock Connects1, the Hong Kong dollar traded close to the strong-side CU at the beginning of the year.  Thereafter, the Hong Kong dollar weakened amid stock market correction and repatriation of initial public offering (IPO) proceeds by some newly listed firms before rebounding slightly in the second quarter due to corporates’ dividend payment needs and net inflows from the southbound Stock Connects.  Stepping into the second half of the year, while the Hong Kong dollar drifted lower amid softened equity market sentiment, it stayed mostly at the strong side of the Convertibility Zone and continued to trade in a smooth and orderly manner (Chart 1).  Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market functioned normally throughout 2021.\n\nChart 1 Market exchange rate in 2021\n\nAs the CUs were not triggered, the total of the Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs remained virtually unchanged at around HK$1,526.3 billion in 2021 (Chart 2). During the year, the HKMA issued a total of HK$80 billion additional Exchange Fund Bills to meet the ongoing demand for Exchange Fund paper by banks amid the abundance of liquidity in the banking system, which led to a contraction of the Aggregate Balance from HK$457.5 billion at the end of 2020 to HK$377.5 billion at the end of 2021.\n\nReflecting the additional issuance of Exchange Fund Bills and the issuance of EFBNs to absorb EFBNs’ interest payments according to the established practice, the outstanding EFBNs increased from HK$1,069.2 billion to HK$1,148.8 billion during the year.  The Monetary Base as a whole remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\n# HK$1,526.3 billion\n\nTotal Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs\n\nChart 2 Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding Exchange Fund papers in 2021\n\n# Money market\n\nWith the sizeable Aggregate Balance, the Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained largely stable at low levels throughout the year (Chart 3).  While the demand for the Hong Kong dollar increased along with the IPO activities during the first quarter, Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs) of various tenors saw little fluctuations.  Thereafter, HIBORs remained largely stable despite concerns about the pace of US monetary tightening.  Towards the end of 2021, HIBORs witnessed mild pick-ups, partly reflecting anticipated funding needs towards the year end.  On the retail front, banks kept their Best Lending Rates unchanged.  Overall, Hong Kong’s money markets continued to function normally.  Discount Window borrowing decreased to HK$6.8 billion in 2021 from HK$9.1 billion in 2020.\n\nChart 3 Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates in 2021\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nThe Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has been a strong anchor of Hong Kong’s financial system for more than three decades and has shown its strength and resilience to challenges.  Despite lingering uncertainties surrounding global economic recovery, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to function in an orderly manner, reflecting the robustness of the LERS.  The Government is firmly committed to the LERS.  In its 2021 External Sector Report, the International Monetary Fund once again reiterated that the credibility of the LERS has been assured by a transparent set of rules, ample fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nA robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS.  Hong Kong’s banking sector continued to operate smoothly with liquidity positions and capitalisation faring very well by international standards.  To ensure resilience of the banking sector, the HKMA has been closely monitoring banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and has maintained its supervisory efforts on bank lending.\n\nTo improve transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998.  The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) moved within a range of 109.8–110.5% during 2021, without touching the Upper or the Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 110.2% on 31 December (Chart 4). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate.  The ample financial resources of the Exchange Fund, together with the sound banking system, provide a powerful backstop to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nChart 4 Daily movement of the Backing Ratio in 2021\n\n# Currency Board Sub-Committee\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong.  In 2021, the CBC considered issues, including an assessment of inflation in the US, implications of the US dollar depreciation on Hong Kong, assessment of the taper tantrum risk and its impact on Hong Kong, and understanding the influence of Mainland-related fund flows on monetary conditions in Hong Kong.  Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and reports on the Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Notes and coins\n\nAt the end of 2021, the total value of banknotes issued by note-issuing banks in circulation was HK$592.6 billion, an increase of 5.9% from a year earlier (Charts 5, 6 and 7). The total value of Government-issued notes and coins in circulation amounted to HK$12.9 billion at the end of 2021, up 1.7% year on year (Charts 8 and 9).\n\n# HK$592.6 billion, +5.9%\n\nTotal value of banknotes issued by note-issuing banks\n\n# HK$12.9 billion, +1.7%\n\nTotal value of notes and coins issued by Government\n\n# Chart 5\n\nBanknotes in circulation by note-issuing banks at the end of 2021\n\n# Chart 6 \n\nDistribution of banknotes in circulation at the end of 2021\n\n# Hong Kong banknotes\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA arranged 14 seminars for more than 4,000 participants, including professionals in the banking and retail industries as well as students, to help enhance their knowledge and skills in differentiating between authentic and counterfeit banknotes.  These public education programmes on the design and security features of Hong Kong banknotes are well received.\n\n# Coin Collection Programme\n\nThe Coin Collection Programme continued to be well received by the public.  More information about the Programme can be found in the Sustainability chapter on page 198.\n\n# Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\n\nThe EFBN Programme continued to operate smoothly. To meet the ongoing demand for Exchange Fund paper by banks amid the abundance of liquidity in the banking system, the HKMA issued a total of HK$80 billion additional Exchange Fund Bills in the second half of 2021.  The additional issuance resulted in a corresponding reduction of the Aggregate Balance.  At the end of 2021, the nominal amount of outstanding Exchange Fund papers stood at HK$1,148.6 billion (Table 2).\n\nTable 2 Outstanding issues of Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\n\n# Monetary research\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMR)  maintained a steady research output in 2021 despite the ongoing pandemic.  During the year, the HKIMR released 30 working papers and held nine webinars, which encompassed a wide range of topics including monetary policy, banking stability, market microstructure and financial technology (fintech) development.  The HKIMR also organised an international conference and a webinar in hybrid format.\n\nThe webinar, titled RMB Exchange Rate Formation Mechanism and Exchange Rate Outlook, was co-organised with the Hong Kong Academy of Finance on 17 August.  It was live-streamed on a number of online platforms and attracted a total of over 1.16 million real-time views.\n\nThe 11th Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy, titled On the Path to Common Prosperity: China’s Economic Development in Dual Circulation, was held on 11 November.  The conference discussed recent policy developments related to common prosperity, dual circulation, anti-monopoly regulations, property market, Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect and financial developments in the Greater Bay Area5.  Expert speakers also presented in-depth analyses on the impact of population ageing and the sustainability of social security funds, as well as China’s contribution to global financial stability and world economy.  The six different sessions of the conference attracted over 3,200 online and on-site viewers, totaling 5,900 views.\n\n", "zh": "# 貨幣穩定\n\n儘管圍繞COVID-19大流行的不確定性仍然持續，以及對美國貨幣緊縮步伐的擔憂增加，香港元匯率和貨幣市場仍然平穩有序地進行交易。自1983年實施以來，聯繫匯率制度一直是香港貨幣和金融穩定的基石，展示了其抗外部衝擊的實力與韌性。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的首要目標是貨幣穩定。這被定義為香港貨幣對美元在外匯市場的外部匯率穩定，在港幣7.75至7.85對1美元的範圍內波動。貨幣制度的結構以貨幣局安排為特色，要求貨幣基礎至少由外匯基金持有的美元儲備全額支持，並且貨幣基礎的變動必須與美元儲備的相應變動完全匹配。\n\n# 貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n\n提供三家發鈔行全部發行鈔票的全額支援的證券；政府發行的流通貨幣鈔票和硬幣；結算帳戶餘額總和，即香港金融管理局持有的結算帳戶餘額；以及由香港金融管理局代表政府發行的外匯基金票據（EFBNs）。\n\n香港元匯率的穩定通過自動利率調整機制和香港金融管理局對兌付承諾（CU）的堅定承諾來維持。根據要求，當強方（或弱方）兌付承諾被觸發時，香港金融管理局準備以每美元7.75（或7.85）出售（或購買）港元與美元兌換，集結餘將擴大（或收縮），以促使香港元利率下降（或上升），幫助香港元回到7.75至7.85的兌付區間內。\n\n# 2021年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n由於募集活動和南向股通的股市相關需求，香港元在年初接近強方兌付承諾。其後，股市修正和部分新上市公司在首次公開募股（IPO）資金匯回之前，港元走弱，但由於企業的股息支付需求和南向股通的淨流入，第二季度略有反彈。進入下半年，儘管股市情緒轉趨疲軟，港元仍基本保持在兌付區的強側，交易平穩有序（見圖1）。整體來看，2021年香港的外匯市場正常運作。\n\n圖1 2021年市場匯率\n\n由於未觸發兌付承諾，集結餘和未動用的EFBN總額在2021年幾乎未變，保持在約1,526.3億港元（見圖2）。年內，香港金融管理局發行了總計80億港元的額外外匯基金票據，以滿足銀行持續對外匯基金票據的需求，因銀行系統內流動性充裕，導致2020年底的集結餘從457.5億港元收縮至2021年底的377.5億港元。\n\n反映額外發行的外匯基金票據及按照既定慣例發行EFBN以吸收EFBN的利息支出，年內未清償的EFBN由1,069.2億港元增加至1,148.8億港元。整體貨幣基礎仍由外匯儲備完全支持。\n\n# 1,526.3億港元\n\n集結餘與未動用EFBN總額\n\n圖2 2021年集結餘（折扣窗口前）與未動用的外匯基金票據\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n由於集結餘充裕，2021年內，港元拆息基本保持低水準且穩定（見圖3）。第一季度，隨著IPO活動帶動的港元需求增加，各期限的香港銀行同業拆息（HIBOR）變動不大，此後，儘管擔憂美國貨幣緊縮步伐，HIBOR仍大致持平。到了年底，HIBOR出現微幅上升，部分反映年底前預期資金需求增加。在零售層面，銀行保持最優惠貸款利率不變。整體而言，香港的貨幣市場持續正常運作。折扣窗口借款由2020年的9.1億港元下降至2021年的6.8億港元。\n\n圖3 2021年香港元拆息\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n聯繫匯率制度（LERS）作為香港金融體系的強大支柱，已有超過三十年的歷史，展現其韌性與實力。儘管全球經濟復甦仍面臨不確定性，香港元匯率及貨幣市場仍然有序運作，彰顯LERS的穩健。政府堅定支持聯繫匯率制度。在2021年對外經濟部門報告中，國際貨幣基金組織再次重申，LERS的可信度得益於透明的規則、充足的財政和外匯儲備、嚴格的金融監管和監督、靈活的經濟體系及謹慎的財政框架。\n\n穩健的銀行體系是聯繫匯率制度正常運作的重要保障。香港銀行業持續運作平穩，流動資金狀況與資本充足程度在國際標準下表現良好。為確保銀行業的韌性，香港金融管理局密切監察銀行的信貸、流動性及利率風險管理和壓力測試結果，並持續加強銀行貸款監管。\n\n為提高貨幣局賬戶的透明度，自1998年10月起，已分配部分外匯基金資產用來支援貨幣基礎。2021年，Backing Ratio（支援比率，即支援資產除以貨幣基礎）在109.8%至110.5%範圍內波動，未達到上或下觸發水平。截止2021年12月31日，該比率為110.2%（見圖4）。在LERS下，雖然已指定部分外匯基金資產作為支援組合，但所有外匯基金資產均可用來支持港元匯率。外匯基金充裕的資金與健全的銀行體系，共同為香港的貨幣和金融穩定提供強大後盾。\n\n圖4 2021年支援比率每日變動\n\n# 貨幣局委員會\n\n貨幣局委員會（CBC）監督與審查影響香港貨幣與金融穩定的相關議題。2021年，CBC討論了包括美國通脹評估、美元貶值對香港的影響、縮減成瘾風險及其對香港的影響、以及內地相關資金流對香港貨幣狀況的影響等議題。這些討論記錄與貨幣局的操作報告均已在香港金融管理局網站刊載。\n\n# 現鈔與硬幣\n\n2021年底，流通中的銀行票據總值為5926億港元，同比增加5.9%（見圖5、6、7）。政府發行的票據及硬幣總值為129億港元，同比增長1.7%（見圖8、9）。\n\n# 5926億港元，+5.9%\n\n銀行發行的鈔票總值\n\n# 129億港元，+1.7%\n\n政府發行的票據與硬幣總值\n\n# 圖5\n\n2021年底由發鈔銀行發行的流通鈔票\n\n# 圖6\n\n2021年底流通鈔票的分佈\n\n# 香港鈔票\n\n年內，香港金融管理局安排了14場研討會，參與人數超過4,000人，包括銀行和零售行業的專業人士及學生，以幫助提升他們在辨別真鈔與偽鈔方面的知識與技能。這些關於香港鈔票設計與安全特徵的公共教育計劃受到熱烈歡迎。\n\n# 硬幣收藏計劃\n\n硬幣收藏計劃仍然受到公眾熱烈歡迎。更多關於此計劃的資訊可參見第198頁的可持續發展章節。\n\n# 外匯基金票據\n\n外匯基金票據計劃運作順利。為滿足銀行對外匯基金票據的持續需求，在2021年下半年，香港金融管理局共發行了80億港元的額外外匯基金票據。此次增發相應降低了集結餘。至2021年底，未清償的外匯基金票據名義總額為1,1486億港元（見表2）。\n\n表2 未償還的外匯基金票據\n\n# 貨幣研究\n\n儘管持續受疫情影響，香港貨幣金融研究所以（HKIMR）2021年仍保持穩定的研究產出。年內，HKIMR推出了30份工作論文，舉辦了九場網絡研討會，涵蓋貨幣政策、銀行穩定、市場微觀結構與金融科技（Fintech）發展等多個範疇。該研究所還組織了一場國際會議與一場混合式網絡研討會。\n\n該網絡研討會題為《人民幣匯率形成機制與匯率展望》，由香港金融管理局與香港金融學院聯合主辦，於8月17日播放直播，總實時觀看人數超過116萬。\n\n第十一屆中國經濟國際會議（主題：共富之路：雙循環背景下的中國經濟發展）於11月11日舉行。會議討論了有關共同富裕、雙循環、防垄断、房地產市場、跨境財富管理通和大灣區金融發展的最新政策動向。專家演講還深入分析人口老齡化與社會保障基金的可持續性，以及中國對全球金融穩定和經濟的貢獻。六個分會場吸引超過3,200名線上與現場觀眾，合計觀看次數達5,900。"}
{"en": "# Banking Stability\n\nThe banking sector in Hong Kong remained sound and stable in 2021, despite the emergence of more contagious COVID-19 variants, causing uncertainty to global economic recovery.  During the year, the HKMA remained focused on the supervision of authorized institutions’ risk management.  Supervision of authorized institutions’ operational and cyber resilience was also stepped up in light of escalating cyber threats and accelerating digitalisation in the banking sector.\n\nOn conduct supervision, the HKMA provided guidance to banks to facilitate the use of non-face-to-face channels for distributing investment and insurance products, and worked with fellow regulators to formulate supervisory requirements on new products in the market such as insurance-linked securities and virtual assets.  The Code of Banking Practice was also revised to enhance consumer protection in digital financial services.\n\nIn the area of anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT), the HKMA’s priority has been to further strengthen banks’ gatekeeper role in the ecosystem and their ability to prevent and detect illicit fund flows associated with increases in online fraud, mule account networks and other financial crimes during the pandemic.  To increase protection for customer accounts against fraud and financial crimes, the HKMA scaled up collaboration and information sharing with other stakeholders via public-private partnerships.  While supporting remote customer on-boarding, the HKMA also encouraged adoption of other technologies including network analytics through the launch of the first AML Regtech Lab in November.  Internationally, proactive engagement has kept the HKMA at the forefront of global AML/CFT efforts in the Financial Action Task Force.\n\nOn the development front, the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Pilot Scheme in the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area was launched smoothly in September.  During the year, the HKMA continued to execute its two-year roadmap for promoting Regtech adoption in Hong Kong.  Several initiatives were rolled out to lay the foundation for banks’ climate risk management and promote green and sustainable banking more broadly, as discussed in the Sustainability chapter. Further efforts were also made in the area of soft infrastructure, including promoting a customercentric corporate culture, as well as working with the banking industry to roll out capacity-building initiatives to facilitate talent development.\n\nMeanwhile, the HKMA has worked closely with the banking industry in optimising supervisory policies and processes. Good progress was made on implementing international supervisory standards locally, including those on capital adequacy and disclosure.  The HKMA continued to advance its work to ensure a credible resolution regime for authorized institutions, including developing new resolution standards and implementing rules on loss-absorbing capacity requirements to enhance authorized institutions’ resolvability.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system.  Achieving this objective is contingent upon a highly resilient financial system that is capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their businesses and, in extreme cases, by failing in a disorderly manner.  The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring that banks are resilient to shocks and able to recover their positions in crises, ultimately helping to prevent failures.  The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks and is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs).\n\nHowever, the Monetary Authority cannot ensure, nor is the Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework designed to ensure, a zero-risk financial system.  Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that, in the event of an AI becoming non-viable, its failure can be managed in an orderly manner.  To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong has been established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs, among other types of institutions.  To operationalise the resolution regime in Hong Kong, it is important to lay down resolution rules and policy standards, undertake resolution planning to remove impediments to AIs’ resolvability and develop the HKMA’s operational capability to resolve a failing AI.  In order to carry out these tasks effectively, the HKMA adopts an internationally harmonised and co-ordinated approach.\n\nThe Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs). In overseeing FMIs, the HKMA aims to promote their general safety and efficiency, limit systemic risk and foster transparency.  Making FMIs more resilient to financial crises protects the monetary and financial systems in Hong Kong from possible destabilising effects arising from disruption to the FMIs.  Information regarding the HKMA’s oversight approach is available on the HKMA website.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2021\n\n# Licensing\n\nAt the end of 2021, Hong Kong had:\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA granted two banking licences and one restricted bank licence to three non-local banks. The HKMA also granted a money broker approval to a foreign trading platform operator.  The authorizations of three licensed banks and two restricted licence banks were revoked during the year.\n\nMore information about the AIs and local representative offices in Hong Kong can be found in the Annex and Tables D to F on pages 321 to 324, and 330 to 333 respectively.\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nThe HKMA conducted 189 off-site reviews covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL rating assessment1, corporate governance, risk management and financial technology (fintech) strategies.  As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance, 40 meetings were held with the AIs’ boards of directors, independent non-executive directors or board-level committees.  A further 38 tripartite meetings were held among the HKMA, AIs and their external auditors.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA conducted regular on-site examinations supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk.  A total of 679 on-site examinations and thematic reviews were carried out during the year with credit risk management as a key focus. Amid growing adoption of technology by banks, management of operational risk and technology risk was another major area of attention.  The HKMA also increased the number of on-site examinations and thematic reviews targeting liquidity and market risk management.  In addition, specialist teams performed on-site examinations and thematic reviews of AIs’ activities in securities, investment products, insurance and mandatory provident fund (MPF)- related businesses, as well as their anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) controls. Table 1 contains a summary of the HKMA’s supervisory activities in 2021.\n\n# Credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nTotal loans increased by 3.8% in 2021, compared with a growth of 1.2% in 2020.  Table 2 shows the breakdown of growth in loans and advances.\n\nMainland-related lending increased by 3.6% to HK$4,725 billion in 2021 (Table 3).\n\nThe asset quality of the banking sector remained largely stable during the year and stayed at a healthy level by both historical and international standards.  The classified loan ratio of the industry was 0.88% at the end of 2021, down from 0.90% at the end of 2020, well below the long-run historical average of 1.8% since 2000.  The ratio for Mainland-related lending also decreased to 0.86% from 0.96% a year ago.\n\nDuring the year, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to weigh on some sectors of the economy, while credit events in the Mainland property sector caught the attention of the market.  The HKMA enhanced the breadth and depth of its surveillance, with deep-dive reviews focused on banks’ exposures to highly leveraged borrowers. Close communication with banks has been maintained to facilitate up-to-date assessment of the impact of economic and market developments as well as the adequacy of banks’ risk management measures.  The overall credit risk facing the banking sector is assessed to be manageable.  The latest results of the HKMA’s solvency stress tests confirm that the banking sector continues to maintain sufficient capital buffers to withstand extreme stress.\n\nTargeted and thematic examinations were conducted during the year to evaluate AIs’ systems and controls over loan classification and loan loss provisioning, overseas lending operations, and collateralised lending to private banking and wealth management customers.\n\n# Alleviating cash-flow pressure faced by customers\n\nIn September, the HKMA and the Banking Sector Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) Lending Coordination Mechanism announced a six-month extension of the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme until the end of April 2022.  This scheme was first launched in May 2020 to defer loan principal payments of eligible corporate customers by six months.  In light of a resurgence of local coronavirus infections, in February 2022, the scheme was further extended until the end of October 2022.  In addition, the scheme was enhanced to offer a one-year partial principal repayment option to those customers who are financially capable and willing to resume principal repayment gradually.\n\nBy the end of December 2021, banks had approved loan tenor extensions and other forms of relief in over 83,000 cases, involving an aggregate amount of over HK$920 billion. For personal customers, banks had approved more than 52,000 cases of principal payment holidays for residential mortgages and other personal relief loans, amounting to over HK$53 billion.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nThe successive rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures introduced by the HKMA since 2009 have strengthened banks’ risk management and the banking sector’s resilience to a possible abrupt downturn in the local property market.  The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of new residential mortgage loans (RMLs) approved in December 2021 was 53%, compared with 64% in September 2009 before the countercyclical measures were first introduced.  The average debt servicing ratio (DSR) of new mortgages remained low at 36% in December 2021, compared with 41% in August 2010, when a cap on DSR was first applied (Chart 1).\n\n# Operational and technology risks\n\nIn light of banks’ increasing reliance on technology to support their operations, the HKMA stepped up supervision of operational and technology risks.  Key supervisory focuses during the year included controls over cloud outsourcing and remote working arrangements.  The HKMA launched an industry consultation in December on a draft new Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module on “Operational Resilience”. The new SPM module seeks to provide guidance to banks on developing a holistic and integrated operational resilience framework.\n\nThe HKMA introduced the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 in January to reflect the latest sound practices on cyber security risk management.  During the year, the HKMA monitored AIs’ implementation of the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 and reviewed their cyber resilience capabilities.  In view of the growing risk of destructive cyber-attacks, in May, the HKMA requested all AIs to critically assess the need for a secure tertiary data backup, taking reference from the Secure Tertiary Data Backup Guideline issued by the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB).\n\nIn response to heightened risks and rising numbers of phishing attacks, the HKMA worked closely with the industry to strengthen the security of internet and mobile banking services.  A large-scale joint HKMA-HKAB public awareness campaign, themed “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!” began in July (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 Raising public awareness of phishing attacks\n\nSlogan icon for the public awareness campaign themed “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!”\n\n# Liquidity and market risks\n\nTo enhance monitoring of AIs’ liquidity risk exposures, the HKMA introduced additional scenarios into its liquidity stress testing framework to evaluate AIs’ ability to cope with liquidity shocks over a prolonged period.\n\nDuring the year, thematic reviews were conducted to assess the adequacy of AIs’ liquidity stress testing programmes and evaluate the sufficiency of their monitoring metrics and control limits for managing liquidity risk.  The HKMA also carried out reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of AIs’ market risk management frameworks for debt securities investments and operational controls over treasury activities.\n\nThe HKMA closely monitored AIs’ progress in preparing for the transition away from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR).  It collaborated with industry associations and developed tools to assist AIs in supporting their customers’ migration to alternative reference rates, including a leaflet to raise corporates’ awareness of the transition and an information note on options available in the loan markets to replace US dollar LIBOR.  AIs have substantially remediated contracts referencing LIBOR settings which ceased to be published after the end of 2021.  They were reminded not to enter into new LIBOR contracts from 1 January 2022 onwards.\n", "zh": "# 銀行穩健性\n\n儘管新型傳染力更強的新冠病毒變異株出現，導致全球經濟復甦充滿不確定性，2021年香港銀行業仍然保持健全穩定。在此期間，香港金融管理局（HKMA）專注於對持牌機構的風險管理監管，加強了對持牌機構營運和網絡韌性的監管，以應對不斷升級的網絡威脅和銀行業數碼化的加速。\n\n在操守監管方面，HKMA為銀行提供指引，促進利用非面對面渠道分銷投資和保險產品，並與其他監管機構合作，制定市場中新型產品如保險掛鈎證券和虛擬資產的監管要求。同時，銀行業務守則也經修訂，以增強數碼金融服務的消費者保障。\n\n在反洗錢及反恐怖融資（AML/CFT）方面，HKMA的重點是進一步強化銀行在生態系統中的守門員角色及其防範和偵測非法資金流動的能力，尤其是在疫情期間相關的網上欺詐、騙帳網絡及其他金融犯罪增加的情況下。為提升客戶帳戶對欺詐和金融犯罪的保護，HKMA擴大了與其他利益相關者的合作與資訊分享，通過公私合營模式合作，並於11月推出首個AML監管科技實驗室，支持遠程客戶入職。此外，HKMA積極參與國際行動，保持在金融行動特別工作組（FATF）全球AML/CFT努力的前沿。\n\n在發展方面，粵港澳大灣區跨境財富管理通Pilot計劃於九月順利啟動。年內，HKMA持續推進其兩年規範科技採用的路線圖，並推出多項倡議，奠定銀行氣候風險管理基礎，推廣綠色及可持續銀行業（詳見可持續發展章節）。此外，HKMA還在軟基礎建設方面製定努力，包括推動以客戶為中心的企業文化，並與銀行業合作，推行能力建設計劃以促進人才培育。\n\n同時，HKMA亦積極與銀行業調整監管政策及流程。例如，在本地落實國際監管標準方面取得良好進展，包括資本充足度和披露標準。同時，HKMA持續推動建立可信的持牌機構解決方案體系，制定新解決方案標準，並實施吸收損失能力要求，以提升持牌機構的可解決性。\n\n# 目標\n\nHKMA的總體目標是促進銀行系統的安全與穩定。要達成此目標，前提是建立一個高度韌性的金融體系，能為香港經濟提供關鍵的金融服務。\n\n各銀行通過其經營方式，可能會影響系統穩定性，在極端情況下甚至可能造成非有序失敗。作為監管機構，HKMA在保障金融穩定中扮演關鍵角色，確保銀行具備韌性應對衝擊並能在危機中復原，最終有助於防止失敗。HKMA負責銀行的審慎監管，擁有香港持牌銀行、受限制牌照銀行及存款收集公司（合稱「授權機構」）的授權資格。\n\n然而，HKMA不能也不是設計來確保零風險的金融體系；作為解決危機的權威機構，其目標是確保在授權機構變得不可行時，其失敗可以有序管理。為此，香港已建立金融機構的解決機制體系，HKMA作為其解決權威。為有效運作該體系，必須制定解決規則及政策標準，進行解決計劃，消除阻礙授權機構可解決性的障礙，並增強HKMA的實務運作能力。\n\n此外，HKMA還負責指定和監督部分金融市場基礎設施（FMIs）。在監督FMIs時，HKMA旨在提升其整體安全與效率，限制系統性風險並促進透明度。加強FMIs的韌性，可以防止金融危機對香港貨幣和金融體系造成破壞。相關監管方式可在HKMA網站查詢。\n\n# 2021年回顧\n\n# 發牌\n\n截至2021年底，香港持有：\n\n年內，HKMA核發兩張銀行牌照及一張受限制牌照給三家非本地銀行。同時，亦准許一外國交易平台運營商作為支付中介人。三間持牌銀行及兩間受限制牌照銀行的授權於年內被吊銷。\n\n有關香港本地機構的詳情，請參閱第321至324頁的附件以及第330至333頁的表格D至F。\n\n# 監管活動概況\n\nHKMA進行了189次非現場審查，內容涵蓋CAMEL評級、公司治理、風險管理及金融科技策略等多方面。為促進風險治理，HKMA與機構董事會、獨立非執行董事或董事委員會舉行了40次會議。此外，HKMA亦與機構及其審計師合作，進行了38次三方會議。\n\n除非現場審查，HKMA亦定期進行現場檢查及主題性審查，涵蓋高風險領域。包括679次實地檢查與主題性審查，重點包括信貸風險管理。隨著科技採用的增加，營運風險與科技風險管理亦成為關注重點；HKMA加強了針對流動性、市場風險及證券、投資產品、保險和強積金（MPF）業務的實地檢查與審查。\n\n# 信貸風險\n\n# 信貸增長與資產質素\n\n2021年整體貸款增長3.8%，較2020年的1.2%為高。詳情見第二張表。  \n\n與大陸相關的貸款在2021年增長3.6%，達到HK$4,7250億（第三張表）。\n\n行業資產質素大致保持穩定，維持良好水準，行業分類貸款比率於2021年底為0.88%，較2020年底的0.90%略有下降，遠低於自2000年的長期平均1.8%。大陸相關貸款比率亦由去年同期的0.96%降至0.86%。\n\n疫情持續影響部分經濟部門，大陸房地產的信用事件亦引起市場關注。HKMA加強監控範圍，深入分析銀行對高杠桿借款人的敞口。與銀行保持密切溝通，以便即時掌握經濟與市場變化及風險管理措施的充足性。整體來看，銀行業的信用風險被評估為可控，HKMA最新的壓力測試結果顯示銀行仍然具有充足資本緩衝，能應對極端狀況。\n\n年內亦進行針對性及主題性審查，評估授權機構在貸款分類、貸款撥備、海外放款操作，以及私人銀行與財富管理業務的擔保貸款及AML/CFT控制方面的系統與管控。\n\n# 緩解客戶現金流壓力\n\n2021年九月，HKMA聯同銀行業中小企（SME）放款協調機制宣布延長六個月預先核准還款假期計劃，至2022年四月。此項計劃於2020年五月推出，暫緩符合條件企業客戶的貸款本金還款。隨著本地疫情反彈，2022年二月再延長至十月。並新增為期一年的部分本金償还方案，讓經濟能力良好的客戶逐步恢復還款。\n\n截至2021年十二月底，銀行已批准逾83,000宗貸款展期及其他救濟措施，總額逾HK$9200億。個人層面，亦批准逾52,000宗的按揭貸款及其他個人救濟貸款，總額超過HK$530億。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n自2009年起，HKMA多輪逆周期宏觀審慎措施，加強銀行風險管理及行業韌性，防止本地房市突發下跌。2021年12月新批住宅按揭貸款（RMLs）的平均貸款成數（LTV）為53%，較2009年9月的64%顯著降低。新按揭的平均負擔比（DSR）保持低位，12月為36%，遠低於2010年8月首次實施的41%（見圖表1）。\n\n# 營運與科技風險\n\n隨著銀行日益依賴科技支持業務，HKMA加強營運與科技風險監管。重點監管範疇包括雲端外包和遠程工作安排。HKMA於12月公佈「營運韌性」新監管政策手冊（SPM）草案，提供全方位的韌性管理指引。\n\n2023年1月推出的「網絡韌性評估框架2.0」反映最新的資安實踐。HKMA持續監測授權機構的實施情況，並檢視其網絡韌性能力。為應對破壞性網絡攻擊風險，HKMA於五月要求所有授權機構評估建設安全的第三資料備份方案，參考香港銀行協會（HKAB）發布的相關指引。\n\n為應對日益增長的釣魚攻擊風險，HKMA與行業合作，於七月發起「保護你的數位鑰匙、防範欺詐鏈接」的宣傳活動（見圖一）。\n\n圖一：提升公眾對釣魚攻擊的認識\n\n「保護你的數位鑰匙、防範欺詐鏈接！」的宣傳標語圖標。\n\n# 流動性與市場風險\n\n為提升對授權機構流動性風險的監控能力，HKMA在流動性壓力測試框架中加入多個額外情景，以評估授權機構應對長時間流動性沖擊的能力。\n\n年內，HKMA針對流動性測試計劃的充足性，以及管理流動性風險的監控指標與控制限，進行主題性審查。同時，亦評估市值和操作控制框架在債務證券投資及財資管理方面的有效性。\n\nHKMA緊密追蹤金融機構向倫敦銀行同業拆借利率（LIBOR）退出的準備進展。與行業協會合作，研發幫助企業遷移至其他基準利率的工具，包括提升企業對轉型的認識宣傳冊及有關貸款市場替代方案的資訊通訊。2021年底前，相關合同已大幅修訂，杜絕後續新簽LIBOR條款，並提醒自2022年1月1日起不得簽訂新LIBOR合約。"}
{"en": "# International Financial Centre\n\nDuring 2021, the HKMA achieved good progress in strengthening Hong Kong’s status as a globally competitive international financial centre through a multi-pronged approach.\n\nThe HKMA unveiled “Fintech 2025” strategy to promote the wide adoption of fintech by the financial sector and bolster Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub more broadly.  On the Faster Payment System, it has seen a surge in turnover during the year amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOn enhancing connectivity, significant progress was made during the year with the addition of the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect and Southbound Trading under Bond Connect to the suite of Connect schemes.  Thanks to its world-class market infrastructure and the Connect schemes, Hong Kong is the favoured platform for Mainland funds to tap into global markets and for international investors to access the fast-growing Mainland markets.\n\nAlso during 2021, the HKMA devoted significant efforts in creating new business opportunities to strengthen the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, in areas including bond issuance, asset and wealth management, corporate treasury centres, and green and sustainable finance.  To promote Hong Kong’s financial services, the HKMA stepped up market outreach to overseas and Mainland stakeholders to keep them informed about the resilience of Hong Kong’s financial system and the prospects it presents.\n\nMeanwhile, the HKMA is active in international and regional central banking and regulatory forums, contributing to global efforts in maintaining financial stability and promoting financial market developments.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nThe HKMA announced its “Fintech 2025” strategy, covering a series of initiatives to promote wide adoption of financial technology (fintech) and strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia.  The HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO), together with the banking departments, played a pivotal role in driving various key initiatives during the year including the following:\n\n- Promoting regulatory technology (Regtech) adoption\n- Rolling out the Tech Baseline Assessment to understand banks' adoption of fintech\n\nHong Kong’s position as an offshore renminbi hub remained firm, with offshore renminbi businesses registering robust growth during the year.  Inflows into renminbi assets continued to gather pace as the inclusion of onshore securities in major financial market indices continued. Hong Kong plays an indispensable role in facilitating international investors’ increased allocation to renminbi assets, with the Mainland–Hong Kong Connect schemes being widely accepted as the channels of choice for international investors to access onshore capital markets. In 2021, daily turnover under Northbound Bond Connect increased 34% to around RMB25.8 billion.\n\nFollowing the success of Northbound Bond Connect, Southbound Bond Connect was launched in September, completing the two-way connection between the Mainland and international bond markets.  In the same month, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), the HKMA and the Monetary Authority of Macao promulgated the implementation details for the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Crossboundary WMC) Scheme in the Guangdong–Hong Kong– Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA).  In October, eligible banks in Hong Kong started providing Cross-boundary WMC services together with their Mainland partner banks.\n\n\n\nTo enhance Hong Kong’s role as a key offshore renminbi centre, a working group comprising the HKMA, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) was formed to conduct a feasibility study on promoting trading of renminbi-denominated equity securities in Hong Kong.  A joint seminar was also co-organised by the PBoC and the HKMA in December, showcasing Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre and a leading renminbi business hub.\n\nThe HKMA continues to make progress towards strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform.  In particular, to increase Hong Kong’s appeal as a preferred fund domicile, the HKMA worked closely with the Government and the financial industry to provide a more facilitating tax and regulatory environment for fund formation.  Significant strides were also made in further elevating Hong Kong’s position as a regional green and sustainable finance hub, and as a bond issuance centre. At the same time, the HKMA stepped up market outreach to promote Hong Kong’s financial services to overseas and Mainland stakeholders.\n\nSafe and efficient operation of financial infrastructure is fundamental for reinforcing Hong Kong’s position as a leading international financial centre.  In 2021, the four interbank Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) and the Hong Kong Trade Repository achieved 100%1 system availability, outperforming the target of 99.95%.  Following the launch of Southbound Bond Connect in September, the CMU became the settlement and custodian service provider for transactions conducted under both Northbound and Southbound Bond Connect.\n\nAdoption of the FPS continued to expand in 2021. The number of registrations grew to 9.6 million at the end of 2021 and the average daily turnover for the year rose by 90% from 2020.  Increased use of the FPS for settling Government bills, making merchant payments and topping up stored value facility (SVF) e-wallets or bank accounts were the key drivers for the continued rise in transaction volume, on top of a steady growth in person-to-person and business payments.\n\nTo promote the safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA oversees six designated retail payment systems (RPSs) and supervises 15 licensed SVFs under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO).  During the year, the HKMA facilitated the smooth implementation of the Government’s Consumption Voucher Scheme by co-ordinating and promoting dialogues and co-operation between the relevant Government parties and the SVF licensees appointed for the scheme.\n\nIn January 2022, the HKMA issued a discussion paper on crypto-assets and stablecoins, setting out the HKMA’s thinking on the relevant regulatory approach and inviting views from stakeholders.  Relevant factors, including feedback to this discussion paper and recommendations of relevant international bodies, will be taken into account when drawing up the appropriate regulatory regime.\n\nInternationally, the HKMA is an active member of the central banking community and plays a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees.  For example, the HKMA chairs the Working Group on Financial Markets (WGFM) established under the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP)2.  The HKMA also co-chairs the Policy and Standards Group of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), the Non-Bank Monitoring Experts Group and the Financial Innovation Network of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), and leads a team that looks into supervisory issues associated with financial benchmark transition.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2021\n\n# Hong Kong as a fintech hub in Asia\n\n# Fintech 2025\n\nIn June, the HKMA unveiled its “Fintech 2025” strategy to drive fintech development in Hong Kong.  The strategy aims to encourage the financial sector to adopt technology comprehensively by 2025, as well as to promote the provision of fair and efficient financial services for the benefit of Hong Kong citizens and the economy.  The five focus areas of the strategy are:\n\n- All banks go fintech\n- Future-proofing Hong Kong for CBDCs\n- Creating the next-generation data infrastructure\n- Expanding the fintech-savvy workforce\n- Nurturing the ecosystem with funding and policies\n\nThe HKMA’s “Fintech 2025” strategy drives fintech development in Hong Kong\n\n# Fintech Adoption in the Banking Sector\n\nTo support the “All banks go fintech” initiative of the “Fintech 2025” strategy, the HKMA rolled out the Tech Baseline Assessment in June 2021.  The assessment aims to help the HKMA develop a better understanding of the current fintech landscape in the banking sector, and identify which fintech areas may warrant the HKMA’s support.  All licensed banks with significant operations in Hong Kong were requested to develop a three-year plan for fintech adoption by the end of 2021.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA also continued to implement its two-year roadmap to promote Regtech adoption by banks in Hong Kong, and incorporate technology in its own supervisory processes to improve efficiency and effectiveness.  See page 98 of the Banking Stability chapter for more details.\n\n# Wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency\n\nThe HKMA and the Bank of Thailand expanded the scope of their joint research project with the joining of the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates and the Digital Currency Institute of the PBoC in February 2021.  Renamed as “Multiple Central Bank Digital Currency Bridge (mBridge)” and strongly supported by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Innovation Hub Centre in Hong Kong, the project further explores the capabilities of distributed ledger technology to facilitate real-time cross-border foreign exchange payment-versus-payment (PvP) transactions in a multi-jurisdictional context and on a 24/7 basis.  A joint report was published in September to deliver the interim findings, followed by the publication of potential use cases and a future roadmap in November.\n\n# Retail Central Bank Digital Currency\n\nTo future-proof Hong Kong in terms of CBDC readiness, the HKMA started a study on the prospect of issuing retail CBDC in Hong Kong, i.e. e-HKD, covering both technical and policy considerations.  In collaboration with the BIS Innovation Hub Centre in Hong Kong, the HKMA embarked on a study called Project Aurum to explore the technical aspect of issuing retail CBDC.  Separately, an internal cross-departmental working group was set up to study the relevant technical, policy and legal issues.  In October, the HKMA released a technical white paper titled e-HKD: A technical perspective to explore and invite comments on potential technical design options for issuing and distributing retail CBDC.\n\nFurthermore, the HKMA supports the Digital Currency Institute of the PBoC on the technical pilot testing of using e-CNY for cross-boundary payments.  This will help promote interconnection in the GBA and bring greater convenience to Hong Kong and Mainland tourists by enhancing the efficiency and user experience of cross-boundary payments.\n\n# Commercial Data Interchange\n\nIn July, the HKMA hosted a virtual symposium to encourage banks and SVF operators to join the CDI, a next-generation financial data infrastructure that aims to enable more efficient financial intermediation in the banking system.  To further facilitate development and adoption, the launch of the CDI Innovation Hub was announced during the symposium. To facilitate small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) financing, the HKMA completed two phases of proof-of-concept study examining the technical feasibility of the CDI.  Applying alternative data to facilitate credit assessment and the underwriting of loans, more than 550 SME loans exceeding HK$900 million in total were approved by the participating banks during the study.  Based on the encouraging results, the HKMA announced the pilot launch of the CDI in November.\n\nSME owners commend the CDI for streamlining their loan applications\n\n# Talent development\n\nTo expand the fintech talent pool, the HKMA continued to run the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme 2.0 in collaboration with its strategic partners3 to nurture young talent at various stages of their career development. More than 180 students benefitted from the scheme in 2021. Separately, the Industry Project Masters Network scheme was piloted in September to provide opportunities for master’s degree students majoring in fintech to work on real-life fintech projects.  To form strategic partnerships and foster collaboration in areas including fintech talent development, the HKMA entered into memorandums of understanding (MoUs) with four local universities in October.\n\nMr Colin Pou (middle), Executive Director (Financial Infrastructure) of HKMA, at the MoU signing ceremony with four local universities\n\n# Fintech Supervisory Sandbox\n\nThe use of Fintech Supervisory Sandbox (FSS) continued to rise during the year.  As of end-December 2021, a total of 234 pilot trials of fintech initiatives had been allowed in the FSS since its launch in 2016, compared with 193 as of end-2020.  As of end-December 2021, the HKMA had also received in total 666 requests to access the FSS Chatroom for supervisory feedback at the early stage of fintech projects since the introduction of the Chatroom in 2017.

{"en": "# Reserves Management\n\nThe global financial markets embarked on a recovery path in 2021.  Although the global economy continued to be affected by the evolving COVID-19 pandemic situation, a number of factors, including an increasing vaccination rate as well as accommodative monetary policies and fiscal measures around the world, have contributed to notable recovery in the global economy and financial markets.  Against this background, a number of overseas equity markets achieved record highs during the year, and the Exchange Fund’s overall equity holdings were able to achieve a decent return despite the sluggish performance in Hong Kong equities. During 2021, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$191.9 billion, representing an investment return of 4.1%.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong.  The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre.  The HKMA, under the delegated authority of the Financial Secretary and within the terms of the delegation, is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(i) to preserve capital;\n(ii) to ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(iii) to ensure that sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(iv) subject to (i)–(iii), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Exchange Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 Portfolio Segregation of the Exchange Fund\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP).  The BP holds highly liquid US dollardenominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The IP invests primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member economies of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of its assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA diversifies part of the Exchange Fund’s investments in a prudent and incremental manner into a wider variety of asset classes.  This includes emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate.  Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP).  The HKMA has put in place a cap1 to guide the pace of diversification into the LTGP since its inception.  As the LTGP has become increasingly mature in investment scale and asset diversity, the EFAC decided in January 2022 to replace the cap by a target asset allocation that is determined concurrently with that of other asset classes, subject to prudent risk management principles.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007, holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that have been acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes.  The Strategic Portfolio is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of its unique nature.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by Fiscal Reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP2, with the major exception of the Future Fund3, which links its interest rate to the return of both the IP and the LTGP in accordance with the portfolio mix.  The portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 40:60 in 2021.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation.  The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents long-term asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund.  Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark.  This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark (or strategic) allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”.  While the benchmark and tracking error4 limit are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with the EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority.  Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may assume positions to take advantage of short-term market movements (Figure 2).\n\nFigure 2 Asset allocation of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nThe HKMA’s Exchange Fund Investment Office houses its investment and related risk management functions. Exchange Fund Investment Office staff members directly manage about 71% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, comprising the entire BP and part of the IP.  This part of the IP includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 29% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes.  The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to realise sustainable returns, draw on diverse and complementary investment styles, and gain market insights and technical expertise in investment.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes.  The expenditure is determined primarily by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe growing complexity of the investment environment underlines the importance of risk management.  The HKMA sets stringent controls and investment guidelines for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and ensures a proper risk monitoring and compliance system is in place. Three lines of defence are in place to implement effective risk management and governance of investment-related activities.  Key risk categories (including credit, market, liquidity and operational risks) are regularly monitored, and the risk management process provides a robust framework to support strategic planning and investment diversification.\n\n# RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT\n\nThe HKMA believes that, by putting an appropriate emphasis on responsible investment and sustainable long-term economic performance, it can better achieve the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund and reduce risks associated with environmental, social and governance (ESG)- related matters of its underlying investments.  The HKMA supports responsible investment by integrating ESG factors into the investment processes for both public and private market investments of the Exchange Fund, underpinned by the guiding principle that priority will generally be given to ESG investments if the long-term risk-adjusted return is comparable with other investments.  For more details about the HKMA’s responsible investment framework and implementation, see the Sustainability chapter on pages 184 to 191.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2021\n\nGlobal equity markets rose sharply and hit new record highs on the back of ultra-loose monetary policies and fiscal measures, driving an accelerated recovery of the global economy and financial markets.  However, Hong Kong and Mainland equity markets underperformed amid market reforms.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index in the US rose by 27%, while the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong dropped by 14%.\n\nFor the bond markets, rising inflation expectations and tapering of asset purchases by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) led to a rise in US Treasury yields and falling bond prices during 2021.  Ten-year US Treasury yields increased by about 60 basis points from 0.9% at the beginning of the year to 1.5% at the end of the year.\n\nIn the currency markets, the US dollar strengthened against other major currencies, particularly towards the end of 2021, on the back of expectations about the Fed’s tapering pace. In particular, the euro and the yen depreciated by 7.1% and 10.3% against the US dollar respectively.\n\nThe performance of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2021 is shown in Table 1.\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$191.9 billion in 2021.  This comprised gains on bonds of HK$12.6 billion, net gains on equities of HK$47.8 billion (with gains of HK$68.8 billion from foreign equities, and losses of HK$21.0 billion from Hong Kong equities), a positive currency translation effect of HK$16.8 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets and gains of HK$114.7 billion on other investments held by the investment-holding subsidiaries of the Fund. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$3.1 billion.\n\nTotal assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,570.2 billion at the end of the year.  The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$515.3 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$392.5 billion and real estate HK$122.8 billion.  Outstanding investment commitments of the LTGP amounted to HK$225.7 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund in 2021, excluding the Strategic Portfolio, was 4.1%.  Specifically, the IP achieved a rate of return of 3.7%, while the BP gained 0.4%.  The LTGP has recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 15.4% since its inception in 2009.\n\nThe annual returns of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2021 are set out in Chart 1.  Table 2 shows the 2021 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over several different time horizons.  The average return was 5.3% during 2019–2021, 4.7% during 2017–2021, 3.3% during 2012–2021 and 4.8% since 1994.  Table 3 shows the currency mix of the Fund’s assets on 31 December 2021.\n\nSee pages 211 to 319 for the audited 2021 financial statements of the Exchange Fund.\n", "zh": "儲備管理\n\n2021年，全球金融市場踏上復甦之路。儘管全球經濟仍受到不斷演變的COVID-19疫情影響，然而包括疫苗接種率逐步提升、各國實施的寬鬆貨幣政策和財政措施在內的多個因素，促成全球經濟和金融市場的顯著復甦。在此背景下，部分海外股票市場創下歷史新高，匯豐銀行的整體股票持倉仍能取得可觀的回報，儘管香港股市表現較為疲軟。2021年，匯豐銀行錄得投資收入1919億港元，投資回報率為4.1%。\n\n匯豐基金\n\n按照《匯豐基金條例》的規定，匯豐基金的主要目標是對香港貨幣的匯率價值進行直接或間接的影響。該基金亦可用於維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定與完整，以協助香港維持國際金融中心的地位。在財經司司長授權委託下，金管局負責匯豐基金的運用及投資管理，並在授權範圍內向財經司司長負責。\n\n匯豐基金管理\n\n投資目標及投資組合結構\n\n匯豐基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）已制定以下投資目標：\n(i) 保持資本；\n(ii) 保證整個貨幣基礎在任何時候均由高流動性、以美元計價的資產完全支持；\n(iii) 確保擁有足夠的流動性以維持貨幣和金融穩定；以及\n(iv) 在（i）至（iii）的前提下，達到有助於長遠維持匯豐基金購買力的投資回報。\n\n上述目標充分考慮了匯豐基金的法定宗旨，並融入基金的投資組合結構和目標資產配置（圖1）。\n\n圖1 匯豐基金的資產配置劃分\n\n一般而言，匯豐基金有兩個主要投資組合：後備組合（BP）和投資組合（IP）。BP持有高度流動性以美元計價的資產，以滿足貨幣局制度下全額支持貨幣基礎的要求。IP則主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織（OECD）會員國的債券和股票市場，以保持資產的價值和長遠購買力。\n\n為更好管理風險和提升中長期回報，金管局謹慎且逐步地將部分匯豐基金投資分散至更廣泛的資產類別，包括新興市場及內地的債券和股票、私募股權（含基礎建設）以及房地產。新興市場及內地債券和股票由IP持有，而私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合（LTGP）持有。自成立以來，金管局設定了對LTGP的分散投資速度上限。隨著LTGP在投資規模和資產多樣性方面日益成熟，EFAC於2022年1月決定用目標資產配置取代此上限，同時根據謹慎的風險管理原則，與其他資產類別的配置共同確定。\n\n自2007年設立的策略性投資組合持有由政府為匯豐基金的戰略目的而收購的香港交易所及結算有限公司（HKEX）的股份。由於其特殊性，該策略性投資組合未納入基金投資績效評估。\n\n與匯豐基金的資金安排\n\n匯豐基金不時接受財政儲備、政府資金和法定機構的存放安排。利率通常與IP的表現掛鈎，主要例外是未來基金，其利率則以IP和LTGP的回報以及 Portfolio的配置比例為參考，2021年未來基金在IP與LTGP的比重約為40：60。\n\n投資流程\n\n匯豐基金的投資流程基於兩類資產配置決策：戰略性資產配置和戰術性資產配置。戰略性資產配置反映在投資基準中，代表考量匯豐基金投資宗旨的長期資產比重。在此指引下，資產會進行戰術性配置，以追求超越基準的超額回報。實際配置常與基準（或戰略）配置不同，差異稱為“戰術偏離”。基準和追蹤誤差的限制由財經司司長與EFAC協商確定，而戰術決策和偏離範圍由金管局在授權下制定。在允許範圍內，資產管理人可根據短期市場趨勢作出調整（圖2）。\n\n圖2 匯豐基金的資產配置\n\n投資管理\n\n直接投資\n\n金管局的匯豐基金投資辦事處負責其投資及相關風險管理。該辦事處的員工約管理約71%的投資，包括整個BP和部分IP的投資，這部分IP涉及全球固定收益市場的投資組合及執行宏觀風險策略的衍生品組合。\n\n外部管理者的使用\n\n除內部管理外，金管局亦聘用外部基金管理人管理約29%的基金資產，包括所有上市股票投資組合及其他專門資產類別。聘用外部管理人旨在利用市場中的最佳投資專業知識，以實現可持續回報，採用多元且互補的投資策略，並獲得市場洞察及技術專長。\n\n相關支出包括基金管理費、保管費、交易成本，以及預扣稅等，此類支出主要受市場因素影響，年年可能有所不同。\n\n風險管理與合規\n\n不斷變化的投資環境凸顯風險管理的重要性。金管局對內外管理的投資組合設置嚴格控制和投資指引，並確保建立適當的風險監控和合規系統。設有三道防線，保障投資活動的有效風險管理和治理。定期監控關鍵風險類別（信用、市場、流動性及運營風險），並通過風險管理流程提供堅實的策略規劃及投資多元化支撐框架。\n\n責任投資\n\n金管局相信，通過高度重視責任投資和可持續長遠經濟表現，能更有效達成匯豐基金的投資目標，並減少環境、社會及公司治理（ESG）相關風險。金管局支持責任投資，將ESG因素融入公共和私募市場的投資流程，並堅持在長期風險調整後回報可比的情況下，優先考慮ESG投資。更詳盡的責任投資框架與執行情況，請見第184至191頁的可持續發展章節。\n\n基金績效\n\n2021年金融市場\n\n全球股票市場在超寬鬆的貨幣政策和財政措施推動下大幅上升，創出新高，加速了全球經濟及金融市場的復甦。然而，市場改革下的香港及內地股市則表現較為拖累。美國標準普爾500指數升27%，而恒生指數則下跌14%。\n\n債券市場方面，通脹預期上升及美聯儲縮減資產購買規模，推動美國國債收益率上升，債券價格下跌。年內，十年期美國國債收益率由年初的0.9%升約60個基點，到年底達1.5%。\n\n貨幣市場上，美元兌其他主要貨幣升值，特別是在2021年底，主因市場預期美聯儲縮減步伐。歐元及日圓對美元分別貶值7.1%和10.3%。\n\n表1展示了2021年主要貨幣、債券和股票市場的表現。\n\n匯豐基金的績效\n\n2021年，匯豐基金錄得投資收入1919億港元，包括債券收益的126億港元，股票的淨收益478億港元（外國股票68.8億港元，香港股票21億港元的虧損），非港元資產的貨幣轉換正效應168億港元，以及投資控股子公司持有的其他投資的收益1147億港元。此外，策略性投資組合錄得估值增值31億港元。\n\n年末，匯豐基金總資產達到4兆5700億港元，LTGP下的投資市值合計5153億港元，其中私募股權為3925億港元，房地產為1228億港元。LTGP的未完成投資承諾則達到2257億港元。\n\n不計入策略性投資組合的匯豐基金2021年的投資回報率為4.1%。其中IP的回報率為3.7%，BP則為0.4%。自2009年成立以來，LTGP的年化內部收益率達至15.4%。\n\n圖1呈現1994年至2021年匯豐基金的年度回報，表2列示2021年的投資回報及不同時間範圍內基金的平均回報，2019-2021年的平均回報為5.3%，2017-2021為4.7%，2012-2021為3.3%，自1994年至今為4.8%。表3則展示2021年年末基金的貨幣結構。\n\n請參閱第211至319頁的審計2021年財務報表全文。"}

By end-2021, the HKMA had opened up 148 sets of Open APIs on its website, in line with the targeted schedule.\n\n# Information Centre\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre, located on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre, is an important facility introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters.  It consists of an exhibition area and a library. The exhibition area presents an overview of the HKMA’s work and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong in an interactive manner.  It also contains information and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.  The library, situated next to the exhibition area, houses more than 26,000 books, journals and other publications on Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs as well as central banking topics.  It also maintains the register of AIs and local representative offices, as well as the register of securities staff of AIs, for public access as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nTo safeguard public health and safety during the COVID-19 pandemic, special operational arrangements were put in place at the Information Centre.  Cleansing and disinfection were stepped up, and facilities and exhibits were sanitised regularly with anti-microbial coating.\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre’s exhibition area comprises the Policy Section, the Currency Section and the Historical Timeline\n\n# Community engagement and public education\n\nTo reach out to the community and raise public awareness of the HKMA’s work, a public education programme has been running since 1998.  In 2021, a webinar was organised for over 2,300 students and teachers from 84 secondary schools.  The webinar covered an overview of the HKMA’s work, the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, protection of personal digital keys, the Deposit Protection Scheme and career opportunities in the banking industry.  To date, more than 63,000 people have participated in the public education programme.\n\nThe HKMA educates and engages the public on how to be smart and responsible financial consumers.  In view of the increase in phishing scams, the HKMA conducted a public awareness campaign themed “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!” with cross-media promotion to urge the public to stay vigilant against fraudulent hyperlinks embedded in SMS messages and emails purportedly from banks.\n\nCross-media promotion reminding the public to beware of fraudulent hyperlinks\n\nThe HKMA also seeks to enhance the public’s understanding of the financial industry and raise the young generation’s interest in pursuing a career in the industry.  Following positive feedback to the online drama series “STEPS” in 2020, the HKMA launched a new series titled “Four Faces of Talents in Central” featuring four growing areas of the financial industry: data science, fintech, green and sustainable finance, and wealth management.  In the video series, the characters of the market practitioners were portrayed in a humorous manner, and seasoned industry players and young talents shared first-hand information on the nature and requirements of jobs, career opportunities and prospects across the above four growing areas.\n\n“Four Faces of Talents in Central” series keeps the young generation abreast of career opportunities in the financial market\n\nThe “Online Parenting and Educational Campaign” launched in 2020 was recognised with a Silver Award in the “Best Event — Corporate Social Responsibility” category of the MarketingInteractive’s Marketing Events Awards 2021.  Building on the campaign’s success and to sustain momentum, the HKMA rolled out additional initiatives, including a parenting financial education workshop where child education experts shared tips on how to teach kids good money sense and demonstrated a DIY (do-it-yourself) financial educational toy, as well as an animated virtual tour of the HKMA Information Centre.\n\nThe “Online Parenting and Educational Campaign” wins an award at the Marketing Events Awards 2021.  The campaign promotes money management concept and skills to let parents and kids learn in an amusing and entertaining way.\n\nTo enhance financial literacy among secondary school students, the HKMA and various stakeholders co-organised the “Hong Kong Financial Literacy Championship”, which featured a fintech theme.  Apart from an online quiz, a new financial design thinking workshop on personal financial management was added to train the participating students to develop innovative proposals on money management tools.  This initiative won the “Highest Student Participation Award” offered by the Business-School Partnership Programme under the Education Bureau, and the “Investor and Financial Education Award (Corporate) — Gold Award” offered by the Investor and Financial Education Council2 (IFEC).\n\nThe “Hong Kong Financial Literacy Championship” educates students on fintech and design thinking concepts and achieves record-high participation\n\nOther community engagement initiatives included talks or webinars for students and retirees.  The HKMA also participated in a teacher training webinar on economic security organised by the Education Bureau.  Online educational materials offering smart tips on using automated teller machines (ATMs) are available in eight languages3 to cater for people of different backgrounds living in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA supports the IFEC in promoting financial literacy and capacity in Hong Kong, and will explore further collaboration with stakeholders to maximise the impact of community engagement.\n\n# Financial disclosure\n\nTo maintain a high level of transparency, the HKMA adopts international standards in financial disclosure insofar as these are applicable to central banking operations.  These include the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and other applicable reporting requirements, for example, the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard.  The Finance Division works with external auditors and other accounting professionals to prepare and present the Exchange Fund’s financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards.  The HKMA also provides detailed disclosures and thorough analyses of a wide range of expense items and budgetary information in its Annual Report.\n\n# ACCOUNTABILITY AND CONTROLS\n\n# Risk management\n\nOne of the HKMA’s most important tasks is to manage risks to the monetary and banking systems.  Risk management is undertaken both at a working level in the day-to-day operations and at a higher level through strategic planning. Under the HKMA’s risk management framework, there are two high-level committees — the Macro Surveillance Committee and the Risk Committee — both of which are chaired by the Chief Executive of the HKMA.\n\nThe terms of reference of the Macro Surveillance Committee are:\n\n- to identify potential risks and threats to the monetary and financial system in Hong Kong and discuss possible measures to address such risks;\n- to review existing measures for managing risks in the monetary and financial system to identify possible gaps and ensure the adequacy of these measures; and\n- to encourage cross-departmental sharing of relevant information on macro surveillance with a view to enhancing the macro surveillance capability of the HKMA.\n\nThe terms of reference of the Risk Committee are:\n\n- to identify potential risks and threats to the organisation and devise strategies to reduce the impact of such events;\n- to review the existing system for managing risks across different departments to identify possible gaps and significant risks and ensure the adequacy of measures to address them;\n- to harmonise the criteria and methods of risk measurement and prioritise the resources management of risks identified; and\n- to encourage a stronger risk management culture institutionally which promotes the proper levels of authorisation and controls.\n\nA robust operational risk management framework is in place covering organisational risks at two levels: the entity level and the department level.  Entity-level risks refer mainly to those which concern the entire organisation in the medium term, or which might call for a cross-departmental response. Potential and emerging risks identified by business units, and the adequacy of the control measures and mitigating strategies they devise, are reviewed and reported every quarter.  This is supplemented by a top-down approach to manage entity-level risks, in which senior colleagues heading different business units actively identify risks of wider impact and propose mitigating measures.  The Risk Committee discusses these assessments and decides on appropriate follow-up actions.\n", "zh": "# 企業職能\n\n企業職能支持香港金融管理局（HKMA）的運作，具有高度的透明度、問責性、效率和專業精神。 為了促進公眾理解其政策與運作，HKMA通過傳統媒體和社交媒體、其官方網站、資訊中心及其他渠道與社會和市場保持有效溝通。在機構內，HKMA誠心建立一支敏捷且可持續的團隊，制定嚴謹的財務紀律，並升級資訊技術能力，以適應變化，確保政策和措施的有效落實。\n\n# 透明度\n\n# 媒體關係及社交媒體\n\nHKMA與媒體密切合作，以提升透明度及促進公眾對其政策和運作的了解。2021年，HKMA舉辦或參與了169場實體及線上活動，包括八場新聞發布會、八場即場訪談和另外153場公共活動。並安排了27場媒體訪問。全年共發佈632份雙語新聞稿，並每天處理大量媒體詢問。\n\n為提升公眾對HKMA主要職能的認識，亦舉辦新聞發布會和媒體簡報會，對象包括本地、大陸及國外媒體。議題涵蓋「聯繫方案」、金融科技（fintech）以及利率基準改革等。\n\n為及時與公眾互動，HKMA維持五個社交媒體帳號（Facebook、Instagram、LinkedIn、Twitter和YouTube），粉絲數逾80,000名。HKMA利用其社交媒體渠道提升公眾對多個議題的認識，尤其是「網絡釣魚詐騙」，疫情期間大幅增加。此外，HKMA亦在社交媒體上推行推廣活動，內容包括綠色金融、金融科技及「聯繫方案」，以讓公眾了解最新發展趨勢。\n\n香港金融管理局行政總裁余偉文先生於2021年「香港金融科技周」上主持虛擬專題討論會\n\n香港金融管理局副行政總裁李漢榮先生主持有關HKMA「金融科技2025」策略的媒體簡報\n\nHKMA副行政總裁袁志明先生主持有關香港銀行業準備迎接倫敦銀行同業拆借利率轉型的媒體簡報\n\nHKMA副行政總裁劉毅衡先生接受國際新聞頻道採訪\n\n# 公眾查詢\n\n公眾查詢服務為大眾提供一個有效途徑，以更好了解HKMA的主要職能和操作流程。2021年共處理97781宗查詢，約一半與銀行政策及規管、消費者銀行事務、紙幣硬幣，以及金融基礎建設和債務市場發展有關。一些較為重要的查詢涉及「貨幣收集計劃」、銀行產品與服務、銀行相關指南及公告，以及零售債券發行計劃。\n\n圖表1顯示自2018年以來接收的公眾查詢數目，圖表2則呈現2021年按查詢性質的分佈。\n\n圖表1 公眾查詢總數\n\n圖表2 2021年查詢性質分佈\n\n# 公報出版物\n\n除《香港金融管理局年報》外，HKMA還出版了兩期《半年度貨幣與金融穩定報告》和四期《季度公報》，並定期更新《月份統計公報》，提供最新和主題性的貨幣、銀行及經濟相關資訊與分析。HKMA亦發表11篇Insight1文章，介紹其主要新措施和政策，及討論熱點議題。\n\n2020年《年報》獲得“非牟利及慈善機構”類別銀獎及香港管理專業協會2021年度最佳年報獎中的可持續發展特別獎（卓越獎）。\n\n# 企業網站\n\n企業網站（www.hkma.gov.hk）提供超過4萬4千頁內容，覆蓋英語、繁體與簡體中文，是公眾獲取HKMA最新資訊的主要入口。網站設有持牌金融機構（AIs）及本地代表處名冊，以及根據《銀行條例》第20條保存的金融資訊工作人員名冊，以及根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》持牌儲值設施營運者名冊。\n\nHKMA自2018年起以階段方式在網站推出金融數據和重要資訊的開放應用程式介面（API）。至2021年底，HKMA已開放148組API，符合預定時間表。\n\n# 資訊中心\n\nHKMA資訊中心位於國際金融中心55樓，是一個重要設施，向社會介紹HKMA的工作並促進公眾對貨幣與銀行事務的認識。包括展覽區及圖書館。展覽區以互動方式呈現HKMA的工作概況以及香港貨幣和銀行的發展歷史，並設有關於香港貨幣、銀行和金融事務的資訊和展品。圖書館位於展覽區旁，藏有超過26,000本書籍、期刊和其他出版物，內容涵蓋香港貨幣、銀行及金融事務與中央銀行相關話題。亦保存有銀行條例第20條規定的AIs及代表處名冊，以及金融結算協議（FSD）資料。\n\n為保障公眾健康安全，COVID-19疫情期間，資訊中心實行特別運作安排，包括加強清潔和消毒，並定期用抗菌塗層對設施和展品進行消殺。\n\n資訊中心的展覽區包括政策部分、貨幣部分及歷史時間線\n\n# 社區參與及公共教育\n\n自1998年起，HKMA持續推行公共教育計劃，以加強社會了解HKMA的工作。2021年，舉辦了一場線上研討會，吸引來自84所中學的逾2,300名學生和老師參與，內容涵蓋HKMA的工作概況、聯繫匯率制度、香港紙幣、個人數碼鑰匙的保護、存款保障計劃及銀行業的職業機會。迄今，已有超過63,000人參與這個公共教育計劃。\n\nHKMA致力於引導及教育公眾，成為聰明且負責任的金融用戶。為應對電信詐騙增加，HKMA推出「守護你的個人數碼鑰匙 小心詐騙連結！」跨媒體推廣活動，提醒公眾提高警覺，避免點擊來自銀行的詐騙短訊及電子郵件中的虛假超連結。\n\n跨媒體推廣提醒公眾警惕詐騙超連結\n\n另外，HKMA亦旨在提升公眾對金融行業的了解，並激發年輕一代對行業的興趣。2020年反響熱烈的網劇系列《步入》基礎上，HKMA推出新系列《中環金融人才四面體》，介紹金融行業的四大成長範疇：數據科學、金融科技、綠色及可持續金融、以及財富管理。該系列影片以幽默方式展現市場從業人員，並由行業資深人士與年輕人才實地分享工作內容、職業前景和職位要求。\n\n「中環金融人才四面體」系列讓年輕人掌握金融市場的職業機遇\n\n2020年推出的「線上親子及教育推廣」活動榮獲2021年營銷互動的“最佳企業社會責任活動”銀獎。在活動成功的基礎上，HKMA進一步推出多項措施，包括親子理財工作坊，由專家分享務實的理財技巧及示範DIY理財教玩具，並設有HKMA資訊中心的虛擬導覽動畫。\n\n「線上親子及教育推廣」在2021年營銷活動獎中獲獎，推廣理財觀念與技能，使家長和子女能以輕鬆愉快的方式共同學習。\n\n為提升中學生的金融素養，HKMA與多方合作，舉辦以金融科技為主題的「香港金融素養比賽」。除線上測驗外，還新增一個個人金融管理的設計思維工作坊，訓練學生用創新方案研發理財工具。此項目榮獲教育局「商校合作計劃」的「最高學生參與獎」及「投資者和財務教育理事會（IFEC）」頒發的「投資者及理財教育大獎（企業組）—金獎」。\n\n「香港金融素養比賽」推動學生理解金融科技及設計思維，參與人數創新高\n\n其他社區參與活動包括為學生和退休人士舉辦的講座或網絡研討會。HKMA亦參與由教育局舉辦的經濟安全教師培訓網絡研討會。提供多語種的網上教育資料，教導自動櫃員機（ATM）的智慧用法，服務來自不同背景的香港市民。\n\nHKMA支持IFEC推動香港金融素養與能力提升，並將探索與持份者進一步合作，以最大化社區參與的影響力。\n\n# 財務披露\n\n為保持高度的透明度，HKMA在財務披露方面採用國際標準，並根據適用於中央銀行運作的規定，包括香港財務報告準則及其他規定，例如國際貨幣基金組織的特殊數據揭示標準。財務部門與外部審計師及會計專業人員合作，按香港財務報告準則編制和呈報結算法基金的財務報表。年報中亦作詳細披露，並提供多方面的支出項目和預算分析。\n\n# 問責制及內部控制\n\n# 風險管理\n\nHKMA其中一項最重要的職責是管理貨幣及銀行系統的風險。風險管理既在日常營運層面操作，也在戰略層面通過策劃進行。在HKMA的風險管理框架下，設有兩個高層委員會——宏觀監察委員會和風險委員會，兩者皆由HKMA行政總裁主持。\n\n宏觀監察委員會的職責範圍包括：\n- 識別香港貨幣及金融系統潛在風險及威脅，討論應對措施；\n- 檢討現有風險管理措施，找出疏漏並確保措施充分；\n- 鼓勵跨部門分享宏觀監測資訊，以提升HKMA的宏觀監測能力。\n\n風險委員會的職責範圍包括：\n- 識別組織潛在風險與威脅，制定策略降低其影響；\n- 檢討不同部門的風險管理系統，找出疏漏和重要風險，確保措施充分；\n- 統一風險測量標準與方法，優先配置資源應對風險；\n- 鼓勵建立強化的風險管理文化，推動適當的授權及控制層級。\n\n一套完善的運營風險管理框架已建立，涵蓋機構層面及部門層面。機構層風險主要涉及中期或要求跨部門反應的整體性風險。業務單位每季會評估和報告潛在和新出現的風險，以及其控制措施的充分性。此層風險管理亦採用自上而下的方法，讓不同業務單位的高層積極辨識較大範圍的風險並提出緩解措施。風險委員會會討論這些評估，並決定跟進措施。"}
{"en": "# Sustainability\n\nThe HKMA is publishing its first sustainability report, as an integral part of its Annual Report 2021, to set out its strategy on sustainability and document its own efforts, as well as its joint efforts with the financial industry, to support the Government’s climate strategies and contribute to a more climate resilient and sustainable world.\n\nThe HKMA embeds sustainability considerations across its main roles and functions, whether as a banking supervisor, a market facilitator, a responsible investor, or in maintaining financial and monetary stability.  Moreover, the HKMA collaborates with local and overseas counterparts in strengthening the management and disclosures of climate risks, as well as the development of the green and sustainable finance market.\n\nIn addition, the HKMA is committed to fulfilling its corporate social responsibility, and aims to be a responsible and sustainable organisation. This commitment is manifested in various areas, including promoting a sustainable, financially inclusive and environmentally friendly marketplace, supporting the wider community, protecting the environment and nurturing a caring workplace.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nClimate change is one of the most pressing challenges facing the world today.  To combat climate change, countries agreed, under the Paris Agreement1, to take actions to cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and eventually achieve carbon neutrality within this century.  Meeting the Paris Agreement climate change target will require investments of an estimated US$1–2 trillion a year globally2, making sustainability one of the biggest drivers of capital flows in the decades ahead.\n\nHong Kong is determined to be at the forefront of this transition.  The Government announced that it will strive to achieve carbon neutrality before 2050, in line with developed economies globally.  Hong Kong is also the first Asian jurisdiction that has committed to specifically aligning disclosure requirements with recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) by 2025 across relevant sectors.\n\nTo the financial sector, climate change is both a source of risk and opportunity.  While the financial sector cannot be spared from the threats posed by climate change, it has a key role to play in the transition by channelling more financing to activities that are consistent with a pathway towards lower GHG emissions and climate-resilient developments.\n\nThe HKMA is committed to strengthening Hong Kong’s financial system to support a greener and more sustainable future, driving actions to support the Government’s climate goal and contributing to the global agenda.  In doing so, the HKMA incorporates sustainability considerations in carrying out its main functions and in running its operations.\n\nFirst, as a banking supervisor, the HKMA aims to strengthen resilience of the banking system against climate risks and to accelerate banks’ efforts in supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy.  To accomplish this, the HKMA has formulated a regulatory framework setting out supervisory requirements for banks to manage and disclose climate risks.  A pilot exercise on climate risk stress test to assess the resilience of the banking sector was also concluded successfully in 2021.  Meanwhile, on an ongoing basis, the HKMA takes into account climate change in monitoring financial stability risks.\n\nSecondly, in its market development role, the HKMA is focusing its efforts in enhancing Hong Kong’s role as a green and sustainable finance hub in the region, including the Greater Bay Area (GBA).  Hong Kong, being Mainland’s offshore financial centre, is well-positioned to channel global investments into Mainland’s plans to achieve peak carbon emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060.  The HKMA is also working through the Green and Sustainable Finance Cross-Agency Steering Group (CASG)3, which the HKMA co-chairs, to build industry capacity, address data gaps and explore the development of a local green classification framework.\n\nIn fact, Hong Kong is a leader in green finance solutions, having established the world’s first government Global Medium Term Note Programme dedicated to green bond issuances under the Government Green Bond Programme, and increased gradually the diversity of its issuances since 2019, both in terms of currencies and tenors.  To support the issuance of green and sustainable bonds and loans in the private sector, the Government set up the Green and Sustainable Finance Grant Scheme in May 2021. Administered by the HKMA, this scheme has incentivised more corporates to seek green and sustainable financing in Hong Kong, and encouraged more green advisers and external reviewers to establish or expand their presence here.\n\nThirdly, as the manager of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA has ensured that environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations are an integral part of its investment process and asset allocation decisions.  In the latter part of this report, the HKMA makes its inaugural disclosures on its climate scenario analysis and carbon footprint metrics of the Exchange Fund’s portfolios.\n\nFourthly, the HKMA is stepping up its own green office initiatives to ensure its own operations conform to best practices in the management and mitigation of climate risks.  As a start, the HKMA has established its carbon profile across Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions4, and made corresponding disclosures.  At the same time, the HKMA has implemented measures to enhance industry-wide operational efficiency and minimise resource consumption.  In addition, the HKMA holds itself to high standards of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and works with its stakeholders to promote financial inclusion and financial literacy.\n\nGreening the financial system requires close collaboration amongst central banks and supervisors.  The HKMA is an active member of the international community in global policymaking and alignment of sustainability standards. The HKMA has also issued a statement to support the Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) Glasgow Declaration5, reaffirming its commitment to delivering on the NGFS recommendations in taking the necessary measures to foster a greener financial system.\n\nIn driving these sustainability initiatives and assessing climaterelated opportunities and risks, sustainability and green considerations are embedded in the HKMA’s governance and risk management frameworks, in which the leadership is actively involved in setting the overarching objectives and guiding principles, in consultation with the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) and its sub-committees. The HKMA’s CSR and Sustainability Committee (CSC) also assesses the potential impacts of sustainability and climate-related issues on the organisation, and devises strategies to reduce the impacts.  Execution of the relevant strategies and initiatives is closely monitored and reported to the top management regularly.  In addition, external consultants have been engaged to advise the HKMA in selected areas of work.\n\nThe subsequent sections of this chapter will delve into the HKMA’s governance, strategies and risk management measures in undertaking green finance and sustainability work in each of its roles.\n\nThis report is prepared with reference to the disclosure elements recommended in the NGFS’s Guide on Climaterelated Disclosure for Central Banks, published in December 2021.  In addition, information in relation to the HKMA’s office operations makes broad reference to the reporting principles under the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards6 and the ESG Reporting Guide promulgated by the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited.\n\n# Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System\n\nThe NGFS provides a platform for central banks and prudential supervisory authorities to exchange experiences, share best practices, contribute to the development of environmental and climate risk management in the financial sector, and mobilise mainstream finance to support the transition towards a sustainable economy.  Its purpose is to define and promote best practices to be implemented within and outside of the membership of the NGFS, and to conduct or commission analytical work on green finance.\n\n# Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures\n\nIn December 2015, the Financial Stability Board created the TCFD to develop recommendations for more effective climate-related disclosures by companies to investors, lenders and insurance underwriters that could promote more informed decisions.  The TCFD’s recommendations are structured around four thematic areas that represent the core elements of how organisations operate: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets.\n\n# BANKING SUPERVISOR\n\nAs the core part of the financial system, banks should be proactive in managing climate risks, and support channelling more capital to green and sustainable activities.  As a banking supervisor, the HKMA focuses on building banks’ resilience against climate risks and accelerating banks’ efforts in supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\n# Overview of the HKMA’s three-phased approach\n\nSince May 2019, the HKMA has been promoting green and sustainable banking in three phases:\n\n# Phase I\n\nDeveloping a common framework to assess the “greenness baseline” of individual banks, and collaborating with international bodies to provide technical support to banks in Hong Kong.\n\n# Phase II\n\nConsulting the industry and other stakeholders on the supervisory expectations and requirements of green and sustainable banking.\n\n# Phase III\n\nFocusing on the implementation of supervisory requirements, monitoring and evaluation of banks’ progress in green and sustainable banking.\n\n# Guidance\n\n# Supervisory requirements on climate risk management\n\nIn 2020, the HKMA developed a common framework for assessing the “greenness baseline” of individual banks in collaboration with the industry.  The HKMA also conducted the first greenness assessment of banks, which marked the completion of Phase I.  To help banks prepare for the new supervisory requirements, a white paper was published in June 2020, which outlined the HKMA’s initial thinking on supervisory expectations for climate risk management.\n\nIn December 2021, following an industry consultation, the HKMA issued the supervisory requirements for banks to incorporate climate considerations into governance, strategy, risk management and disclosure.  In particular, specific requirements and concrete timeline were set out in mandating climate-related disclosures based on the recommendations of the TCFD before 2025. The requirements will set a benchmark to help banks upgrade their risk management capability.\n\nThe next step is for the HKMA to monitor banks’ implementation of the relevant requirements.  In this regard, the HKMA has stepped up its supervisory capacity by setting up a new dedicated team within its Banking Supervision Department to carry out climate risk supervision.\n\nThis three-phased approach is an iterative and evolving process.  Further to the first round of greenness assessment conducted in 2020, the HKMA is reviewing the framework to encompass the new supervisory requirements on climate risk management and potentially cover a wider scope, such as other environmental risks and measures for supporting the net zero transition.   The HKMA intends to launch an updated framework in the second half of 2022.\n\n# Sound practices supporting the transition to carbon neutrality\n\nApart from incorporating climate risk considerations into the risk management framework, some banks have devoted resources and taken measures to support the goals of the Paris Agreement and contribute to achieving global net zero emissions.  The HKMA issued a circular in December 2021 to share with the industry the sound practices of these banks which would be of reference value to other banks in the industry in formulating their climate strategies.  These sound practices are grouped into four areas: reducing GHG emissions of the banks’ own operations, reducing financed emissions through portfolio alignment, assisting clients to transition, and promoting collective efforts to assist the economy to achieve a net-zero transition.\n\n# Green classification framework to facilitate green finance flows\n\nTo increase transparency across the financial markets and enable consistent policy making on green finance, the HKMA has been working with other financial regulators to explore a local green classification framework, which will facilitate navigation among the Common Ground Taxonomy (CGT) developed by the International Platform on Sustainable Finance (IPSF)8 and the green definitions adopted by China and European Union, for adoption across different financial sectors.  The work will be guided by the principles of interoperability, comparability and inclusiveness, taking into account other definitions of green, transitional activities and local considerations.  This initiative will reduce the risk of green washing, improve product comparability and ultimately enhance investor protection.\n\n# Assessment: climate risk stress test\n\nTo assess the banking sector’s ability to cope with potential shocks brought about by climate change, the HKMA undertook a pilot exercise on climate risk stress test (CRST), which included the participation of 20 major retail banks and seven branches of international banking groups.  A report summarising the results of the pilot CRST exercise was published in December 2021.  The results showed that the banking sector remained resilient even in the face of extreme climate-related shocks, although these shocks could potentially give rise to significant adverse impacts on banks’ financials.  The CRST exercise helped to enhance banks’ capabilities for measuring and assessing climate risks. In light of the CRST results, the participating banks have devised plans to strengthen their climate strategies and risk governance frameworks.  The HKMA will continue to engage the industry to strengthen banks’ capability and enhance the CRST framework, taking into account the lessons learnt from the pilot exercise.\n", "zh": "# 可持續發展\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）正在發布其首份可持續發展報告，作為《2021年度報告》的重要組成部分，闡述其在發展可持續性方面的策略，並記錄其自身的努力，以及與金融行業的共同努力，以支持政府的氣候策略，並為構建一個更具氣候韌性的可持續世界作出貢獻。\n\nHKMA將可持續性考量融入其主要職能，無論是作為銀行監管機構、市場促進者、責任投資者，還是在維持金融和貨幣穩定方面。此外，HKMA亦與本地和海外的合作夥伴合作，加強氣候風險的管理與披露，並推動綠色及可持續金融市場的發展。\n\n此外，HKMA致力於履行其企業社會責任，並力求成為一個責任感強、具有可持續發展的機構。這一承諾體現在多個範疇，包括推動可持續、金融包容及環境友善的市場，支持更廣泛的社區，保護環境，以及營造關愛的工作環境。\n\n# 概覽\n\n氣候變化是當今世界面臨的最緊迫挑戰之一。為應對氣候變化，各國根據《巴黎協定》-1，同意採取行動削減溫室氣體（GHG）排放，並在本世紀內實現碳中和。實現《巴黎協定》的氣候目標將需要全球每年約一到兩萬億美元的投資，這使得可持續發展成為未來數十年內資本流動的最大推動力之一。\n\n香港致力於在這一轉型中走在前列。政府宣布將努力在2050年前實現碳中和，與全球發展成熟經濟體保持一致。香港也是第一個承諾在2025年前，將披露要求與氣候相關財務揭露工作組（TCFD）的建議進一步對齊的亞洲司法管轄區。\n\n對金融行業而言，氣候變化既是風險來源，也是機遇。儘管金融行業不能免受氣候變化帶來的威脅，但其在轉型中的作用至關重要，透過向符合低碳道路的活動提供更多融資，促進氣候韌性的發展。\n\nHKMA致力於加強香港金融系統，以支持更綠色、更可持續的未來，推動行動支持政府的氣候目標，並為全球議程作出貢獻。在此過程中，HKMA在履行主要職能及經營中均融入了可持續性考量。\n\n首先，作為銀行監管機構，HKMA旨在提升銀行系統應對氣候風險的韌性，並加快銀行支持轉型低碳經濟的努力。為此，HKMA制定了監管框架，規定銀行管理及披露氣候風險的相關要求。2021年，HKMA亦成功完成了氣候風險壓力測試的試點，評估銀行業的韌性。同時，HKMA在監測金融穩定風險時，也考慮氣候變化因素。\n\n第二，作為市場發展角色，HKMA專注於提升香港作為區域綠色及可持續金融樞紐的地位，包括大灣區（GBA）。作為內地的離岸金融中心，香港具備將全球投資引入內地達成2030年碳達峰及2060年碳中和的計劃的有利位置。HKMA亦通過聯合牽頭的綠色及可持續金融跨機構指導小組（CASG）努力，建立行業能力，解決數據缺口，並探索本地綠色分類框架的開發。\n\n事實上，香港在綠色金融解決方案方面已走在前列，建立了全球首個由政府主導的綠色債券計劃「政府綠色債券項目」，並自2019年起，在貨幣種類和期限方面逐步擴展其發行多樣性。為支持私營部門的綠色及可持續債券和貸款，政府於2021年5月設立了綠色和可持續金融資助計劃，由HKMA管理，鼓勵更多企業在香港尋求綠色及可持續融資，以及促使更多綠色顧問和外部審核機構建立或擴展其在本地的業務。\n\n第三，作為外匯基金管理者，HKMA確保環境、社會及治理（ESG）因素為投資流程和資產配置的重要組成部分。在本報告的後部分，HKMA首次披露了其氣候情景分析及外匯基金投資組合的碳足跡指標。\n\n第四，HKMA提升其綠色辦公室措施，確保其自身運作符合氣候風險管理和減緩的最佳實踐。作為起點，HKMA已建立其Scope 1及Scope 2排放的碳足跡，並披露相關資訊。同時，HKMA亦採取措施提升行業整體的運營效率，並減少資源消耗。此外，HKMA堅持高標準的企業社會責任，與持份者合作推動金融包容和理財教育。\n\n推動金融體系綠色化需要央行和監管機構之間緊密合作。HKMA積極參與國際氣候政策制定及標準對接，並支持中央銀行與監管機構聯盟（NGFS）《格拉斯哥宣言》5，重申履行該聯盟建議、促進更綠金融體系的承諾。\n\n在推動這些可持續發展倡議及評估氣候相關機會與風險時，HKMA將可持續性及綠色考量融入其治理架構及風險管理框架，並由領導層積極參與，確定整體目標與指導原則，並在與外匯基金顧問委員會（EFAC）及其專門委員會協商後，制定方向。HKMA的企業社會責任及可持續發展委員會（CSC）亦評估可持續性及氣候相關議題對組織的潛在影響，並制定相應策略以降低這些影響。相關策略和措施的執行由高層嚴格監控，並定期向管理層匯報。此外，HKMA也聘請外部顧問就某些工作區域提供專業意見。\n\n本章的後續部分將深入介紹HKMA在履行其各角色中的治理、策略及風險管理措施，以推動綠色金融及可持續發展工作。\n\n本報告編制參考了2021年12月公布的《NGFS氣候變化披露指南》中推薦的披露要素。此外，HKMA的辦公室運作資料也廣泛參照《全球報告倡議》（GRI）標準6以及香港交易所頒布的《ESG報告指引》的披露原則。"}
{"en": "# The Exchange Fund\n\nReport of the Director of Audit Exchange Fund Financial Statements\n\n# Audit Commission The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 217 to 319, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2021, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2021, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards.  My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report.  I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards.  I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021.  These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.5, 2.6 and 38.1 to the financial statements.\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, the Group had financial assets totalling HK$4,502,475 million and financial liabilities totalling HK$1,150,861 million valued at fair value.\n\nFor 89% of these financial assets and all these financial liabilities, their fair values were quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 inputs) or were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data (Level 2 inputs).\n\nFor the remaining 11% of these financial assets, their fair values were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data (Level 3 inputs).  Such financial assets totalled HK$517,316 million, including mainly unlisted investment funds.\n\nGiven the substantial amount and the estimations involved, valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value was a key audit matter.\n\nThe audit procedures on valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value included:\n\n- obtaining an understanding of the procedures, including relevant controls, for valuing different categories of financial assets and financial liabilities;\n- evaluating and testing the controls, including relevant application controls of the computer systems;\n- obtaining external confirmations on the valuation, existence, rights and obligations and completeness of the financial assets and financial liabilities;\n- where quoted market prices were used, verifying the prices to independent sources;\n- where valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions, and verifying the inputs to independent sources; and\n- where valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Valuation of investment properties at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.11, 18 and 19 to the financial statements.\n\nThe Group’s investment properties were stated at their fair values, totalling HK$27,089 million as at 31 December 2021. The Group also had interests in one associate and twenty one joint ventures totalling HK$45,172 million, whose principal activities were holding overseas investment properties.  The fair values of these investment properties, whether held by the Group directly or by associate or joint ventures, were mainly determined based on valuations by independent professional valuers.  Such valuations involved significant judgments and estimates, including the valuation methodologies and the assumptions used.\n\nThe audit procedures on valuation of investment properties at fair value included:\n\n- obtaining and reviewing the valuation reports of investment properties held by the Group directly or by associate or joint ventures, and verifying that the fair values were based on the valuations stated in the valuation reports;\n- assessing the independence and qualifications of the valuers; and\n- evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information.  The other information comprises all the information included in the 2021 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.  If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact.  I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.  I also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.  The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.  If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion.  My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report.  However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and\n- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements.  I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit.  I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.  I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nJohn Chu Director of Audit\n", "zh": "基金\n\n審計署署長報告 交易基金財務報表\n\n香港特區政府審計委員會\n\n獨立審計師報告 致財政司司長\n\n意見\n\n我證明已審核交易基金及其子公司（「本集團」）所載於第217至319頁的財務報表，包括截至2021年12月31日的交易基金及本集團的資產負債表，以及其當年的收支帳、綜合收益表、權益變動表和現金流量表，以及附註，包括重要會計政策摘要。\n\n依據本人意見，該等財務報表在所有重大方面，真實反映基金及本集團截至2021年12月31日的財務狀況，以及其該年度的財務績效和現金流，符合由香港會計師公會（「HKICPA」）頒布的《香港財務報告準則》（「HKFRSs」），並已妥善按照行政長官根據《交易基金條例》（第66章）第7條制定的指令編製。\n\n理據基礎\n\n本人依照根據《交易基金條例》（第66章）第7條制定的行政長官指令及審計委員會審計準則進行審核。本人在該等準則下的責任在於，使本次審核获得合理保證，證明財務報表整體不存在重大錯誤陳述。本人為獨立於本集團，並已遵守該等準則中的倫理義務。本人相信，所獲得的審計證據充足適當，可以作為出具意見的基礎。\n\n主要審計事項\n\n主要審計事項是指本人專業判斷中於2021年12月31日結束財務年度之財務報表審核中，具有最大重要性的事項。這些事項在我整體財務報表審核及形成意見的過程中已加以處理，並不對這些事項發表獨立意見。\n\n公平值金融資產及負債的估價\n\n請參閱財務報表中的註釋2.5、2.6及38.1。\n\n截至2021年12月31日，本集團的金融資產總值為HK$4,502,475百萬元，金融負債總值為HK$1,150,861百萬元，均按公平值列帳。\n\n其中89%的金融資產及所有金融負債的公平值均採用在活躍市場上相同資產或負債的報價（Level 1輸入），或利用基於可觀察市場數據的估值技術（Level 2輸入）來估價。\n\n剩餘11%的金融資產的公平值則採用基於非可觀察市場數據的估值技術（Level 3輸入），該等金融資產總值為HK$517,316百萬元，主要包括未公開的投資基金。\n\n由於這些金融資產與負債數額龐大且涉及估值程序，這是審計的重點範疇。\n\n對公平值金融資產及負債估價的審計措施包括：\n\n- 了解金融資產及負債不同類別估值程序及相關內部控制；\n- 評估並測試相關控制，包括電腦系統的應用控制；\n- 獲取外部確認，驗證金融資產與負債的估值、存有權、義務及完整性；\n- 使用報價時，驗證其可靠性及來源獨立性；\n- 使用基於可觀察市場數據的估值技術時，評估方法的適切性及假設的合理性，並驗證輸入數據的可靠性；\n- 使用非基於可觀察市場數據的估值技術時，評估方法的適切性、假設的合理性及輸入數據的可靠性。\n\n投資物業的公平值估價\n\n請參閱財務報表中的註釋2.11、18及19。\n\n截至2021年12月31日，本集團的投資物業列賬價值為HK$27,089百萬元。另有一間聯營企業及二十一個合營企業，共值HK$45,172百萬元，主要從事持有海外投資物業。這些投資物業的公平值多由獨立專業估價師進行估值，涉及重大判斷及估算，包括估值方法及假設。\n\n對投資物業公平值估價的審計措施包括：\n\n- 索取及審核由獨立估價師出具的估價報告，並核實其公平值基於報告中的估值；\n- 評估估價師的獨立性及資格；\n- 評估估值方法的適當性及假設與輸入數據的合理性。\n\n其他資料\n\n貨幣管理局負責其他資料。其他資料包括香港金融管理局的2021年年度報告中除財務報表和審計報告外的所有資訊。\n\n本人對財務報表的意見不涵蓋其他資料，亦不提供任何形式的保證結論。\n\n在審核財務報表的同時，本人的責任是閱讀其他資料，並在此過程中，考慮該等資料是否與財務報表或我在審核中獲得的知識重大不符，或是否有其他明顯的重大誤報。如根據本人所執行的工作，我認為該等資料存在重大錯誤，我應該作出報告。本人沒有此方面的通報。\n\n貨幣管理局及交易基金諮詢委員會審計小組對財務報表的責任\n\n貨幣管理局負責依照由HKICPA頒布的HKFRSs及根據《交易基金條例》制定的指令，編製能真實反映財務狀況的財務報表，並就因欺詐或失誤而出現的重大錯誤陳述，保持必要的內部控制。\n\n在編製財務報表時，貨幣管理局亦負責評估本集團持續經營能力，就有關持續經營的事項披露（如適用），並以持續經營為基礎進行會計處理。\n\n交易基金諮詢委員會審計小組負責監督本集團的財務報告流程。\n\n審計師對財務報表的審核責任\n\n我的目標是取得合理保證，確信整體財務報表不存有重大錯誤陳述（包括欺詐或失誤），並出具包含我意見的審計報告。合理保證是一個較高的保證水平，但並不保證依照審計委員會審計準則進行的審計一定能發現所有存在的重大錯誤。錯誤可能由欺詐或失誤產生，若單獨或合計，足以影響使用者基於財務報表作出的經濟決策，即屬重大。\n\n作為審計委員會審計準則下的審計工作一部分，我行使專業判斷，並在整個審計過程中保持專業懷疑。我亦：\n\n- 識別及評估由欺詐或失誤引致的重大錯誤陳述的風險，設計並執行響應這些風險的審計程序，並獲取充足及適當的審計證據，作為我意見的基礎。由欺詐引起的重大錯誤陳述未被察覺的風險較由失誤引起的高，因欺詐可能涉及串謀、偽造、故意遺漏、虛假陳述或內部控制的故意越控；\n- 獲取相關內部控制的了解，以設計適用的審計程序，並非為了對集團內部控制的有效性發表意見；\n- 評估會計政策的適用性及由貨幣管理局作出的會計估計和相關披露的合理性；\n- 根據已獲取的審計證據，斷定貨幣管理局持續經營的做法是否適當，並判斷是否存在重大不確定性，涉及可能對本集團的持續經營能力產生重大疑慮的事件或條件。如我認為存在重大不確定性，應在審計報告中特別指出相關披露，若披露不足，則修正意見。我的結論以截至我審計報告日所獲得的證據為依據，但未來的事件或條件可能導致本集團停止經營；\n- 評估財務報表的整體呈現、結構和內容，包括披露資料，是否以一個公正呈現方式反映了交易和事件的本質；\n- 獲取充足且適當的審計證據，以對集團內相關實體或業務範圍的財務資料發表意見。我負責指導、監督及執行整個集團審計，並獨立承擔我的審計意見。\n\n我會就審計範圍、時間安排及重要審計結果（包括我在審計中發現的重大內控缺陷）與交易基金諮詢委員會進行溝通。\n\n我亦會向交易基金諮詢委員會提供一份聲明，表明我已遵守相關的倫理要求，並就可能合理影響我獨立性的任何關係或其他事宜進行溝通。如適用，亦會提供相關保障措施。\n\n根據與交易基金諮詢委員會的溝通內容，我會確定在本期財務報表審核中最為重要的事項，並在審計報告中針對這些事宜作出說明，除非法律或規例禁止公眾披露，或在極少數情況下，認為披露可能產生負面後果，超過公共利益而不作披露。\n\n審計署署長 柯志祥"}

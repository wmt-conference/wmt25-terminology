{"en": "# Resilience in the face of adversity\n\nReverberations from slowing global economic growth amid a “high for longer” interest rate environment and intensifying geopolitical tensions — not just stemming from the RussiaUkraine war and China-US tensions but also the outbreak of conflict in the Middle East — were the key themes for the financial markets in 2023. The March banking turmoil in the US and Europe, the most significant system-wide banking stress since the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, weighed further on market sentiment. Major economies grappled with the harsh realities of tightened monetary conditions and greater uncertainty over the inflationary path and interest rate outlook. Adding to the uncertainty was the pace of Mainland China’s economic recovery, which was slower than general market expectations.\n\nWith volatility and unpredictability becoming the “new normal” in financial markets, Hong Kong has again demonstrated its well-known ability to adapt, showing remarkable resilience. Since the city’s full-fledged post-COVID reopening last year, much work has been done to attract people back to our dynamic city and reconnect them with Hong Kong. The HKMA has contributed by hosting a series of large-scale international events such as the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit and conferences with the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), which showcased our vibrant city and helped send the message worldwide that Hong Kong, as a major international financial centre (IFC), is open for business and remains the centre of action and innovation. There are clear signs of gradual recovery, driven by an encouraging revival of inbound tourism and improved private consumption, also supported by a resilient labour market and the various support measures rolled out by the Government. For 2023 as a whole, Hong Kong’s gross domestic product growth bounced back to 3.2% from negative territory in 2022.\n\nThe HKMA entered its fourth decade in 2023. The past 30 years have seen the dynamics of the economy and the financial markets change drastically, with technology driving advances beyond anyone’s wildest imagination. The invaluable experience and wisdom gained over the past three decades have enabled us to face the future with confidence. Despite macroeconomic headwinds and an uncertain external environment, the HKMA will continue to uphold its mandate of safeguarding monetary and banking stability in Hong Kong, and will actively pursue developmental opportunities to anchor that stability and cement the city’s status as a leading IFC.\n\nFormer and current Financial Secretaries of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Chief Executives of HKMA at a gathering to celebrate the HKMA’s 30th anniversary: (from left) Mr Joseph Yam, Mr Henry Tang, Mr Donald Tsang, Mr Paul Chan, Mr Eddie Yue, Mr Antony Leung, Mr John Tsang, and Mr Norman Chan\n\n# LERS — Weathering the storms\n\nLast year marked the 40th anniversary of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), a staunch pillar supporting Hong Kong’s strong and stable monetary and financial systems. Four decades of transparent and effective operation have nurtured confidence in the LERS and its credibility in the market. Throughout the year, the Hong Kong dollar stayed within the Convertibility Zone and the Hong Kong dollar market operated smoothly, reflecting the strong market confidence in the LERS, a confidence also shared and expressed by the International Monetary Fund and global market players.\n\nBehind this confidence lie the HKMA’s proactive efforts in public and market engagements, along with effective surveillance. We spared no effort during the year in communicating with key stakeholders to foster a clear understanding of the functioning of the LERS, which is all the more important in times of volatility, be it stemming from economic stress or political uncertainties. We also strengthened surveillance of our monetary system, leveraging the use of datasets from the trade repository and expanded granular data from banks, as well as advanced data analytics and artificial intelligence, to enhance our capability, enabling more timely and comprehensive analysis of financial stability and macro-prudential surveillance.\n\n# Banking system — A major source of stability\n\nDespite a multitude of challenges including the high-interestrate environment, persistent geopolitical tensions and a challenging credit landscape, Hong Kong’s banking system remained stable throughout the year, underpinned by strong capital and liquidity buffers.\n\nAs at the end of 2023, the consolidated total capital ratio of local banks stood at 21.1%, well above the international minimum requirement of 8%. The Liquidity Coverage Ratio of large banks edged up to 178.6% as of the fourth quarter of 2023, likewise well above the statutory minimum requirement of 100%. While the classified loan ratio increased slightly from 1.40% at the end of 2022 to 1.56% at the end of 2023, it remained below the long-term historical average of 2.0%. The increase was mainly driven by exposures to Mainland privately-owned enterprise (POE) property developers; but such exposure levels were generally well-contained as a result of banks’ prudent credit risk management over the years, and the overall asset quality of the banking sector remained sound.\n\nWhat caught most market players by surprise in 2023 was unquestionably the banking turmoil in the US spilling over to Europe, which created a level of system-wide banking stress unseen since the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. The HKMA remained on high alert as the situation unfolded and took a number of precautionary actions to limit any potential adverse spillover effects on confidence in the local banking and financial systems. This, coupled with the strong capital and liquidity buffers maintained by banks in Hong Kong, meant that our banking sector was largely unaffected by the turmoil, remaining resilient even as the global financial markets were roiled. In the aftermath of this episode, the HKMA conducted a comprehensive internal review with a view to drawing out lessons for the local banking sector and strengthening the HKMA’s supervisory effectiveness and agility to handle a banking crisis should one occur.\n\nWhile prudent credit risk management is important, we have always reiterated our supervisory expectation for banks to be mindful of the need to support the real economy. As the orderly exit from the banking sector’s Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme commenced in July 2023 with the economic effects of COVID-19 receding, the HKMA worked closely with banks to ensure a gradual and smooth transition to normal loan repayment with flexibility for those borrowers who continued to be under pressure. Earlier this year, recognising that some small and medium-sized enterprises are still facing challenges in their operations despite the end of the pandemic, nine new measures were rolled out to further assist them in obtaining financing from banks.\n\nHaving reviewed the risks associated with the local property market in the context of banks’ property lending, the HKMA announced in July 2023 the first relaxation of the countercyclical macroprudential measures for residential properties since their introduction in 2009. This relaxation increased the loan-to-value ratio cap for most residential mortgage loans as well as for financing for property development and investment. It was later followed by suspension of the interest rate stress testing requirement in early 2024.\n\nThe HKMA’s supervision of financial institutions has been moving with the times. With recent years having seen a sharp global increase in fraud cases, we have considerably stepped up our efforts to counter new fraud tactics by introducing a holistic set of measures to protect bank customers. These include enhancing information sharing between banks and with law enforcement agencies; strengthening the monitoring of suspicious transactions (including implementation of real-time fraud monitoring and tightened payment card authentication); empowering customers to have more controls on their payment cards; and educating customers and raising public awareness of frauds with the launch of the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter, as well as a pre-transaction alert mechanism which warns users if a higher-risk Faster Payment System (FPS) transaction is spotted.\n\nIn light of a proliferation of innovative and digital banking products and services, the HKMA has worked with the banking industry to step up consumer and investor protection more broadly and enhance the banks’ operational and cyber resilience, as well as their collective defences against systemic cyber events. At the same time, all major banks have considerably strengthened their capabilities to respond to, and recover from, destructive ransomware attacks. The HKMA together with the industry has also pursued various consumer data infrastructure projects, such as the “Credit Data Smart” pilot programme to enhance consumer credit reference services, and taken forward a cross-boundary credit reference initiative to facilitate crossboundary financing activities by corporates.\n\nFintech and digitalisation can bring about enormous opportunities when the risk is properly managed. Leveraging earlier success in facilitating the uptake of Regtech, the HKMA, with the support of the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Insurance Authority, published a new Fintech Promotion Roadmap in August 2023 to promote further development of fintech by financial institutions in five focus areas — Wealthtech, Insurtech, Greentech, artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology. We anticipate local regulators continuing to collaborate and work closely together with their industry sectors in the coming years in order for the Hong Kong financial industry as a whole to keep abreast and reap the benefits of dynamic fintech development.\n\n# Hong Kong as an IFC — The centre of action and innovation\n\nIn 2023, we fully emerged from the pandemic. Hong Kong was not only back in business but its position as one of the world’s leading IFCs was further underscored by the return of global investors and our strengthened global network. Domestically, we took the opportunity of the 30th anniversary of the HKMA’s establishment to host a series of large-scale, international events with top-level participation from the global financial and banking community to demonstrate Hong Kong’s vibrancy and to send a clear message that Hong Kong as an IFC remained relevant and indispensable to global investors and financial institutions seeking growth and innovation. Of particular note was the return of the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit, held in November, which attracted to our city more than 350 international and regional leaders from some 160 global financial institutions. Other high-powered events hosted in Hong Kong included a meeting of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) and two HKMA-BIS Conferences which were among the largest gatherings of central bank governors and banking supervisors of the year. These events attest to the global financial sector’s commitment to and confidence in Hong Kong.\n\nExternally, 2023 was also a year in which Hong Kong proactively reached out to strengthen its connections with traditional markets including the US and Europe, as well as new destinations such as those in the Middle East. We met with peer regulators and top management of global financial institutions in these markets to both apprise and update them on the opportunities in Hong Kong and the Mainland, while seeking out new collaboration opportunities for Hong Kong.\n\nTo complement these engagement efforts, we actively contributed to the work of international and regional forums by taking up certain leadership roles. During the year, I accepted invitations to chair the BIS Meeting of Governors from Major Emerging Market Economies and to co-chair the Financial Stability Board (FSB)’s Regional Consultative Group for Asia. My colleagues are also chairing or co-chairing a number of other important groupings under the Basel Committee, the Financial Action Task Force, and the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks, to name a few. The HKMA’s leadership at many regional and international forums is a recognition of Hong Kong’s expertise and contribution to international central banking and regulatory efforts in the pursuit of global monetary and financial stability, as well as Hong Kong’s importance as an IFC.\n\nTo build on the above accomplishments, we must position ourselves as a forward-looking IFC, staying ahead of the curve to ensure our ongoing competitiveness. We have identified three long-term trends in the coming years that will shape our future: namely the continued opening-up of the Mainland, the development of green and sustainable finance and the deployment of fintech. We will continue to support the development of our financial markets to capture the opportunities from these long-term trends while positioning our financial platform to provide leading services to attract more businesses to Hong Kong.

{"en": "# Highlights of 2023\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nDespite a challenging external environment, the Hong Kong economy stages a positive growth in 2023, driven by revivals in inbound tourism and domestic demand. The labour market continues to improve alongside the economic recovery, while inflation remains moderate. Economic activities for 2024 are expected to recover further at a moderate pace, although the outlook is clouded by multiple external uncertainties.\n\nThe banking sector in Hong Kong remains sound in 2023, supported by strong capital and liquidity buffers. Asset quality remains at a healthy level.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nAmid market expectations of a “high for longer” US policy rate, the Hong Kong dollar mostly trades on the weak side of the Convertibility Zone in 2023, with the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking being triggered eight times between mid-February and early May. The Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets remain stable, and continue to trade in a smooth and orderly manner.\n\n2023 marks the 40th anniversary of the Linked Exchange Rate System. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, the Linked Exchange Rate System has helped Hong Kong weather a succession of shocks and crises in the past four decades, demonstrating the system’s resilience and robustness.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA responds swiftly to the March banking turmoil in the US and Europe — from managing the ripple effects to completing an internal review drawing lessons for the local banking sector, while maintaining its focus on the credit, liquidity and market risk management of banks. In light of escalating cyber threats and increasing use of technology services provided by third parties, the HKMA also works closely with banks to enhance their operational and cyber resilience.\n\nThe HKMA enhances consumer protection on payment cards, and through further revision of the Code of Banking Practice as well as the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter. The HKMA works with fellow regulators on a balanced regulatory regime for virtual asset-related activities, streamlines the selling process for sophisticated professional investors, introduces enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Pilot Scheme, and commences supervision of trust business. A pilot programme on consumer credit reference services under “Credit Data Smart” is also launched.\n\nThe HKMA’s efforts in anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism reflect a commitment to targeting the highest threats under a risk-based approach. To address increasing digital fraud, the HKMA has strengthened ecosystem collaboration through the launch of real-time fraud monitoring, enhanced information sharing between banks and with law enforcement agencies, intensified public education, and launched a new pre-transaction alert mechanism when using the Faster Payment System. In parallel, supervisory technology capabilities have been advanced through the Macro Analytics pilot scheme.\n\nThe HKMA makes good progress on implementing international supervisory standards locally, including those on capital adequacy and disclosure, and makes notable efforts in enhancing capacity building in the banking sector.\n\nThe HKMA also advances its work to ensure a credible resolution regime, including developing a new resolution standard on accessing critical financial market infrastructures, and completing a review on the implementation of loss-absorbing capacity policy standards.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\nThe successful conclusion of the second Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit and the HKMA-BIS High-Level Conference demonstrates the global financial sector’s commitment to and confidence in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA works closely with its Mainland and Hong Kong counterparts to deepen and widen the mutual access between the Hong Kong and Mainland financial markets. This includes enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Scheme, designation of additional market makers for Southbound Trading under Bond Connect, the successful launch of Northbound Trading of Swap Connect, and the roll-out of the HKD-RMB Dual Counter Model and the Dual Counter Market Making Programme, all of which are effective in solidifying Hong Kong’s status as a global hub for offshore renminbi business.\n\nOn strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, notable progress is made in areas including bond issuance, asset and wealth management, green and sustainable finance, and corporate treasury centres.\n\nThe HKMA continues to make significant progress on various fronts of the “Fintech 2025” strategy. Project mBridge enters the Minimum Viable Product development phase, Phase 1 of the e-HKD Pilot Programme is completed, and Commercial Data Interchange sees increasing usage and the successful linkage with Government data source. Moreover, a new Fintech Promotion Roadmap is announced to further develop Wealthtech, Insurtech, Greentech, artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology in the banking sector. Meanwhile, the Faster Payment System marks its fifth anniversary and continues to see expanded adoption and enhancements including new functionalities like the linkage with Thailand’s PromptPay for cross-border QR payment. Significant progress is also made in relation to developing a regulatory regime for stablecoin issuers, with a public consultation paper published for gathering views on the legislative proposal.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\nDespite a volatile and challenging investment environment, the Exchange Fund manages to achieve a decent investment income of HK$226.0 billion, representing an investment return of 5.5%.\n\nThe HKMA continues its efforts on asset diversification and responsible investing.

{"en": "# Priorities for 2024 and Beyond\n\nEntering 2024, the Hong Kong economy is expected to continue to recover at a moderate pace, riding on the ongoing revival of inbound tourism, public infrastructure projects and stable private consumption. However, the external environment is fraught with risks and uncertainties, especially those relating to the future US policy rate path, the global growth prospects, and the evolving geopolitical tensions. That said, Hong Kong’s financial system remains well-positioned to weather adverse shocks given its resilience and ample buffers built up over the years.\n\nThe HKMA attaches great importance to safeguarding Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. Looking ahead, we will stay vigilant in the face of the uncertain macroeconomic environment, seeking to promptly identify emerging risks and respond to them in an agile manner. At the same time, we will seek opportunities and create policy headroom to help further enhance Hong Kong’s status as a leading international financial centre. In managing the Exchange Fund in this challenging investment environment, we will continue to invest prudently, while remaining flexible, taking defensive measures as appropriate, and maintaining a high degree of liquidity.\n\n# Stability and integrity of the financial system\n\nThe global economic uncertainties of recent years look set to continue in 2024. The HKMA will keep abreast of latest developments and stay vigilant against potential risks, with the aim of upholding the resilience and stability of the financial system, which are essential for the ongoing provision of critical financial services that support the functioning of the Hong Kong economy.\n\n# Staying vigilant against potential risks\n\nLooking into 2024, global financial markets could experience volatility as a result of uncertainties surrounding the US monetary policy outlook, evolving geopolitical risks, and an uneven global economic recovery. 2024 is also a key election year as many major elections are scheduled to be held across the world. The outcome of these elections could further increase market uncertainties. Nevertheless, Hong Kong’s financial system is well-positioned to withstand adverse shocks given its resilience and buffers built up over the years. The HKMA also has the capability, the resources and the commitment to safeguard Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nThe HKMA will continue its efforts to closely monitor any risks and vulnerabilities arising in the domestic and external environments, and will deploy appropriate measures where necessary to maintain Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. We will also conduct research into issues affecting the Hong Kong economy, assessing and addressing any potential risks associated with these issues.\n\n# Maintaining banking stability\n\nIn 2023, new geopolitical tensions across the world broke out while others remained unresolved, contributing to political uncertainty and instability that looks set to continue into 2024. Economic pressures in the form of high interest rates were a feature of the global landscape, and rates remain high entering 2024. Within the banking sector, the continued drive towards digitalisation and the implementation of new technology, including artificial intelligence, have brought many advantages but are also posing new operational and cyber security risks as well as supervisory challenges. In such a volatile political, economic and technological landscape, the HKMA strives to ensure banks’ ability to withstand shocks through its ongoing supervisory efforts. At the same time, we will continue to enhance and refine our banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account technological developments, changes in customer expectations, as well as international standards and best practices.\n\n# A risk-based supervisory focus\n\n# Credit, liquidity and market risks\n\nIn light of the increasingly challenging macroeconomic landscape, a special focus of the HKMA will be on monitoring the asset quality of authorized institutions (AIs) and assessing the effectiveness of their credit risk management and controls, particularly with respect to loan classification and provisioning practices and problem loans management. We will also maintain close dialogue with the banking and commercial sectors with a view to ensuring that AIs are striking an appropriate balance between undertaking prudent credit risk management and fulfilling their financial intermediation function throughout economic cycles. In particular, we will follow up with banks through the Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism on the nine new measures rolled out in March 2024 to assist small and medium-sized enterprises in obtaining financing from banks.\n\nUncertainties in the global economic outlook as well as elevated geopolitical tensions may increase the volatility of both asset prices and cross-border fund flows. The HKMA will make vigilance a priority, and will continue to effectively supervise the liquidity and market risk management of AIs.\n\n# Follow-up actions on lessons drawn from the 2023 banking turmoil\n\nThe HKMA will implement the follow-up actions identified in the internal review that it undertook in response to the 2023 banking turmoil in the US and Europe. These are actions that will further strengthen supervisory effectiveness and enhance its ability to handle a banking crisis should one arise. They include enhancing the risk capture of AIs’ interest rate risk in the banking book in the context of the HKMA’s supervisory review process, improving the preparedness of AIs for dealing with liquidity stresses given the continuing digitalisation of banking services, streamlining the HKMA’s crisis management processes, and further enhancing interagency and cross-border supervisory co-ordination.\n\n# Operational and technology risk\n\nThe HKMA will continue to monitor AIs’ progress towards achieving full compliance with the HKMA Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module OR-2 on “Operational Resilience”, and assess and benchmark banks’ tolerance limits for plausible disruptions, with a view to enhancing the overall resilience of the banking system. With respect to cyber risk, we will oversee a new round of self-assessments by AIs under the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 and monitor AIs’ implementation of a secure tertiary data backup to enhance their data recovery capabilities if faced with destructive cyber attacks.\n\nGiven the accelerating pace of digitalisation in banking operations, the HKMA will keep a close watch on emerging risks arising from the use of advanced technologies such as generative artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology. We will also collaborate with banks and other relevant stakeholders in operating an agile and pre-emptive mechanism to counter the growing trend of digital fraud.\n\n# Combatting money laundering and terrorist financing\n\nIn 2024, to uphold the integrity of the banking system and build customer confidence, the HKMA will target high-risk areas and prioritise risk-based regulatory updates, including issuing guidance to support an effective, risk-based implementation of changes to requirements for politically exposed persons, and supporting the implementation of the regulatory regime for stablecoin issuers. We will also issue guidance to help AIs optimise their transaction monitoring systems and to promote the responsible use of artificial intelligence, and focus on controls targeting high-end money laundering through our thematic work. To strengthen the ecosystem response to digital fraud and reduce losses to victims, we will further consult the public and the industry on a proposal to expand the scope of bank-to-bank information sharing from corporate accounts to personal accounts and, based on the feedback received, pursue necessary legislative amendments. We will move to a full build of Macro Analytics 3.0 by pooling data relevant to anti-money laundering across multiple banks and interfacing this with existing ecosystem fraud analysis. This will deliver more rapid cross-bank responses and further enhance our datadriven anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism supervision, enabling us to take quicker, more decisive action against systemic money laundering and terrorist financing risks.\n\n# Wealth management and Mandatory Provident Fundrelated businesses\n\nIn 2024, the HKMA will step up both its on-site examinations and off-site surveillance of AIs’ conduct in relation to wealth management and the selling of securities, investment products, and insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses. More specifically, we will focus on Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) business, digital distribution and advisory platforms, virtual asset (VA)-related products, long term insurance products and premium financing activities, taking into account the latest market developments as well as evolving international standards.\n\nThe HKMA will communicate closely with fellow regulators and the banking industry to provide guidance on regulatory standards in relation to the sale of investment, insurance and MPF products as appropriate. In particular, to support the sustainable and responsible development of the VA sector, we will continue to work with the Government and fellow regulators to ensure that the regulatory regime in place for the VA sector is robust, comprehensive and well-balanced.\n\nThe HKMA will facilitate and monitor the industry’s implementation of enhancements to Cross-boundary WMC, and continue to engage with the industry and relevant regulatory authorities in order to further enhance the scheme. We will also continue to work with fellow regulators and the industry to streamline the selling process for investment products, and will consolidate and clarify guidance, as appropriate, to facilitate industry compliance. In addition to trust business, we will also commence the supervision of new Type 13 regulated activity under the Securities and Futures Ordinance for AIs providing depositary services for collective investment schemes authorised by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), which will come into operation on 2 October 2024.\n\n# Oversight of financial market infrastructures\n\nThe HKMA aims to promote the safety and efficiency of the financial market infrastructures (FMIs) under its oversight in accordance with the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO), the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMI) and the various guidance issued by the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI). We will continue to participate in the CPMI-IOSCO1 PFMI implementation monitoring and assessment exercise, and in other international working groups to discuss the implementation of new and innovative FMI-related initiatives. We will also participate in the work of international standard-setting bodies, and will review and strengthen our oversight requirements as appropriate to reflect the latest international practices as well as market and technology developments.\n\n# Policy development\n\nThe HKMA will continue to strengthen and refine its banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account international standards and best practices.\n\n# Implementation of Basel standards in Hong Kong\n\nThe proposed amendments to the Banking (Capital) Rules (BCR) and the Banking (Disclosure) Rules (BDR) for implementing the Basel III final reform package (Final Package) are expected to take effect on 1 January 2025 following the passage of the amended Rules in the Legislative Council. In 2024, the HKMA will continue to prepare the supporting guidance, banking returns and standard disclosure templates and tables needed to facilitate the application of the Rules. In particular, we plan to:\n- consult the industry in the second quarter of 2024 on the revisions to the SPM module CA-B-3 on “Countercyclical Capital Buffer (CCyB)–Geographic Allocation of Private Sector Credit Exposures” and Return MA(BS)25 “Quarterly reporting on the Countercyclical Capital Buffer”, reflecting the consequential changes arising from the implementation of the Final Package and the revised Return of International Banking Statistics; and\n- finalise the package for effecting the reporting-only requirement for the new standards on market and credit valuation adjustment risks, which starts on 1 July 2024.\n\nThose parts of the proposed amendments to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules (BELR) and the Banking (Liquidity) Rules (BLR) that are largely consequential to the implementation of the Final Package under the amended BCR are also targeted to take effect on 1 January 2025. The HKMA plans to finalise the proposed consequential amendments to the related regulatory returns in 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, with a new standard on the prudential treatment of banks’ crypto-asset exposures and subsequent targeted revisions to the standard having been issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December 2022 and December 2023 respectively, local implementation of the standard is planned for 2025. The HKMA will examine the need for potential legislative amendments to various sets of rules, including the BCR, the BDR, the BELR and the BLR, and conduct the statutory consultation on the necessary rule amendments in the first half of 2025.\n\n# Other supervisory policies and risk management guidelines\n\nThe HKMA plans to update a number of SPM modules in response to lessons learned from the banking turmoil in the US and Europe of March 2023, as well as developments in regulatory requirements and international standards. These modules include:\n", "zh": "2024年及未來的優先事項\n\n邁入2024年，香港經濟預計將持續適度復甦，依托入境旅遊的持續復蘇、公共基建項目以及穩定的私人消費。然而，外部環境充滿風險與不確定性，尤其涉及未來美國政策利率走向、全球增長前景以及不斷演變的地緣政治緊張局勢。儘管如此，香港的金融體系仍具備良好的抗 shocks 能力，得益於多年的韌性與充足的緩衝。\n\n香港金融管理局十分重視維護香港的貨幣與金融穩定。展望未來，我們將保持警覺，面對不確定的宏觀經濟環境，力求及時發現新興風險並靈活應對。同時，我們也將積極尋找機遇，創造政策空間，進一步提升香港作為國際金融中心的地位。在管理這一充滿挑戰的投資環境下，我們將繼續審慎投資，同時保持彈性，採取適當的防禦措施，並維持較高的流動性。\n\n# 金融系統的穩定與完整性\n\n近年來的全球經濟不確定性預計將在2024年持續存在。香港金融管理局將密切跟蹤最新動態，保持警覺，以保障金融體系的韌性與穩定，這對於持續提供支撐香港經濟運作的關鍵金融服務至關重要。\n\n# 謹慎應對潛在風險\n\n展望2024年，由於美國貨幣政策展望的不確定性、地緣政治風險的演變以及全球經濟復甦的不均衡，全球金融市場可能出現波動。2024年也是一個重要的選舉年，全球多個重大選舉將相繼舉行，其結果或將進一步增加市場的不確定性。不過，考慮到香港金融體系多年來累積的韌性與緩衝，仍有能力承受不利 shocks。香港金融管理局亦具備相應的能力、資源和決心，以保障香港的貨幣及金融穩定。\n\n我們將繼續密切監測國內外環境中出現的風險與脆弱點，並在必要時採取適當措施，以維持香港的貨幣與金融穩定。我們亦將進行相關研究，評估並應對與香港經濟相關的潛在風險。\n\n# 維持銀行業穩定\n\n2023年，全球多地爆發新一輪地緣政治緊張局勢，部分局勢仍未解決，造成政治不確定性與動盪，預計此趨勢將延續至2024年。高利率的經濟壓力亦是全球格局的重要特徵，2024年利率仍然偏高。在銀行業方面，數位化的持續推進與新技術（包括人工智能）的實施帶來諸多優勢，但也引發了新的營運與網絡安全風險，以及監管挑戰。在如此易變的政治、經濟與科技環境下，香港金融管理局致力於確保銀行在面對 shocks 時具有韌性，這將透過我們持續的監管工作來實現。同時，我們將不斷完善和優化銀行監管與監理框架和政策，並考慮技術發展、客戶期待的變化，以及國際標準與最佳實踐。\n\n# 以風險為本的監管重點\n\n# 信貸、流動性及市場風險\n\n在宏觀經濟形势日益嚴峻的背景下，香港金融管理局將特別關注授權機構（AIs）的資產質素監測，並評估其信貸風險管理與控制的有效性，尤其是在貸款分類、撥備實踐及不良貸款管理方面。我們亦將與銀行及商業部門保持密切對話，以確保AIs在經濟周期內在謹慎信貸風險管理與履行金融中介職能之間達到適當平衡。特別是，我們會通過銀行業小型企業貸款協調機制，就2024年3月推出的九項新措施，跟進小微企業獲取銀行融資的相關事宜。\n\n全球經濟展望的不確定性及地緣政治緊張局勢升高，可能會加劇資產價格與跨境資金流的波動性。香港金融管理局將將保持警覺作為首要任務，並持續有效監管AIs的流動性與市場風險管理。\n\n# 應對2023年銀行動盪經驗的後續行動\n\n香港金融管理局將推行其內部審查中所制定的後續措施，以應對2023年在美國與歐洲爆發的銀行動盪事件，這些措施將進一步強化監管效率，增強其應對銀行危機的能力，包括在監管審查過程中提升對銀行利率風險的識別、改善AIs在持續數字化銀行服務背景下的流動性壓力應對能力、精簡危機管理流程，以及加強不同機構間及跨境監管合作。\n\n# 營運與科技風險\n\n香港金融管理局將持續監測AIs在全面符合《監管政策手冊》（SPM）有關“營運韌性”模組OR-2的進展，並評估及比較銀行面對合理 disrupted（中斷）情況的容忍度，以提升整體銀行系統的韌性。在網絡風險方面，我們將監督AIs進行的新版網絡韌性評估框架（Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0）自我評定，並推動其實施安全的三級數據備份措施，以增強在遭遇破壞性網絡攻擊時的數據恢復能力。\n\n鑑於銀行營運數字化的提速，我們將密切關注諸如生成式人工智能、分佈式帳本技術等新興科技引發的風險。我們亦將與銀行及其他相關持份者合作，建立一個敏捷且具前瞻性的機制，以應對日益增長的數位詐騙趨勢。\n\n# 打擊洗錢及恐怖融資\n\n2024年，為維護銀行體系的完整性與增強客戶信心，香港金融管理局將聚焦高風險領域，並優先推動風險為本的監管措施，包括發布指南以支持政治暴露人士（PEPs）相關規定的有效、風險為本的實施，及配合穩定幣發行者的監管制度落實。我們亦將提供指引，協助AIs優化交易監控系統，推動人工智能的負責任使用，並透過專題工作重點針對高端洗錢行為設置控制措施。為應對數位詐騙並減少受害者損失，我們將進一步徵詢公眾及業界意見，擬定擴大銀行間資訊共享範圍（由企業帳戶擴展至個人帳戶）的方案，並根據反饋完成必要的立法修訂。同時，我們將整合來自多家銀行的反洗錢相關數據，建立宏觀分析平台（Macro Analytics 3.0），促進更快速的跨行反應，進一步強化數據驅動的反洗錢與反恐怖融資監管能力，使我們能夠更迅速、更果斷地應對系統性洗錢與恐怖融資風險。\n\n# 財富管理及強制性公積金事業\n\n2024年，香港金融管理局將加強對AIs在財富管理、證券、投資產品、保險及強積金（MPF）相關業務的現場審查及非現場監督。特別是，我們將重點關注跨境財富管理（Cross-boundary WMC）、數位分銷與諮詢平台、虛擬資產（VA）相關產品、長期保障產品及保費融資等範疇，並考慮最新市場動向及國際標準的演變。\n\n我們將與其他監管機構及行業保持密切溝通，適當提供有關投資、保險與MPF產品銷售的監管指引。為支持虛擬資產行業的可持續與責任發展，我們會與政府及其他監管機構合作，確保虛擬資產監管制度完整、強健且平衡。\n\n我們將協助並監督相關行業落實Cross-boundary WMC的改進措施，並繼續與行業及相關監管部門合作，推動計劃的進一步完善。我們亦會與其他監管機構共同努力，簡化投資產品的銷售流程，並在適當情況下完善指引，以促進行業合規。此外，我們將展開對由證監會（SFC）授權的集體投資計劃存放服務銀行新型第13類受規管活動（Type 13）的監管，該項監管將於2024年10月2日正式啟動。\n\n# 金融市場基礎設施的監管\n\n香港金融管理局致力於促進其監管範圍內金融市場基礎設施（FMIs）的安全與效率，依據《支付系統及支付儲值設施條例》（PSSVFO）、《金融市場基礎設施原則》（PFMI）以及支付與市場基礎設施委員會（CPMI）所發布的各項指引。我們將繼續參與CPMI-IOSCO的PFMI實施監測與評估工作，以及討論新穎創新的FMI相關倡議。同時，我們亦將參與國際標準制定組織，並視乎最新國際慣例、市場及科技發展，重新檢視並強化我們的監管要求。\n\n# 政策制定\n\n香港金融管理局將持續優化並完善其銀行監管與政策框架，參考國際標準與最佳實踐。\n\n# 對巴塞爾協議標準的落實\n\n預期在2025年1月1日，香港將通過立法會審議並通過修訂《銀行（資本）規則》（BCR）與《銀行（披露）規則》（BDR），以落實巴塞爾III最終改革方案（Final Package）。2024年，香港金融管理局將持續準備相關指引、銀行申報表格與標準披露模板，以協助申請執行新規則。具體而言，預計：\n- 在2024年第二季度，徵詢行業意見，修訂SPM模組CA-B-3“反周期資本緩衝（CCyB）——私營部門信貸曝險的地理分配”與申報表MA(BS)25“有關反周期資本緩衝的季度報告”，反映Final Package及國際銀行統計申報表修訂帶來的變化；\n- 敲定新標準下的市場與信用估值調節風險申報要求，並於2024年7月1日實施。\n\n此外，與巴塞爾銀行監管委員會於2022年12月及2023年12月分別發布的，關於銀行加密資產曝險的審慎處理標準相關的規定，也預計於2025年在本地進行落實。香港金融管理局將檢討立法修訂的必要性，並在2025年上半年進行相關規則的法定諮詢。\n\n# 其他監管政策與風險管理指引\n\n香港金融管理局計劃根據2023年3月在美國與歐洲爆發的銀行動盪事件中吸取的教訓，以及監管要求和國際標準的最新進展，更新多個《監管政策手冊》模組。"}
{"en": "# About the HKMA\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is Hong Kong’s central banking institution. The HKMA has four main functions:\n- maintaining currency stability within the framework of the Linked Exchange Rate System;\n- promoting the stability and integrity of the financial system, including the banking system;\n- helping to maintain Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre, including the maintenance and development of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure; and\n- managing the Exchange Fund.\n\n# HKMA’s legal mandate\n\nThe HKMA was established on 1 April 1993 after the Legislative Council passed amendments to the Exchange Fund Ordinance in 1992 empowering the Financial Secretary to appoint a Monetary Authority.\n\nThe powers, functions and responsibilities of the Monetary Authority are set out in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the Banking Ordinance, the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance, the Deposit Protection Scheme Ordinance, the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, and other relevant Ordinances. The division of functions and responsibilities in monetary and financial affairs between the Financial Secretary and the Monetary Authority is set out in an exchange of letters dated 25 June 2003. The exchange of letters discloses delegations made by the Financial Secretary to the Monetary Authority. The letters are public documents and can be found on the HKMA website.\n\nThe Exchange Fund Ordinance establishes the Exchange Fund under the control of the Financial Secretary. According to the Ordinance, the Fund shall be used primarily for affecting the exchange value of the Hong Kong dollar. It may also be used (whilst having regard to its primary purpose) for maintaining the stability and integrity of the monetary and financial systems of Hong Kong, with a view to maintaining Hong Kong as an international financial centre.\n\nThe Monetary Authority is appointed under the Exchange Fund Ordinance to assist the Financial Secretary in performing his functions under the Exchange Fund Ordinance and to perform such other functions as are assigned by other Ordinances or by the Financial Secretary. The office of the Monetary Authority is known as the HKMA, and the Monetary Authority is the Chief Executive of the HKMA.\n\nThe Banking Ordinance provides the Monetary Authority with the responsibility and powers for regulating and supervising banking business and the business of taking deposits. Under the Ordinance, the Monetary Authority is responsible for the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong.\n\nThe Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance provides that the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for banking sector entities. The Monetary Authority is vested with a range of powers to effect the orderly resolution of a non-viable banking sector entity (the failure of which could pose systemic risk). The purpose is to maintain financial stability, while seeking to protect public funds.\n\nThe Securities and Futures Ordinance and the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Ordinance provide certain powers to the Monetary Authority regarding the securities and mandatory provident fund businesses of banks.\n\nThe Monetary Authority has been delegated with powers of inspection and investigation by the Insurance Authority under the Insurance Ordinance in relation to the insurance related businesses of banks.\n\nThe Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance empowers the Monetary Authority to supervise banks’ compliance with the customer due diligence and record-keeping requirements under the Ordinance.\n\nThe Deposit Protection Scheme Ordinance confers responsibility on the Monetary Authority to assist in the operation of the Deposit Protection Scheme and to trigger payment of compensation from the Deposit Protection Scheme Fund to depositors of a failed licensed bank.\n\nThe Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance provides a statutory regime for the Monetary Authority to designate and oversee certain significant clearing and settlement systems and retail payment systems operating in Hong Kong. It also empowers the Monetary Authority to administer a licensing regime for electronic and physical “facilities”, which are used to store monetary value and which meet the criteria specified in the Ordinance.", "zh": "# 關於香港金融管理局\n\n香港金融管理局是香港的中央銀行機構。香港金融管理局有四個主要職能：\n- 在聯繫匯率制度框架下維持貨幣穩定；\n- 促進金融體系的穩定與完整，包括銀行系統；\n- 協助維持香港作為國際金融中心的地位，包括維護及發展香港的金融基礎設施；\n- 管理外匯基金。\n\n# 香港金融管理局的法律授權\n\n香港金融管理局於1993年4月1日成立，此前立法會於1992年通過修訂《外匯基金條例》，授權財政司司長委任貨幣當局。\n\n貨幣當局的權力、職能和責任載於《外匯基金條例》、《銀行條例》、《金融機構（償付）條例》、《存款保障計劃條例》、《支付系統及積蓄值設施條例》及其他相關條例。財政司司長與貨幣當局之間在貨幣與金融事務方面的職能分工，載於2003年6月25日的信件交換。該信件披露了財政司司長對貨幣當局的授權。這些信件屬公開文件，可在香港金融管理局網站查閱。\n\n《外匯基金條例》設立了由財政司司長控制的外匯基金。根據條例，該基金主要用於影響港元的匯率，也可在考慮其主要用途的同時，用於維持香港貨幣和金融系統的穩定與完整，以維持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。\n\n貨幣當局根據《外匯基金條例》被任命，協助財政司司長履行其條例下的職能，並執行其他由其他條例或財政司司長指派的職能。貨幣當局的辦公室稱為香港金融管理局（HKMA），貨幣當局即為HKMA的行政長官。\n\n《銀行條例》賦予貨幣當局監管和督導銀行業務及吸收存款業務的責任與權力。根據此條例，貨幣當局負責核准持牌銀行、有限牌照銀行及存款公司在香港的營運。\n\n《金融機構（償付）條例》規定貨幣當局是銀行業的償付主管機關，擁有一系列措施，以有序解決不具備持續經營能力的銀行業者（其倒閉可能構成系統性風險）。其目的是維持金融穩定，同時力求保護公眾資金。\n\n《證券及期貨條例》及《強制性公積金計劃條例》賦予貨幣當局就銀行的證券及強積金業務行使一定權力。\n\n根據《保險條例》，香港保險監管局授予貨幣當局對銀行相關保險業務進行檢查與調查的權力。\n\n《反洗錢及打擊恐怖分子資金籌集條例》賦予貨幣當局監督銀行遵守該條例下的客戶盡職審查與記錄保存要求。\n\n《存款保障計劃條例》責成貨幣當局協助運作存款保障計劃，並在一家持牌銀行倒閉時啟動存款保障基金向存款人支付賠償。\n\n《支付系統及積蓄值設施條例》為貨幣當局提供法定制度，授權其指定及監管某些重要的清算與結算系統及零售支付系統在香港的運作，並賦予貨幣當局管理電子及實體“設施”發放牌照，這些設施用於存儲貨幣價值且符合條例中的標準。"}
{"en": "# Corporate Governance\n\nAs Hong Kong’s central banking institution, the HKMA is committed to high standards of corporate governance, as good governance is crucial in maintaining and safeguarding the trust and confidence of the public in the HKMA to fulfil its statutory mandate.\n\nTo achieve its commitment to good corporate governance, the HKMA:\n- puts in place a well-defined governance structure with a high degree of accountability;\n- exercises robust controls to manage risks and ensure that staff behaviours at all levels and its day-to-day operations are consistent with specified standards; and\n- pursues a policy of high transparency and accessibility, and keeps close contacts with stakeholders.\n\n# The HKMA and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government\n\nThe HKMA is an integral part of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government, but is able to employ staff on terms different from those of the civil service in order to attract personnel of the right experience and expertise. The Chief Executive of the HKMA and his staff are public officers. In its day-to-day work, the HKMA operates with a high degree of autonomy within the relevant statutory powers conferred upon, or delegated to, the Monetary Authority.\n\nThe Financial Secretary is responsible for determining the monetary policy objective and the structure of the monetary system of Hong Kong: a letter from the Financial Secretary to the Monetary Authority dated 25 June 2003 specifies that these should be currency stability defined as a stable exchange value at around HK$7.80 to one US dollar maintained by Currency Board arrangements. The Monetary Authority is on his own responsible for achieving the monetary policy objective, including determining the strategy, instruments and operational means for doing so. The Monetary Authority also has responsibilities in relation to the maintenance of the stability and integrity of the monetary system of Hong Kong.\n\nThe Financial Secretary, assisted by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, has responsibility for policies for maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s financial system and the status of Hong Kong as an international financial centre. In support of these policies, the Monetary Authority’s responsibilities include:\n- promoting the general stability and effective working of the banking system;\n- promoting the development of the debt market, in co-operation with other relevant bodies;\n- matters relating to the issuance and circulation of legal tender notes and coins;\n- promoting the safety and efficiency of the financial infrastructure through the development of payment, clearing and settlement systems and, where appropriate, the operation of these systems; and\n- seeking to promote, in co-operation with other relevant bodies, confidence in Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems, and market development initiatives to help strengthen the international competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial services.\n\nThe Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary. The Monetary Authority, under delegation from the Financial Secretary, is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the use of the Exchange Fund, and for the investment management of the Fund.\n\n# Accountability and transparency\n\nThe autonomy given to the HKMA in its day-to-day operations, and in the methods it uses to pursue policy objectives determined by the Government, is complemented by a high degree of accountability and transparency.\n\nThe HKMA serves Hong Kong by promoting monetary and banking stability, by managing the official reserves effectively, and by developing and overseeing a robust and diverse financial infrastructure. These processes help to strengthen Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre and to foster Hong Kong’s economic well-being.\n\nThe HKMA must have the confidence of the community if it is to perform its duties well. The HKMA therefore takes seriously the duty of explaining its policies and work to the general public and makes every effort to address any concerns within the community relevant to the HKMA’s responsibilities. In particular, the HKMA makes timely clarifications on misinformation and rumours about the HKMA’s policies via traditional and social media.\n\nThe HKMA is accountable to the people of Hong Kong through the Financial Secretary, who appoints the Monetary Authority, and through the laws passed by the Legislative Council that set out the Monetary Authority’s powers and responsibilities. The HKMA also recognises a broader responsibility to promote a better understanding of its roles and objectives and to keep itself informed of community concerns. In its day-to-day operations and in its wider contacts with the community, the HKMA pursues a policy of transparency and accessibility. This policy has two main objectives:\n- to keep the financial industry and the public as fully informed about the work of the HKMA as possible, subject to considerations of market sensitivity, commercial confidentiality and statutory restrictions on disclosure of confidential information; and\n- to ensure that the HKMA is in touch with, and responsive to, the community it serves.\n\nThe HKMA seeks to follow international best practices in its transparency arrangements. It maintains extensive relations with the mass media and produces a range of regular and special publications in both English and Chinese. The HKMA’s bilingual website (www.hkma.gov.hk) carries a large number of HKMA publications, press releases, speeches and presentations, in addition to dedicated sections on research, statistics, regulatory resources, consumer information and other topics. Social media platforms are also used to communicate with the public more efficiently in the digital era. The HKMA maintains an Information Centre at its offices, consisting of a library and an exhibition area, which is open to the public six days a week. Further information on the HKMA’s work on public communications and engagement is contained in the Corporate Functions chapter on pages 185 to 193.\n\nOver the years, the HKMA has progressively increased the detail and frequency of its disclosure of information on the Exchange Fund and Currency Board Accounts. Since 1999, the HKMA has participated in the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard project for central banks. The HKMA publishes records of meetings of the Currency Board Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee and the reports on Currency Board operations. The supervisory policies and guidelines on banking have been published on the HKMA website since 1996.\n\nThe relations between the HKMA and the Legislative Council play an important part in promoting accountability and transparency. There is a formal commitment from the Chief Executive of the HKMA to appear before the Panel on Financial Affairs of the Legislative Council three times a year to brief Members and to answer questions on the HKMA’s work. Representatives from the HKMA attend Legislative Council panel and committee meetings from time to time to explain and discuss particular issues and to assist Members in their scrutiny of draft legislation.\n\n# Controls\n\nThe HKMA adopts robust internal and external control mechanisms to ensure that it upholds a high standard of staff conduct, prudent risk management as well as appropriate checks and balances. Internal and external audit functions provide independent assessment on the adequacy and effectiveness of the control mechanisms.\n\n# Code of Conduct\n\nA Code of Conduct, which provides guidance to staff on their ethical and legal responsibilities, is in place to ensure that staff behaviours are consistent with specified standards at all levels.\n\n# Internal controls\n\n# Operational controls\n\nAll departments and divisions have ownership and responsibility to identify and assess risks of their operational processes and put in place appropriate controls for ensuring proper day-to-day operations of the HKMA.

{"en": "# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nDespite a challenging external environment, the Hong Kong economy staged a positive growth in 2023, thanks to the revivals in inbound tourism and domestic demand. The labour market continued to improve alongside the economic recovery, while inflation remained moderate. Asset markets remained soft amid tightened financial conditions and weak market sentiment. Economic activities for 2024 are expected to recover further at a moderate pace, although the outlook is clouded by multiple external uncertainties.\n\n# The economy in review\n\n# Real activities\n\nHaving navigated through the severe challenges posed by the pandemic in the previous year, the Hong Kong economy grew steadily by 3.2% in 2023 (Table 1 and Chart 1). Domestically, private consumption recovered notably on the back of improved labour market conditions and various support initiatives introduced by the Government, such as the Consumption Voucher Scheme and a series of promotional campaigns. Despite tightened financial conditions, overall investment expenditure registered significant growth against a low base of comparison from the previous year. Externally, Hong Kong’s exports of services rebounded, due mainly to the robust revival of inbound tourism. However, their positive impact on growth was more than offset by the strong recovery in outbound tourism, which was measured as imports of services. On the other hand, exports of goods remained lacklustre amid weak external demand, and put a drag on Hong Kong’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth.\n\nChart 1 Real GDP growth by contribution\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\nTable 1 Real GDP growth by expenditure component (period-over-period)\nNote: The seasonally-adjusted quarter-on-quarter rates of change in the gross domestic fixed capital formation are not available.\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\n# Inflation\n\nLocal inflation remained moderate in 2023 as external price pressures gradually eased, while domestic cost pressures remained broadly in check despite rising slightly as the economy recovered (Chart 2)1. For 2023 as a whole, the underlying and headline inflation rates were 1.7% and 2.1% respectively.\n\n# Labour market\n\nLabour market conditions improved further in 2023, with the unemployment rate falling to a decade-low level of 2.8% in July and hovering at a low level for the remaining months of the year2 (Chart 3). Both labour demand and labour supply increased, as reflected respectively by the pick-up in total employment (Chart 3) and in the labour force. In view of Hong Kong’s manpower shortages, the Government rolled out various labour importation schemes3 and talent attraction initiatives4 in 2023. Meanwhile, with tight labour market conditions, the year-on-year growth rates of nominal wages and of labour earnings increased gradually towards their pre-pandemic levels.\n\nChart 2 Underlying consumer price inflation\n\nChart 3 Labour market conditions\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\n# Stock market\n\nAfter stabilising in early 2023, the local stock market turned sluggish in the second half. Extending its rebound in late 2022, the Hang Seng Index rose to a year-high daily close of 22,689 on 27 January 2023. It then retreated and dropped further to low levels by December (Chart 4), reflecting weak market sentiment due to the banking sector problems in the US and Switzerland in March, as well as weaker global economic prospects and tightened financial conditions in the second half. The Hang Seng Index closed the year at 17,047, down notably by 13.8% from the end of 2022, and marking the fourth consecutive year of decline.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market experienced a rebound in the first four months of 2023 on the back of the resumption of normalcy in the Mainland and Hong Kong, but softened subsequently alongside rising mortgage rates5 and weak market sentiment. Overall, housing prices dropped by 6.9% year on year in 2023, while housing transactions further declined by 4.5% to a record-low of 43,002 units. Housing affordability remained stretched despite improving slightly along with the downward adjustment of housing prices. Similarly, the non-residential property markets continued to face headwinds, with prices of offices, retail premises and flatted factories softened further. The rentals for offices remained under pressure due to high vacancy rates amid the increasing prevalence of work-from-home arrangements and large supply. On the other hand, the rentals for retail premises increased in 2023 with the revival of inbound tourism and the improvement in private consumption.\n\nChart 4 Asset prices\nSources: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited\n\n# Outlook for the economy\n\n# Economic environment\n\nIn 2024, the Hong Kong economy is expected to continue its recovery at a moderate pace. Inbound tourism is set to expand further alongside the continuous improvement in handling capacity and the Government’s effort to promote mega events, while local consumption activities should be supported by a steady labour market. The various infrastructure projects to be taken forward by the Government will also lend support to the economy. Meanwhile, Hong Kong’s exports of goods will likely stabilise alongside the expected upturn in the global technology cycle. The Government forecasts real GDP to grow steadily by 2.5% –3.5% in 20246. However, the outlook is clouded by multiple risks and uncertainties, including those stemming from the US policy rate path, the pace of technology cycle recovery, the prospects for global economic growth, and evolving geopolitical tensions.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nLocal inflation is expected to remain mild in 2024, with softened external price pressures helping to offset the upward pressures on domestic costs amid further economic recovery and rising housing rentals. Market consensus forecasts a headline inflation rate of 2.1% in 2024, while the Government projects the headline and underlying inflation rates to be 2.4% and 1.7% respectively. On the other hand, the labour market is expected to be supported by the ongoing economic recovery, while the various labour importation and talent attraction schemes will continue to help alleviate manpower shortages across different industries.\n\n# Performance of the banking sector\n\nIn 2023, the Hong Kong banking sector faced a number of challenges including a high interest rate environment, heightened volatility in global financial markets caused by the March banking turmoil in the US and Europe, and a slowerthan-expected economic recovery in the Mainland and Hong Kong. Despite these multiple headwinds, the Hong Kong banking sector remained sound and continued to be supported by strong capital and liquidity buffers. The asset quality of the banking sector remained healthy despite an increase in the classified loan ratio. The profitability of banks improved notably, driven by higher net interest income.\n\n# Asset quality\n\nThe classified loan ratio of the banking sector rose to 1.56% at the end of 2023 from 1.40% at the end of 2022, with the overdue and rescheduled loan ratio increasing to 1.24% from 0.85% during the same period (Chart 5). The classified loan ratio for Mainland-related lending also rose to 2.58% at the end of 2023 from 2.26% a year before. The increase in the classified loan ratio was mainly due to downgrades of exposures to Mainland property developers. Nevertheless, the provisions set aside by banks remained sufficient. The provision coverage ratio (i.e.  total provisions to classified loans) stood at 75% at the end of 2023. If the market value of collateral held against the classified loans is taken into account, the adjusted provision coverage ratio would reach around 145%. Meanwhile, the delinquency ratios of residential mortgage lending and credit card lending remained low, at 0.08% and 0.30% respectively, at the end of 2023 (Chart 6).\n\nChart 5 Asset quality of the banking sector\nNote: Figures cover Hong Kong offices, overseas branches and major overseas subsidiaries.\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 6 Delinquency ratios of residential mortgage lending and credit card lending\nSource: HKMA\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe banking sector recorded notable profit growth in 2023. The aggregate pre-tax operating profit of retail banks increased by 62.1% in the year, while the post-tax return on average assets rose to 0.89% from 0.57% during the same period (Chart 7). The improvement in profit was predominantly the result of an increase in net interest income (+30%), coupled with a significant gain in investments held for trading in 2023 as compared to a mild loss in the previous year. This was partly offset by an increase in loan impairment charges (+28%), as specific provisions were set aside for new classified loans. Against the backdrop of rising interest rates, the net interest margin of retail banks widened to 1.68% in 2023 from 1.31% a year before (Chart 8). Meanwhile, retail banks’ cost-to-income ratio fell to 38.8% in 2023 from 48.0% in 2022 (Chart 9).\n\nChart 7 Retail banks’ performance\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 8 Retail banks’ net interest margin\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 9 Retail banks’ cost-to-income ratio\nSource: HKMA\n\n# Balance sheet trends\n\nThe banking sector’s balance sheet grew by 0.9% in 2023, as growths in negotiable debt instruments held (+8.6%) and interbank lending (+4.4%) were mostly offset by a decline in total loans. Given the subdued loan demand amid higher borrowing costs and a weakened global economic outlook, total loans decreased by 3.6% in 2023. Of the total loans, loans for use in Hong Kong remained broadly stable (-0.4%), while loans for use outside Hong Kong and trade finance decreased by 10.4% and 13.1% respectively. Mainlandrelated lending fell by 6.6% in 2023.\n\nOn the liability side, total deposits rose by 5.1% in 2023, compared with a growth of 1.7% in 2022. As total loans declined while total deposits grew, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio decreased to 62.8% at the end of 2023 from 68.5% a year before (Chart 10).\n\n# Capital adequacy\n\nThe banking sector remained well capitalised in 2023. The consolidated total capital ratio of locally incorporated authorized institutions (AIs) stood at 21.1% at the end of 2023, compared with 20.1% a year before. The Tier 1 capital ratio was 18.9% (Chart 11). Both ratios were well above their respective international minimum requirements. The Basel III leverage ratio was 7.9% at the end of 2023 (Chart 12).\n\nChart 10 Loans and deposits of the banking sector\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 11 Consolidated capital ratios of locally incorporated AIs\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 12 Consolidated leverage ratio of locally incorporated AIs\nSource: HKMA\n\n# Liquidity conditions\n\nThe banking sector continued to maintain a strong liquidity position. The quarterly average Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) of category 1 institutions was 178.6% in the fourth quarter of 2023, and the quarterly average Liquidity Maintenance Ratio (LMR) of category 2 institutions was 65.7% (Chart 13). The main source of funding for the banking sector continued to be customer deposits. The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) of category 1 institutions and the Core Funding Ratio (CFR) of category 2A institutions were 144.4% and 169.4% respectively at the end of 2023 (Chart 14). All four ratios were well above the statutory minimum requirements.\n\nChart 13 Liquidity ratios of designated AIs\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 14 Funding ratios of designated AIs\nSource: HKMA\n", "zh": "經濟與金融環境\n\n儘管外部環境充滿挑戰，香港經濟在2023年仍呈現正向增長，主要得益於入境旅遊和內需的回升。隨著經濟復甦，勞動市場持續改善，而通脹保持適中。在金融條件收緊、市場信心低迷的背景下，資產市場仍然疲弱。預計2024年的經濟活動將以適度速度進一步復甦，儘管外部不確定因素仍籠罩在前景之上。\n\n經濟回顧\n\n實體活動\n\n經歷去年的嚴峻挑戰後，香港經濟在2023年穩健增長3.2%（表1和圖1）。國內方面，由於勞動市場狀況改善和政府推出的各項支持措施，如消費券計劃和多項促銷活動，私人成品消費顯著回升。儘管金融條件收緊，但整體投資支出由去年低基數反彈，出現了顯著增長。在外部方面，香港服務出口反彈，主要是由於入境旅遊的強勁復甦。然而，服務出口對增長的正面影響被外遊旅遊的強勁復甦所抵消，外遊旅遊被度量為服務進口。另一方面，貨物出口由於外部需求疲弱，仍然乏力，拖累香港的國內生產總值（GDP）增長。\n\n圖1 按貢獻分的實質GDP增長\n資料來源：統計處\n\n表1 按支出構成的實質GDP增長（期比期）\n註：季節調整後的國內固定資本形成的季比季變動率未提供。\n資料來源：統計處\n\n通脹\n\n2023年，本地通脹保持適中，外來價格壓力逐步緩解，儘管本地成本壓力略有增加，但整體仍受控制（圖2）1。全年而言，核心和整體通脹率分別為1.7%和2.1%。\n\n勞動市場\n\n2023年，勞動市場條件進一步改善，失業率在7月降至十年最低的2.8%，其後幾個月維持於低水平（圖3）。勞動需求和勞動供應同步增加，分別由總就業人數（圖3）和勞動力的增加所反映。鑑於香港的人力短缺，政府在2023年推出了多項引入勞工的方案及人才吸引措施3和4。同時，伴隨著勞動市場的緊張，名義工資和勞動收入的年增率逐步接近疫情前的水平。\n\n圖2 核心消費者價格指數通脹\n\n圖3 勞動市場狀況\n資料來源：統計處\n\n股市\n\n在2023年初穩定後，本地股市在下半年轉為疲弱。在延續2022年底的反彈之後，恆生指數於2023年1月27日達到日高22,689點。此後回落，至年底進一步下跌至低點（圖4），反映由於美國和瑞士銀行業危機以及全球經濟前景疲弱和金融條件收緊，市場信心低迷。恆生指數全年收於17,047點，較2022年底下跌13.8%，是連續第四年下跌。\n\n房地產市場\n\n2023年前四個月，隨著內地和香港回歸正常，住宅房地產市場出現反彈，但隨後由於按揭息率上升5和市場情緒疲軟而轉為轉弱。整體而言，2023年房價較去年同期下跌6.9%，房屋交易量更進一步下降4.5%，創下43,002宗的歷史新低。儘管房價略有下調，住房負擔能力仍然緊張，但略有改善。同樣，非住宅物業市場亦面臨逆風，辦公樓、零售商舖和工廠樓的價格進一步走軟。由於空置率較高，加上居家工作普及和供應過剩，辦公室租金仍受壓力；另一方面，隨著入境旅遊復甦和私人成品消費改善，零售商舖租金在2023年有所上升。\n\n圖4 資產價格\n資料來源：評價及估價署與香港交易所及結算所\n\n經濟展望\n\n經濟環境\n\n預計2024年，香港經濟將以適中速度持續復甦。入境旅遊將進一步擴張，並隨著處理能力的提升和政府推動大型活動的努力，而持續改善；同時，內需活動將由穩定的勞動市場予以支持。政府推進的各項基建項目也將助力經濟。在出口方面，隨著全球科技循環預期回暖，香港貨物出口可能趨於穩定。政府預測2024年實質GDP將穩步增長2.5%－3.5%6，但多重風險和不確定性仍籠罩前景，包括美國政策利率走向、科技循環復甦的步伐、全球經濟增長前景，以及地緣政治緊張局勢的演變。\n\n通脹與勞動市場\n\n預計2024年本地通脹仍將維持溫和，外部價格壓力緩解將有助於抵消國內成本上升，儘管經濟進一步復甦和房租上升。此外，市場普遍預測2024年整體通脹率為2.1%，而政府則預計大約為2.4%（整體）和1.7%（核心）。由於經濟持續復甦，勞動市場應能提供支持，同時多個引入勞工和吸引人才方案將繼續緩解各行各業的人力短缺。\n\n銀行業表現\n\n2023年，香港銀行業面對多重挑戰，包括高利率環境、由美國和歐洲三月銀行業動盪引發的全球金融市場波動，以及內地和香港經濟復甦慢於預期。儘管如此，香港銀行業保持穩健，並由於資本和流動性充裕得到支援。資產質素仍然健康，儘管不良貸款比率有所上升。銀行盈利能力顯著改善，主要受淨利息收入較高推動。\n\n資產質素\n\n截至2023年底，銀行業不良貸款比率上升至1.56%，較2022年底的1.40%有所增加，同期逾期和重新安排貸款比率亦由0.85%升至1.24%（圖5）。與內地相關的貸款不良比率亦由2.26%升至2.58%。不良貸款比率的上升主要由於對內地房地產開發商的信貸調降。然而，銀行預留的撥備仍然充足，到2023年底，撥備覆蓋率（即 撥備總額對不良貸款的比例）為75%；若考慮抵押品的市值調整，則調整後的撥備覆蓋率約為145%。此外，住宅抵押貸款和信用卡貸款的逾期比率均較低，分別為0.08%和0.30%（圖6）。\n\n圖5 銀行資產質素\n註：數字涵蓋香港分行、海外分支及主要海外子公司。\n資料來源：香港金融管理局\n\n圖6 住宅抵押貸款和信用卡貸款的逾期比率\n資料來源：香港金融管理局\n\n盈利趨勢\n\n2023年，銀行業錄得顯著盈利增長。零售銀行的稅前經營利潤全年增長62.1%，而資產平均回報率由0.57%升至0.89%（圖7）。盈利改善主要來自淨利息收入的增加（+30%）以及2023年交易性投資的巨大利得，較去年溫和的虧損有所不同。這部分被新不良貸款的撥備增加（+28%）所抵銷，信貸準備金的增榮是在利率上升背景下淨利差擴大至1.68%（較前一年的1.31%，圖8）。同時，零售銀行的成本收入比由2022年的48.0%下降至2023年的38.8%（圖9）。\n\n資產負債表趨勢\n\n2023年，銀行業資產負債表增長0.9%，主要由於流動資產(包括可轉讓債券+8.6%)和銀行間借貸(4.4%)的增長，抵銷了貸款總額的下降。在較高借貸成本和全球經濟前景疲弱的情況下，貸款總額減少了3.6%。在貸款中，用於香港的貸款大致持平（-0.4%），而用於海外和貿易融資的貸款分別下降10.4%和13.1%。內地相關貸款在2023年下降了6.6%。\n\n在負債方面，總存款比去年增長5.1%，而2022年為1.7%。由於貸款需求縮減而存款增長，貸存比率由去年末的68.5%降至62.8%（圖10）。\n\n資本充足度\n\n2023年，銀行業資本充足，維持良好。本地持牌金融機構的合併總資本充足率在2023年底為21.1%，較去年20.1%有所提升。核心資本充足率為18.9%（圖11）。兩者均遠高於國際最低標準。巴塞爾協議三的槓桿率在2023年底為7.9%（圖12）。\n\n圖10 銀行資產與存款\n資料來源：香港金融管理局\n\n圖11 本地持牌金融機構的合併資本比率\n資料來源：香港金融管理局\n\n圖12 本地持牌金融機構的合併槓桿率\n資料來源：香港金融管理局\n\n流動性狀況\n\n銀行業保持強健的流動性。2023年第4季，第一類金融機構的季平均流動性覆蓋比率（LCR）為178.6%，第二類金融機構的季平均流動性維持比率（LMR）為65.7%（圖13）。銀行業的主要融資來源仍是客戶存款。第一類機構的淨穩定資金比率（NSFR）及第二類A的核心融資比率（CFR）在2023年底分別為144.4%和169.4%（圖14），均高於法定最低要求。"}
{"en": "# Monetary Stability\n\nIn 2023, amid market expectations of a “high for longer” US policy rate, the Hong Kong dollar mostly traded on the weak side of the Convertibility Zone, with the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking being triggered eight times between mid-February and early May.  The Hong Kong dollar had regained some momentum since May and traded around the central parity rate of 7.8 at year end.  Under the Linked Exchange Rate System, which marked its 40th anniversary in 2023, the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates generally track their US dollar counterparts, while also being affected by local supply and demand.  Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets remained stable and traded in a smooth and orderly manner.  As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, the Linked Exchange Rate System has shown its strength and resilience to various external shocks time after time.\n\n# Objectives\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability.  This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1.  The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n- Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks;\n- Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation;\n- The Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of clearing account balances kept with the HKMA; and\n- Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs).  With the HKMA standing ready to sell (or buy) Hong Kong dollars to (or from) banks in exchange for US dollars upon request at HK$7.75 (or HK$7.85) per US dollar when the strong-side (or weak-side) CU is triggered, the Aggregate Balance will expand (or contract) to push down (or up) Hong Kong dollar interest rates, helping move the Hong Kong dollar back to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85.\n\n# Review of 2023\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nAmid the market expectation of a “high for longer” US policy rate, the Hong Kong dollar remained soft and mostly traded on the weak side of the Convertibility Zone throughout 2023.  The weak-side CU was triggered eight times from mid-February to early May.  The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate regained some strength during early May to July, partly driven by dividend payment-related demand from listed companies and half-year-end funding needs by corporates. Thereafter, the Hong Kong dollar was mainly driven by the changes in local funding demands, such as buying flows through the Southbound Stock Connect, and traded around the central parity rate of 7.8 at year end (Chart 1).  Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market continued to function normally throughout 2023.\n\nChart 1 Market exchange rate in 2023\n\nFrom February to May, the HKMA purchased a total of HK$51.5 billion at the weak-side CU at the request of banks in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS).  Reflecting the triggering of the weak-side CU, the Aggregate Balance decreased from HK$96.3 billion at the end of 2022 to HK$45.0 billion at the end of 2023. Meanwhile, the outstanding EFBNs increased slightly from HK$1,200.4 billion to HK$1,245.5 billion during the year. The total of the Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs therefore declined from HK$1,296.7 billion at the end of 2022 to HK$1,290.4 billion at the end of 2023 (Chart 2). The Monetary Base as a whole remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\nChart 2 Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding Exchange Fund papers in 2023\n\n# Money market\n\nUnder the LERS, the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs) generally track their US dollar counterparts.  As the US continued to raise interest rates in the first seven months of 2023, the HIBORs generally rose (Chart 3).  For the year as a whole, the overnight, 1-month and 3-month HIBORs increased respectively by 286, 92 and 16 basis points to 6.09%, 5.27% and 5.15% at year end.\n\nFollowing the increases in the target range for the US federal funds rate, the Base Rate was adjusted upwards four times by a total of one percentage point (i.e. 100 basis points) from 4.75% to 5.75%.1 On the retail front, following the US policy rate hikes, many banks raised their Best Lending Rates by 12.5 basis points in early May and another 12.5 basis points in late July.  Some banks also increased the cap on HIBOR-based mortgage rates of newly approved mortgage loans during the year, and the average interest rate of new mortgage loans rose from 3.35% in 2022 to 4.13% in December 2023.  Overall, Hong Kong’s money markets continued to function normally.  Discount Window borrowing increased to HK$38.8 billion in 2023 from HK$8.4 billion in 2022 and no abnormality was noted in the relevant usage.\n\nChart 3 Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates in 2023\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nThe LERS has been a strong anchor of Hong Kong’s financial system for four decades and has shown its strength and resilience to challenges.  Despite lingering uncertainties surrounding the US interest rate path and global economic recovery, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to function in an orderly manner, reflecting the robustness of the LERS.  The Government is firmly committed to the LERS.  In its 2023 External Sector Report, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) once again reiterated that the credibility of the LERS has been ensured by a transparent set of rules, large fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nA robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS.  Hong Kong’s banking sector continued to operate smoothly with liquidity positions and capitalisation faring very well by international standards.  To ensure the resilience of the banking sector, the HKMA has been closely monitoring banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress testing results, and has maintained its supervisory efforts on bank lending.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of the Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) rose from 110.12% at the end of 2022 to a high of 112.71% on 4 May 2023, surpassing the Upper Trigger Level of 112.5% (Chart 4).  This largely reflected the contraction in the Aggregate Balance as a result of the triggering of the weak-side CU in the first half of the year2. In accordance with the arrangement approved by the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee and as a result of the redemption of Certificates of Indebtedness, assets were transferred out of the Backing Portfolio to the Investment Portfolio to reduce the Backing Ratio to around 109.97% on 8 May.  Thereafter, the Backing Ratio rose steadily to close at 110.73% on 31 December.  Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate.  The ample financial resources of the Exchange Fund, together with the sound banking system, provide a powerful backstop to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nChart 4 Daily movement of the Backing Ratio in 2023\n\n# Currency Board Sub-Committee\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong.  In 2023, the CBC considered issues including the May 2022 stablecoin market crash, the transmission of Federal Reserve’s dollar liquidity backstop measures to banks in Hong Kong, and the recent movements in the Hong Kong dollar interest rates.  Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Notes and coins\n\nThe below table summarises the value of the notes and coins in circulation at the end of 2023:\n\nChart 5 Banknotes in circulation by note-issuing banks at the end of 2023\n\nChart 6 Distribution of banknotes in circulation at the end of 2023\n\nChart 7 Banknotes in circulation at the end of 2023\n\nChart 8 Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation at the end of 2023\n\nChart 9 Breakdown of Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation at the end of 2023\n\n# Hong Kong banknotes\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA continued to organise seminars on the design and security features of Hong Kong banknotes for bank tellers, cashiers from retail establishments and students to help enhance their knowledge and skills in authenticating banknotes.  During 2023, 15 seminars were arranged for around 3,000 participants.\n\n# Coin Collection Programme\n\nThe Coin Collection Programme continued to be well received by the public.  More information about the Programme can be found in the Sustainable HKMA chapter of the Sustainability Report 2023.\n\n# Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\n\nThe EFBN Programme operated smoothly.  At the end of 2023, the nominal amount of outstanding Exchange Fund papers stood at around HK$1,255.4 billion (Table 2).\n\nTable 2 Outstanding issues of EFBNs\n\n# Monetary research\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMR)3, the research arm of the Hong Kong Academy of Finance, published 20 working papers and held 17 seminars/ webinars on monetary and financial research topics that are of strategic importance to Hong Kong and the region. The HKIMR also published six eJournals on the Social Science Research Network (SSRN) to disseminate research outputs to SSRN’s global research community.  Moreover, to provide the public with a high-level, non-technical summary of the recently published working papers, the HKIMR published two issues of Insights from Monetary Research.\n\nApart from its research activities, the HKIMR organised four international events, one roundtable and four seminars/ webinars with academia, global central banks and international financial institutions to promote dialogue and exchange on economic and financial issues:\n\n# 9 Mar\n\nA seminar on China’s Rebound: Recent Developments and Outlook by Dr Steven Alan Barnett, Senior Resident Representative in China of the IMF, and Dr Phakawa Jeasakul, Resident Representative for People’s Republic of China – Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) of the IMF, was held. Dr Barnett shared his views on the latest developments in the Chinese economy, as well as short- and medium-term issues that need to be addressed. More than 100 participants attended the seminar.\n\n# 17 Apr\n\nA seminar on Navigating Through a Challenging World was held. Four experts from the IMF shared their views on the analytical chapters of the most recent issues of World Economic Outlook and Global Financial Stability Report by the IMF. Over 50 participants attended the seminar.\n\n# 25 Apr\n\nA seminar with the presentation of the IMF’s April 2023 Global Financial Stability Report titled Safeguarding Global Financial Stability amid High Inflation and Interest Rates by Dr Jason Wu, Assistant Director, and Mr Thomas Pointek, Senior Financial Sector Expert, of the IMF’s Monetary and Capital Markets Department was held. More than 80 participants attended the seminar.\n\n# 2 May\n\nA fireside chat on Asia in a Challenging World was hosted between Mr Krishna Srinivasan, Director of the Asia and Pacific Department of the IMF, and Mr Eddie Yue, Chief Executive of the HKMA. Mr Srinivasan outlined the key messages of the recent IMF Regional Economic Outlook report for Asia and shared his views on the key drivers and risks of the global and regional economy. In addition, the dialogue covered many important issues concerning the regional economy and the evolution of the international monetary system. Around 120 participants attended the event.\n", "zh": "貨幣穩定\n\n2023年，面對市場預期“長期高位”的美國政策利率，港元大部分在可兌換區的弱側交易，並於2月中旬至5月初觸發了八次弱側兌換承諾（CU）。自5月以來，港元已逐步恢復動力，並在年終時在7.8的中間匯率附近交易。在標籤外匯制度下，該制度自2023年迎來第40個周年，港元的銀行間拆借利率通常追踪美元利率，同時也受到本地供需情況的影響。總體而言，港元的外匯和貨幣市場保持穩定，交易平穩有序。作為香港貨幣和金融穩定的基石，聯絡匯率制度多年來展現了其堅韌和應對各種外部震盪的能力。\n\n目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的首要目標是貨幣穩定。這一目標被定義為港幣在外匯市場對美元的匯率保持穩定，並在每美元7.75至7.85港元的範圍內浮動。貨幣制度的結構特點是貨幣局制度，要求貨幣基數至少由存放在匯基金的美元儲備100%支持，貨幣基數的變動必須與美元儲備的變動完全匹配。\n\n貨幣基數（表1）包括：\n- 負債證券，為由三家鈔票發行銀行發行的鈔票提供全面支持；\n- 政府發行的流通貨幣票據和硬幣；\n- 總結餘，即與香港金融管理局（HKMA）保持的清算帳戶餘額之和；\n- 由HKMA代表政府發行的匯基金票據（EFBNs）。\n\n港幣匯率的穩定通過自動利率調整機制以及HKMA堅定履行兌換承諾的承諾來維持。在觸發強側（或弱側）兌換承諾時，HKMA準備以每美元 HK$7.75（或 HK$7.85）向銀行出售（或購買）港幣換取美元，從而擴大（或縮小）總結餘以降低（或提高）港幣利率，幫助港元回到7.75至7.85的兌換區間內。\n\n2023年回顧\n\n匯率穩定\n\n在市場預期“長期高位”的美國政策利率背景下，港元全年偏軟，並大多在可兌換區的弱側交易。從2月中旬到5月初觸發了八次弱側兌換承諾。5月初至7月，港元匯率略為回升，部分由於上市公司派息需求及企業半年底融資需求所推動。之後，港元主要受本地融資需求變化影響，例如通過南向股票通的買入力，與年終時匯率在7.8左右交易（圖1）。整體而言，2023年港元匯市運作正常。\n\n圖1 2023年市場匯率\n\n從2月至5月，HKMA在弱側CU的要求下，按照聯絡匯率制度（LERS）的設計，共購買HK$515億。由於弱側CU的觸發，總結餘由2022年底的HK$963億減少到2023年底的HK$450億。同時，未償還的EFBN略為增加，從HK$1,2004億升至HK$1,245.5億。由此，總貨幣基數與未償還的匯基金票據的總合由2022年底的HK$1,2967億略降至2023年底的HK$1,2904億（圖2）。貨幣基數整體仍完全由外匯儲備支持。\n\n圖2 2023年總結餘與未償還匯基金票據（折扣窗口前）\n\n貨幣市場\n\n在聯絡匯率制度下，香港銀行同業拆借利率（HIBOR）通常追蹤美元利率。由於美國在2023年前七個月持續加息，HIBOR普遍上升（圖3）。全年來看，隔夜、一個月和三個月HIBOR分別上升286、92和16個基點，年底分別為6.09%、5.27%和5.15%。\n\n在美聯儲聯邦基金利率目標區間上調後，基準利率調升四次，共一個百分點（即100個基點），由4.75%升至5.75%。在零售方面，跟隨美國政策利率的升息，許多銀行在5月初和7月下旬分別上調最優貸款利率12.5個基點。一些銀行還調整了新批核按揭貸款的HIBOR封頂利率，新按揭貸款的平均利率由2022年的3.35%上升至2023年12月的4.13%。總體而言，香港貨幣市場運作正常。折扣窗口借款由2022年的84億港元增加至2023年的388億港元，未見異常使用情況。\n\n圖3 2023年香港銀行同業拆借利率\n\n聯絡匯率制度\n\n聯絡匯率制度已經成為香港金融體系的重要支柱，堅韌不拔。儘管美國利率走勢及全球經濟復甦仍存在不確定性，港元的外匯和貨幣市場仍有序運行，顯示LERS的穩健性。政府堅定支持該制度。在其2023年對外經濟部報告中，國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）再次強調，LERS的可信度由透明的規則、大量的財政和外匯儲備、強健的金融監管和監督、靈活的經濟以及謹慎的財政框架所保障。\n\n堅韌的銀行體系對聯絡匯率制度的正常運作至關重要。香港的銀行業持續運作順利，流動性和資本狀況在國際標準下表現良好。為確保銀行系統的韌性，HKMA密切監管銀行的信貸、流動性和利率風險管理及壓力測試結果，並維持對銀行放貸的監管力度。\n\n為提升貨幣局帳戶的透明度，自1998年10月起，部分匯基金資產被專門用於支持貨幣基數。支持比例（定義為支持資產除以貨幣基數）由2022年底的110.12%升至2023年5月4日的高點112.71%，超過了112.5%的上觸發水平（圖4）。這主要反映上半年弱側CU觸發後，總結餘的收縮。根據匯基金諮詢委員會批准的安排，並因債務證券的贖回，資產從支持組合轉入投資組合，使支持比例在5月8日降至約109.97%。隨後，支持比例穩步上升，至12月31日收於110.73%。在聯絡匯率制度下，雖然已為支持組合指定了部分匯基金資產，但所有匯基金資產均可用於支持港元匯率。匯基金豐富的金融資源以及健全的銀行系統，為香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供了有力的後盾。\n\n圖4 2023年支持比例每日變動\n\n貨幣局委員會子委員會\n\n匯基金諮詢委員會的貨幣局子委員會（CBC）監督和審查與香港貨幣金融穩定相關的事宜。2023年，CBC評估了2022年5月穩定幣市場崩盤，美聯儲美元流動性支援措施傳導給香港銀行的情況，以及近期港元利率的變動。相關討論記錄和貨幣局運作的報告已在HKMA網站公布。\n\n鈔票與硬幣\n\n以下表格總結了截至2023年底的流通鈔票和硬幣的價值：\n\n圖5 發行銀行鈔票的流通量（2023年底）\n\n圖6 流通鈔票分佈（2023年底）\n\n圖7 2023年流通中的鈔票\n\n圖8 政府發行的貨幣票據和硬幣（2023年底）\n\n圖9 政府發行的貨幣票據和硬幣的分佈（2023年底）\n\n香港鈔票\n\n年內，HKMA持續舉辦關於香港鈔票設計和安全特徵的研討會，面向銀行櫃台人員、零售收銀員及學生，以提升他們辨識假鈔的知識和技能。2023年共舉辦了15場研討會，約3000人參加。\n\n硬幣收藏計劃\n\n硬幣收藏計劃受到市民熱烈歡迎。有關更多詳情，可參閱2023年可持續發展報告中的“可持續香港金融管理局”章節。\n\n匯基金票據\n\n匯基金票據計劃運作順利。截至2023年底，未償還匯基金票據的名義總額約為HK$1,255.4億（表2）。\n\n表2 匯基金票據未償還額\n\n貨幣研究\n\n香港金融研究院（HKIMR），香港金融管理局的研究部門，共發布20份研究論文，並舉辦了17場有關香港及區域戰略性貨幣和金融議題的研討會/網絡研討會。HKIMR還在社會科學研究網絡（SSRN）發表了六份電子期刊，以向全球研究界傳播研究成果。此外，為向公眾提供最新研究論文的高層次、非技術性摘要，HKIMR出版了兩期“貨幣研究洞見”。\n\n除研究活動外，HKIMR還組織了四場國際活動，一次圓桌會議和四場研討會/網絡會議，與學術界、全球中央銀行和國際金融機構交流意見，推動經濟金融議題的對話與合作：\n\n# 3月9日\n\n舉行中國經濟復甦：近期發展與展望研討會，由IMF中國常駐代表Steven Alan Barnett博士與IMF“中國—香港特別行政區”常駐代表Jeasakul博士共同主講。Barnett博士分享了中國經濟的最新動態，以及亟需解決的短期與中期問題。超過100人參與。\n\n# 4月17日\n\n舉辦“穿越挑戰世界”研討會。IMF四位專家分享了《世界經濟展望》和《全球金融穩定報告》的分析章節。超過50人參與。\n\n# 4月25日\n\n舉行IMF2023年4月版全球金融穩定報告（題為“在高通脹和高利率中保障全球金融穩定”）的推介研討會，由IMF貨幣與資本市場部助理主任Wu Jason博士和資深金融部專家Pointek先生主持。超過80人出席。\n\n# 5月2日\n\n由IMF亞太司司長Srinivasan先生與HKMA行政總裁Yue Eddie先生共同主持的“挑戰中的亞洲”座談會。Srinivasan提出IMF最新地區經濟展望報告的重點，並分享了全球和區域經濟的驅動因素與風險。同時，討論涵蓋多個關鍵區域經濟與國際貨幣制度演變的議題。約120人參與。"}
{"en": "# Banking Stability\n\nThe banking sector in Hong Kong remained strong and resilient in 2023 despite multiple headwinds, including the March banking turmoil in the US and Europe, a high interest rate environment and geopolitical tensions. The HKMA responded swiftly to the March banking turmoil — from managing the ripple effects to completing an internal review (covering such areas as the supervisory processes and resolution framework) drawing lessons for the local banking sector, while maintaining its focus on the credit, liquidity and market risk management of authorized institutions. In light of escalating cyber threats and the increasing use of technology services provided by third parties, the HKMA also worked closely with authorized institutions to enhance their operational and cyber resilience.\n\nThe HKMA enhanced consumer protection in respect of payment cards, and through further revision of the Code of Banking Practice as well as the launch of the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter. The HKMA worked with fellow regulators on a balanced regulatory regime for virtual asset-related activities, streamlined the selling process for sophisticated professional investors, introduced enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Pilot Scheme, and commenced supervision of trust business. A pilot programme was launched to prepare for provision of consumer credit reference services under “Credit Data Smart”.\n\nThe HKMA’s efforts in anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) reflect a commitment to targeting the highest threats under a risk-based approach. To address increasing digital fraud, the HKMA has strengthened ecosystem collaboration through the launch of real-time fraud monitoring and expanding the scope of public-private information-sharing partnerships, including the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce. The launch of a ground-breaking platform to facilitate bank-to-bank information sharing will help address the risk of mule account networks, while the HKMA also worked closely with the industry to take concerted action to handle increasing fraud-related banking complaints and raise public awareness about different scams, including a pre-transaction alert mechanism when using the Faster Payment System. In parallel, supervisory technology capabilities were also advanced through the Macro Analytics pilot scheme.\n\nGood progress was made on implementing international supervisory standards locally, including those on capital adequacy and disclosure. Notable efforts were also made in enhancing capacity building in the banking sector, attracting and nurturing future talents and upskilling existing practitioners. In addition, the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board completed a public consultation on proposed enhancements to the Deposit Protection Scheme.\n\nThe HKMA continued to advance its work to ensure a credible resolution regime. A new resolution standard related to accessing critical financial market infrastructures was developed and a review on experiences of implementing loss-absorbing capacity policy standards was completed. Significant progress was made in resolution planning with banks to address early termination risk and operational continuity in resolution. The HKMA also continued to be active in international policy initiatives and regional co-operation on resolution.\n\n# Objectives\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this objective is contingent upon a highly resilient financial system that is capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their businesses and, in extreme cases, by failing in a disorderly manner. The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring that banks are resilient to shocks and able to recover their positions in response to crises, ultimately helping to prevent failures. The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks and is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs).\n\nThe Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework is not designed to ensure a zero-risk financial system. Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that, in the event of an AI becoming non-viable, its failure can be managed in an orderly manner. To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong has been established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs, among other types of institutions. To operationalise the resolution regime in Hong Kong, it is important to lay down resolution rules and policy standards, undertake resolution planning to remove impediments to AIs’ resolvability and develop the HKMA’s operational capability to resolve a failing AI. In order to carry out these tasks effectively, the HKMA adopts an internationally harmonised and co-ordinated approach.\n\nThe Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs). In overseeing FMIs, the HKMA aims to promote their general safety and efficiency, limit systemic risk and foster transparency. Making FMIs more resilient to financial crises protects the monetary and financial systems in Hong Kong from possible destabilising effects arising from disruption to the FMIs.\n\n# Review of 2023\n\n# Licensing\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA granted one banking licence and one restricted bank licence to two banks incorporated outside Hong Kong. The HKMA also granted money broker approval to four foreign trading platform operators and revoked another approval granted to one money broker. The HKMA revoked authorizations of five licensed banks during the year.\n\nMore information about the AIs and local representative offices in Hong Kong can be found in the Annex and Tables D to F on pages 313 to 316 and 322 to 325 respectively.\n\n# Review of three-tier banking system\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA conducted a comprehensive review on the three-tier banking system in order to simplify the structure of Hong Kong’s banking system. The review found that the three-tier system has become more complex than necessary to achieve the original aim to strike a balance between flexibility of entry into the banking system and protection of small depositors. Subsequently, the HKMA commenced a three-month consultation in June on a proposal to simplify the three-tier banking system into two tiers by merging deposit-taking companies into the restricted licence bank sector, thereby forming a new second tier of Hong Kong’s banking system. Respondents were generally supportive of the proposal.\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA conducted 177 off-site reviews covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL rating assessment1, corporate governance and risk management. As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance, 38 meetings were held with the boards of directors, independent non-executive directors or board-level committees of AIs. Furthermore, 38 tripartite meetings were held among the HKMA, AIs and their external auditors.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA conducted regular on-site examinations on a wide range of AIs’ activities. Credit risk management was a key focus given the challenging credit risk landscape amid a high interest rate environment and debt defaults by some Mainland property developers. The management of operational risk and technology risk was another major focus as the adoption of technology by AIs gathered further momentum. The HKMA also stepped up its supervisory work on climate risk management and rolled out a new round of thematic examinations focused on climaterelated risk governance, and a series of consultative sessions to provide supervisory guidance to AIs.\n\nThe banking turmoil in the US and Europe that started in March 2023 was the most significant system-wide banking stress since the Great Financial Crisis of 2008 in terms of scale and scope. The HKMA stayed on high alert as the turmoil unfolded and took a number of precautionary actions to ensure that any potential fallout would not undermine confidence in the local banking and financial system. After the episode, the HKMA conducted an internal review exercise having regard to the observations and experience gained from the turmoil. Based on this exercise, the HKMA developed a detailed action plan to incorporate lessons learnt with a view to strengthening its supervisory effectiveness and augmenting its ability to handle a banking crisis if one did occur. See Liquidity and market risks on page 95 for more details on the HKMA’s work in this respect.\n\nOn conduct supervision, the HKMA carried out on-site examinations in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses as well as consumer protection matters, supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk or new initiatives.\n\nTable 1 contains a summary of the HKMA’s supervisory activities in 2023.\n\nTable 1 Summary of supervisory activities\n\n# Credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nTotal loans decreased by 3.6% in 2023, compared with a decline of 3.0% in 2022. Table 2 shows the breakdown of growth in loans and advances. Mainland-related lending decreased by 6.6% to HK$4,226 billion in 2023 (Table 3).\n\nTable 2 Growth in loans and advances\n\nTable 3 Growth in Mainland-related lending\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA intensified supervisory efforts in monitoring AIs’ asset quality and assessing their credit risk management practices given the high interest rate environment and continued weakness in the Mainland property market. The asset quality of the banking sector deteriorated during the year but remained manageable. The classified loan ratio of the banking sector was 1.56% at the end of 2023, up from 1.40% at the end of 2022. The classified loan ratio for Mainland-related lending increased to 2.58% from 2.26% at the end of 2022.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA conducted targeted and thematic examinations to evaluate AIs’ credit risk management focusing on exposures to vulnerable sectors, premium financing, oversight of credit risks at operations outside Hong Kong and exposures to non-bank financial institutions.\n\n# Alleviating cash flow pressure faced by bank customers\n\nThe HKMA and the Banking Sector Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) Lending Coordination Mechanism announced in July the commencement of an orderly exit from the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme. The Scheme was introduced in May 2020 to tide eligible corporates over the pandemic. Taking into account the views of the commercial sectors, the partial principal repayment options were enhanced to assist corporates’ gradual return to normal repayment. Where sectors or individual borrowers were still facing challenges despite the end of the pandemic, banks continued to offer principal moratorium or other suitable credit relief measures on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe HKMA also encouraged banks to be sympathetic in handling the funding needs of corporates which had not participated in the Scheme but were facing cash flow pressures due to individual circumstances. The HKMA reminded banks to follow the “Hong Kong Approach to Corporate Difficulties” guidelines in dealing with corporates encountering repayment problems, so that individual banks would act collaboratively in the common interest of the lenders involved.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nThe successive rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures introduced by the HKMA since 2009 have strengthened banks’ risk management of their property mortgage lending business and the banking sector’s capacity to cope with challenges arising from a sharp correction in property prices. The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of new residential mortgage loans approved in 2023 stood at 57%, compared with 64% in September 2009 before the countercyclical measures were first introduced (Chart 1). The average debt servicing ratio (DSR) of new mortgages stayed low at 40% in 2023, compared with 41% in August 2010 when a cap on DSR was first applied.\n\nOn 7 July, the HKMA adjusted the countercyclical macroprudential measures after taking into account factors such as property prices, transaction volumes and the local and external economic environment. This was the first time the countercyclical macroprudential measures for residential properties were relaxed since their introduction in 2009. The adjustments included increasing the maximum LTV ratios for residential properties and commercial properties, as well as for mortgage loans assessed based on the net worth of mortgage applicants. In addition, the requirements to lower the applicable maximum LTV ratio and DSR limit by ten percentage points for mortgage applicants with incomes derived mainly from places outside of Hong Kong were lifted. The HKMA also removed the requirement to apply a five-percentage-point reduction on applicable DSR limits when mortgage applicants’ total mortgage finance exceeded the HKMA’s normal permissible LTV ceilings by 20 percentage points.\n\nChart 1 Average LTV ratio and DSR of new residential mortgage loans approved\n", "zh": "2023年，香港的銀行業在面對多重逆風，包括美國和歐洲三月的銀行動盪、高利率環境以及地緣政治緊張局勢下，依然保持強勁和韌性。香港金融管理局迅速應對三月的銀行動盪，從管理波及效應到完成內部審查（涵蓋監理流程和解決框架等領域），為本地銀行業汲取教訓，同時保持對授權金融機構的信貸、流動性及市場風險管理的關注。在網絡攻擊日益升級及科技服務由第三方提供的情況下，香港金融管理局亦與授權機構緊密合作，以提升其營運和網絡韌性。\n\n為了提升消費者保護，金融管理局加強了在支付卡方面的措施，並通過修訂銀行業守則及推出反欺詐消費者保護守則來進行改進。香港金融管理局與相關監管部門合作，建立了針對虛擬資產相關活動的平衡監管制度，簡化專業投資者的銷售流程，推出跨境理財通試點計劃的改善措施，並開始對信托業務進行監管。還啟動了“信用資料智能”下的消費者信貸參考服務的試點計劃。\n\n香港金融管理局在反洗錢及反恐融資（AML/CFT）方面的努力，體現了其根據風險導向方針 targeting 最高威脅的承諾。為應對日益嚴峻的數碼詐騙，金融管理局強化了生態系統合作，推出了實時詐騙監控系統，並擴展公私部門資訊共享合作範圍，包括反詐和反洗錢情報專案。推出促進銀行間資訊共享的創新平台，有助於應對兜售帳戶網絡的風險；同時，金融管理局亦與行業緊密合作，共同行動應對日益增加的詐騙投訴，並增強公眾對不同詐騙手法的認識，包括在使用快速支付系統時的預交易預警機制。此外，監管科技能力也透過宏觀分析試點方案得到了提升。\n\n在本地落實國際監管標準方面，取得了良好的進展，包括在資本充足率和資訊披露方面的標準。亦在加強銀行業的能力建設方面作出了顯著努力，吸引和培育未來人才，同時提升現有從業人員的專業技能。此外，香港存款保障局完成了有關存款保障計劃擴展方案的公開諮詢。\n\n金融管理局持續推進其建設一套可信的解決方案制度的工作。制定了與存取關鍵金融市場基礎設施相關的新解決標準，並完成了關於執行吸收損失能力政策標準的經驗回顧。與銀行合作的解決策劃也取得了重大進展，以應對提前終止風險及確保解決方案中的營運連續性。金融管理局亦積極參與國際政策倡議及區域合作，有關解決方案的國際協作持續推進。\n\n# 2023年回顧\n\n# 發牌工作\n\n2023年，金融管理局向兩家香港以外成立的銀行發放了一張銀行牌照和一張限制性銀行牌照。同時，亦批准了四家外國交易平台運營商的貨幣經紀批准，並吊銷了一家貨幣經紀的批准資格。年內，金融管理局吊銷了五家持牌銀行的牌照。\n\n關於在香港的授權機構和本地代表辦事處的詳情，請參見附件以及第313至316頁、第322至325頁的表格D至F。\n\n# 三層銀行體系回顧\n\n2023年，香港金融管理局進行了全面檢討，旨在簡化香港的三層銀行體系結構。該檢討認為，三層制度已變得比原先設計的更加複雜，不再符合原有促進靈活進入銀行體系與保障小型存戶的平衡目標。因此，金融管理局於六月展開為期三個月的諮詢，提出將存款受託公司合併入限制性牌照銀行部門，進而形成香港銀行體系中新二層的簡化方案。大多數回應者支持該建議。\n\n# 監管活動總結\n\n2023年，金融管理局進行了177次非現場審查，涵蓋範圍廣泛，包括CAMEL評級、公司治理和風險管理等。為了促進更強的風險治理，舉行了38次與授權金融機構董事會、獨立非執行董事或董事會委員會的會議。此外，亦舉行38次香港金融管理局、金融機構與外部審計師之間的三方會議。\n\n除了非現場工作外，金融管理局亦定期進行現場審查，涵蓋諸如信貸風險管理，尤其是在高利率環境下及部分內地房地產開發商拖欠債務情況嚴峻之際。營運風險和科技風險的管理也是重點，隨著金融機構進一步強化科技應用。金融管理局亦加強了氣候風險管理的監管工作，並推行了一系列以氣候相關風險治理為重點的專題檢查，以及一系列提供監管指引的磋商會議。\n\n自2023年3月起，美元高利率引起的美國和歐洲系統性銀行動盪成為2008年金融危機以來最嚴重的系統性衝擊。金融管理局保持高度警戒，采取多項預防措施，確保潛在影響不會削弱本地銀行和金融系統的信心。事件結束後，金融管理局進行了一次內部審查，總結經驗並制定詳細行動計劃，以提升監管效果，並增強應對銀行危機的能力。詳情請參閱第95頁有關流動性及市場風險的內容。\n\n在行為監管方面，金融管理局展開了證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（MPF）相關業務以及消費者保護範疇的現場檢查，並針對高風險或新型措施進行專題審查。\n\n2023年，金融管理局的監管活動摘要見表1。\n\n表 1 監管活動概要\n\n# 信貸風險\n\n# 信貸增長與資產質量\n\n2023年，總貸款較2022年減少3.6%，而2022年為減少3.0%。表2顯示貸款及預付款項的增長細節。內地相關貸款減少6.6%，至香港元4226億元（見表3）。\n\n表 2 貸款及預付款項增長\n\n表 3 內地相關貸款增長\n\n2023年，金融管理局加強對銀行資產質量的監測和信用風險管理的評估，特別是在高利率環境和內地樓市持續疲軟的背景下。銀行業的資產質量有所下滑，但仍在可控範圍內。2023年底，銀行業的不良貸款比率為1.56%，較2022年底的1.40%有所上升。內地相關貸款的不良貸款比率由2022年底的2.26%升至2.58%。\n\n年內，金融管理局針對脆弱行業、保費融資、境外經營信用風險管理及非銀行金融機構的曝險情況進行了專題審查。\n\n# 緩解銀行客戶的現金流壓力\n\n金融管理局與銀行業中小企業（SME）貸款協調機制於7月宣布正式退出預先批准的本金還款假期計劃。該計劃自2020年5月推出，旨在幫助符合條件的企業渡過疫情。考慮到商業界的意見，部分本金償還安排得到改善，以協助企業逐步恢復正常還款。即使在疫情結束後，仍有行業或個別借款人面臨困難，銀行亦持續根據個別情況提供本金展期或其他適合的信貸緩解措施。\n\n金融管理局亦鼓勵銀行同情心對待未參與該計劃但因個別情況面臨現金流壓力的企業的資金需求。並提醒銀行遵循「香港企業困難處理方針」的指引，與遇到還款困難的企業合作，以共同利益行事。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n自2009年以來，香港金融管理局多次推出逆周期宏觀審慎措施，加強銀行對房地產按揭業務的風險管理及银行應對房價急劇調整的能力。2023年，新批核的住宅按揭貸款的平均成數（LTV）為57%，較2009年9月推出逆周期措施前的64%有所降低（見圖1）。新按揭貸款的平均償付比率（DSR）保持較低水平，2023年為40%，較2010年8月首次設置的41%有所降低。\n\n7月7日，金融管理局調整了逆周期宏觀審慎措施，考慮到房價、交易量及本地外經濟狀況等因素。這是自2009年措施推出以來，首次放寬住宅物業的逆周期宏觀審慎措施。調整內容包括提高住宅和商業物業的最高成數上限，以及基於按揭申請人淨資產估算的按揭貸款成數上限。此外，針對收入主要來自港以外地區的借款人，取消降低最高成數和償付比率上限10%的要求，亦取消對超出香港金融管理局正常LTV上限20%的按揭申請人執行成數和DSR限制削減5%的規定。"}
{"en": "# International Financial Centre\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA utilised a multi-pronged approach to achieve notable progress in consolidating Hong Kong’s status as a globally competitive international financial centre.\n\nThe success of two major events, namely the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit and the HKMA-BIS High-Level Conference, had reinforced Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre and created positive ripple effects.\n\nThe HKMA, together with its Mainland and Hong Kong counterparts, made concerted efforts to deepen and widen the mutual access between the financial markets of Hong Kong and the Mainland. This included enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Scheme in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, the designation of additional market makers for Southbound Trading under Bond Connect, the successful launch of Northbound Trading of Swap Connect, and the roll-out of the HKD-RMB Dual Counter Model and the Dual Counter Market Making Programme. These initiatives were effective in strengthening Hong Kong’s gateway position and reinforcing the city’s status as a global hub for offshore renminbi business.\n\nThe HKMA also made good progress in strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, in areas including bond issuance, asset and wealth management, green and sustainable finance, and corporate treasury centres. To promote Hong Kong’s financial services, the HKMA stepped up its market outreach activities to overseas and Mainland stakeholders to keep them well informed about the opportunities in Hong Kong’s financial market and its resilience.\n\nSignificant progress has been made on all fronts of the HKMA’s “Fintech 2025” strategy, including in areas such as promoting fintech adoption, Central Bank Digital Currency, data infrastructure, talent development, and policies and funding support.\n\nThe Faster Payment System (FPS) marked its fifth anniversary in September. The number of registrations has grown steadily, and had reached 13.6 million at the end of 2023. The average daily turnover for the year rose to 1.25 million real-time transactions. FPS x PromptPay link for cross-border QR payment between Hong Kong and Thailand was jointly launched with the Bank of Thailand in December, providing a fast, secure and easily accessible cross-border retail payment service for people travelling between the two places.\n\nAs an active member of many international and regional central banking and regulatory forums, the HKMA continued to contribute to global efforts to maintain financial stability and promote financial market developments.\n\n# Overview\n\nThroughout the year, the HKMA continued making proactive efforts to strengthen Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre. In November, it organised the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit for the second year. This three-day event brought together prominent financial leaders from around the world to share their unique perspectives under the theme of “Living with Complexity”. With over 350 participants from 160 international financial institutions attending, the summit clearly showed the global financial sector’s commitment to and confidence in Hong Kong. In the same month, the HKMA and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) co-hosted the HKMA-BIS High Level Conference, which attracted more than 300 participants, including over 20 current and former central bank governors. The conference highlighted the HKMA’s close collaboration with the BIS as well as with the international central banking community.\n\nThe expansion of and enhancements made to the MainlandHong Kong Connect schemes have reinforced Hong Kong’s role as the bridge between the Mainland and international financial markets. A series of enhancements to the Crossboundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) scheme were introduced to facilitate cross-boundary retail investment in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA). Riding on the smooth operations of Southbound Bond Connect, the HKMA designated nine additional market makers to improve secondary liquidity and meet investor demand. Northbound Trading of Swap Connect was successfully launched in the year, enabling global investors to better manage the interest rate risks associated with their Mainland fixed income portfolio via Hong Kong.\n\nHong Kong’s offshore renminbi businesses saw robust growth during the year. The HKMA collaborated with the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) to launch the HKD-RMB Dual Counter Model and the Dual Counter Market Making Programme in June. This helped develop a more diverse range of renminbi-denominated products in Hong Kong by facilitating the issuance and trading of renminbidenominated stocks in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA continued to work on strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. In particular, to enhance Hong Kong’s appeal as a preferred fund management centre, the HKMA worked closely with the Government and the financial industry to provide a more facilitative tax and regulatory environment. Significant progress was also made in promoting innovation in Hong Kong’s bond market, and consolidating Hong Kong’s position as a regional green and sustainable finance hub. At the same time, the HKMA stepped up its market outreach activities to promote Hong Kong’s financial services to overseas and Mainland stakeholders.\n\nBoth the Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO) and the banking departments of the HKMA continued to implement the “Fintech 2025” strategy1 to promote wide adoption of financial technology (fintech) and strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia. Key initiatives implemented during the year included:\n- promoting further adoption in the tech focus areas of Wealthtech, Insurtech, Greentech, artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology (DLT);\n- advancing the work on wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) to improve cross-border payments;\n- progressing further in the study on the prospect of introducing a retail CBDC in Hong Kong, i.e. an e-HKD;\n- stepping up efforts to develop Commercial Data Interchange (CDI);\n- enhancing talent development;\n- nurturing the fintech ecosystem through funding and policies;\n- strengthening cross-border collaboration in fintech; and\n- expanding the adoption of the FPS.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure is vital for maintaining the city’s position as a leading international financial centre. In 2023, the four interbank Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) and the Hong Kong Trade Repository (HKTR) achieved 100%2 system availability, outperforming the target of 99.95%. The debt securities settlement service, including the Northbound and Southbound Bond Connect linkage service, continued to operate smoothly.\n\nAdoption of the FPS continued to increase in 2023, marking the significant milestone of the FPS reaching its fifth anniversary. The number of registrations for the FPS and the FPS turnover have grown steadily over the past five years, with the number of registrations growing to 13.6 million at the end of 2023 and the average daily turnover for the year rising by 33% from 2022. The increased use of the FPS for settling Government bills, making merchant payments, and topping up Stored Value Facility (SVF) e-wallets or bank accounts, were key drivers for the continued rise in the transaction volume, on top of steady growth in person-toperson and business payments.\n\nTo ensure the safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA oversees six designated retail payment systems (RPSs) and supervises 17 licensed SVFs (four of which are SVFs issued by licensed banks) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO). During the year, the HKMA also continued to facilitate the smooth implementation of the Government’s Consumption Voucher Scheme, helping to co-ordinate the relevant Government parties and the SVF licensees appointed for the scheme, and facilitate dialogue and co-operation between them.\n\nOn 27 December, the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau and the HKMA jointly issued a public consultation paper on regulation for stablecoin issuers. The HKMA subsequently introduced a sandbox arrangement on 12 March 2024 for institutions planning to issue fiat-referenced stablecoins in Hong Kong. At the same time, the HKMA has been actively participating in the work of international bodies in relation to crypto-asset activities, and monitoring the development of the market closely.\n\nInternationally, the HKMA has remained an active member of the central banking community and continued to play a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees. Currently, the HKMA co-chairs the Policy and Standards Group of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), as well as the Regional Consultative Group for Asia, the Non-Bank Monitoring Experts Group (until June) and the Financial Innovation Network of the Financial Stability Board (FSB). The HKMA also chairs the BIS’ Meeting of Governors from Major Emerging Market Economies (EMEs). Between 2018 and 2023, the HKMA served consecutive terms as the chair of the Working Group on Financial Markets established under the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP)3.\n\nThe HKMA also held bilateral meetings with the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates and the Saudi Central Bank in May and July respectively to promote investment and financial market connectivity between the Middle East and Asia. The sixth Hong Kong-Switzerland Financial Dialogue was held in Bern, Switzerland on 25 September, and the discussion covered topics on regional and domestic outlook and policy challenges, latest development, and potential collaboration in the areas of sustainable finance, fintech, and market connectivity.\n\n# A glance at the HKMA’s initiatives in 2023 in strengthening Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre\n\n# Strengthen connections with the world\n\n- Hosted series of international events: Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit, HKMA-BIS High-Level Conference and HKMA-BIS Joint Conference and Basel Committee meeting\n- Active participation in international central banking and regulatory forums\n- Stepped up market outreach to overseas and Mainland stakeholders to promote Hong Kong’s financial services and laid solid foundation for collaboration with Middle East\n\n# Enhance financial platform competitiveness\n\n- Promoted bond market innovation by assisting the Government to issue the world’s first tokenised government green bond\n- Supported dim sum bond issuances by Shenzhen and Hainan governments in Hong Kong\n- Signed Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the National Development and Reform Commission to support cross-border financing by Chinese enterprises in Hong Kong\n- Enhanced tax concession regimes for family offices and asset and wealth management industries\n- Continued raising Hong Kong’s value proposition as a Corporate Treasury Centre (CTC) hub and financing hub for infrastructure investments\n- Continued the development of Hong Kong’s treasury market and over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market\n- Consolidation of Hong Kong’s position as a regional green and sustainable finance hub\n\n# Ensure the reliability and efficiency of Hong Kong’s critical financial infrastructure\n\n- Continued to ensure the safe and efficient operation of the RTGS systems, CMU and the HKTR\n- Progressed with the upgrade of the CMU’s operational capacity and product offerings to develop the system into a major international central securities depository\n\n# Nurture future finance leaders and strengthen applied research capabilities\n\n- Continued the leadership development and research efforts by the Hong Kong Academy of Finance (AoF)\n\n# Deepen connectivity between the financial markets of Hong Kong and the Mainland and enhance Hong Kong’s role as an offshore renminbi business hub\n\n- Successful launch of Northbound Trading of Swap Connect\n- Enhancements to Cross-Boundary WMC\n- Designation of additional market makers for Southbound Trading under Bond Connect\n- Rollout of HKD-RMB Dual Counter Model and Dual Counter Market Making Programme\n- Good progress on initiatives to support corporates’ business operations and the livelihoods of residents in the GBA, e.g. enhanced cross-boundary fund flow management for GBA corporates, facilitative measures for Hong Kong residents on property purchases in GBA’s Mainland cities\n- Deepened exchanges between Mainland agencies and financial industry in Hong Kong to identify business opportunities\n\n# Reinforce Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia\n\n- Continued implementation of the “Fintech 2025” Strategy:\n    -

{"en": "# Reserves Management\n\nThe investment environment in 2023 was volatile and challenging. Although some banks in the US and Europe experienced liquidity issues at the beginning of the year, the associated risks did not spread across the financial markets. While levels of inflation in major developed economies have declined from their peak in 2023, they have remained above the targets set by major central banks. Following an aggressive rate hike cycle, the US Federal Reserve has paused hiking rate since the third quarter, and indicated that the policy rate was likely at or near its peak. This, coupled with a resilient US economy, has made investor sentiment more optimistic. However, ongoing geopolitical tensions, such as the Russia-Ukraine war and the outbreak of conflict in the Middle East during the year, added turbulence and uncertainties to the investment market. In this complicated and dynamic investment environment, the investment performance of the Exchange Fund experienced some ups and downs. Despite this, the Exchange Fund managed to achieve a decent investment return. In 2023, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$226.0 billion, representing an investment return of 5.5%.\n\n# The Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems in order to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The HKMA, under the delegated authority of the Financial Secretary and within the terms of the delegation, is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# Management of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(i) To preserve capital;\n(ii) To ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(iii) To ensure that sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(iv) Subject to (i)–(iii), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Exchange Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 Portfolio segregation of the Exchange Fund\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP). The BP holds highly liquid US dollardenominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base, as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The IP invests primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member economies of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, with a view to preserving the value and long-term purchasing power of its assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA diversifies part of the Exchange Fund’s investments in a prudent and incremental manner into a wider variety of asset classes. These include emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The target asset allocation of the LTGP is determined concurrently with that of other asset classes, subject to prudent risk management principles and portfolio diversification strategy.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007, holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that have been acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes. Due to its unique nature, the Strategic Portfolio is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by the Fiscal Reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP1. A major exception is the Future Fund2, which links its interest rate to the return of both the IP and the LTGP in accordance with the portfolio mix. The portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 35:65 in 2023.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: strategic asset allocation and tactical asset allocation. Strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents long-term asset allocation based on the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark (or strategic) allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and tracking error3 limit are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with the EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may assume positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nThe HKMA’s Exchange Fund Investment Office houses the Exchange Fund’s investment and related risk management functions. Exchange Fund Investment Office staff members directly manage about 71% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, comprising the entire BP and part of the IP. The part of the IP managed internally includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 29% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes. The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to realise sustainable returns, while also drawing on diverse and complementary investment styles and taking advantage of external market insights and technical expertise in investment.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is determined primarily by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nAs the investment environment becomes more complex, good risk management is increasingly important. The HKMA sets stringent controls and investment guidelines for both its internally and externally managed portfolios, and ensures that a proper risk monitoring and compliance system is in place. Three lines of defence are in place to implement effective risk management and governance of investment-related activities. Key risk categories (including credit, market, liquidity and operational risks) are regularly monitored. The risk management process provides a robust framework that supports the HKMA’s strategic planning and investment diversification efforts.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nThe HKMA believes that an appropriate emphasis on responsible investment and sustainable long-term economic performance can help better achieve the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund, as well as reduce risks associated with environmental, social and governance (ESG)-related matters of its underlying investments. To embrace responsible investment practices, the HKMA has integrated ESG factors into the investment processes of the Exchange Fund, with the guiding principle that priority will generally be given to ESG investments if their long-term risk-adjusted returns are comparable with other investments. For more details about the HKMA’s responsible investment work, see the Responsible Investment chapter of the Sustainability Report 2023.\n\n# Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\n# The financial markets in 2023\n\nThe investment environment in 2023 was volatile and challenging.\n\nGlobal equities were generally on an upward trend in 2023. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose by 24% during the year, especially in the fourth quarter as markets began to anticipate sooner-than-expected rate cuts.\n\nIn the bond markets, yields remained high, with the 10-year US Treasury yield surging above 5% at one point to reach its highest level since 2007. However, as market expectations of central banks’ monetary policies shifted, bond yields retreated towards the end of the year alongside a gradual increase in bond prices.\n\nIn the currency markets, the US dollar recorded a mixed performance against major currencies. Among these, the pound sterling and the euro appreciated against the US dollar, while the yen and the renminbi depreciated.\n\nThe performance of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2023 is shown in Table 1.\n\nTable 1 2023 market returns\n\n# Reserves Management\n\n# Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$226.0 billion in 2023. This comprised gains on bonds of HK$144.7 billion, gains on equities of HK$58.1 billion (with gains of HK$73.6 billion from foreign equities, and losses of HK$15.5 billion from Hong Kong equities), a negative currency translation effect of HK$0.5 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets, and gains of HK$23.7 billion on other investments held by the investment-holding subsidiaries of the Fund. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation loss of HK$4.8 billion.\n\nTotal assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,016.5 billion at the end of the year. The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$517.3 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$411.9 billion and real estate HK$105.4 billion. Outstanding investment commitments of the LTGP amounted to HK$291.1 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund in 2023, excluding the Strategic Portfolio, was 5.5%. The returns of the IP and the BP were 6.4% and 5.0% respectively. The LTGP has recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 11.8% since its inception in 2009.\n\nThe annual returns of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2023 are set out in Chart 1. Table 2 shows the 2023 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over several different time horizons. The average return was 1.6% during 2021–2023, 3.3% during 2019–2023, 2.7% during 2014–2023 and 4.5% since 1994. Table 3 shows the currency mix of the Fund’s assets on 31 December 2023.\n\nSee pages 205 to 311 for the audited 2023 financial statements of the Exchange Fund.\n\nChart 1 Investment return of the Exchange Fund (1994–2023)\n\nTable 2 Investment return of the Exchange Fund in Hong Kong dollar terms\n\nTable 3 Currency mix of the Exchange Fund’s assets on 31 December 2023 (including forward transactions)\n", "zh": "儲備管理\n\n2023年的投資環境充滿波動與挑戰。儘管美國和歐洲的部分銀行在年初出現流動性危機，但相關風險並未擴散到整個金融市場。主要發達經濟體的通脹水平已從2023年的高點回落，但仍高於各主要中央銀行設定的目標。美國聯邦儲備局在一輪積極的升息循環後，自第三季度起暫停升息，並表示政策利率可能已到達或接近峰值，這再加上美國經濟的韌性，使投資者情緒更為樂觀。然而，俄羅斯-烏克蘭 war 及本年度中東地區的衝突爆發等持續的地緣政治緊張局勢，為投資市場增添了波動性與不確定性。在這個複雜且充滿變化的投資環境下，財政司署基金的投資表現經歷了一些起伏。儘管如此，財政司署基金仍成功實現了不錯的投資回報。2023年，該基金錄得投資收入港幣2260億元，投資回報率為5.5%。\n\n財政司署基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》，外匯基金的主要目標是直接或間接影響香港貨幣的匯率。基金亦可用於維持香港貨幣與金融系統的穩定與完整，以促進香港作為國際金融中心的地位。財經事務司司長委任的差託範圍下，香港金融管理局負責外匯基金的運用與投資管理，並向財經司司長負責。\n\n外匯基金的管理\n\n投資目標與資產組合結構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）為外匯基金設定了以下投資目標：\n\n(i) 保持資本價值；\n(ii) 確保整個貨幣基數在任何時候都由高流動性、以美元計價的資產充分支持；\n(iii) 確保有足夠的流動性以維持貨幣和金融穩定；以及\n(iv) 在符合(i)至(ii)條款的前提下，實現能長期幫助維持外匯基金購買力的投資回報。\n\n這些目標充分考慮了外匯基金的法定宗旨，並已融入基金的資產結構與目標資產配置（見圖1）。\n\n圖1：外匯基金資產配置分類\n\n概括而言，外匯基金主要有兩大資產組合：支撐組合（BP）和投資組合（IP）。支撐組合持有高流動性、以美元計價的資產，以完全支持貨幣基數，這是貨幣局安排的貨幣發行制度的要求。投資組合則主要投資於經合組織（OECD）會員經濟體的債券和股票市場，旨在保存資產的價值與長期購買力。\n\n為了更好地管理風險並提升中長期回報，香港金融管理局採取審慎逐步的多元化策略，將部分外匯基金投資於更多資產類別，包括新興市場及內地債券和股票、私募股權（含基礎設施投資）及房地產。新興市場及內地債券和股票由投資組合（IP）持有，而私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合（LTGP）持有。LTGP的目標資產配置與其他資產類別同步決定，並遵循審慎的風險管理和資產配置策略。\n\n戰略性投資組合（Strategic Portfolio）於2007年成立，持有香港交易及結算有限公司（HKEX）已由政府以戰略目的為外匯基金收購的股份。由於其特殊性，戰略性投資組合不計入基金的投資績效評估。\n\n與外匯基金的存放安排\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定機構的存放安排。利率通常會與投資組合（IP）的表現掛鈎，一個主要的例外是未來基金（Future Fund），其利率根據IP與LTGP的投資組合比例計算。2023年，未來基金在IP與LTGP之間的投資比例約為35:65。\n\n投資程序\n\n外匯基金的投資程序基於兩種資產配置決策：戰略資產配置和策略性資產配置。戰略資產配置反映於投資基準，代表基於外匯基金投資目標的長期資產配置。遵循戰略配置，進行策略性資產配置，以期獲得超越基準的超額回報，這意味着實際配置通常會偏離基準（或戰略）配置。實際與基準配置之間的偏差稱為“策略偏差”。雖然基準和追蹤誤差由財經司司長在與EFAC協商後決定，但策略性決策和策略偏差的允許範圍由香港金融管理局在授權下制定。在允許的範圍內，資產管理者可以根據短期市場動向調整持倉。\n\n投資管理\n\n直接投資\n\n香港金融管理局的外匯基金投資辦事處負責外匯基金的投資及相關風險管理工作。該辦事處直接管理約71%的基金投資，包括整個支撐組合及部分投資組合。內部管理的投資組合涵蓋全球固定收益市場及多個宏觀風險管理策略的衍生品組合。\n\n使用外部基金經理\n\n除了內部管理外，香港金融管理局亦聘用外部基金經理負責約29%的資產，包括所有上市股票及其他專門資產類別。聘用外部經理的目的在於利用市場上最優秀的投資專業知識，以實現可持續的回報，同時借助多樣且互補的投資風格，並利用外部市場見解及專業技術。\n\n外部管理費用包括基金管理費、保管人費用、交易費用及預扣稅等，主要由市場因素決定，年度可能有所波動。\n\n風險管理與合規\n\n隨著投資環境愈發複雜，良好的風險管理越來越重要。香港金融管理局為其內部和外部管理的資產持有嚴格控制與投資指引，確保建立完善的風險監控與合規系統。該機制包括三道防線，以有效落實風險管理和投資治理。關鍵風險類別（包括信用、市場、流動性與操作風險）定期受到監控。風險管理流程提供堅實的框架，支援香港金融管理局的戰略規劃與投資多元化努力。\n\n負責任投資\n\n香港金融管理局認為，重視負責任投資與推行長期可持續經濟表現，有助於更好地實現外匯基金的投資目標，並降低其底層投資的環境、社會及治理（ESG）相關風險。為推行負責任投資作業，香港金融管理局已將ESG因素融入外匯基金的投資流程，並以ESG投資的長期風險調整回報與其他投資相當為原則。關於香港金融管理局的負責任投資工作，詳見2023年永續發展報告的“負責任投資”章節。\n\n外匯基金的績效\n\n2023年的金融市場\n\n2023年的投資環境充滿波動與挑戰。\n\n全球股市大致呈上升趨勢。標準普爾500指數全年上升了24%，尤其在第四季度，市場開始預期利率將比預期更早下調。\n\n在債券市場方面，收益率保持高企，10年期美國國債收益率一度突破5%，達到自2007年以來的最高水平。然而，隨著市場對中央銀行貨幣政策的預期轉變，年底前債券收益率逐步回落，伴隨著債券價格的逐漸上升。\n\n在貨幣市場方面，美元對主要貨幣的表現複雜。其中，英鎊及歐元相對美元升值，而日元與人民幣則走跌。\n\n2023年前述主要貨幣、債券及股票市場的表現見表1。\n\n表1：2023年市場回報\n\n外匯基金的績效\n\n外匯基金在2023年錄得投資收入港幣2260億元，包括債券收益1447億元，股票收益581億元（其中外國股票收益736億元，而本地股票則虧損155億元），非港幣資產的貨幣轉換負向影響0.5億元，以及由投資持有子公司持有的其他投資獲得的收益237億元。另，戰略性投資組合錄得估值損失48億元。\n\n年終外匯基金總資產達到401,650億元。長期增長組合的投資市值為5173億元，其中私募股權為4119億元，房地產為1054億元。LTGP尚未完成的投資承諾金額為2911億元。\n\n2023年，除戰略性投資組合外，外匯基金的投資回報率為5.5%。投資組合（IP）與支撐組合（BP）的回報率分別為6.4%及5.0%。自2009年成立以來，LTGP已錄得年化內部回報率11.8%。\n\n從1994年至2023年的年度投資回報率見圖1。表2列出了2023年的投資回報及基金在不同時間範圍的平均投資回報率。在2021–2023年，平均回報為1.6%；2019–2023年為3.3%；2014–2023年為2.7%；自1994年起至今則為4.5%。表3展示了截至2023年12月31日基金資產的貨幣構成。\n\n詳見第205至311頁的2023年外匯基金經審核財務報表。\n\n圖1：外匯基金投資回報（1994–2023）\n\n表2：2023年外匯基金以港幣計的投資回報\n\n表3：截至2023年12月31日外匯基金資產的貨幣構成（包括遠期交易）"}

The Annual Report 2022 received a Gold Award in the “Non-profit Making and Charitable Organizations” category, the highest ranking within the category, at the Hong Kong Management Association’s 2023 Best Annual Reports Awards. Meanwhile, the Sustainability Report 2022 won the ESG Award in the Public Sector/Not-for-profit (Large) Category of the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants’ Best Corporate Governance and ESG Awards 2023.\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA published two issues of its Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report and four issues of its Quarterly Bulletin, and regularly updated its Monthly Statistical Bulletin to provide up-to-date and thematic information on and analyses of monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. The HKMA also published 14 inSight1 articles in which it introduced major new policies and initiatives and discussed topical issues.\n\n# Corporate website\n\nThe corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk), with nearly 60,000 pages of content in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, is the public gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It contains the register of authorized institutions (AIs) and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance (BO), as well as the register of stored value facility licensees under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance.\n\nThe HKMA has been releasing financial data and important information on its website via an Open Application Programming Interface (Open API) in phases since 2018. By the end of 2023, the HKMA had opened up 175 sets of Open APIs on its website, in line with its target schedule.\n\nThe HKMA’s Open API portal:\n\n# Information Centre\n\nLocated on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre, the HKMA Information Centre consists of an exhibition area and a library designed to introduce the work of the HKMA to the community and enhance public awareness of monetary and banking matters. The interactive exhibition area presents an overview of the HKMA’s work, and of the development of money and banking in Hong Kong, along with information and exhibits useful for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nDuring the year, the Information Centre welcomed more than 31,000 visitors and hosted over 480 guided tours for schools and other groups.\n\nThe library, next to the exhibition area, houses over 26,000 books, journals and other publications on Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs as well as central banking topics.

To date, more than 66,000 people have participated in the public education programme. In 2023, a webinar was organised for over 1,200 students and teachers from 58 secondary schools. The webinar topics included an overview of the HKMA’s work, the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, protection of personal digital keys, the Deposit Protection Scheme, green finance, and career opportunities in the banking industry.\n\nThe HKMA educates and engages the public on how to be smart and responsible financial consumers. In light of the rise in phishing scams and credit card fraud, the HKMA continued its efforts across different media to remind the public to stay vigilant. A brand new awareness campaign was rolled out following the launch of the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter, emphasising that banks and major merchants have committed not to send hyperlinks via instant electronic messages soliciting personal and credit card information. The HKMA also passed on smart tips on credit cards, personal loans, online shopping, banking services and different payment options (including “Buy Now, Pay Later” products) via radio and social media channels.\n\nA new video and animations with cannibal plant and animal trap are produced with the theme “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!”\n\nCross-media publicity is produced reminding members of the public not to click on suspicious links\n\nAnimated video to promote e-laisees\n\nIn support of the environment, and drawing on technological advances in financial services, the HKMA encouraged members of the public to give out electronic lai sees (e-laisees) and to consider using good-as-new banknotes for physical lai sees over the Chinese New Year through social media and radio promotions.\n\nThe HKMA also seeks to enhance public understanding of the financial industry and raise young people’s interest in pursuing a career in the industry, thus enlarging Hong Kong’s talent pool for the financial industry. Following positive feedback for its earlier video series “Four Faces of Talents in Central”, the HKMA launched a new video series titled “Financial Special Forces: Unleashing New Horizons” that featured four growth areas in the financial industry: data science, fintech, green and sustainable finance, and wealth management. The video series utilised computer graphics and animation to show seasoned market practitioners supervising young talents as they managed daily work challenges, providing a light-touch introduction to career opportunities and prospects within the industry.\n\nA video series “Financial Special Forces: Unleashing New Horizons” is produced to keep the younger generation abreast of career opportunities in finance\n\nMentors from different areas sharing their expertise and experience with students\n\nTo enhance financial literacy among secondary school students, the HKMA worked with other stakeholders to co-organise the “Hong Kong Financial Literacy Championship” for the ninth consecutive year. Under the theme of digital and sustainable economy, the event helped students learn more about money management, green and sustainability, the current state of the financial market and career opportunities. It also included an online quiz that received around 20,000 submissions, mentoring by experienced practitioners from diverse areas, and design thinking challenge.\n\n# $mart Money Management 321\n\nThe HKMA launched its first financial education board game called “$mart Money Management 321”, which is jointly designed and developed with a social enterprise specialising in board game production. The board game was designed to help primary school students learn about different payment methods, money management concepts, fintech and cybersecurity in a simulated setting.\n\nThe HKMA took a booth at the Hong Kong Book Fair 2023 to promote the board game, which was one of the best-selling items at the Fair. In addition, the HKMA organised a series of free promotional activities, which included workshops in community centres, trials for students in primary schools, and train-the-trainer workshops for primary school teachers and social workers at non-governmental organisations, as well as running a “$mart Money Management Experiential Centre” at PMQ during the festive season.\n\nThe HKMA’s first financial education board game, “$mart Money Management 321”, and the “$mart Money Management Experiential Centre” receive several international design awards\n\nFollowing its launch at the Hong Kong Book Fair, the board game is promoted through train-the-trainer workshops, student trial sessions and an experiential centre at PMQ\n\nThe HKMA also collaborated with different stakeholders in a number of community engagement programmes. One of these was the second phase of a cross-generation outreach educational programme, organised jointly with an educational institution. It included a bank simulation game along with talks targeting kindergarten students, their parents and teachers, and young adults.\n\nThe HKMA continued to support the work of the Investor and Financial Education Council in promoting financial literacy and financial capacity in Hong Kong. It will explore further collaboration with different stakeholders to maximise the impact of its community engagement work.\n\n# Financial disclosure\n\nTo maintain a high level of transparency, the HKMA adopts international standards in financial disclosure insofar as they are applicable to central banking operations. These include the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and other applicable reporting requirements, such as the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard. The Finance Division works with external auditors and other accounting professionals to prepare and present the Exchange Fund’s financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards. The HKMA also provides detailed disclosures and thorough analyses of a wide range of expense items and budgetary information in its Annual Report.\n\n# Accountability and controls\n\n# Risk management\n\nOne of the HKMA’s most important tasks is to manage risks to the monetary and banking systems.

{"en": "# The Exchange Fund\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 211 to 311, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2023, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including material accounting policy information.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2023, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards. My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report. I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises all the information included in the 2023 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. I also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and\n- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nProf. LAM Chi Yuen Nelson\nDirector of Audit\n\n# 1 PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES\n\nThe Monetary Authority, under delegated authority from the Financial Secretary as Controller of the Exchange Fund (the Fund), manages the Fund in accordance with the provisions of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66). The principal activities of the Fund are safeguarding the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong and maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems.\n\nThe assets of the Fund are managed as four portfolios: the Backing Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio and the Strategic Portfolio. The assets of the Backing Portfolio fully match the Monetary Base, under Hong Kong’s Currency Board system. The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The Long-Term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments. The Strategic Portfolio holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited acquired by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government for the account of the Fund for strategic purposes. Operating segment information is set out in note 31.\n\n# 2 MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n# 2.1 Statement of compliance\n\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRSs), which is a collective term that includes all applicable individual HKFRSs, Hong Kong Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), and accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong. Material accounting policies adopted by the Fund and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) is set out below.\n\nThe HKICPA has issued certain new or revised HKFRSs that are first effective or available for early adoption for the current accounting period of the Group. Note 3 provides information on the changes, if any, in accounting policies resulting from initial application of these developments to the extent that they are relevant to the Group for the current and prior accounting periods reflected in these financial statements.\n\n# 2.2 Basis of preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe Group financial statements include the financial statements of the Group as well as the Group’s interests in associates and joint ventures. The principal activities of the principal subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are shown in notes 16 and 17.\n\nThe measurement basis used in the preparation of the financial statements is historical cost except for the following assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value:\n- derivative financial instruments (note 2.6);\n- financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value through income and expenditure account (note 2.6);\n- financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (note 2.6);\n- gold (note 2.10); and\n- investment properties (note 2.11).\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with HKFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nJudgements made by management in the application of HKFRSs that have significant effect on the financial statements and major sources of estimation uncertainty are disclosed in note 2.18.\n\nCertain comparative figures have been restated to conform to the current year presentation of the Group financial statements.\n\n# 2.3 Subsidiaries and non-controlling interests\n\nA subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. When assessing whether the Group has power, only substantive rights (held by the Group and other parties) are considered.\n", "zh": "基金交易帳\n\n審計署署長報告\n\n獨立核數師致財政司司長的報告\n\n意見\n\n我證明，我已審核交易基金及其附屬公司（「本集團」）的財務報表，該等財務表列於第211至311頁，包括截至2023年12月31日的交易基金及本集團的資產負債表及其當年終結的收支帳、全面收入表、權益變動表及現金流量表，以及財務報表附註，包括重要會計政策資料。\n\n我認為，該等財務報表公允反映基金及本集團於2023年12月31日的財務狀況，以及其當年的財務表現和現金流量，並已根據香港會計師公會（「HKICPA」）發出的《香港財務報告準則》（「HKFRSs」），並遵循第66章《交易基金條例》下行政長官根據第7節的指令妥善編制。\n\n意見基礎\n\n我以按照《交易基金條例》第7節所作的行政長官指令及審計署審計準則進行審計。這些準則下，我的責任於審計師責任章節中進一步描述。根據這些準則，我與本集團保持獨立，並已履行其他倫理責任。我相信我已收集的審計證據足夠及適當，以作為我意見的基礎。\n\n主要審計事項\n\n主要審計事項是指我專業判斷中，在我審核截至2023年12月31日當年財務報表時，最具重要性的事項。這些事項是在我整體審核財務報表及形成意見的背景下處理的，我不就這些事項另行出具意見。\n\n其他資料\n\n貨幣管理局負責其他資料。其他資料包括香港金融管理局2023年度報告中所有資料，除財務報表及我所作的核數師報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見不涵蓋其他資料，也不對其提供任何形式的保證結論。\n\n在審核財務報表過程中，我的責任是閱讀其他資料，並在此過程中，考慮該資料是否與財務報表或我在審計中獲得的知識有重大不一致的情況，或似乎存在重大失誤。如我根據已完成的工作得出結論認為該資料存在重大失誤，我須予以報告。在這方面，我無事報告。\n\n貨幣管理局及交易基金諮詢委員會審計小組會計師就財務報表的責任\n\n貨幣管理局負責按香港會計師公會頒布的HKFRSs及第66章《交易基金條例》下行政長官的指令，編製能夠真實反映財務狀況的財務報表；也負責建立必要的內部控制，以確保財務報表不因欺詐或錯誤而出現重大失誤。\n\n在製作財務報表時，貨幣管理局需評估本集團繼續經營的能力，並在適當時披露相關持續經營事項，並以持續經營作為會計基礎。\n\n交易基金諮詢委員會的審計小組負責監督財務報告程序。\n\n核數師對財務報表的審核責任\n\n我的目標是獲取合理確信，判斷整體財務報表是否不存在因欺詐或錯誤而造成的重大失誤，並發出包含我意見的核數報告。合理確信是一個高水平的確信，但不能保證按照審計署審計準則進行的審計一定能發現所有存在的重大失誤。錯誤或欺詐都可能導致失誤，如果單獨或合計起來，合理預期能影響使用該財務報表作出經濟決策的用戶。\n\n按照審計署審計準則進行審計時，我會運用專業判斷並保持專業懷疑。我亦須：\n\n- 識別及評估財務報表可能存有重大失誤的風險，設計並執行響應那些風險的審計程序，並獲得足夠且適當的審計證據，以構成本人意見的基礎。由欺詐導致的重大失誤不易被發現的風險高於錯誤，因欺詐可能涉及串謀、偽造、故意遺漏、虛假陳述或凌駕內部控制；\n- 獲取與審計相關的內部控制理解，以設計適當的審計程序，但不為了表達對集團內部控制有效性的意見；\n- 評估貨幣管理局所採用的會計政策的適當性及其會計估計和相關披露的合理性；\n- 對貨幣管理局使用持續經營基礎的適當性作出結論，並根據已獲得的審計證據，判斷是否存在可能對本集團持續經營能力構成重大疑慮的重大不確定性。如判斷存在這種不確定性，我須在我的審計報告中指出與財務報表公開披露有關的事項，或如披露不足，則修正我的意見。我的結論以我獲得的審計證據為依據，但未來的事件或條件可能導致本集團停止經營；\n- 評估財務報表的整體呈現、結構與內容，包括披露內容，是否以公平呈現交易和事件的方式；\n- 獲得足夠且適當的審計證據，對本集團內部各單位或業務活動的財務資料發表意見。我負責指導、監督及執行集團審計，並對我的審計意見保持唯一責任。\n\n我會就計劃的審計範圍和時間及重大審計結果，包括我在審計期間發現的任何重大內部控制缺陷，與交易基金諮詢委員會的審計小組溝通。\n\n我亦會向交易基金諮詢委員會的審計小組出具聲明，證明我已遵守有關獨立性之倫理規定，並就所有合理認為可能影響我獨立性的關係及其他事項（如有），予以披露及相應的保障措施。\n\n經與審計小組溝通的事項中，我會確定此次財務報表審計中最重要的事項，及因此為主要審計事項。如法律或規例禁止公開披露，或在非常少見的情況下，認為披露之不利後果遠遠超過公開利益，則這些事項不會在我的核數報告中披露。\n\n林志遠教授 審計署署長\n\n第一主要活動\n\n貨幣管理局由財政司署長代表交付管理貨幣基金（即基金）的授權，根據《交易基金條例》（第66章）條款管理基金。基金的主要職能是保護港幣的兌換價值，以及維持香港貨幣和金融系統的穩定與完整。\n\n基金的資產被管理為四個投資組合：後備投資組合、投資組合、長期成長投資組合及策略投資組合。後備投資組合的資產完全匹配貨幣基數，按照香港貨幣局制度運作。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作暨發展組織（OECD）成員國的債券和股票市場。長期成長投資組合持有私募股權和房地產投資。策略投資組合持有由香港特別行政區（HKSAR）政府代表基金收購的香港交易所股份，以達到策略性目的。營運範疇的資料詳見第31號附註。\n\n第二重要會計政策\n\n第二章.1 符合性聲明\n\n本財務報表根據香港財務報告標準（HKFRSs）編製，該術語包括香港會計師公會（HKICPA）頒布的所有適用的HKFRSs、香港會計準則及解釋及在香港普遍接受的會計原則。基金及其附屬公司（統稱「本集團」）採用的重要會計政策見下文。\n\nHKICPA已對本會計年度首次生效或可提前採用的若干新或修訂HKFRSs作出公告。第3號附註提供有關這些發展初次適用，若有變動，與本集團於本財年及前期財務報表中反映的相關會計政策變更的資料。\n\n第二章.2 財務報表的編製基準\n\n本集團的財務報表包括本集團的財務資料及其在聯營及合營企業中的權益。主要附屬公司、聯營公司及合營企業的主要業務見第16及17號附註。\n\n在編製財務報表所採用的測量基礎為歷史成本，惟以下資產及負債按公平值衡量：\n- 衍生金融工具（第2.6號附註）；\n- 按公平價值計入損益戶的金融資產及金融負債（第2.6號附註）；\n- 按公平價值計入其他全面收益的金融資產（第2.6號附註）；\n- 黃金（第2.10號附註）；\n- 投資物業（第2.11號附註）。\n\n根據HKFRSs編製財務報表要求管理層作出判斷、估計及假設，這些會影響政策的應用和資產、負債、收入及支出的報告金額。這些估計及相關假設基於歷史經驗及在特定情況下被認為合理的各種因素，結果構成對資產及負債的帳面值作出判斷的依據，若其他資料未顯示的，實際結果可能與這些估計不同。\n\n估計及假設會持續審查。如修訂估計，只在修訂時所涉及的期間生效；若涉及當期及未來期間，則於未來期間亦予反映。管理層在運用HKFRSs時作出的重大判斷和重要估計不確定性之來源，詳見第2.18號附註。\n\n部分比較資料已修正，以符合本年度財務報表的呈列。\n\n第二章.3 附屬公司與非控股權\n\n附屬公司是由本集團控制的實體。如本集團掌握對一實體享有之變動回報的權利或承擔其變動回報，並能透過其對該實體的控制權影響該等回報，則視為控制該實體。評估本集團是否擁有控制權時，僅考量實質性權利（由本集團或其他各方持有的權利）。"}

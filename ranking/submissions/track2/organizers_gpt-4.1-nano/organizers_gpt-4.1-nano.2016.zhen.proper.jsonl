{"zh": "# 總裁報告\n\n2016年的全球政經舞台上「黑天鵝」身影頻仍，英國脫歐公投和美國總統大選結果固然令各種民調淪為笑柄，但更出乎意料的卻是金融市場的反應。以美國大選為例，特朗普當選消息令美股三大指數的期貨在開市前急挫，但開市不久美股指數隨即反彈，此後凱歌高奏，屢創新高。連串事件，凸顯了傳統智慧和思維對預測市場能力的局限性，也標誌着未來環球局勢發展的重大不確定性。\n\n過去一年，多項主要金融數據都反映市場情緒異常敏感：美國十年期國庫債券收益率在7月跌至1.36厘歷史低位後，在美國總統大選後的12月中旬飆升至2.6厘。反映美元兌一籃子貨幣走勢的美匯指數在年底升至14年高位；紐約原油期貨價格由年初每桶26美元低位反彈至年底的54美元。本港股市方面，恒生指數全年微升86點，但期內峰谷差逾6,000點。外圍形勢驚濤駭浪，更形金融體系尤其是貨幣和銀行體系穩定的重要和可貴。\n\n2016年1月，國際對沖基金部署狙擊人民幣和港元的傳言甚囂塵上，人心虛怯。金管局迅即向市場發放明確、堅定的訊息，我們絕對有信心、有能力捍衛聯匯制度和香港的金融體系穩定，適時穩住了市場信心。綜觀2016年全年，港元長時間貼近強方兌換保證。由於銀行體系資金非常充裕，即使去年12月和今年3月美國聯儲局加息，對港元利率和匯率並未有明顯的即時影響。\n\n香港銀行體系繼續穩步發展，去年整體貸款錄得6.5%溫和增長，資產質素保持良好，不良貸款比率維持在0.85%的健康水平，遠低於2000年以來約2%的長期平均水平。銀行體系的資本充足率和流動性比率均保持在高於法定要求的高水平。在樓宇按揭業務方面，經過七輪逆周期措施，新造住宅物業按揭平均成數從2009年9月的64%下降至2016年底的51%，平均供款與入息比率也從2010年8月的41%下降至2016年底的34%，為樓市周期一旦逆轉而令銀行體系受到衝擊時，提供了所需的緩衝。金管局會繼續密切留意樓市的發展，因應周期變化而採取合適措施，以保持銀行體系穩定。\n\n進一步強化銀行體系穩定的立法工作去年取得令人鼓舞的進展。優化存款保障制度和針對金融機構「大得不能倒」風險的兩條法例，及時在上屆立法會任期屆滿前順利通過。前者加快存款保障金的發放速度，簡化發放程序，有助加強存戶對銀行體系的信心；後者則為包括銀行在內的金融機構建立處置機制，防範這些機構一旦倒閉而引發的系統性金融風險，並盡量避免動用公帑為它們「包底埋單」。金管局已在今年4月1日設立處置機制辦公室，落實執行法例的要求和跟進工作。\n\n銀行業素有「百業之母」之稱，是實體經濟和普羅市民日常生活倚重的儲蓄、支付渠道和信貸來源。年內，部分中小企業界代表反映融資有困難。金管局即時與銀行界溝通，希望銀行在維持審慎風險管理的情況下，盡可能為中小企的營運和發展繼續提供資金支援。我們又透過轄下香港按揭證券公司，加強向工商界推廣政府的「中小企融資擔保計劃」，並與銀行業界緊密溝通，以釋除疑慮、釐清誤解及理順處理壞帳的索償程序，從而提高銀行參與該計劃的意願。多管齊下，收到了一定成效，根據金管局對銀行進行的調查，中小企整體信貸額度在去年保持平穩，超過九成企業的信貸額度得以維持甚至增加。同時，「中小企融資擔保計劃」的申請數字亦明顯上升。\n\n近年來金管局大力推動普及金融，就是考慮到基本銀行服務已是營商和日常生活不可或缺的環節。去年當我們得知有些海外公司和初創企業在香港開戶遇到困難後，旋即展開跟進工作，與多個國際商會和企業協會聯繫，並跟銀行業界深入溝通，對症下藥。去年9月我向香港所有銀行簽發通告，闡釋應如何理解金管局針對反洗錢和恐怖分子資金籌集活動的「風險為本」監管原則，如何將這項原則應用在開戶申請和對現有客戶的盡職審查措施上，強調銀行不應對所有客戶採用「一刀切」的要求和程序。經我們與銀行和商界協商後，企業開戶情況有所改善，但仍有進步空間，這也是我們今年工作重點之一。\n\n普及金融還涉及銀行分行服務的覆蓋面。金管局一直鼓勵銀行在營商圖利之餘，也要顧及市民的基本銀行服務需要。金融科技一日千里，銀行提供服務的渠道也更趨多元化。除了日益普及的網上銀行服務外，去年多家銀行紛紛推出流動銀行車或視像櫃員機服務，提供較傳統櫃員機更貼身、更全面的銀行服務。在我們的推動下，多家銀行也計劃在偏遠地區設立實體分行，加強對當區居民的服務。\n\n金融中心的發展就如逆水行舟，因此，金管局多年來不斷為香港金融業發展尋求新的契機，開拓新的領域。2016年可說是成果豐碩的一年，當中又以金融科技(Fintech)和基建融資為亮點。\n\n在金融科技方面，香港的零售支付服務在2016年進入新時代。金管局去年發出13個儲值支付工具牌照，通過發牌和恒常監管制度為零售支付服務創造有利的營商環境，配以一系列公眾教育宣傳，讓消費者在享受新科技帶來的便捷之餘，權益也得到合理保障。\n\n此外，去年3月金管局成立了金融科技促進辦公室，以此平台推動與銀行業相關的金融科技發展。幾個月間，我們推出多項新猷，包括「網絡防衛計劃」(Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative)，為強化銀行體系網絡安全建立風險評估、資訊共享和人才培訓三足鼎立的新平台。我們並與香港應用科技研究院（應科院）合作，開展分布式分類帳技術(distributed ledger technology)專項研究，探討該技術在香港銀行業應用的可行性，並在應科院設立金融科技創新中心(Fintech Innovation Hub)，為銀行業界和金融科技界提供技術支援。金管局的銀行監管部門還設立「金融科技監管沙盒」(Fintech Supervisory Sandbox)，讓銀行在較小和可控範圍內測試新技術的應用，為新產品、新服務的開發提速。自去年9月至今年3月，已有6家銀行共14項新技術項目使用沙盒進行測試，部分項目亦已相繼推出市場，為市民帶來更多金融科技的新產品。\n\n世界各地對基建融資的需求巨大，特別是「一帶一路」倡議提出以來，基建融資更成中外矚目的議題。香港是亞洲的國際金融中心，在基建融資領域極具優勢。去年7月金管局成立了基建融資促進辦公室(Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office，簡稱IFFO)，搭建一個嶄新和獨特的平台，匯聚60多家世界級的多邊機構、機構投資者、銀行、保險公司和其他金融機構、基建項目的建設和營運方、各類專業機構等，就基建投融資課題互通訊息、交流經驗、尋求合作機會。IFFO成立至今已舉辦十多場大型會議、研討會和工作坊，金管局並分別與國際金融公司(International Finance Corporation)、全球基礎設施中心(Global Infrastructure Hub)、國家開發銀行(China Development Bank)和中國進出口銀行(The Export-Import Bank of China)簽署了共同促進基建投融資活動的《諒解備忘錄》。起步時間雖然不長，但為香港未來作為基建投融資中心奠下堅實的基礎。\n\n拆牆鬆綁是提升競爭力的不二法門。年內，金管局積極參與和支援特區政府修訂稅務條例，向在港經營集團內部財資業務的企業提供有利的稅務環境。我們並積極接觸跨國企業，吸引它們來港發展或擴充企業財資活動，藉此進一步強化香港金融市場的功能。\n\n去年的離岸人民幣市場處於調整期。受市場波動和對人民幣匯率預期等因素影響，全球離岸人民幣資金池規模普遍收縮。儘管如此，香港仍穩執離岸人民幣業務的牛耳，保持全球最大的人民幣資金池，經香港結算的人民幣維持在日均約8,600億元人民幣高位。為進一步優化香港離岸人民幣市場的流動性安排，去年10月我們將一級流動性提供行由7家增至9家，支援雙邊流動資金的總額度由原來的140億元人民幣增至180億元，確保在離岸人民幣市場資金出現緊絀的情況下，仍可保持市場有序運作。去年12月股票市場「深港通」開通，令香港的人民幣業務再添動力。金管局亦正與內地有關當局研究「債券通」方案，進一步便利兩地投資者參與債券市場，並優化債券市場基礎設施的聯繫。\n\n儘管去年全球投資環境充斥着各種不穩因素，但有賴於過去一段時間所採取的多項防禦性部署，外匯基金去年錄得681億港元投資收入。自1994年以來外匯基金的複合年度投資回報率達4.8%，高於同期2.1%的本地通脹率。\n\n外匯基金將繼續推動多元化投資，包括進一步擴展資產類別，加大對於信貸資產、抵禦通脹類投資產品和新興市場的投資。而作為多元化投資旗艦的「長期增長組合」，透過私募股權和房地產項目等投資於另類資產。該組合自2009年啟動以來一直保持不俗的成績，成立至今的平均內部回報率年率約12%，而隨着政府「未來基金」部分投放於該組合，我們加快了投資步伐，去年底「長期增長組合」的資產規模約1,818億港元，已批出但未提取作投資的總額約1,338億港元。外匯基金將繼續恪守「保本先行、長期增值」的投資策略，在保持充裕的流動性和備用資金的前提下，尋求長遠穩定的回報。\n", "en": "# Chief Executive’s Statement\n\nIn 2016, “black swans” frequently appeared on the global political and economic stage. While the Brexit referendum and the U.S. presidential election results made various polls appear laughable, even more surprising was the reaction of the financial markets. Take the U.S. election as an example: news of Trump’s victory caused major U.S. stock index futures to plunge sharply before markets opened, but shortly after opening, the stock indices rebounded, subsequently reaching new highs with triumphant celebrations. These series of events highlight the limitations of traditional wisdom and thinking in predicting market movements, and mark significant uncertainties in the future development of the global situation.\n\nOver the past year, many key financial data reflected an abnormally sensitive market sentiment: after the U.S. ten-year Treasury yield hit a record low of 1.36% in July, it shot up to 2.6% in mid-December following the U.S. presidential election. The USD index, which reflects the trend of the U.S. dollar against a basket of currencies, rose to a 14-year high at the end of the year; meanwhile, crude oil futures prices rebounded from a low of US$26 per barrel at the beginning of the year to US$54 at year-end. In our local stock market, the Hang Seng Index saw a marginal increase of 86 points for the whole year, but within the period, the peak-to-trough difference exceeded 6,000 points. External shocks and tumultuous conditions further underscore the importance and preciousness of the stability of the financial system, particularly the monetary and banking sectors.\n\nIn January 2016, rumours ran rampant about international hedge funds deploying strategies to target the renminbi and Hong Kong dollar, causing widespread panic. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority promptly issued clear and firm messages to the market: we are confident and capable of defending the Linked Exchange Rate System and the stability of Hong Kong’s financial system, thus stabilizing market confidence in a timely manner. Throughout 2016, the Hong Kong dollar remained close to the strong-side convertibility undertaking. Due to ample liquidity in the banking system, even with the U.S. Federal Reserve raising interest rates in December last year and in March this year, there was no obvious immediate impact on the Hong Kong dollar interest rates or exchange rate.\n\nThe banking sector continued to develop steadily. Overall loans grew modestly by 6.5% last year, with asset quality maintained at a good level; non-performing loan ratio remained at a healthy 0.85%, well below the long-term average of about 2% since 2000. Capital adequacy and liquidity ratios also remained at high levels above statutory requirements. In the property mortgage sector, after seven rounds of countercyclical measures, the average loan-to-value ratio for new residential properties declined from 64% in September 2009 to 51% at the end of 2016, and the average debt-service ratio also decreased from 41% in August 2010 to 34% at year-end, providing buffers against potential shocks when the property cycle turns. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority will continue to closely monitor the property market development and adopt appropriate measures according to the cycle’s changes to maintain banking system stability.\n\nLegislative progress last year further strengthened the stability of the banking system. The two laws aimed at optimising the deposit protection scheme and establishing resolution mechanisms to prevent “too big to fail” risks for financial institutions were approved in a timely manner before the previous Legislative Council term ended. The former accelerates the disbursement of deposit protection funds and simplifies procedures, which helps bolster depositors’ confidence in the banking system. The latter provides a resolution framework for financial institutions, including banks, to guard against systemic risks caused by their potential insolvency and to reduce reliance on public funds for bailouts. The HKMA established the Resolution Office on April 1 this year to ensure the proper implementation of the legal requirements and ongoing follow-up work.\n\nBanks are known as the “mother of all industries,” as they are vital to the real economy and the daily lives of ordinary citizens—serving as the main channels for savings, payments, and credit needs. During the year, some representative of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) expressed concerns over financing difficulties. The HKMA immediately engaged in communication with the banking sector, encouraging banks to continue to support SME operations and development while maintaining prudent risk management. We also promoted the Government’s “SME Financing Guarantee Scheme” through the HKMC and worked closely with banks to allay concerns, clarify procedures for claims on bad debts, and streamline processes, thereby increasing banks’ willingness to participate. These efforts have achieved certain results: a survey conducted by the HKMA showed that overall SME credit limits remained stable last year, with over 90% of enterprises maintaining or even increasing their credit limits. Meanwhile, the number of applications under the scheme also increased significantly.\n\nIn recent years, the HKMA has vigorously promoted financial inclusion, recognizing that basic banking services are essential for businesses and daily life. After learning that some overseas companies and startups faced difficulties opening accounts in Hong Kong, we promptly followed up by contacting multiple chambers of commerce and business associations, and working closely with the banking sector to resolve issues. In September last year, I issued a notice to all banks in Hong Kong, explaining how to interpret and apply the “risk-based” regulatory principles in anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing activities—especially in account opening and customer due diligence procedures—emphasizing that banks should not adopt a “one size fits all” approach for every customer. After negotiations with the banking sector and trade associations, the situation has improved, although there remains room for further enhancement, which will be one of our focuses this year.\n\nFinancial inclusion also pertains to expanding the coverage of banking services through branch networks. The HKMA has been encouraging banks to balance profit motives with citizens’ basic banking needs. With the rapid development of financial technology, service channels are becoming more diverse. In addition to increasingly popular online banking, many banks introduced mobile branches and video teller machines last year to provide more personalized and comprehensive banking services. Under our promotion, several banks also plan to set up physical branches in remote areas to better serve local residents.\n\nAs an international financial centre, Hong Kong’s development is like sailing against the current—the pursuit of new opportunities has been ongoing for many years. In 2016, this effort bore fruitful results, especially in financial technology (Fintech) and infrastructure financing.  \n\nIn the Fintech domain, Hong Kong’s retail payment services entered a new era in 2016. The HKMA issued 13 stored value facilities licenses last year, creating a conducive environment for retail payment service providers through licensing and the ongoing regulatory regime, complemented by a series of public education campaigns. This ensures consumers enjoy the convenience brought by new technology while their rights are protected.\n\nAdditionally, in March last year, the HKMA established the Fintech Facilitation Office as a platform to promote related developments in banking. Several new initiatives were launched within months, including the Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative, which established a tripartite platform for risk assessment, information sharing, and talent training to strengthen the cybersecurity of the banking system. We also collaborated with the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute (ASTRI) to carry out research on distributed ledger technology, exploring its feasibility for application in Hong Kong’s banking sector, and established the Fintech Innovation Hub to support technological development in the industry. The HKMA’s banking supervision department also set up a Fintech Supervisory Sandbox, allowing banks to test new technologies on a smaller and controlled scale, thereby accelerating the development of new products and services. From September last year to March this year, six banks conducted tests on 14 new technology projects within the sandbox, with some projects already launched to the market, bringing new fintech products to citizens.\n\nGlobally, there is an enormous demand for infrastructure financing—especially since the “Belt and Road” Initiative has garnered international attention. Hong Kong, as Asia’s international financial hub, has distinct advantages in this area. In July last year, the HKMA established the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO), creating a unique platform to connect more than 60 world-class multilateral agencies, institutional investors, banks, insurance companies, other financial institutions, infrastructure project developers and operators, and professional service providers to exchange information, share experiences, and seek cooperation on infrastructure investment and financing. Since its inception, IFFO has held over ten major conferences, seminars, and workshops. The HKMA has also signed memoranda of understanding with the International Finance Corporation, Global Infrastructure Hub, China Development Bank, and the Export-Import Bank of China to jointly promote infrastructure investment and financing activities. Although still in its early stages, these efforts lay a solid foundation for Hong Kong’s future role as an infrastructure financing centre.\n\nRemoving barriers is a key to enhancing competitiveness. During the year, the HKMA actively participated in and supported the SAR Government’s amendments to the tax law, aiming to create a favourable tax environment for enterprises operating in Hong Kong’s corporate treasury business. We also proactively engaged with multinational companies to attract them to develop or expand their treasury activities here, further strengthening the function of Hong Kong’s financial market.\n\nLast year, the offshore renminbi market experienced a period of adjustment. Due to market volatility and expectations concerning the renminbi’s exchange rate, the size of the offshore renminbi liquidity pool contracted globally. Nevertheless, Hong Kong maintained its position as the world’s largest renminbi offshore hub, with the renminbi traded through Hong Kong maintaining an average daily volume of approximately RMB 8.6 trillion, remaining at a high level. To further optimize liquidity arrangements in Hong Kong’s offshore renminbi market, we increased the number of primary liquidity providers from seven to nine last October, raising the total support capacity for bilateral liquidity to RMB 18 billion, ensuring market orderly operation even when offshore renminbi liquidity tightens. The “Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect” program was launched in December last year, injecting fresh momentum into Hong Kong’s renminbi business. The HKMA is also working with mainland authorities on the “Bond Connect” scheme to facilitate bond market participation and connect infrastructure.\n\nDespite the many uncertainties in the global investment environment last year, our past defensive preparations paid off—resulting in an investment income of HK$68.1 billion for the Exchange Fund. Since 1994, the compound annual return of the Fund has been 4.8%, surpassing the 2.1% local inflation rate during the same period.\n\nThe Exchange Fund will continue to promote diversified investments, including expanding asset classes, increasing holdings of credit assets, inflation-linked investment products, and investments in emerging markets. The flagship “Long-Term Growth Portfolio,” which involves investments in alternative assets such as private equity and real estate, has performed remarkably since its inception in 2009, with an average annual internal rate of return of about 12%. As the government has allocated part of the “Future Fund” into this portfolio, we have accelerated our investment pace. By the end of last year, the asset size of the “Long-Term Growth Portfolio” reached approximately HK$181.8 billion, with an outstanding committed but unexercised investment amount of about HK$133.8 billion. The Exchange Fund will uphold the principle of “capital preservation first, long-term value growth next,” maintaining ample liquidity and reserves while seeking long-term stable returns."}

Facing increasing uncertainties in the external environment, it is expected that economic growth in 2017 will remain moderate.\n\n# Economic Review\n\n# Overview\n\nHong Kong's economic growth slowed in 2016, with real local GDP growth decreasing from 2.4% in 2015 to 1.9% (Table 1). Net exports were the main drag, notably with weak arrivals tourism depressing service exports (Figure 1). Domestic demand also decelerated but continued to support overall economic growth. The labor market remained broadly stable, with the unemployment rate at a low 3.3% to 3.4%. Due to easing pressures on local costs and external prices, consumer price inflation further slowed. Amid volatile external conditions and variable market sentiment, asset markets experienced fluctuations. Thanks to a robust rebound in the residential property market, the government implemented new stamp duty measures in November.\n\nDespite external volatility and rising U.S. interest rates, the Hong Kong dollar and currency markets continued to function smoothly. The HKD spot exchange rate weakened slightly in January and then hovered around 7.75. No exchange guarantee was triggered during the year. The total reserves balance combined with outstanding Exchange Fund paper and bonds remained stable at about HK$1.2 trillion. Following the U.S. rate hike in mid-December, the HKMA's base rate was increased from 0.75% to 1%. Hong Kong interbank lending rates and yields on longer-term bonds remained at relatively low levels but rose slightly toward year-end, partly reflecting movements in U.S. interest rates and yields. Overall bank lending growth accelerated to 6.5% in 2016. Although loan quality slightly declined, the proportion of classified loans remained at very low levels.\n\nFigure 1 Contributions to Real Local GDP Growth by Component\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\nTable 1 Real GDP Growth by Expenditure Item (Compared with Previous Period)\n\nNote: Seasonally adjusted quarter-to-quarter changes in total local fixed asset formation are not specified.\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Domestic Demand\n\nGrowth in domestic demand slightly weakened in 2016. Despite stable employment and income supporting private consumption, its growth slowed to 1.6%, partly reflecting increased economic uncertainties. Government expenditure growth also slowed slightly to 3.3%. Total fixed asset formation experienced large quarterly fluctuations (Figure 2), culminating in a 0.5% contraction for the year. Private sector machinery and equipment purchases were the main drag, contracting for the third consecutive year amid poor business outlook, while construction and building activities increased due to more housing start projects.\n\nFigure 2 Domestic Demand\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# External Demand\n\nHong Kong exports showed signs of stabilization near the end of 2016, but overall performance remained weak over the year (Figure 3). Goods exports rose 1.7% from a low base in 2015. Exports to advanced economies remained sluggish; however, with trade flows within the region becoming more stable, exports to Mainland China, India, Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan improved compared to 2015.\n\nPartly reflecting the normalization of retail sales after rapid growth, Hong Kong’s service exports contracted sharply by 3.1% in 2016. Goods imports recovered some ground after contracting in 2015, while services imports continued to grow, benefiting from residents’ outward travel propensity. Overall, Hong Kong's trade surplus narrowed in 2016, weighing on local economic growth.\n\nFigure 3 Goods Exports and Service Outputs\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Inflation\n\nInflationary pressures remained controlled in 2016. Excluding the impact of one-off government relief measures, core inflation decreased from 2.5% in 2015 to 2.3% in 2016 (Figure 4). The pass-through effect of earlier reductions in private residential rents contributed to a slowdown in rent component inflation within the Consumer Price Index. With softer global commodity prices and a firm HKD, import price inflation was subdued. Conversely, moderate growth in labor costs and easing rent pressures—especially in retail—kept domestic costs relatively mild.\n\nFigure 4 Core Consumer Price Inflation\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Labour Market\n\nThe labor market remained broadly stable in 2016, with demand and supply growth roughly balanced. Industry analysis shows that employment conditions in tourism-related sectors deteriorated, while others remained steady. Overall, seasonally adjusted unemployment edged up slightly from 3.3% in 2015 to 3.4% (Figure 5). Nominal wages increased by 3.8% in the first three quarters, down from 4.6% in 2015. Real wages in the same period grew by 0.9%, slower than 1.5% in 2015.\n\nFigure 5 Labour Market Conditions\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Stock Market\n\nHong Kong shares experienced substantial volatility in 2016. Pressure from renminbi depreciation and mainland stock market fluctuations pushed the Hang Seng Index down to a three-year low in February (Figure 6). In March, the market rebounded significantly following the recovery of U.S. and other major markets. Despite market turbulence triggered by Brexit referendum, expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve would slow the pace of rate hikes and major central banks’ monetary easing improved investor sentiment. The Hang Seng Index reached a high of 24,100 in September. However, as a result of the U.S. presidential election and expectations of faster rate hikes, the market weakened again in the last quarter. Overall, the Hang Seng Index slightly increased by 0.4% in 2016, contrasting with a decline of 7.2% in 2015. Daily average turnover dropped from HK$105.6 billion in the previous year to HK$66.9 billion, and total capital raised in the local stock market decreased from HK$1,115.6 billion to HK$490.1 billion.\n\nFigure 6 Asset Prices\nSource: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\n\n# Property Market\n\nThe residential property market experienced some fluctuations in 2016. After hitting the lowest level on record in the first quarter, transaction volume recovered over the subsequent months but declined again after the new stamp duty measures were introduced in November. Overall, transactions for the year slightly fell to 54,701. Meanwhile, property prices rose from the second quarter onward, surpassing the September 2015 high, with cumulative growth of 7.8% in 2016 (Figure 6). Housing affordability remained tight, with the price-to-income ratio at 15.9, exceeding the 1997 peak; the income leverage ratio stood at 72.0%, well above the long-term average. Thanks to competitive mortgage plans introduced by banks, mortgage interest rates slightly declined but edged up again toward year-end as Hong Kong interbank offered rates increased. The commercial property sector saw stable trading volume over the year. Prices declined from their 2015 peaks, and the corresponding rental yields rose slightly year-on-year but remained low.\n\n# Economic Outlook\n\n# Economic Environment\n\nReal GDP growth is projected to stay moderate in 2017. The government forecasts growth of 2-3%, with private sector analysts expecting an average of 2.0%. External outlook remains uncertain amid global macroeconomic and financial environment ambiguities, likely resulting in continued moderate growth of the world economy and trade. The appreciation of the effective real exchange rate of the HKD against the backdrop of a strong USD will weigh on Hong Kong’s export performance. Domestically, stable employment and income conditions will support consumption, but rising interest rates are expected to lead to modest growth in private consumption. Increased housing supply and ongoing infrastructure projects should support steady growth in building and construction activities, but weak business sentiment and rising interest rates could dampen corporate capital investment.\n\n# Inflation and Labour Market\n\nInflationary pressures are expected to remain modest in 2017. Global commodity prices and rising inflation in Mainland China may lift import prices, but a strengthening HKD could offset these pressures. Under moderate economic momentum, local costs will stay contained, but rents for new private residential units are expected to rise early in 2017, possibly pushing up rent components within the CPI slightly. Market consensus points to an overall inflation rate of 1.9% for 2017, with the government projecting a basic inflation rate of 2.0%. Increased uncertainty in the market may impact hiring intentions, but private sector analysts forecast unemployment to remain at 3.4%.\n\n# Uncertainties and Risks\n\nThe 2017 economic outlook faces many uncertainties, especially external ones. U.S. policy uncertainty under the new administration could bring increased unpredictability to the global outlook, with protectionist measures possibly hampering trade. Brexit and upcoming elections in major European countries may cause asset market fluctuations and influence capital flows into the HKD. Additionally, normalization of U.S. interest rates will tighten financial conditions locally and exert downward pressures on the economy and asset prices, particularly in the housing market, where demand remains tight amid ongoing uncertainties. In the short term, low mortgage rates, stable employment and income, and incentives from developers (such as discounts and cash rebates) may support housing demand. Conversely, new stamp duty measures, potential faster U.S. rate hikes, and steady housing supply growth could continue to pose headwinds for the property market.\n\n# Banking System Performance\n\nDespite economic headwinds and unexpected geopolitical developments causing market volatility, Hong Kong's banking system remained resilient in 2016. The capital and liquidity positions of authorized institutions stayed healthy, asset quality slightly deteriorated but remaining sound.\n\n# Interest Rate Trends\n\nFollowing U.S. rate hikes, Hong Kong's interbank offered rates spiked notably in November and December. The composite rate reflecting retail banking costs of HKD funds increased slightly (Figure 7).\n\nFigure 7 HKD Interbank Offered Rates, Composite Rate, and Best Lending Rate\n\nNotes:\n1. HKD interbank offered rates (monthly average) published by the Hong Kong Association of Banks.\n2. Best lending rate (monthly average) based on the rate quoted by HSBC Hong Kong.\n\n# Profitability Trends\n\nRetail banking profits improved slightly in 2016, with pre-tax operating profit increasing by 8.7% overall. Growth was driven mainly by income from foreign exchange and derivatives (+39.7%), dividends received from subsidiaries (+123.5%), and net interest income (+2.8%), though some gains were offset by a decrease in expenses and commissions (-11.3%). After tax, retail banking profit surged by 44.4%, mainly due to non-recurring items. The average return on assets of retail banks increased from 1.04% in 2015 to 1.44% (Figure 8).\n\nFigure 8 Performance of Retail Banks\n\nIn 2016, net interest margin of retail banks remained at 1.32%, similar to 2015 levels (Figure 9). Although retail banks continued to allocate surplus funds to low-yield, high-liquidity financial investments, the decline in interest income was offset by reduced interest expenses.\n\nFigure 9 Net Interest Margin of Retail Banks\n\nThe proportion of non-interest income in total operating income stayed at about 44.3%. Despite an 11.3% decline in expenses and commissions, dividends and income from foreign exchange and derivatives increased by 123.5% and 39.7%, respectively."}
{"zh": "# 貨幣穩定\n\n儘管外圍環境波動及美元息率上升，港元匯率在2016年仍然保持穩定。香港貨幣市場亦繼續運作暢順，銀行同業流動資金充裕。聯繫匯率制度繼續展現高度承受衝擊的能力，是香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的主要目標是維持貨幣穩定，即確保港元匯價穩定，使港元在外匯市場兌美元的匯率保持在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的區間內。該貨幣體制主要採用貨幣發行局制度，規定由外匯基金所持的美元儲備向貨幣基礎提供最少百分之百的支持；貨幣基礎若有變動，美元儲備亦必須作出相應增減，與貨幣基礎的變動百分之百配合。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n- 負債證明書（為3間發鈔銀行發行的銀行紙幣提供十足支持）\n- 政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣\n- 銀行在金管局所持結算戶口的結餘總額（即總結餘）\n- 金管局代表政府發行的外匯基金票據及債券。\n\n表1 貨幣基礎\n\n金管局透過自動利率調節機制及履行兌換保證的堅決承諾來維持港元匯率的穩定。若市場對港元的需求大過供應，令市場匯率轉強至7.75港元兌1美元的強方兌換保證匯率，金管局會向銀行沽出港元、買入美元，使總結餘增加及港元利率下跌，從而令港元匯率從強方兌換保證匯率水平回復至7.75到7.85的兌換範圍內。相反，若港元供過於求，令市場匯率轉弱至7.85港元兌1美元的弱方兌換保證匯率，金管局會向銀行買入港元，使總結餘減少及推高港元利率，港元匯率隨之由弱方兌換保證匯率水平回復至兌換範圍內。\n\n# 2016年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n港元匯率在2016年首兩個月略有波動後，於年內餘下時間一直窄幅徘徊。港元在2016年初兌美元顯著轉弱，由1月4日的7.7510降至1月20日的7.8196（圖1）。港元匯率轉弱符合聯繫匯率制度的正常運作，反映美國在2015年12月加息後港元與美元的負息差擴濶。此外，其他市場相關因素，包括香港股市出現拋售、內地及香港經濟前景不及以前樂觀、人民幣匯率波動增加，以及亞洲貨幣普遍疲弱，均導致港元需求減弱。受到市場氣氛改善支持，港元匯率在2月略為轉強，並自3月起一直在7.753至7.776之間窄幅徘徊，即使英國脫歐公投及美國總統選舉引發市場波動亦未受影響。由於市場預期美國會在夏季加息，港元匯率於5月出現短暫的轉弱壓力。整體而言，港元外匯市場在2016年一直正常運作。\n\n圖 1 2016年市場匯率\n\n由於兌換保證沒有被觸發，因此總結餘及未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額在2016年沒有明顯變動，大致維持在12,222億港元左右（圖2）。年內金管局增發總值1,320億港元的外匯基金票據，以滿足銀行在流動性管理方面的龐大需求，令總結餘相應減少至2016年底的2,596億港元。增發外匯基金票據符合貨幣發行局制度的原則，這是由於增發外匯基金票據只屬貨幣基礎組成部分之間的轉移，即由總結餘移至未償還外匯基金票據及債券，貨幣基礎仍然由外匯儲備提供十足支持。\n\n圖 2 2016年總結餘及未償還外匯基金票據及債券\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n香港銀行同業拆息在2016年大部分時間維持在較低水平（圖3）。香港銀行同業拆息在1、2月期間因金融市場波動加劇而面對一些上升壓力，但在3月隨着金融環境回復平靜而轉趨穩定。於第2及第3季，儘管市場關注英國脫歐公投結果以及美國貨幣市場基金改革，香港銀行同業拆息仍大致保持穩定。部分受到年底資金需求影響，以及港元拆息追回美元拆息的升幅，香港銀行同業拆息在第4季錄得較大升幅。儘管如此，短期銀行同業拆息在2016年大致維持在低於基本利率的水平。\n\n因應美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍於12月14日（美國時間）由0.25至0.50厘上調至0.50至0.75厘，基本利率於12月15日由0.75厘上調至1.00厘。基本利率的調整是按照於2009年3月26日宣布的經修訂計算公式作出。按照該公式，基本利率定於美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍下限加50基點的水平，或隔夜與1個月香港銀行同業拆息的5天移動平均數的平均值水平，兩者以較高者為準。\n\n圖 3 2016年香港銀行同業拆息\n\n港元遠期匯率點子在1月出現大幅溢價，大致跟隨港元與美元息差的走勢，以及部分反映投資者為其港股組合作出外匯對沖的需求（圖4）。遠期匯率溢價在2月開始收窄。隨着市況轉趨穩定，港元遠期匯率點子在3至11月期間大致保持穩定，其後在12月因港元與美元息差收窄而再度上升。整體而言，香港貨幣市場運作暢順，銀行同業流動資金充裕。貼現窗借貸在2016年並不活躍，僅涉及53億港元。\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n儘管經歷多次區內以至全球金融危機，聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）過去數十年來一直是香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石。2016年初市場波動加劇，再度引起有關港元轉弱及情況有如亞洲金融危機時期的評論。為增進各界對聯匯制度的認識，金管局向公眾闡釋聯匯制度的技術細節，並指出香港金融體系有能力抵禦衝擊。政府亦重申堅決維持聯匯制度。外匯及貨幣市場穩定，進一步鞏固公眾對政府維持聯匯制度的決心以及港元作為支付及保值貨幣的信心。國際貨幣基金組織在與香港進行年度第四條磋商時，明確表示聯匯制度是最適合香港的貨幣制度，指出香港靈活的經濟結構、充裕的財政及儲備緩衝、以及穩健有效的金融監管是聯匯制度的後盾。\n\n圖 4 2016年美元兌港元遠期匯率點子\n\n鑑於穩健的銀行體系對聯匯制度的正常運作具關鍵作用，金管局繼續密切監察銀行的信用、流動性及利率風險管理以及壓力測試結果，並加強對銀行個人、企業及內地相關貸款的監管，以確保銀行體系具備應付衝擊的能力。面對美國貨幣政策正常化，香港銀行同業拆息開始上升，金管局提醒市民保持警覺，並作好準備以應付可能出現的市場波動及風險。\n\n為提高貨幣發行局帳目的透明度，自1998年10月起，外匯基金已有部分資產被指定用作支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（即支持資產相對貨幣基礎的比率）於2016年在106.3至107.5%之間的窄幅上落，並無觸及上限或下限。該比率於2016年12月31日為106.7%（圖5）。在聯匯制度下，雖然已指定某些外匯基金資產作為支持組合，但外匯基金的全部資產均可用作支持港元匯率。外匯基金的龐大財政資源，能在面對突如其來的衝擊時為香港貨幣及金融穩定提供強力後盾。\n\n圖5 2016年支持比率每日變動\n\n# 研究工作\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的貨幣發行委員會負責監察和探討與香港貨幣及金融穩定有關的課題。在2016年，貨幣發行委員會探討的課題包括香港與中國內地及美國經濟增長同步性、港元貨幣外部需求及香港的金融狀況指數。貨幣發行委員會會議紀錄及金管局向其呈交的貨幣發行局制度運作報告，均載於金管局網站。\n\n香港金融研究中心繼續支持貨幣政策、銀行業及金融範疇的研究工作。在2016年，研究中心合共邀請18位學者到訪，並發表20份工作論文。\n\n年內研究中心舉辦6項國際會議及研討會，主要包括：\n- 於1月舉辦「第7屆中國經濟年度國際研討會」，主題為「中國對全球經濟的影響日益加深」，其間發表8份涵蓋廣泛議題的研究論文，包括中國增長再平衡及增長潛力、來自中國的經濟外溢效應、人民幣對全球及區內的影響，以及人民幣市場之間的利差交易走勢及資訊流動。\n- 於3月與香港科技大學及慶應大學合辦「科技大學與慶應大學及研究中心匯率及宏觀經濟研討會」，內容涵蓋多個不同經濟議題，包括全球經濟失衡、匯率動態變化、資本管制及貨幣政策。\n- 於8月與香港城市大學合辦「房地產與金融穩定研討會」，會上發表的論文內容涵蓋年齡、人口與住屋需求；大額投資者對資產質素的影響；香港房屋價格動態變動；住屋市場負擔能力；按揭規例對家庭生命周期置業決定的影響，以及中國內地的住宅物業市場。\n- 於10月與金管局及國際結算銀行合辦有關亞太區經濟體系的研討會，主題為「在動盪不穩的全球環境下區內經濟體系的抗震能力」。研討會吸引多間央行的高層、主要學者及來自國際組織與私人機構的專家出席，就亞太區經濟體系最迫切的事項進行互動式圓桌討論，交流意見。探討的議題涵蓋廣泛，包括亞洲的金融失衡狀況、資金流、內地經濟放緩對區內其他地方的外溢效應，以及亞洲潛在增長受到的影響及前景。\n\n研究中心亦於8月舉辦「第14屆年度夏季研討會」，並於9月舉辦「第14屆中國內地經濟研討會」，探討內地銀行的資產質素及金融穩定事項。上述會議及研討會吸引學術界、金融服務界及各地央行代表參加。研究中心亦於年內舉辦21場公開小型研討會，探討廣泛的經濟、貨幣及金融議題。\n\n# 紙幣及硬幣\n\n截至2016年底，流通銀行紙幣（指發鈔銀行發行的紙幣）總值4,078億港元，較上年增加13.2%（圖6、7及8）。政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣總值118億港元，較上年增加5.3%（圖9及10）。在政府發行的紙幣及硬幣中，10港元流通紙幣總值44億港元，當中塑質鈔票佔86%。\n", "en": "# Currency Stability\n\nDespite fluctuations in external environments and rising US interest rates, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained stable in 2016. The Hong Kong monetary market continued to operate smoothly, with ample liquidity in interbank banking. The Linked Exchange Rate System continued to demonstrate strong resilience under shocks and is the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\n# Objectives\n\nHong Kong’s main monetary policy goal is to maintain monetary stability, specifically to keep the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate stable within the interval of 7.75 to 7.85 HKD per USD on the foreign exchange market. The monetary system primarily adopts the Currency Board Arrangements, which stipulate that the US dollar reserves held by the Exchange Fund provide at least 100% backing to the monetary base. Any change in the monetary base must be matched dollar-for-dollar with corresponding increases or decreases in US dollar reserves, ensuring full support of the monetary base by foreign exchange reserves.\n\nThe monetary base (Table 1) includes:\n- Certificates of indebtedness (fully supporting banknotes issued by three note-issuing banks)\n- Circulating banknotes and coins issued by the government\n- Total balance in the settlement accounts held by banks with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (i.e., the aggregate balance)\n- Foreign exchange fund notes and bonds issued by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority on behalf of the government.\n\nTable 1: Monetary Base\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority maintains exchange rate stability through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and a firm commitment to currency convertibility guarantees. If market demand for HKD exceeds supply, causing the exchange rate to strengthen to the strong-side convertibility rate of 7.75 HKD per USD, the HKMA will sell HKD and buy USD from banks, increasing the aggregate balance and lowering HKD interest rates. This action helps the exchange rate revert from the strong-side convertibility rate back within the 7.75–7.85 exchange rate range. Conversely, if HKD supply exceeds demand, causing the exchange rate to weaken towards the weak-side convertibility rate of 7.85 HKD per USD, the HKMA will buy HKD from banks, reducing the aggregate balance and raising HKD interest rates, thus restoring the exchange rate within the target range.\n\n# 2016 Review\n\n# Exchange Rate Stability\n\nAfter slight fluctuations in the first two months of 2016, the HKD exchange rate largely remained within a narrow range throughout the rest of the year. In early 2016, the HKD depreciated significantly, dropping from 7.7510 on January 4 to 7.8196 on January 20 (Chart 1). The weakening of the HKD aligned with the normal operation of the Linked Exchange Rate System, reflecting a widening of the negative interest differential between HKD and USD following US rate hikes in December 2015. Additionally, other market factors, including stock sell-offs in Hong Kong, less optimistic outlooks for the Mainland and Hong Kong economies, increased RMB exchange rate volatility, and widespread weakness of Asian currencies, contributed to reduced demand for HKD. Supported by improved market sentiment, the HKD appreciated slightly in February and traded within 7.753 to 7.776 from March onwards, remaining unaffected by Brexit or US presidential election market volatility. Expectations of US interest rate hikes during summer prompted brief depreciation pressures in May. Overall, the HKD foreign exchange market operated normally throughout 2016.\n\n*Chart 1: Market Exchange Rate in 2016*\n\nSince the convertibility guarantee was not triggered, the total balance and the total amount of outstanding foreign exchange fund notes and bonds remained relatively unchanged in 2016, roughly maintaining around HK$1,222.2 billion (Chart 2). During the year, the HKMA issued an additional HK$132 billion of foreign exchange fund notes to meet banks’ substantial liquidity management needs, resulting in a decrease in the total balance to HK$259.6 billion by year-end. The issuance of foreign exchange fund notes aligns with the principles of the Currency Board Arrangements, representing transfers within the components of the monetary base—that is, from the total balance to the outstanding foreign exchange fund notes and bonds—while the overall backing remains fully supported by foreign exchange reserves.\n\n*Chart 2: Total Balance and Outstanding Foreign Exchange Fund Notes and Bonds in 2016*\n\n# Money Market\n\nInterbank offered rates (HIBORs) in Hong Kong mostly stayed at low levels throughout 2016 (Chart 3). During January and February, Hong Kong interbank rates faced upward pressures amid financial market volatility but stabilized from March as market conditions calmed. In the second and third quarters, despite concerns over Brexit and the US money market fund reforms, the rates remained broadly stable. In the fourth quarter, due to year-end liquidity demands and the narrowing HKD–USD interest rate differential, HKHIBOR experienced a significant rise. Nevertheless, short-term interbank rates stayed generally below the basic interest rate level throughout 2016.\n\nFollowing the December 14 (US time) increase in the US Federal Funds target rate from 0.25–0.50% to 0.50–0.75%, the HKMA adjusted the base rate from 0.75% to 1.00% on December 15. This adjustment follows the revised calculation formula announced on March 26, 2009, where the base rate is set at the higher of either the US Federal Funds rate target lower bound plus 50 basis points or the 5-day moving average of overnight and 1-month HKD interbank rates.\n\n*Chart 3: Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates in 2016*\n\nThe HKD forward points surged in January, primarily tracking the interest rate differentials between HKD and USD, and partially reflecting investor hedging needs for their Hong Kong stock portfolios (Chart 4). Forward points Premium narrowed from February. As market conditions stabilized from March to November, the forward points mostly remained stable, then rose again in December due to the narrowing interest rate differential. Overall, the Hong Kong monetary market operated smoothly with ample bank liquidity. Discount window lending was not active in 2016, involving only HK$5.3 billion.\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nDespite multiple regional and global financial crises, the Linked Exchange Rate System has been a cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability for decades. Early in 2016, market volatility increased again, leading to comments about a weakening HKD and the situation resembling the Asian Financial Crisis. In response, the HKMA clarified the technical workings of the system and reiterated Hong Kong’s capacity to withstand shocks. The government reaffirmed its firm commitment to maintaining the Linked Exchange Rate System. Stable foreign exchange and money markets further solidified public confidence in the government’s resolve to uphold the system and in the HKD’s role as a medium of exchange and store of value. During the annual fourth review of the IMF, the IMF explicitly stated that the system was the most suitable monetary arrangement for Hong Kong, citing Hong Kong’s flexible economic structure, ample fiscal and reserve buffers, and robust, effective financial regulation as its backing.\n\n*Chart 4: Forward Points of USD/HKD in 2016*\n\nGiven the critical role of a sound banking system for the normal operation of the Linked Exchange Rate System, the HKMA continues to closely monitor banks’ credit, liquidity, and interest rate risk management, as well as stress test results. It also enhances supervision of individual, corporate, and Mainland-related loans to ensure the banking sector's resilience. As US monetary policy normalizes, with HKHIBOR rising, the HKMA reminds the public to stay vigilant and be prepared for possible market volatility and risks.\n\nTo enhance transparency of the Currency Board Account, since October 1998, part of the foreign exchange reserves has been designated to support the monetary base. The support ratio (assets supporting the monetary base against the monetary base) fluctuated narrowly in 2016 between 106.3% and 107.5%, without breaching upper or lower limits. The ratio stood at 106.7% as of December 31, 2016 (Chart 5). Although certain foreign exchange reserves are designated as supporting assets under the system, the entire foreign exchange reserve can be used to support the HKD exchange rate. The large fiscal buffer of the reserves provides strong backing for Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability in face of unexpected shocks.\n\n*Chart 5: Daily Changes in Support Ratio in 2016*\n\n# Research Work\n\nThe Currency Issuance Committee, under the Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, is responsible for monitoring and discussing issues related to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. In 2016, topics included the synchronization of Hong Kong and Mainland China and US economic growth, external demand for the HKD, and the Hong Kong financial conditions index. Minutes of the committee meetings and the HKMA’s reports on the operation of the Currency Board Arrangements are available on the HKMA website.\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research continued supporting research on monetary policy, banking, and finance. In 2016, it hosted 18 visiting scholars and published 20 working papers.\n\nThe institute organized six international seminars and conferences in 2016, including:\n- The 7th Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy in January, themed “The Deepening Impact of China on the Global Economy,” featuring eight papers on topics such as China’s growth rebalancing and potential, economic spillovers from China, RMB’s impact on global and regional economies, and inter-market yield spreads and information flows.\n- The joint “Exchange Rate and Macroeconomics Conference” with HKUST and Keio University in March, addressing issues such as global economic imbalances, exchange rate dynamics, capital controls, and monetary policy.\n- The “Real Estate and Financial Stability Conference” with City University in August, focusing on age, demographics, housing demand, the impact of large investors on asset quality, dynamics of housing prices in Hong Kong, affordability, the effects of mortgage regulations on household decision-making, and China's Mainland property market.\n- The joint “Asia-Pacific Economies Resilience in a Volatile Global Environment” seminar with HKMA and BIS in October, attracting senior central bank officials, leading academics, and experts from international and private institutions for interactive roundtable discussions on urgent issues in the Asia-Pacific region, such as financial imbalances, capital flows, spillovers from China’s slowdown, and potential growth prospects.\n- The 14th Annual Summer Workshop in August and the 14th Mainland China Economic Seminar in September, examining asset quality and financial stability in Mainland banks. These events drew academics, financial sector participants, and central bank representatives worldwide. The institute also held 21 public outreach seminars exploring broad economic, monetary, and financial issues during the year.\n\n# Banknotes and Coins\n\nBy the end of 2016, the total value of circulation banknotes (issued by note-issuing banks) was HK$407.8 billion, representing a 13.2% increase from the previous year (Charts 6-8). The total value of government-issued circulating banknotes and coins was HK$11.8 billion, a 5.3% rise from 2015 (Charts 9-10). Among the government-issued banknotes and coins, the HK$10 circulating banknotes totaled HK$4.4 billion, of which 86% were polymer notes."}
{"zh": "# 銀行體系穩定\n\n儘管環球市場風險及震盪增加，香港銀行體系在2016年仍維持穩健。金管局在年內加強監管認可機構的風險管治架構，以及信用與流動性風險管理系統的成效。鑑於網絡攻擊日趨頻繁，金管局亦加強監管認可機構的科技風險管理。為貫徹金管局致力打擊金融罪行的目標，認可機構打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集監控措施的成效，繼續是金管局的監管重點。在監管認可機構的操守方面，金管局採取實質行動，推動以客為本的企業文化及促進普及金融，和應對海外中小企及初創企業在香港開立及維持銀行帳戶方面遇到的困難。金管局亦加強監管認可機構銷售投資及保險產品的手法，以進一步提升對客戶的保障。\n\n在監管政策方面，金管局就香港實施國際監管及會計標準的準備工作取得重大進展；當中包括穩定資金淨額比率、大額風險承擔限額、國際財務報告準則第9號及《金融機構（處置機制）條例》下的處置框架。\n\n# 2016年回顧\n\n# 監管工作概覽\n\n金管局在2016年共進行188次非現場審查，涵蓋範圍廣泛，包括認可機構的CAMEL評級、企業管治、業務運作及風險管理。金管局加強與認可機構董事局的聯繫，以強化銀行業的風險管治及企業文化。除與董事局或董事局委員會舉行會議外，亦另行與獨立非執行董事（獨立非執董）會面，就企業文化及風險管治事宜交換意見。金管局亦與認可機構及其外聘審計師舉行三方聯席會議。此外，金管局就認可機構的薪酬制度是否有助促進有效的風險管理進行評估。\n\n在資本充足水平方面，金管局審視認可機構的資本計劃，包括其未來數年的資本目標，以便就2019年全面實施《巴塞爾協定三》緩衝資本作好準備。認可機構的償付能力壓力測試亦因應當前宏觀經濟環境作出改進。金管局又審慎評估各主要零售銀行的恢復計劃，並就需要改善的環節提出意見。\n\n除了非現場審查工作外，金管局繼續以專題評估配合定期現場審查，而專題評估主要適用於被評定為較高風險的範疇。這種監管方法讓金管局更有效地調配監管資源，以應對認可機構所面對的各項新增及主要風險。金管局在2016年共進行377次現場審查及專題評估。這些審查與評估的重點仍是信用風險管理與監控，尤其涉及內地相關業務的信用風險；另一個重點是打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集監控措施。金管局又增加對流動性風險、業務操作風險及科技風險管理的現場審查及專題評估次數。年內專項審查小組亦對認可機構的證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（強積金）相關業務進行現場審查。\n\n表1載有金管局於2016年的監管工作概要。\n\n# 信用風險的監管\n\n# 信貸增長及資產質素\n\n銀行貸款在2016年增長溫和。未償還貸款總額全年增加6.5%；2015年的增幅則為3.5%（表2）。由於客戶存款的增幅超過銀行貸款的增幅，整體貸存比率由2015年底的70.1%降至2016年底的68.4%。\n\n表 2 貸款及墊款的增長\n\n內地相關貸款總額在2016年底增加7%至35,640億港元（表3），其中包括在香港註冊的銀行設於內地的附屬公司入帳的5,450億港元貸款。\n\n銀行業的資產質素在2016年維持穩健。儘管零售銀行的特定分類貸款比率由2015年底的0.69%微升至2016年底的0.72%，但仍遠低於2000年以來的長期平均水平2.4%。同期，整體銀行業的特定分類貸款比率由0.73%上升至0.85%。年內銀行業的內地相關貸款的資產質素呈相若走勢；同期，零售銀行這些貸款的特定分類貸款比率由0.78%微升至0.82%，整體銀行業的相關比率亦由一年前的0.77%微升至0.80%。\n\n金管局投入大量監管資源，以確保認可機構繼續採用審慎的信貸審批標準，並維持有效的貸款分類及撥備制度。金管局在監管過程中亦特別關注認可機構對中國內地民營企業的風險承擔持續增加，以及為增加收益而投資於債務證券所引起的信用風險。此外，金管局就認可機構分銷高風險投資產品的信用風險管理進行專題評估。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n金管局繼續密切留意認可機構的物業貸款業務。住宅物業價格於2015年9月開始出現調整，但其後於2016年3月再度上升，全年上升8%。新造住宅物業按揭貸款的平均按揭成數，由2009年9月金管局尚未推出首輪物業貸款逆周期措施時的64%，降至2016年12月的51%。新造住宅物業按揭貸款的平均供款與入息比率亦由2010年8月首度推出供款與入息比率上限時的41%，降至2016年12月的34%（圖1）。\n\n圖 1 新造住宅物業按揭貸款的平均按揭成數及供款與入息比率\n金管局推出首輪物業貸款逆周期措施前推出供款與入息比率上限\n\n根據金管局於2015年2月推出的第七輪逆周期措施，使用內部評級基準計算法計算信用風險資本要求的認可機構須將15%信用風險加權下限的應用，由新造按揭貸款延伸至整個住宅按揭貸款組合。這項規定於2016年6月生效。\n\n年內有更多地產發展商向物業買家直接提供按揭貸款，其按揭成數往往高於金管局對認可機構實施審慎要求下許可的水平。金管局密切留意有關發展，並定期與認可機構溝通，以評估銀行有否繼續有效管理對地產發展商的風險承擔。此外，土地註冊處應金管局要求，同意向認可機構提供電子提示服務。使用這項服務的認可機構，當有其他按揭文書就其承按的物業交付土地註冊處辦理註冊時，會收到該處發出的電子提示訊息。這項服務將有助應對按揭借款人未有事先獲得承按認可機構同意下，擅自以同一物業借取額外按揭貸款的情況。土地註冊處已於2017年第1季推出電子提示服務。\n\n# 業務操作及科技風險的監管\n\n與其他國際金融中心一樣，香港面對的網絡威脅與日俱增。金管局於2016年接到認可機構通報發現未經授權股票交易及試圖入侵其支付系統的個案，並隨即採取行動應對這些攻擊造成的風險。金管局發出電子銀行服務提示，提醒公眾慎防網上股票交易騙案，並建議公眾採取預防措施。金管局又向認可機構發出通告，就進一步加強網上銀行服務監控可採取的保安措施提供指引。有關試圖入侵銀行支付系統的個案，金管局在香港首次發現相關個案時已提醒認可機構留意這類騙案，並在警方協助下說明這類騙案的犯案手法，以及要求認可機構在加強支付操作的監控措施時須顧及有關手法。\n\n為進一步提升銀行體系應對網絡風險的能力，金管局於2016年5月推出網絡防衛計劃。此計劃由三項支柱組成，即網絡防衛評估框架、專業培訓計劃及網絡風險資訊共享平台（詳見「香港的國際金融中心地位」一章「金融科技促進辦公室」部分）。金管局在12月向認可機構發出通告，列載網絡防衛評估框架的實施時間表。\n\n金融科技在銀行業的應用於2016年長足發展，多間認可機構推出新的金融科技產品，其中個人小額支付服務、非接觸式流動支付及生物認證這幾個範疇的發展尤為顯著。金管局在9月推出「金融科技監管沙盒」，讓認可機構能在受控環境中就其金融科技項目先作試行，而無需完全符合金管局的監管規定。有關安排讓認可機構在正式推出金融科技服務前，可及早收集真實數據及用戶意見，以便作出適當修改。截至2016年底，共有6項使用金融科技監管沙盒的申請獲批，有關的新金融科技產品涉及生物認證、證券交易及用於按揭估值的區塊鏈。金管局又在11月上調無需雙重認證的網上銀行個人小額支付服務的交易上限至每個帳戶每日5,000港元，以應付日益增加的簡便個人支付服務需求。\n\n2016年發生多宗與物業相關的騙案，當中涉及騙徒假扮業主，試圖藉申請按揭貸款或出售有關物業謀取利益。雖然這些騙案並不涉及認可機構，但金管局仍與警方及香港銀行公會（銀行公會）緊密合作，就偵測及防止這些騙案在銀行業內發生向認可機構提供指引。年內金管局出版兩期《操作事故通訊》，與業界分享從認可機構發生過的操作事故中汲取的教訓。金管局亦對認可機構的業務操作風險管理制度、詐騙管理方法、信託╱託管業務操作及防範違規或未經授權交易活動的風險管理及監控措施進行現場審查及專題評估。\n\n# 財資業務及流動性風險的監管\n\n2016年發生數宗重大政治事件，引致金融市場在年內多次大幅波動。與此同時，美國利率繼續緩慢地正常化，聯邦公開市場委員會於12月決定調高聯邦基金利率，是全球金融危機以來的第二次。為應對這些政治事件作好準備，金管局與境外監管機構繼續保持緊密聯繫，並評估事件對香港銀行體系的影響，以及要求銀行保持警覺並加強其風險管理以應對不利的市場發展。\n\n在流動性風險管理方面，金管局進行額外的流動性壓力測試，以評估銀行體系應對可能發生的嚴峻壓力情境的能力，並對認可機構作出跟進，以加強其應對能力。金管局在2015年針對利率風險管理進行一輪現場審查後，再進行額外的現場審查，以評估認可機構的市場風險管理，並要求在監控方面存有不足的認可機構作出糾正。\n\n# 打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集活動\n\n金管局的風險為本打擊洗錢監管包括現場審查及非現場審查（包括就特定事件與認可機構進行的監管聯繫），主要針對洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險較高的範疇。審查內容涵蓋認可機構對洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險的評估、風險為本方法的落實情況，以及交易監察與制裁合規的制度和程序。金管局的專項監管人員在2016年共進行17次現場審查及30次非現場審查。\n\n在政策發展方面，金管局優先處理某些行業及人士在開立銀行帳戶方面遇到困難的情況，並發出指引與「常見問題」，以釐清若干客戶盡職審查的規定，以及金管局就風險為本方法的監管期望。與此同時，金管局繼續與業內公會緊密合作，發出指引以協助認可機構處理某些範疇的風險，例如貿易相關的洗錢活動。\n", "en": "# Bank System Stability\n\nDespite increased global market risks and turbulence, the Hong Kong banking system remained resilient in 2016. The HKMA strengthened the risk governance framework of its approved institutions and the effectiveness of their credit and liquidity risk management systems throughout the year. Given the increasing frequency of cyber attacks, the HKMA also enhanced cybersecurity risk management for approved institutions. To fulfill its goal of combating financial crimes, the HKMA continued to focus on monitoring measures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, which remain key supervisory priorities. In terms of conduct, the HKMA took substantive actions to promote customer-centric culture and financial literacy, and addressed difficulties faced by overseas SMEs and start-ups in opening and maintaining bank accounts in Hong Kong. The HKMA also intensified supervision of approved institutions’ sales practices for investment and insurance products to further enhance customer protection.\n\nOn the policy front, the HKMA made significant progress in implementing international regulatory and accounting standards in Hong Kong; including the implementation of the Basel III liquidity standards, large exposure limits, International Financial Reporting Standard 9, and the resolution framework under the Banking (Resolution) Ordinance.\n\n# 2016 Review\n\n# Overview of Supervisory Work\n\nIn 2016, the HKMA conducted 188 off-site reviews covering a broad scope, including the CAMEL ratings, corporate governance, operational practices, and risk management of approved institutions. The HKMA strengthened its communication with the boards of directors of approved institutions to reinforce bank risk governance and corporate culture. Besides meetings with boards or their committees, it also held separate discussions with independent non-executive directors (INEDs) to exchange views on corporate culture and risk governance. The HKMA also held tripartite meetings with approved institutions and their external auditors. Moreover, it evaluated whether the approved institutions’ remuneration policies supported effective risk management.\n\nRegarding capital adequacy, the HKMA reviewed the capital plans of approved institutions, including their capital targets for future years, to prepare for the full implementation of Basel III buffers by 2019. Recovery stress testing was also improved to reflect current macroeconomic conditions. The HKMA carefully assessed the recovery plans of major retail banks and provided recommendations for improvements.\n\nBeyond off-site reviews, the HKMA continued thematic assessments combined with periodic on-site examinations, mainly targeting higher-risk areas. This approach enabled a more effective allocation of supervisory resources to address newly identified and significant risks faced by approved institutions. In 2016, a total of 377 on-site examinations and thematic assessments were carried out. The focus remained on credit risk management and monitoring, especially related to Mainland China-related business; another key area was the monitoring of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing measures. The HKMA also increased on-site assessments for liquidity, operational risks, and cyber risks. During the year, a special review team conducted on-site examinations of approved institutions’ securities, investment products, insurance, and MPF-related businesses.\n\nTable 1 summarizes the supervisory activities of the HKMA in 2016.\n\n# Credit Risk Supervision\n\n# Credit Growth and Asset Quality\n\nBank loans grew modestly in 2016, with total outstanding loans increasing by 6.5% over the year; in 2015, the growth was 3.5% (see Table 2). Since customer deposits increased at a faster rate than loans, the overall loans-to-deposits ratio declined from 70.1% at end-2015 to 68.4% at end-2016.\n\nTable 2 Growth in Loans and Advances\n\nMainland China-related loans increased by 7% to HK$3,564 billion at the end of 2016 (see Table 3), including HK$545 billion of loans recorded by bank subsidiaries registered in Mainland China.\n\nAsset quality in the banking sector remained sound in 2016. Although the specific classified loan ratio for retail banks rose slightly from 0.69% at the end of 2015 to 0.72% at the end of 2016, it still remained well below the long-term average of 2.4% since 2000. The overall classified loan ratio for the entire banking sector increased from 0.73% to 0.85% during the same period. The asset quality of Mainland China-related loans in 2016 was generally stable; for retail banks, the specific classified loan ratio increased slightly from 0.78% to 0.82%, and for the entire banking sector, the related ratio rose marginally from 0.77% to 0.80%.\n\nThe HKMA allocated substantial supervisory resources to ensure that approved institutions continued to adopt prudent credit approval standards and maintained effective loan classification and provisioning systems. It paid particular attention to the rising risk exposures of approved institutions to Mainland Chinese private enterprises, and the credit risks arising from their investments in debt securities aimed at increasing yields. Additionally, the HKMA conducted thematic assessments of credit risk management in approved institutions’ distribution of high-risk investment products.\n\n# Property Mortgage Loans\n\nThe HKMA continued closely monitoring mortgage lending activities. Residential property prices, which had begun to decline in September 2015, increased again in March 2016, ending the year up 8%. The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio for new residential mortgage loans decreased from 64% before the HKMA launched its first round of macroprudential measures in September 2009 to 51% in December 2016. Similarly, the average debt-service ratio for new residential mortgages fell from 41% in August 2010, when limits on debt-service ratios were first introduced, to 34% in December 2016 (see Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 Average LTV and DSR for New Residential Mortgage Loans\nLimits on debt-service ratios introduced before the first round of macroprudential measures in September 2009\n\nUnder the seventh round of macroprudential measures launched in February 2015, approved institutions using the internal ratings-based approach to calculate credit risk capital requirements were required to extend the application of the 15% minimum risk-weighted capital requirement to the entire residential mortgage loan portfolio, from new loans onwards. This regulation took effect in June 2016.\n\nDuring the year, more property developers offered mortgages directly to homebuyers, often with higher LTV ratios than permitted under prudent requirements imposed by the HKMA on approved institutions. The HKMA closely monitored these developments and regularly communicated with approved institutions to assess whether banks continued to effectively manage the associated risks. Additionally, the Lands Department, at the HKMA’s request, agreed to provide electronic notification services to approved institutions. When mortgaged properties receive registration entries from the Land Registry, approved institutions using this service will receive electronic alerts. This service helps address cases where mortgage borrowers take additional loans against the same property without prior approval from their approved institution. The Land Registry launched this electronic notification service in the first quarter of 2017.\n\n# Supervision of Business Operations and Technology Risks\n\nSimilar to other global financial centers, Hong Kong faces increasing cyber threats. In 2016, the HKMA received reports from approved institutions indicating unauthorized stock trading and attempted intrusions into their payment systems, prompting immediate action to mitigate these risks. The HKMA issued alerts on electronic banking services to remind the public to beware of online stock trading scams and advised on preventive measures. It also issued notices to approved institutions offering guidance on enhancing cybersecurity for online banking services. The HKMA had previously warned about such scams when they first emerged in Hong Kong, detailing the tactics used with police assistance, and emphasized the importance of strengthening payment operation surveillance.\n\nTo further enhance the banking system’s cyber resilience, the HKMA launched a Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative (CFI) in May 2016. The program comprises three pillars: a cybersecurity risk assessment framework, professional training, and a cybersecurity risk information sharing platform (see “Hong Kong’s Status as an International Financial Center” Chapter “Fintech Facilitation Office”). In December, the HKMA issued a notice outlining the implementation timetable for the cybersecurity risk assessment framework.\n\nThe application of financial technology (Fintech) in banking grew rapidly in 2016, with many approved institutions introducing new Fintech products, especially in personal small-value payments, contactless mobile payments, and biometric authentication. In September, the HKMA launched the Fintech Supervisory Sandbox, allowing approved institutions to pilot their Fintech projects in a controlled environment without fully complying with existing regulations. This facility enables early collection of real transaction data and user feedback, allowing for necessary adjustments later. By the end of 2016, six applications to use the Fintech Supervisory Sandbox had been approved, involving biometric authentication, securities trading, and blockchain-based mortgage valuation. In November, the HKMA raised the transaction limit for online banking small-value payments without dual authentication to HK$5,000 per day per account, to meet rising demand for convenient personal payment services.\n\nIn 2016, multiple property-related scams surfaced, involving fraudsters impersonating owners to apply for mortgages or sell properties for illicit gain. Although these scams do not directly involve approved institutions, the HKMA worked closely with police and the Hong Kong Association of Banks to provide guidance on detecting and preventing such frauds within banks. During the year, the HKMA published two issues of the Operational Incidents Watch to share lessons learned from past operational incidents. The HKMA also conducted on-site inspections and thematic assessments of approved institutions’ operational risk management systems, fraud prevention measures, trustee/custodian operations, and measures to mitigate risks of unauthorized or rogue transactions.\n\n# Treasury and Liquidity Risk Supervision\n\nIn 2016, several major political events led to significant volatility in financial markets. Meanwhile, U.S. interest rates continued to normalize gradually; in December, the Federal Open Market Committee raised the federal funds rate for the second time since the global financial crisis. To prepare for such political developments, the HKMA maintained close links with overseas regulators and assessed their potential impact on Hong Kong’s banking system, urging banks to remain vigilant and strengthen their risk management against adverse market conditions.\n\nRegarding liquidity risk management, the HKMA conducted additional liquidity stress tests to evaluate the banking system’s resilience under severe stress scenarios, and followed up with approved institutions to enhance their preparedness. After a review of interest rate risk management through on-site examinations in 2015, further on-site reviews assessed market risk management, requiring institutions with weaknesses to address issues proactively.\n\n# Combating Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing\n\nThe HKMA’s risk-based AML/CFT supervision, comprising on-site and off-site reviews (including regulatory contact on specific incidents), primarily targeted areas with higher risks of money laundering and terrorist financing. Reviews covered the assessment of AML/CFT risks, implementation of a risk-based approach, transaction monitoring, and sanctions compliance procedures. In 2016, the HKMA conducted 17 on-site inspections and 30 off-site reviews.\n\nPolicy-wise, the HKMA prioritized addressing difficulties encountered by certain industries and individuals in opening bank accounts, issuing guidance and answering Frequently Asked Questions to clarify customer due diligence requirements and supervisory expectations for a risk-based approach. It also continued working with industry associations to issue guidance on risks associated with trade-based money laundering."}

Last year's tax amendments helped create a favorable environment to attract multinational companies to establish corporate treasury centres in Hong Kong. To develop Hong Kong into an infrastructure financing hub and a fintech centre, the HKMA established the Infrastructure Financing Office and the Fintech Facilitation Office during the year. Within the same period, the HKMA issued 13 licences to stored value facilities licensees. Hong Kong’s robust fiscal performance and large net external assets continue to be confirmed by credit rating agencies, with Standard & Poor’s maintaining a AAA rating for Hong Kong.\n\n# Overview\n\nInfluenced by volatility in the global financial markets and uncertainties over the renminbi exchange rate outlook, global offshore renminbi activities slowed down in 2016. Nonetheless, Hong Kong retained its status as a global offshore renminbi business hub, processing about 70% of the world’s renminbi payments. The Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect was launched in December, marking another milestone in Mainland China’s capital account liberalization and an important step in enhancing Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre. The HKMA further increased renminbi liquidity transparency through expanding liquidity support to the market and introducing measures to strengthen the liquidity and development of the renminbi market infrastructure.\n\nIn July, the HKMA established the Infrastructure Financing Office (IFFO) to gather major stakeholders to promote infrastructure development and develop Hong Kong into an infrastructure financing centre. As of the end of January 2017, over 60 institutions had joined IFFO as partners, including multilateral financial institutions, development banks, public sector investors, private sector investors, asset management companies, banks, insurance companies, infrastructure project developers and operators, professional service firms, and international trade associations (Table 1).\n\nSince its establishment, IFFO has made good progress. To enhance skills and knowledge, in October, IFFO and the International Finance Corporation (IFC) under the World Bank Group organised an executive workshop on “Private Sector Participation in Infrastructure Investment in Emerging Markets,” which received very positive feedback from participants and helped deepen their understanding and networks. In November, IFFO held a high-level seminar, inviting Mr. Jin Liqun, President of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, to share experience in infrastructure project planning, operation, and management. In July, IFFO signed Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) with IFC and the Global Infrastructure Facility to establish cooperation frameworks. In December, MOUs were also signed with the China Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank of China, promoting infrastructure project financing through the IFFO platform. These activities help strengthen Hong Kong’s position and reputation as an infrastructure financing hub.\n\nMr. Norman Chan, Chief Executive of the HKMA (front row, far left), and other guests attended the launch ceremony of IFFO and toasted to success.\n\nThe HKMA’s proactive measures have seen over 60 institutions from Mainland China, Hong Kong, and overseas partner with IFFO by January 2017, including many multilateral finance institutions, development banks, public and private investors, asset managers, banks, insurance companies, and infrastructure project developers and operators. IFFO’s efforts include forging strategic partnerships, such as signing MOUs with IFC and the Global Infrastructure Facility to facilitate efficient infrastructure investment and financing in the region (Figures 1 & 2).\n\n# Corporate Treasury Centres\n\nTo attract more multinational companies to establish corporate treasury centres in Hong Kong, the HKMA and government authorities have worked together to create a tax environment conducive to such development. Specifically, the 《Taxation (Amendment) (No. 2) Ordinance 2016》 was enacted in June, allowing enterprises that meet specified criteria to deduct interest expenses on internal group financing when calculating profits tax, and to enjoy a 50% concession on profits derived from qualifying treasury business, reducing the profits tax rate to 8.25%. Table 2 summarizes key aspects of the 《Amendment》.\n\nApart from legislative efforts, the HKMA actively promotes the advantages of establishing corporate treasury centres in Hong Kong to multinational and Mainland Chinese companies. By the end of the year, the HKMA had engaged nearly 400 companies, financial institutions, and industry associations. In November, the HKMA signed an MOU with the Hong Kong Chinese Enterprises Association to assist Chinese enterprises in Hong Kong to better understand and utilize the platform for their corporate treasury activities.\n\n# Promoting Asset Management Business\n\nThe HKMA continues to promote Hong Kong as a centre for asset management. According to the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), as of the end of 2016, there were approximately 1,300 licensed asset management firms, an increase of nearly 15% year-on-year. The Asia Private Equity Journal reported that the number of private equity firms in Hong Kong (including SFC-licensed and unlicensed firms) increased by 4.6% to 431 in 2016. Nearly 70 of the world’s top 100 asset management firms, and most among China’s top 20 mutual fund managers, have established operations or affiliated firms in Hong Kong. The number of institutional investors based in Hong Kong also steadily increased. Notably, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA), as the world’s third-largest sovereign fund, announced in October the establishment of an overseas office in Hong Kong, the only one outside Abu Dhabi.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF), in its recent Article IV Consultation discussions, recognized Hong Kong’s efforts in consolidating its status as an international financial centre. Throughout the year, the HKMA actively participated in international discussions, promoting financial stability both globally and regionally. The HKMA also maintained close communication with major credit rating agencies, which contributed to Hong Kong’s credit ratings being reaffirmed by major agencies in 2016.\n\nThe robust and secure operation and continuous development of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure are vital to strengthening Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre and as a global offshore renminbi business hub. In 2016, the four real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems and the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) system achieved 100% system availability, exceeding the target level of 99.95%.\n\nThe HKMA further strengthened Hong Kong’s retail payment infrastructure in 2016. Under the comprehensive Payment System and Stored Value Facilities (SVF) Ordinance enacted in November 2016, a total of 13 licences for stored value facilities were issued within the year. The scope of electronic check services has also been expanded to include cross-border payments between Hong Kong and Guangdong (including Shenzhen).\n\nTo promote fintech development in Hong Kong, the HKMA established the Fintech Facilitation Office in March. Many important initiatives introduced during the year have achieved promising progress.\n\nThe HKMA launched a series of measures to enhance the resilience of the banking industry, including (i) launching a director training programme to improve board directors’ professional capabilities; (ii) establishing a comprehensive bank professional qualification framework; and (iii) implementing a consumer education programme.\n\n# 2016 Review\n\n# Offshore Renminbi Activities\n\nIn 2016, global financial market volatility and uncertainties over the renminbi exchange rate outlook led to a slowdown in worldwide offshore renminbi activities. By year-end, Hong Kong’s renminbi customer deposits and certificates of deposit amounted to RMB 625.1 billion, a 38% decrease from the previous year (Figure 1). Offshore renminbi bond issuance declined to RMB 52.8 billion, and renminbi trade settlement processed through Hong Kong banks decreased to RMB 4,542.1 billion. Meanwhile, as of year-end, the renminbi loan balance in Hong Kong banks was RMB 294.8 billion, roughly unchanged from the previous year (Figure 2). Renminbi RTGS transaction volume remained high, averaging RMB 863.6 billion daily in 2016. Despite a reduction in the renminbi liquidity pool, the continued large-scale renminbi financial intermediation activities in Hong Kong demonstrate its essential role. According to SWIFT, in 2016, Hong Kong processed about 70% of the world’s renminbi payments, underscoring its status as a global offshore renminbi business hub.\n\nFigure 1 Renminbi Customer Deposits and Certificates of Deposit\n\nFigure 2 Renminbi Financing Activities\n\nThroughout the year, the HKMA worked closely with Mainland authorities to secure greater policy space and promote Hong Kong’s renminbi business. Several new measures were introduced, including further opening Mainland China’s interbank bond market and foreign exchange market, and the December launch of the “Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect.” In response to increased cross-border investment channels and market liquidity management needs, the HKMA expanded renminbi liquidity arrangements. In October, the number of primary liquidity providers was increased from 7 to 9, with total quotas rising from RMB 14 billion to RMB 18 billion. Transparency in the use of renminbi liquidity arrangements was also enhanced, helping participants manage liquidity more effectively.\n\nThe “13th Five-Year Plan” announced by the central government in March reaffirmed Hong Kong’s role as a global offshore renminbi business hub, indicating strong support from the central authorities for Hong Kong’s further development of offshore renminbi activities.\n\nSimultaneously, the HKMA continued strengthening cooperation with other economies to develop offshore renminbi business. The HKMA actively participated in various industry and private sector activities to promote Hong Kong as the global offshore renminbi hub and a key platform for Mainland China’s “Going Global” strategy, including involvement in industry associations and overseas events in Mainland China, Germany, Kazakhstan, and the United Kingdom.\n\n# Mainland-Hong Kong Closer Economic and Trade Relationship Arrangement\n\nUnder the framework of the “Mainland and Hong Kong Closer Economic and Trade Relationship Arrangement,” a new agreement to further liberalize service trade between Mainland China and Hong Kong was signed in 2015. The HKMA continues to monitor the implementation of current measures and collaborates with government authorities to explore further market openings and facilitation measures for Hong Kong’s financial industry.\n\n# Infrastructure Financing Office (IFFO)\n\n# Mission of IFFO\n\nIFFO’s mission is to bring together key stakeholders to jointly promote infrastructure investment and financing. Its functions include:\n- Providing a platform for information exchange and experience sharing;\n- Enhancing skills and knowledge in infrastructure investment and financing;\n- Promoting market and product development;\n- Facilitating infrastructure investment activities.\n\nMr. Norman Chan, Chief Executive of the HKMA (seventh from left), attended the IFFO launch ceremony and toasted with other guests.\n\nIn July, the HKMA established IFFO, aiming to foster development through stakeholder collaboration. As of the end of January 2017, more than 60 institutions from Mainland China, Hong Kong, and overseas joined as partners, including multilateral financial institutions, development banks, public sector investors, private sector investors, asset management firms, banks, insurance companies, infrastructure project developers and operators, professional service providers, and international trade associations (Table 1).\n\nSince its inception, IFFO has made significant progress. To further enhance skills, IFFO organized an executive workshop in October, jointly with IFC and Eastspring Investments, on “Private Sector Participation in Infrastructure Investment in Emerging Markets,” which received very positive feedback and strengthened knowledge and networks. In November, IFFO hosted a high-level seminar with Mr. Jin Liqun, President of AIIB, sharing experiences in project planning, operation, and management. In July, IFFO signed MOUs with IFC and the Global Infrastructure Facility to establish cooperation frameworks. In December, MOUs were also signed with the China Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank of China to promote infrastructure project financing via the platform. These initiatives enhance Hong Kong's role and reputation as an infrastructure financing hub.\n\nMr. Norman Chan (front row, far left) and Mr. Philip Leurig, CEO of IFC (front row, far right), signed MOUs to enhance cooperation through IFFO, fostering more efficient and favorable market conditions for infrastructure investment and financing in the region.\n\nMr. Norman Chan (front row, far left) and Mr. Chris Heathcote, CEO of the Global Infrastructure Facility, signed an MOU to establish a strategic partnership to promote infrastructure project financing.\n\nMr. Norman Chan (front row, left) and Mr. Hu Huibin, Chairman of China Export-Import Bank, signed an MOU to strengthen cooperation with the HKMA.\n\n# Corporate Treasury Centres\n\nTo further attract multinational companies to establish corporate treasury centres in Hong Kong, the HKMA and government authorities have collaborated to create a tax environment conducive to such centres. Specifically, the 《Taxation (Amendment) (No. 2) Ordinance 2016》 was enacted in June, allowing enterprises meeting specified criteria to deduct interest expenses on intra-group financing when calculating profits tax, and to enjoy a 50% reduction on profits derived from qualifying treasury activities, lowering the profits tax rate to 8.25%. Table 2 briefly outlines key points of the 《Amendment》.\n\nIn addition to legislative work, the HKMA actively promotes the advantages of establishing corporate treasury centres in Hong Kong to multinational and Mainland Chinese enterprises. By year-end, the HKMA had engaged nearly 400 companies, financial institutions, and industry groups. In November, the HKMA signed an MOU with the Hong Kong Chinese Enterprises Association to assist Chinese firms in Hong Kong in better understanding and utilizing the platform for their treasury activities.\n\n# Promoting Asset Management Business\n\nThe HKMA continues to promote Hong Kong as an asset management centre. According to the Securities and Futures Commission, by the end of 2016, there were about 1,300 licensed asset management firms, an increase of nearly 15% year-on-year. The Asia Private Equity Journal reported that the number of private equity firms in Hong Kong (including SFC-licensed and unlicensed firms) increased by 4.6% to 431. Nearly 70 of the world’s top 100 asset management companies and most among China’s top 20 mutual fund companies have established operations or affiliates in Hong Kong. The number of institutional investors based in Hong Kong is also increasing. The Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, as the third-largest global sovereign fund, announced in October the establishment of an overseas office in Hong Kong, the only one outside Abu Dhabi.\n\n# Introducing Open-ended Fund Company Structure\n\nTo attract funds to register in Hong Kong, the HKMA continues working with the government and industry to create a more favourable tax and regulatory environment. In June, the 《Securities and Futures (Amendment)》 Bill was passed, introducing the Open-ended Fund Company structure.

{"zh": "# 儲備管理\n\n2016年是充滿意外和黑天鵝事件的一年，環球金融市場出現大波動和震盪。2016年年初市場憂慮內地經濟硬着陸及全球增長放緩，促使環球股市大幅下挫。6月英國脫歐公投和11月美國大選結果亦出人意表。儘管投資環境困難，金管局在過去幾年已採取連串防禦措施，增強外匯基金的抗震能力，因此外匯基金在2016年仍錄得2% 的整體投資回報。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》，外匯基金的首要目的是直接或間接影響港元匯價，亦可運用於保持香港貨幣及金融體系穩定健全，藉此保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。外匯基金由財政司司長掌有控制權，並投資於其經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後認為合適的證券或其他資產。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標及組合結構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會為外匯基金制定下列投資目標：\n(a) 保障資本；\n(b) 確保整體貨幣基礎在任何時候都由流通性極高的美元資產提供十足支持；\n(c) 確保流動資金足以維持貨幣及金融穩定；以及\n(d) 在符合上述(a)至(c)項的前提下盡量爭取投資回報，以保障基金的長期購買力。\n\n以上目標全面顧及外匯基金的法定目的，並已於外匯基金的組合結構及目標資產分布中反映。\n\n外匯基金大致上分成兩個主要組合：支持組合及投資組合。支持組合持有流通性極高的美元資產，按照貨幣發行局制度的規定為貨幣基礎提供十足支持。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債市及股市，以保障資產的價值及長期購買力。這兩個組合整體債券與股票的長線目標分布比率為71比29。以目標貨幣比重計，91%的資產分配予美元及港元，其餘9%分配予其他貨幣。\n\n為能更妥善管理風險及提高中長期回報，金管局以審慎及循序漸進方式將外匯基金的部分資產分散投資至較多元化的資產類別，包括新興巿場及內地債券與股票、私募股權，以及海外投資物業。新興巿場及內地債券與股票由投資組合持有，私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合持有。長期增長組合的市值上限為外匯基金累計盈餘的三分之一，但因應部分未來基金投放於長期資產，市值上限還有增加的空間。\n\n策略性資產組合於2007年設立，以持有政府基於策略性目的而為外匯基金帳目購入的香港交易及結算所有限公司股份。由於這個組合性質獨特，因此外匯基金的投資表現評估並無將其包括在內。\n\n# 於外匯基金的存款\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定組織的存款，利率一般與投資組合的表現掛鈎2，惟未來基金存款則除外。未來基金存款的利率與投資組合及長期增長組合的表現掛鈎，實際利率視乎組合比重而定。於2016年底，未來基金在投資組合與長期增長組合的比重為80：20。預期截至2018年底，未來基金存款中與長期增長組合掛鈎的部分會逐步增加至約50%。\n\n# 投資程序\n\n外匯基金的投資程序分別以策略性資產分布及戰略性資產分布作基礎。策略性資產分布，即投資基準反映的分布情況，顯示外匯基金為達到投資目標而可以作出的最佳長線資產分布。外匯基金以策略性分布作為指引，對資產進行戰略性分布，以爭取超越基準的回報。因此，實際分布往往會與基準分布（亦即策略性分布）有所偏離，而實際與基準分布之間的差距稱為「戰略性偏離」。財政司司長經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後制定投資基準及戰略性偏離的限度，金管局獲授權決定戰略性資產分布。投資組合經理可在戰略性偏離的限度內選持倉盤，從短期市場變化中獲利。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局儲備管理部職員直接管理外匯基金約74%的投資，其中包括整個支持組合及部分投資組合。該部分投資組合投資於環球定息市場，並透過衍生工具執行外匯基金的宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 外聘投資經理\n\n除透過內部職員管理資產外，金管局亦僱用外聘投資經理負責管理外匯基金約26%的資產，其中包括所有上市股票組合及其他特別資產。僱用外聘投資經理的目的，是要運用市場上最佳的專業投資技術為外匯基金投資，並讓外匯基金受惠於多元化的投資方式，以及讓內部專業人員汲取市場知識與資訊。\n\n僱用外聘投資經理的相關支出包括基金管理與託管費、交易費、預扣稅及其他稅項。這些支出主要受市場因素影響而每年不同。\n\n金管局支持證券及期貨事務監察委員會於2016年3月7日發布的《負責任的擁有權原則》（《原則》）。《原則》屬自願性質，旨在協助投資者釐定如何以最佳方法履行其於香港上市公司的投資的擁有權責任。就外匯基金的管理而言，金管局鼓勵獲委任負責管理香港股票組合的外聘基金經理在管理有關投資時採納《原則》。\n\n# 風險管理及監察\n\n近年金融市場波動極大，凸顯風險管理的重要。金管局為內部及外聘投資經理所管理的投資組合均訂立嚴格管控措施及投資指引，並密切監察對指引及法規的遵守情況；另亦採用風險管控工具來評估在正常及極度不利市況下的市場風險。金管局亦進行詳細的投資表現因素分析，務求能最有效地運用內部及外聘投資經理的投資管理技術。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2016年的金融市場\n\n2016年環球金融市場出現大波動和震盪。股票市場方面，1月市場憂慮內地經濟硬着陸及全球增長放緩，促使香港及其他主要股市大幅下挫，直至2月中旬市場才穩定下來。6月英國脫歐公投及11月美國大選結果相繼出人意表，但股市在經歷短暫下挫後迅速收復失地。全年計，環球股市普遍表現理想。\n\n債券市場方面，第1季商品價格進一步下跌加深市場對全球增長放緩及低通脹的憂慮，加上第2季英國脫歐公投帶來的不明朗因素及市場對中央銀行維持寬鬆政策的預期，加大了市場對安全資產的需求，支持政府債市於2016年上半年有不俗表現。其中10年期美國國庫券收益率在7月跌至1.36%的歷史低位。然而，在下半年由於市場對美國加息的預期升溫，尤其在美國總統選舉後，美國國庫券收益率飆升。其他主要政府債券的收益率亦上升，但升幅較小。\n\n貨幣市場方面，美元在2016年繼續走強，美元匯價指數升至14年來的高位。美元持續強勢，是受到美元與其他主要貨幣的利率差距擴大所支持。雖然日圓兌美元於2016年上升約3%，歐元兌美元下跌約3%。在英國脫歐公投結果帶來的不明朗因素持續困擾下，英鎊兌美元於年內亦下跌16%，是自2008年以來的最大跌幅。\n\n表1列載主要貨幣、債巿及股市在2016年的表現。\n\n表1 2016年市場回報\n股市表現按照年內指數價格變動計算。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n儘管金融市場大幅波動，外匯基金在2016年仍錄得681億港元投資收入，包括外地股票收益286億港元、香港股票收益53億港元、債券收益331億港元、外匯基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資收益169億港元，以及非港元資產外匯估值下調158億港元。由於去年美元匯價急升，外匯基金非美元投資轉作港元時無可避免出現外匯估值下調。另一方面，策略性資產組合錄得7億港元估值虧損。\n\n於2016年年底，外匯基金的資產總額達36,187億港元。長期增長組合投資的市值總計1,818億港元，當中包括私募股權1,168億港元及房地產650億港元，已承擔但尚未提取作投資的總額為1,338億港元。\n\n儘管投資環境挑戰不絕，外匯基金在2016年仍錄得2%的投資回報率（不包括策略性資產組合）。長期增長組合自2009年開展投資以來的內部回報率年率約為12%。\n\n由於外圍投資環境持續惡化，過去幾年金管局已作出一系列防禦部署，包括縮短債券組合年期、增持現金及大幅減持非美元及非港元資產。我們亦加快多元化投資的步伐，特別是長期增長組合的投資。這些部署大大增強外匯基金的抗震能力。\n\n圖1列明外匯基金由1994至2016年的年度回報率。表2顯示外匯基金在2016年的投資回報率及不同年期的平均投資回報率。外匯基金在過去3年的平均回報率為0.9%、過去5年為2.0%、過去10年為2.6%，以及由1994年起為4.8%。表3列載外匯基金資產於2016年12月31日的貨幣比重。\n\n圖 1 外匯基金投資回報率（1994至2016年）\n\n1. 投資回報率的計算不包括策略性資產組合內的資產。\n2. 綜合消費物價指數以2014/2015年為基期的數列計算。\n\n表2 外匯基金投資回報率：以港元計\n\n1. 2001至2003年的投資回報率以美元計。2. 投資回報率的計算不包括策略性資產組合內的資產。3. 不同年期的平均數以複合年度方式計算。\n\n表3 外匯基金資產於2016年12月31日的貨幣比重（包括遠期交易）\n", "en": "# Reserves Management\n\nThe year 2016 was filled with unexpected events and black swan events, with significant volatility and turbulence in the global financial markets. Early in 2016, concerns about a hard landing of Mainland China's economy and global growth slowdown led to sharp declines in global stock markets. The Brexit referendum in June and the U.S. presidential election in November also produced surprising results. Despite a challenging investment environment, the HKMA has adopted a series of defensive measures in recent years to enhance the resilience of the Exchange Fund; as a result, the Exchange Fund still achieved an overall investment return of 2% in 2016.\n\n# Exchange Fund\n\nUnder the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the primary purpose of the Exchange Fund is to directly or indirectly influence the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, as well as to be used to maintain the stability and soundness of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems, thereby preserving Hong Kong's position as an international financial centre. The Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary and invests in securities or other assets deemed appropriate following advice from the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee.\n\n# Management of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Investment Objectives and Portfolio Structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee sets the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n(a) To safeguard capital;\n(b) To ensure that the overall monetary base at all times is fully supported by highly liquid USD assets;\n(c) To ensure liquidity is sufficient to maintain monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) To strive for investment returns above the benchmarks under the premise of (a) to (c), thereby safeguarding the long-term purchasing power of the fund.\n\nThese objectives comprehensively reflect the statutory purpose of the Exchange Fund and are embedded in its portfolio structure and target asset allocation.\n\nThe Exchange Fund is roughly divided into two main portfolios: the Support Portfolio and the Investment Portfolio. The Support Portfolio holds highly liquid USD assets, providing full backing to the monetary base in accordance with the currency issuance system. The Investment Portfolio primarily invests in government bonds and equities of member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), to safeguard asset value and long-term purchasing power. The overall long-term target distribution between bonds and equities for these two portfolios is 71:29. In terms of the target currency distribution, 91% of assets are allocated to USD and HKD, with the remaining 9% to other currencies.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance medium- to long-term returns, the HKMA has gradually diversified part of the Exchange Fund’s assets into more varied asset classes—including emerging markets and Mainland China bonds and equities, private equity, and overseas real estate investments. Emerging markets and Mainland bonds and equities are held within the Investment Portfolio, while private equity and real estate are held within the Long-Term Growth Portfolio. The market value cap for the Long-Term Growth Portfolio is one-third of the accumulated surplus of the Exchange Fund, with room for further increases given future allocations to long-term assets.\n\nThe Strategic Asset Portfolio was established in 2007 to hold Hong Kong Exchange and Clearing Limited shares purchased by the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes. Due to its unique nature, the performance of this portfolio is not included in the overall evaluation of the Exchange Fund’s investment performance.\n\n# Deposits in the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund periodically receives deposits from the Fiscal Reserves, government funds, and statutory organizations, with interest rates generally linked to the performance of the investment portfolios, excluding future fund deposits. Future fund deposits’ interest rates are tied to the performance of the investment portfolios and the Long-Term Growth Portfolio, with actual rates depending on their respective weightings. As of the end of 2016, deposits linked to the investment portfolios and the Long-Term Growth Portfolio accounted for 80:20. It is expected that by the end of 2018, the portion linked to the Long-Term Growth Portfolio will gradually increase to approximately 50%.\n\n# Investment Procedures\n\nThe investment procedures of the Exchange Fund are based on the Strategic Asset Allocation and the Tactical Asset Allocation. The Strategic Asset Allocation reflects the optimal long-term asset distribution for achieving the investment objectives, serving as the benchmark. The Exchange Fund uses this benchmark as a guideline and implements the Tactical Asset Allocation to aim for returns exceeding the benchmark. As a result, actual allocations often deviate from the benchmark—referred to as “strategic deviations.” After consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, the Financial Secretary establishes the permissible limits for the benchmark and the deviations. The HKMA is authorized to determine the Strategic Asset Allocation. Portfolio managers may then select holdings within these limits, seeking to profit from short-term market fluctuations.\n\n# Investment Management\n\n# Direct Investment\n\nOfficers in the HKMA Reserves Management Department directly manage approximately 74% of the Exchange Fund’s investments, including the entire Support Portfolio and part of the Investment Portfolio. These investments are mainly in the global fixed income markets, with macro risk management strategies implemented via derivatives.\n\n# External Investment Managers\n\nAside from internal management, the HKMA also employs external investment managers responsible for about 26% of the assets, including all listed equity portfolios and other special assets. The purpose of hiring external managers is to leverage the best professional investment techniques in the market, benefiting from diversification and gaining market insights and information. Expenses related to external managers include fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, withholding taxes, and other taxes, which vary annually depending on market conditions.\n\nThe HKMA supports the Principles on Responsible Ownership issued by the SFC on March 7, 2016. The Principles are voluntary and aim to help investors determine the best ways to fulfill their ownership responsibilities when managing Hong Kong-listed companies. Regarding the management of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA encourages appointed external fund managers responsible for Hong Kong equity portfolios to adopt these Principles in their investment practices.\n\n# Risk Management and Monitoring\n\nRecent years have seen extreme volatility in financial markets, underscoring the importance of risk management. The HKMA has established strict controls and guidelines for both internal and external investment managers, closely monitoring compliance with the guidelines and regulations. Additionally, risk control tools are used to evaluate market risk under normal and highly adverse conditions. The HKMA also conducts detailed performance attribution analysis, striving to maximize the effective use of internal and external investment management expertise.\n\n# Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Financial Markets in 2016\n\nThe global financial markets experienced substantial volatility and turbulence in 2016. In equities, concerns over Mainland China’s economy and global growth caused major declines in Hong Kong and other major markets in January, stabilizing only by mid-February. The Brexit referendum in June and the U.S. presidential election in November produced unexpected outcomes, but markets recovered quickly after brief dips. Overall, global equity markets performed well for the year.\n\nIn bonds, commodity prices fell further in the first quarter, deepening market fears of slow growth and low inflation. The second quarter saw uncertainties from the Brexit vote and expectations for sustained loose monetary policies by central banks, which supported government bonds in the first half of 2016. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield dropped to a historic low of 1.36% in July. However, in the second half, expectations of U.S. rate hikes increased, especially after the U.S. presidential election, causing yields to surge. Yields on other major government bonds rose too, but to a lesser extent.\n\nIn the currency markets, the US dollar continued to strengthen, with the USD index reaching a 14-year high. The dollar’s strength was driven by wider interest rate differentials with other major currencies. The Japanese yen appreciated about 3% against the dollar, while the euro depreciated roughly 3%. Amid ongoing uncertainty following the Brexit vote, the British pound against the dollar fell 16% for the year, its largest decline since 2008.\n\nTable 1 shows the performance of major currencies, bond markets, and stock markets in 2016.\n\nTable 1 Market Returns in 2016\nStock market performance based on index price changes during the year.\n\n# Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\nDespite significant market volatility, the Exchange Fund achieved an investment income of HK$68.1 billion in 2016, including HK$28.6 billion from foreign equities, HK$5.3 billion from Hong Kong equities, HK$33.1 billion from bonds, HK$16.9 billion from other investments held by subsidiaries of the Exchange Fund, and an unrealized valuation loss of HK$15.8 billion on non-HKD assets due to exchange rate depreciation. The sharp appreciation of the US dollar last year resulted in unavoidable exchange valuation losses when non-USD assets were converted to HKD. Conversely, the Support Portfolio recorded valuation losses of HK$700 million.\n\nAs of the end of 2016, the total assets of the Exchange Fund amounted to HK$3,618.7 billion. The market value of investments in the Long-Term Growth Portfolio reached HK$181.8 billion, including private equity at HK$116.8 billion and real estate at HK$65 billion. The total unrealized but not yet invested amount was HK$133.8 billion.\n\nDespite ongoing challenges, the Exchange Fund recorded a 2% investment return in 2016 (excluding the Support Portfolio). Since its inception in 2009, the internal rate of return of the Long-Term Growth Portfolio has been approximately 12% annually.\n\nGiven the continuous deterioration of external investment environments, the HKMA has implemented a series of defensive measures in recent years, including shortening bond durations, increasing holdings of cash, and significantly reducing non-USD and non-HKD assets. Efforts to diversify investments have accelerated, especially within the Long-Term Growth Portfolio. These measures have substantially strengthened the resilience of the Exchange Fund.\n\nFigure 1 illustrates the yearly return rates of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2016. Table 2 shows the investment return rates for 2016 and the average returns over different periods in HKD. The average return over the past 3 years is 0.9%, over 5 years 2.0%, over 10 years 2.6%, and since 1994, 4.8%.

In addition, in 2016, the HKMA published 32 articles in \"Insight,\" a significant increase from 14 articles in 2015, discussing various topics related to its work.\n\nThe HKMA’s 2015 Annual Report received the Silver Award in the “Non-profit and Charitable Organizations” category at the CityU Best Annual Reports Awards 2016.\n\n# Public Education Programs\n\nLocated on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre, the HKMA Information Centre introduces the HKMA’s work and enhances public understanding of monetary and banking affairs. The Centre comprises an exhibition area and a library, open six days a week to the public. The exhibition showcases HKMA’s functions and the development of Hong Kong’s currency and banking industry, with reading materials and exhibits to facilitate research into Hong Kong’s monetary, banking, and financial affairs.\n\nThe policy exhibition area in the HKMA Information Centre, which explains the HKMA’s work and introduces related financial knowledge, was renovated in the fourth quarter of 2016 to enrich its content and incorporate interactive elements. Notably, the redesign includes educational games to help visitors understand financial concepts in an engaging manner, along with multimedia touch screens providing a more comprehensive and in-depth introduction to HKMA’s work, aiming to offer visitors a new immersive experience. After the renovation, the Centre also features a mosaic artwork made from over 130,000 Hong Kong coins depicting Victoria Harbour. The new theme-based exhibition reopened on February 24, 2017, for public visits.\n\n# HKMA Website\n\nThe HKMA’s official website (www.hkma.gov.hk) provides over 50,000 pages of information in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, offering convenient access to the latest updates.

Although it is part of the government structure, the HKMA hires staff under non-civil service terms to attract qualified individuals with suitable experience and expertise. As a public body, the HKMA strives to keep its organizational structure lean and flexible, and to implement new measures and handle increasing workloads primarily through reallocating existing personnel.\n\n# Staffing\n\nAt the beginning of 2016, the HKMA had a staff headcount of 875. In the second half of 2016, 12 new positions were added to support its regulatory functions under the new insurance regulatory regime. Consequently, by the end of 2016, the total staff number was 887.\n\nTo ensure adequate resources for implementing new laws and policies, ongoing pilot projects, and managing the increasingly heavy and complex workload, the HKMA increased its overall staffing by 40 to 927 (a 4.5% increase) in 2017. The additional positions are responsible for functions including:\n- Promoting stability in banking and financial systems, such as:\n    - Enhancing supervisory capacity to manage increasing technological risks, new fintech initiatives, and to cope with regional and cross-border expansion of banks;\n    - Strengthening supervision and enforcement against money laundering and terrorist financing activities, and preparing for the 2018 Mutual Evaluation Plan of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF);\n    - Planning and preparing for the implementation of the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance to address the “too big to fail” issue in line with international standards; and\n    - Enhancing supervisory capacity to meet new international standards on capital and market risk, and allocating resources to consumer protection and bank complaints handling.\n- Increasing investment, risk management, and related support to further diversify the investment products of the Exchange Fund, while strengthening strategic asset allocation and investment procedures to face mounting challenges in the environment.\n- Developing and implementing talent development plans, and allocating resources to ensure the HKMA is equipped with the necessary human resources to respond to market developments and future challenges.\n- Strengthening research on monetary policy, processing monetary statistics, and providing resources to handle inquiries and complaints related to stored value facilities and retail payment system licensing and regulation.\n\nTable 1 details the HKMA’s organizational structure and actual staffing as of January 1, 2017.\n\nThe HKMA reallocates temporary resources to manage other tasks and second employees to international or local organizations, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Development Council, to assist with work or policies involving Hong Kong or the HKMA. It also assigns staff to the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board and the Treasury Markets Association to provide full-time or support functions.\n\n# Compensation and Benefits Policy and Review Mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, considers market salary levels and practices when determining staff remuneration and employment conditions at the HKMA. The compensation package includes cash salary and mandatory provident fund contributions, with additional basic benefits. Cash salary comprises a fixed monthly salary (basic salary) and a variable component paid annually based on performance.\n\nWhen reviewing HKMA staff salaries annually, the Financial Secretary, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, takes into account its recommendations, the HKMA’s performance assessment over the past year, results of surveys on financial industry salaries conducted by independent HR consultants, and other relevant factors. High-performing staff members may receive special adjustments to maintain competitive remuneration.\n\nSalary adjustments for individual employees are based on performance, with approved amounts allocated for adjusting fixed annual salaries or awarding variable bonuses. The variable bonus system for professional staff aims to strengthen links between investment performance and pay. Salary adjustments or bonus payments for Assistant General Managers and above are approved by the Financial Secretary after considering the Governance Committee’s advice and are made when the entire amount approved for salary payments is paid out. For managers and below, the HKMA’s Chief Executive, authorized by the Financial Secretary, determines the adjustments based on the approved total sum allocated for salary payments, with relevant employees excused from discussions on their remuneration during meetings."}
{"zh": "# 外匯基金\n\n# 審計署署長報告\n\n# 香港特別行政區政府審昇計毐署\n\n# 獨立審計師報告致財政司司長\n\n# 意見\n\n茲證明我已審計列載於第149至237頁外匯基金及其附屬公司（「集團」）的財務報表，該等財務報表包括外匯基金及集團於2016年12月31日的資產負債表與截至該日止年度的收支帳目、全面收益表、權益變動表和現金流量表，以及財務報表的附註，包括主要會計政策概要。\n\n我認為，該等財務報表已按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》真實而公平地反映外匯基金及集團於2016年12月31日的財務狀況及截至該日止年度的財務表現和現金流量，並已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》 （第66章）第7條下所發出的指示妥為擬備。\n\n# 意見的基礎\n\n我已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示及審計署的審計準則進行審計。我根據該等準則而須承擔的責任，詳載於本報告「審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任」部分。根據該等準則，我獨立於集團，並已按該等準則履行其他道德責任。我相信，我所獲得的審計憑證是充足和適當地為我的審計意見提供基礎。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項是根據我的專業判斷，對截至2016年12月31日止年度財務報表的審計最為重要的事項。我對整體財務報表進行審計及形成意見時處理了這些事項，而我不會對這些事項提供單獨的意見。\n\n# 審計署署長報告（續）\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n我在審計中如何處理有關事項\n\n# 按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.5、2.6及36.1。\n\n於2016年12月31日，集團按公平值列帳的金融資產共31,989.75億港元，金融負債共9,639.77億港元。\n\n95%的該等金融資產及所有該等金融負債的公平值為相同資產或負債於活躍市場的報價（第1級參數），或是以估值方法估計，而所用的參數是以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第2級參數）。\n\n其餘5%的該等金融資產的公平值，是以估值方法估計，而所用的參數並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第3級參數）。有關金融資產共1,758.86億港元，主要包括非上市投資基金。\n\n鑑於所涉數額龐大及涉及估計，按公平值列帳的金融資產及金 融負債的估值屬關鍵審計事項。\n\n就按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值，審計程序包括：\n- 了解不同類別金融資產及金融負債的估值程序，包括相關監控措施；\n- 評價及測試監控措施，包括電腦系統的相關應用程式監控措施；\n- 就金融資產及金融負債的估值、存在、權利與責任及完整性取得函證；\n- 若使用市場報價，根據獨立來源核實價格；\n- 若所用估值方法的參數是以可觀察市場數據為基礎，評價估值方法是否適合及有關假設是否合理，以及根據獨立來源核實參數；及\n- 若所用估值方法的參數並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎，評價估值方法是否適合，以及有關假設與參數是否合理。\n\n# 未來基金存款\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.6、2.16.1、4(b)、23及28。\n\n在以往年度，財政儲備的絕大部分存款均須於要求時償還，並按每年參考投資組合過去的投資回報釐定的固定息率計算利息。\n\n政府於2016年1月1日在財政儲備內設立未來基金。未來基金存款包含來自土地基金結餘的首筆資金（為數2,197.30億港元），以及從政府一般收入帳目轉撥的恆常注資（金額由財政司司長指示）。未來基金存款的利息按綜合息率計算，而該綜合息率是參考上文提及與投資組合的表現掛鈎的固定息率及與長期增長組合（持有私募股權及房地產投資）的表現掛鈎的年度回報率，每年在加權平均基礎上釐定。除財政司司長另有指示外，未來基金的存款連同所賺取的利息應在2025年12月31日償還。\n\n於2016年12月31日，未來基金的存款共2,245.30億港元。有關存款的累計利息為100.71億港元。由於涉及數額龐大及存款條件有重大改變，需要格外關注有關存款及所賺取的利息的計量、列報方式及披露資料。\n\n就未來基金存款，審計程序包括：\n- 評價計量有關存款及所賺取的利息所用的會計政策是否恰當；\n- 審視與長期增長組合的表現掛鈎的年度回報率的計算方法；\n- 核實參考投資組合以往的表現釐定的固定息率、與長期增長組合的表現掛鈎的年度回報率及參考該兩項息率釐定的綜合息率的計算；\n- 核實以綜合息率計算的應計利息數額；及\n- 審視有關存款及所賺取的利息在財務報表中的列報方式及披露資料。\n\n# 按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.12、17及18。\n\n集團的投資物業按公平值列帳，於2016年12月31日共值227.23億港元。集團亦於3間聯營公司及14間合營公司擁有權益，該等公司主要業務為持有海外投資物業，有關權益共值320.83億港元。不論是由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有，該等投資物業的公平值均主要根據獨立專業估值師的估值釐定。該等估值涉及重大判斷及估計，包括所用的估值方法及假設。\n\n就按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值，審計程序包括：\n- 獲取及審視由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有的投資物業的估值報告，並核實公平值是根據有關估值報告所列的估值釐定；\n- 評估估值師的獨立性及資歷；及\n- 評價估值方法是否適合，以及有關假設與參數是否合理。\n\n# 其他資料\n\n金融管理專員須對其他資料負責。其他資料包括金融管理局2016年年報內的所有資料，但不包括財務報表及我的審計師報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見並不涵蓋其他資料，我亦不對其他資料發表任何形式的鑒證結論。\n\n就財務報表審計而言，我有責任閱讀其他資料，從而考慮其他資料是否與財務報表或我在審計過程中得悉的情況有重大矛盾，或者似乎存有重大錯誤陳述。基於我已執行的工作，如果我認為其他資料存有重大錯誤陳述，我需要報告該事實。在這方面，我沒有任何報告。\n\n# 金融管理專員及外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會就財務報表而須承擔的責任\n\n金融管理專員須負責按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》及行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示擬備真實而公平的財務報表，及落實其認為必要的內部控制，使財務報表不存有因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在擬備財務報表時，金融管理專員須負責評估集團持續經營的能力， 以及在適用情況下披露與持續經營有關的事項，並以持續經營作為會計基礎。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會負責監督集團的財務報告過程。\n\n# 審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任\n\n我的目標是就整體財務報表是否不存有任何因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述取得合理保證，並發出包括我意見的審計師報告。合理保證是高水平的保證，但不能確保按審計署審計準則進行的審計定能發現所存有的任何重大錯誤陳述。錯誤陳述可以由欺詐或錯誤引起，如果合理預期它們個別或滙總起來可能影響財務報表使用者所作出的經濟決定，則會被視作重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在根據審計署審計準則進行審計的過程中，我會運用專業判斷並秉持專業懷疑態度。我亦會：\n- 識別和評估因欺詐或錯誤而導致財務報表存有重大錯誤陳述的風險；設計及執行審計程序以應對這些風險；以及取得充足和適當的審計憑證，作為我意見的基礎。由於欺詐可能涉及串謀、偽造、蓄意遺漏、虛假陳述，或凌駕內部控制的情況，因此未能發現因欺詐而導致重大錯誤陳述的風險，較未能發現因錯誤而導致者為高；\n- 了解與審計相關的內部控制，以設計適當的審計程序。然而，此舉並非旨在對集團內部控制的有效性發表意見；\n- 評價金融管理專員所採用的會計政策是否恰當，以及其作出的會計估計和相關資料披露是否合理；\n- 判定金融管理專員以持續經營作為會計基礎的做法是否恰當，並根據所得的審計憑證，判定是否存在與事件或情況有關，而且可能對集團持續經營的能力構成重大疑慮的重大不確定性。如果我認為存在重大不確定性，則有必要在審計師報告中請使用者留意財務報表中的相關資料披露。假若所披露的相關資料不足，我便須發出非無保留意見的審計師報告。我的結論是基於截至審計師報告日止所取得的審計憑證。然而，未來事件或情況可能導致集團不能繼續持續經營；\n- 評價財務報表的整體列報方式、結構和內容，包括披露資料，以及財務報表是否公允反映交易和事項；及\n- 就集團中實體或業務活動的財務資料獲取充足和適當的審計憑證，以對財務報表發表意見。我負責指導、監督和執行集團審計。我對我的審計意見承擔全部責任。\n\n我會與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通計劃的審計範圍和時間以及重大審計發現等事項，包括我在審計期間識別出內部控制的任何重大缺陷。\n", "en": "# Exchange Fund\n\n# Director of Audit’s Report\n\n# Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government Audit Department\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report to the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI hereby certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) as listed on pages 149 to 237. These financial statements comprise the balance sheet of the Exchange Fund and the Group as at December 31, 2016, together with the income and expenditure account, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity, and cash flow statement for the year then ended, along with the notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn my opinion, these financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Exchange Fund and the Group as at December 31, 2016, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants and have been properly prepared in compliance with the directions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for Opinion\n\nI have conducted my audit in accordance with the directions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Hong Kong Standards on Auditing issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants. My responsibilities under those standards are described in the “Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements” section of this report. My independence from the Group and my other ethical responsibilities have been met in accordance with those standards. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016. I have addressed these matters in my audit and formed my opinion thereon, but I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Continued from Director of Audit’s Report\n\n# Key Audit Matters\n\nHow I addressed these matters in my audit\n\n# Valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities designated at fair value\n\nPlease refer to notes 2.5, 2.6, and 36.1 to the financial statements.\n\nAs at December 31, 2016, the Group’s financial assets designated at fair value amounted to HK$3,198.975 billion, and financial liabilities HK$963.977 billion.\n\n95% of these financial assets and all these financial liabilities’ fair values are based on quoted prices in active markets (Level 1 inputs), or estimated using valuation techniques where the inputs are observable market data (Level 2 inputs).\n\nThe remaining 5% of these financial assets valued at HK$175.886 billion mainly include unlisted investment funds, and their fair values are estimated using valuation techniques where some inputs are not observable market data (Level 3 inputs).\n\nGiven the large amounts involved and the use of estimates, the valuation of financial assets and liabilities designated at fair value is a key audit matter.\n\nThe audit procedures for the valuation of these financial assets and liabilities included:\n\n- Understanding the valuation techniques for different categories of financial assets and liabilities, including relevant monitoring procedures;\n- Evaluating and testing the monitoring procedures, including computer systems’ application controls;\n- Obtaining confirmations of valuation, existence, rights and obligations, and completeness for financial assets and liabilities;\n- When using market quotations, independently verifying prices from sources outside the Group;\n- For valuation techniques where inputs are observable market data, assessing whether the valuation model is appropriate and whether the assumptions are reasonable, and verifying the inputs from independent sources; and\n- For valuation techniques where inputs are not observable market data, assessing whether the valuation model is appropriate and whether the assumptions and parameters are reasonable.\n\n# Future Fund Deposits\n\nPlease refer to notes 2.6, 2.16.1, 4(b), 23, and 28 to the financial statements.\n\nIn previous years, the majority of the deposits in the Fiscal Reserve were repayable upon demand, with interest calculated at fixed rates determined annually based on past investment returns of the investment portfolio.\n\nOn January 1, 2016, the government established the Future Fund within the Fiscal Reserve. The Future Fund includes the initial capital transferred from the land fund balance (HK$219.730 billion), and additional regular contributions transferred from the Government’s General Revenue Account (amounts directed by the Financial Secretary). The interest on the deposits is calculated at a comprehensive rate, which is a weighted average of the fixed interest rate linked to the performance of the investment portfolio and the annual return rate associated with the long-term growth portfolio (holding private equity and property investments). Except for other instructions from the Financial Secretary, the deposits in the Future Fund and the interest earned thereon are scheduled to be repaid by December 31, 2025.\n\nAs at December 31, 2016, the Future Fund deposits totaled HK$224.530 billion. The accumulated interest on these deposits amounted to HK$10.071 billion. Due to the large amounts and significant changes in deposit conditions, particular attention is required for the measurement, presentation, and disclosure of these deposits and the interest earned.\n\nThe audit procedures for the deposits of the Future Fund included:\n\n- Evaluating the appropriateness of the accounting policies adopted for measuring the deposits and interest;\n- Reviewing the calculation method for the annual return rates linked to the long-term growth portfolio;\n- Verifying the calculation of the interest based on the historical performance of reference investment portfolios, including the fixed interest rate, the annual return linked to the long-term growth portfolio, and the comprehensive rate based on these two rates;\n- Verifying the accrued interest calculated using the comprehensive rate; and\n- Reviewing the presentation and disclosures of these deposits and the interest earned in the financial statements.\n\n# Valuation of Investment Properties Accounted at Fair Value\n\nPlease refer to notes 2.12, 17, and 18 to the financial statements.\n\nThe Group’s investment properties valued at fair value totaled HK$22.723 billion as at December 31, 2016. The Group also owned interests in 3 associates and 14 joint ventures, primarily holding overseas investment properties, with total interests valued at HK$32.083 billion. Whether held directly by the Group or via associates or joint ventures, the fair value of these investment properties is primarily determined based on valuations by independent professional valuers. These valuations involve significant judgments and estimates, including the choice of valuation methods and assumptions.\n\nThe audit procedures for the valuation of investment properties accounted at fair value included:\n\n- Obtaining and reviewing valuation reports from the Group’s directly held properties and from interests held through associates or joint ventures, and verifying that fair values were derived from the relevant valuation reports;\n- Assessing the independence and professional credentials of the valuers; and\n- Evaluating whether the valuation methods are appropriate and whether the assumptions and parameters are reasonable.\n\n# Other Information\n\nThe Financial Secretary is responsible for the accuracy of other information. Other information includes all the information contained in the HKMA’s 2016 Annual Report, but excludes the financial statements and my auditor’s report.\n\nI do not express any audit opinion or any form of assurance conclusion on other information. My responsibility is to read such other information to consider whether there are any material inconsistencies with the financial statements or the knowledge I have obtained during the audit, or whether there are indications of material misstatement. If I identify any material misstatement in other information, I am required to report this to the responsible parties. In this respect, I have not identified any such issues.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Financial Secretary and the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund for the Financial Statements\n\nThe Financial Secretary is responsible for preparing the financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the directions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for establishing and maintaining internal controls that the Financial Secretary deems necessary to ensure that the financial statements are free from material misstatement caused by fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Financial Secretary shall evaluate the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern and disclose, where applicable, matters related to the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\n\nMy objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement caused by fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report including my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Hong Kong Standards on Auditing will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. A misstatement is considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, it could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nIn planning and performing my audit in accordance with the Hong Kong Standards on Auditing, I will:\n\n- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence to provide a basis for my opinion. Because fraud may involve collusion, falsification, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or override of internal controls, there is a higher risk that I may not detect a significant misstatement caused by fraud than one caused by error;\n- Understand internal control related to the audit to design appropriate audit procedures. This does not involve expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n- Evaluate whether the accounting policies adopted by the Financial Secretary are appropriate and whether the accounting estimates and related disclosures are reasonable;\n- Determine whether the Financial Secretary’s use of the going concern basis of accounting is appropriate, and, based on the audit evidence obtained, assess whether there is a material uncertainty related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I will include in my auditor’s report a statement drawing attention to relevant disclosures in the financial statements. If the disclosures are inadequate, I may have to issue a modified (qualified or adverse) opinion. My conclusion is based on audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. Future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure, and content of the financial statements, including disclosures, to determine whether they give a true and fair view of the transactions and events they represent; and\n- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for directing, supervising, and performing the Group’s audit. I will bear all of my audit opinion’s responsibility.\n\nI will communicate with the Audit Committee established under the Exchange Fund regarding the planned scope and timing of the audit, as well as significant findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control identified during the audit."}

{"en": "# Chief Executive’s Statement\n\nThe year 2021 was a year of concurrent consolidation and development.\n\nIn 2021, the pandemic entered its second year unabated: global supply chains were disrupted, inflation pressures were on the rise, risk of premature tightening of global financial conditions increased.  Adding to the unpredictability were the emergence of mutant variants of COVID-19 and the intensification of geopolitical tensions.  Despite such a macro environment filled with uncertainties, we continued to safeguard monetary and financial stability and maintain operational resilience.\n\n2021 also brought hope for recovery with the successful rollout of COVID-19 vaccines together with the accommodative monetary and fiscal policies introduced in multiple economies.  The global economy began to recover from the severe contraction in 2020.  Locally, after having endured economic contraction in 2019 and 2020, the Hong Kong economy grew by 6.3% in 2021, thanks to the rollout of the vaccination programme and the Government’s pandemic relief measures which have lent crucial support to our economic recovery.\n\nWith financial and monetary stability maintained, as well as a steadying macro environment, 2021 gave us some room to pursue more development work.  We seized the opportunity and pressed ahead with developmental initiatives that will help our financial sector remain highly competitive. Significant progress has been made across our three strategic priorities, namely fintech, green finance and Mainland market opportunities arising from Hong Kong’s gateway role.\n\nAs we entered 2022, the global environment took a turn for the worse.  But as the saying goes, when the going gets tough, the tough get going.  We will continue to be proactive and pursue our developmental goals and priorities to be better prepared for the next challenge and to cement our status as an international financial centre.  We will also remain steadfast in our commitment to ensure the soundness of Hong Kong monetary and financial systems, as we have risen to the many challenges time and again as in the past.\n\n# Monetary and financial stability: foundation of an international financial centre\n\nSince its establishment in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has been a strong anchor of Hong Kong’s financial system and has helped Hong Kong withstand numerous shocks and challenges.  Despite the lingering uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and market concerns about the pace of US monetary tightening, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to function in an orderly manner throughout the year, reflecting the robustness of the LERS.\n\nThis confidence in our systems did not happen overnight, but is based on the solid foundation which has been built up over the years.  In its 2021 External Sector Report, the International Monetary Fund once again reiterated that the credibility of the LERS has been assured by a transparent set of rules, ample fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy, and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nThe confidence is also a result of our efforts in public and market engagement, as well as effective surveillance.  On the latter, we have leveraged technology and data analytics to strengthen our capability for more timely and comprehensive analysis on financial stability and macroprudential surveillance.\n\nThe robustness of the banking system is of paramount importance to financial stability in Hong Kong.  Two years into the COVID-19 pandemic, our banks remained resilient with liquidity positions and capitalisation faring very well by international standards.  As at end-2021, the capital adequacy ratio of local banks stood at 20.2%, well above the minimum requirement of 8%, while the average Liquidity Coverage Ratio of large banks was 151.9% in the fourth quarter of 2021, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 100%.  Despite a challenging credit landscape amid the pandemic, the asset quality of the banking sector remained largely stable during the year. The classified loan ratio of the industry was 0.88% at the end of 2021, down from 0.90% at the end of 2020, well below the long-run historical average of 1.8% since 2000.\n\n# Banking sector: a pillar of support to the economy\n\nAs always, the banking sector is an important pillar of support to economic activity.  This is ever more crucial in the face of economic fallout from the COVID-19 outbreak.  In the past year, a main challenge was to strike a balance between managing credit risk in the banking sector and maintaining the sector’s support for the real economy.  With our supervisory work over the years, banks continued to manage credit risks effectively.  At the same time, we worked closely with banks to provide the much needed relief to corporate and personal customers through the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme (PPPHS) and other relief measures.  The PPPHS, launched together with the Banking Sector Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) Lending Coordination Mechanism in 2020 allowing eligible corporate customers to defer loan principal payments by six months on a pre-approval basis, was again further extended twice during 2021 until April 2022 recognising that some economic sectors were still hard-pressed by the lingering pandemic and were in need of continued credit relief.  Subsequently, in light of a resurgence of local coronavirus infections, in February 2022, the PPPHS was further extended until the end of October 2022.  It is encouraging to see that the banking sector has joined forces with the HKMA to help relieve cash-flow pressures on corporate and individual borrowers, even whilst the sector itself is experiencing its own difficult operating conditions due to the outbreak of the pandemic.\n\nApart from the challenging credit landscape, the pandemic also brought about a more difficult operating environment and a digital landscape with escalating cyber threat. We have stepped up our efforts to enhance operational and cyber resilience of the banking sector, as well as consumer and investor protection amid increasing digitalisation and a surge in phishing scams.  In particular, the Code of Banking Practice was revised to enhance consumer protection in digital financial services.\n\nBesides supervisory work, we are dedicated to promoting financial inclusion and customer-centric culture in the banking sector.  Enhancing accessibility to banking services by customers in need has been one of our priority areas and we have been working closely with the industry to develop industry guidelines.  Further to the guidance on barrier-free banking services and provision of banking services for persons with intellectual disabilities, the industry, with the support of the HKMA, published in December 2021 a guideline to set out the principles and good practices for the banking industry in providing banking services to persons with dementia and customers in need.\n\nTo support the continued development of the banking sector in the future where the new growth opportunities and challenges require a new set of skills from the workforce, the HKMA has formulated a holistic talent development strategy — “Connecting Talent to the Future” — to groom future talent and upskill existing practitioners in a more systematic and targeted manner.  Our new strategy is built on three “connect” directions: connecting students to the banking industry, connecting practitioners to the future of banking, and connecting the key stakeholders together to enhance collaboration in implementing the strategy.  We have launched a series of outreach and promotional campaigns to attract more students to enter the banking industry. To better prepare university students to be “future ready”, we have launched the Future Banking Bridging Programme jointly with the Hong Kong Institute of Bankers, which comprises a series of courses that cover practical banking knowledge and useful soft skills that are highly in demand in the banking industry.  For the existing banking practitioners, we have been working closely with the industry on developing opportunities for upskilling through providing more in-demand training programmes.  In December 2021, the new Fintech module under the Enhanced Competency Framework for banking practitioners was launched.\n\nFinancial talent is crucial to the future development of Hong Kong as an international financial centre.  We will work hand in hand with all stakeholders with a view to strengthening the talent pool for the further development of the industry.\n\n# International financial centre: strong position underpinned by an unparalleled access to opportunities\n\nThe competitiveness of Hong Kong as an international financial centre is underpinned by the unparalleled access to opportunities it offers.  There is general consensus that global fintech adoption, opening-up of Mainland’s financial markets, and the mainstreaming of green and sustainable finance present huge opportunities for the future development of Hong Kong’s financial sector.  At the HKMA, we have dedicated substantial efforts in leveraging Hong Kong’s unique edge to capture these opportunities.  Let me talk about the fintech and Mainland opportunities first.\n\n# Comprehensive adoption of fintech\n\nThe pandemic has clearly demonstrated the power of fintech and permanently changed customers’ behaviour towards financial services.  To make sure we continue to stay at the forefront of the global fintech scene and are ready to tap all of the potential of fintech, we must build an ecosystem where the value of fintech is experienced across all levels and by all groups of people.\n\nThis vision has driven us to formulate a new strategy, “Fintech 2025”, which was unveiled in June 2021.  As its name suggests, it aspires to help the financial sector adopt technology comprehensively by 2025.  The strategy comprises five focus areas which cover the required elements to achieve a successful ecosystem, and also the right factors for the ecosystem to grow further in a virtuous cycle. The first two parts of the strategy, namely “all banks go fintech” and “future-proofing Hong Kong for Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)” mainly sought to create more demand for fintech adoption.  The other parts of the strategy relate to data, infrastructure, talent and funding, which are vital to the growth of the ecosystem.\n\nUnder this strategy, a number of new initiatives were introduced, such as the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) fintech pilot trial facility which allows financial institutions and technology firms to conduct pilot trials and obtain early feedback from regulators and users on their cross-boundary fintech initiatives, and the pilot launch of the Commercial Data Interchange which leverages the use of alternative data to facilitate SME financing.  We have also stepped up research on the application of wholesale CBDC to cross-border payments, and explored the prospect of e-HKD, which will increase Hong Kong’s readiness in terms of adopting CBDCs and in turn future-proof our city’s financial infrastructure in the decades ahead.\n\nWhile we capitalise on the new opportunities presented by technological advancement, we also continue to build on our existing achievements as well as watch out for new risks that may arise.  For example, the Faster Payment System (FPS) introduced in 2018 has grown rapidly over the years, with the number of registrations reaching 9.6 million at the end of 2021, up 40% year on year.  The average daily turnover also increased 90% from 2020, reaching about 673,000 real-time transactions in 2021.  Meanwhile, in view of the rapid development of crypto-assets particularly payment-related stablecoins, we have issued a discussion paper earlier this year to invite market feedback on the development of an appropriate regulatory framework.\n\nOur new, forward-thinking strategy will set the scene for a healthy growth of the fintech ecosystem.  As the banking sector increasingly adopts fintech to capture the opportunities it offers, this will ultimately benefit both financial institutions and Hong Kong people, while strengthening Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre.\n\n# Hong Kong as the dominant gateway to the Mainland\n\nHong Kong has always played a strategic role in linking the Mainland market with international financial markets, providing international investors with a familiar regime and platform to conduct various kinds of financial, investment and wealth management activities.  The National 14th Five-Year Plan strengthens Hong Kong’s position as an international financial centre, a global offshore renminbi business hub, as well as asset management and risk management centres. This together with global economic trends has reinforced our conviction that Hong Kong should continue to enhance its unique value as a bridge connecting the Mainland and international markets.\n\nIn 2021, we reached a milestone in enhancing connectivity, adding two new members to our family of Connect schemes, namely the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) Scheme in the GBA, and Southbound Trading under Bond Connect, essentially completing the two-way loop of mutual access in a wide spectrum of financial markets including equities, debts and wealth management.  The launch of the two schemes will bring new opportunities for Hong Kong in various aspects. By meeting the increasing diversification needs of Mainland investors, the two schemes will enlarge the customer base of our bond market and wealth management industry.  I am pleased to see that these two schemes have been operating smoothly.  The HKMA will continue to engage the Mainland authorities to further enhance these schemes over time.\n", "zh": "# 行政總裁聲明\n\n2021年是兼具鞏固與發展的一年。\n\n在2021年，疫情未見緩解，進入第二年：全球供應鏈遭受破壞，通脹壓力不斷上升，全球金融狀況過早收緊的風險增加。 加上新冠病毒的突變變異株出現及地緣政治緊張局勢升級，使得宏觀環境充滿不確定性。 儘管如此，我們仍繼續維持貨幣及金融穩定，並保持運作韌性。\n\n2021年亦帶來復甦的希望，隨著多個經濟體成功推出新冠疫苗以及採取寬鬆的貨幣和財政政策。 全球經濟開始擺脫2020年的嚴重收縮。 本地方面，經歷2019及2020年的經濟收縮後，2021年香港經濟增長6.3%，這得益於疫苗接種計劃的推行及政府的抗疫援助措施，為我們的經濟復甦提供了重要支持。\n\n在貨幣及金融穩定得以維持、宏觀環境趨於穩定之下，2021年我們有更多空間推動發展工作。 我們抓住時機，持續推行有助我們金融行業保持高度競爭力的發展措施。在我們的三個戰略重點——金融科技、綠色金融及因香港作為通往內地的門戶而帶來的內地市場機遇——上都取得了顯著進展。\n\n隨著我們進入2022年，全球環境轉向嚴峻。 但正所謂，困難時刻見真章。 我們將持續積極行動，追求發展目標與重點範疇，以更好應對下一次挑戰，並鞏固我們作為國際金融中心的地位。 我們亦會堅定不移地致力確保香港貨幣及金融系統的健全，正如過去數次克服挑戰一樣。\n\n# 貨幣及金融穩定：國際金融中心的基石\n\n自1983年建立以來，聯繫匯率制度（LERS）一直是香港金融體系的堅實支柱，幫助香港抵禦了多次震盪與挑戰。 儘管新冠病毒疫情仍籠罩不確定性，並且市場擔憂美國貨幣緊縮步伐，但全年港元匯市與貨幣市場仍有序運作，反映出LERS的韌性。\n\n這份信心並非一朝一夕建立起來，而是建立在長年累積的堅實基礎上。 國際貨幣基金組織在2021年對我外部部門的報告再次強調，LERS的可信度由透明的規則、充足的財政與外匯儲備、健全的金融監管與監督、靈活的經濟體系，以及審慎的財政框架所保障。\n\n這份信心亦源於我們在公眾與市場的積極參與以及有效的監察。 在監察方面，我們利用科技與數據分析，加強分析金融穩定性與宏觀審慎監察的即時性與全面性。\n\n銀行體系的韌性對香港金融穩定極為重要。 疫情持續兩年，香港銀行仍展現韌性，流動性與資本狀況均達到國際標準。 截至2021年底，本地銀行資本充足率為20.2%，遠高於8%的最低規定；大行的流動性覆蓋比率在2021年第四季平均為151.9%，亦遠高於100%的法定最低要求。 儘管疫情帶來嚴峻的信貸環境，銀行資產質素在震盪中仍較為穩定，行業的分類貸款比率在2021年底為0.88%，較2020年底的0.90%略有下降，自2000年以來長期平均為1.8%。\n\n# 銀行業：支持經濟的支柱\n\n一如既往，銀行業是推動經濟活動的重要支柱。在面對COVID-19疫情帶來經濟震盪時，更顯得格外重要。在過去一年，主要挑戰是如何在管理信貸風險與支持實體經濟之間取得平衡。 通過多年的監管工作，銀行能有效管理信貸風險；同時，我們與銀行緊密合作，通過預先批核還息假期計劃（PPPHS）及其他援助措施，提供急需的支援。2020年推出的PPPHS結合銀行業中小企貸款協調機制（SME貸款協調機制），允許合資格企業客戶在經批核後延遲六個月償還本金，2021年再次兩度延長，直至2022年4月，反映出部分產業仍受到疫情影響，亟需持續信貸援助。 隨後，鑒於本地疫情再度升溫，PPPHS於2022年2月再度延長至2022年10月底。 即使在業務困難之中，銀行業仍與金管局攜手合作，協助緩解企業及個人借款人的資金流動壓力。\n\n除信貸環境困難外，疫情亦帶來更嚴峻的營運環境，以及數碼化帶來日益增加的網絡威脅。我們已加強措施，提升銀行業的運作及網絡防衛韌性，並在數碼化與電郵釣魚騙案激增的背景下，強化消費者與投資者保障。 特別是，銀行營運守則已修訂，以增強數碼金融服務中的消費者保障。\n\n除了監管工作外，我們亦專注推動金融包容及以客為本的企業文化。 提升服務可及性，成為我們優先推行的範疇之一，我們亦與業界緊密合作制定行業指引。在無障礙銀行服務及為智障人士提供服務的指引基礎上，2021年12月，業界在金管局協助下，發布了針對認知障礙症患者及其他有需要客戶的銀行服務原則與最佳實務指引。\n\n為支持未來銀行業的持續發展，以及應對新興的挑戰，我們制定了全面的人才發展策略——“連接人才與未來”——以系統化培育未來人才並提升現有人員的專業能力。 此策略以三個“連接”方向為核心：連接學生與銀行業、連接從業人員與銀行的未來、促進主要利益相關方的合作。 我們已推行系列宣傳及推廣活動，吸引更多學生進入銀行業。 為更好準備大專院校學生成為“未來準備好的人才”，我們與香港銀行學會合辦未來銀行銜接課程，內容涵蓋實用銀行知識與行業高度需求的軟技能。 對於現有的銀行從業人員，我們亦與業界合作，開發更多進修升級的培訓計劃。 2021年12月，“銀行專業資歷架構”下的新金融科技模塊正式推出。\n\n金融人才對香港作為國際金融中心的未來發展至關重要。我們將與各方攜手合作，致力打造更強大的人才庫，促進行業持續發展。\n\n# 國際金融中心：依托無與倫比的機遇帶動強勁位置\n\n香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力，源自其提供的無與倫比的機遇。普遍認為，全球金融科技應用、內地金融市場開放，以及綠色和可持續金融的普及，為香港金融行業的未來發展帶來巨大潛力。 在金管局，我們致力於發揮香港的獨特優勢，把握這些機遇。 先談金融科技與內地機遇。\n\n# 全面推進金融科技應用\n\n疫情清楚展示了金融科技的力量，並徹底改變了客戶對金融服務的行為。 為確保我們在全球金融科技舞台始終處於領先位置，並能充分利用金融科技的潛力，我們必須建立一個涵蓋所有層面及群體的生態系統，使金融科技的價值得以深層體驗。\n\n這一願景驅使我們制定了“金融科技2025”新策略，於2021年6月公布。 顧名思義，該策略旨在至2025年前協助金融行業全面採用科技。 該策略包括五個重點範疇，涵蓋成功建立生態系統所需的要素，並促使該生態系統在良性循環中持續擴展。 策略的前兩個部分，即“所有銀行皆行金融科技”及“為人民幣數字貨幣（CBDCs）打造未來的香港”，主要旨在創造更多金融科技需求。 其他部分涉及數據、基建、人才和資金，這些都是推動生態系統成長的關鍵因素。\n\n在此策略下，我們推出多項新措施，如粵港澳大灣區金融科技測試平台，方便金融機構和科技公司進行試點，並提前獲得監管部門與用戶的反饋，以及利用電商數據促進中小企融資的商業數據互通平臺試點。我們亦加強對批發人民幣數字貨幣（ wholesale CBDC）在跨境支付中的應用研究，並探索e-HKD的可行性，以提升香港在採用CBDCs方面的準備程度，並在未來數十年內鞏固我們城市的金融基建。\n\n在把握科技進步帶來的新機遇的同時，我們亦持續推動現有成就，並密切關注新風險。例如，2018年推出的快速支付系統（FPS）多年來快速成長，截至2021年底，註冊用戶數達960萬，年增40%。 日均交易額也從2020年的約71萬筆，增長90%至2021年的約67萬筆。 同時，鑑於加密資產尤其是支付相關穩定幣的快速發展，我們今年初發布討論文件，徵求市場對制定合適監管框架的意見。\n\n我們的新戰略將為金融科技生態系統的健康發展奠定基礎。 隨著銀行業越來越多地採用金融科技抓住其提供的機遇，最終將惠及金融機構及香港市民，同時鞏固香港作為國際金融中心的競爭優勢。\n\n# 香港作為內地的主要門戶\n\n香港一直在聯通內地市場與國際金融市場方面扮演重要角色，為國際投資者提供熟悉的制度與平台，以進行各類金融、投資及財富管理活動。 《十四五規劃》進一步鞏固香港作為國際金融中心、全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐，以及資產管理和風險管理中心的地位。 這些因素再加上國際經濟趨勢，增強了我們的信念——香港應繼續提升其作為內地與國際市場橋樑的獨特價值。\n\n2021年，我們在增強聯通方面邁出重要一步，新增兩個成員入我們的“聯通”計劃，包括大灣區跨境財富管理（WMC）方案，以及“債券通”南向交易，基本完成涵蓋股票、債券及財富管理等廣闊範圍的雙向互通。這兩個計劃的推行，將為香港帶來多方面的新機遇。通過滿足內地投資者日益多元化的需求，這些方案將擴大我市債券市場與財富管理行業的客戶基礎。 我很高興看到這兩個計劃運作順利。 未來，金管局將持續與內地當局保持緊密合作，進一步完善這些計劃。"}

{"en": "# Priorities for 2022 and Beyond\n\nGlobal and local conditions deteriorated notably entering 2022. On the one hand, the escalation of the Ukraine situation and expectations of rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve triggered market volatility. On the other hand, the local economy took a hit from the new wave of COVID-19 pandemic. That said, Hong Kong’s financial system remains well-positioned to withstand adverse shocks given its resilience and buffers built up over the years. Looking ahead, the HKMA will continue to attach high importance to safeguarding monetary and financial stability. In doing so, we will endeavour to stay ahead of the curve by identifying emerging risks and responding to them in an agile manner. At the same time, the HKMA will seek opportunities that would help bolster Hong Kong’s status as a leading international financial centre. In managing the Exchange Fund in this complicated investment environment, the HKMA will continue to invest prudently, while remaining flexible, implementing defensive measures as appropriate, and maintaining a high degree of liquidity.\n\n# STABILITY AND INTEGRITY OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM\n\nThe global economic outlook remains subject to significant uncertainties.  The HKMA will keep abreast of latest developments and stay vigilant against potential risks, with the aim of upholding the resilience and stability of the financial system, which are essential for the ongoing provision of critical financial services that support the functioning of the Hong Kong economy.\n\n# Staying vigilant against potential risks\n\nLooking ahead, markets may be subject to heightened volatilities amid increased uncertainties on various fronts. On the one hand, the US Federal Reserve’s monetary policy normalisation, if continuing at a fast pace, may tighten global financial conditions visibly ahead and increase the global debt-servicing burden.  On the other hand, following the escalation of the Ukraine situation in early 2022, geopolitical uncertainties including the China–US tension may continue to stay high and trigger bouts of financial market volatility again.  Last but not least, with the evolving pandemic developments, there might be a potential downside scenario where lockdowns were to be re-imposed at a large scale, leading to persistent global supply bottlenecks and adversely affecting global growth and inflation.  Having said that, Hong Kong’s financial system is well-positioned to withstand adverse shocks given the resilience and buffers built up over the years.  The HKMA also has the capability, resources and commitment to safeguard Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nThe HKMA will continue to closely monitor risks and vulnerabilities in the domestic and external environments and stand ready to deploy appropriate measures where necessary to maintain Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. Research programmes in 2022 will study issues affecting the Hong Kong economy and assess their potential risks. Meanwhile, the HKMA’s ongoing Digitalisation Programme will help enhance its surveillance capabilities to support more holistic surveillance and comprehensive analysis of the financial system.\n\n# Maintaining banking stability\n\nAs developed markets tighten monetary policies and the impact of the pandemic lingers, the credit landscape facing the banking sector is expected to remain challenging. At the same time, rapid technological advancement and digitalisation present both opportunities and challenges to the banking sector.  Facing an ever-changing financial landscape, the HKMA strives to ensure banks’ ability to withstand shocks through its ongoing supervisory efforts. At the same time, the HKMA will also continue to enhance and refine its banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account international standards and best practices.\n\n# A risk-based supervisory focus\n\n# Credit risk\n\nIn 2022, the HKMA will step up the surveillance of banks’ credit risk exposures and take proactive steps to ensure that overall risk levels remain well contained.\n\nThe HKMA will also continue to monitor the development of the pandemic and its effect on the operating conditions of corporates, as well as maintain close dialogue with the banking and commercial sectors while keeping the various relief measures under review.\n\n# Operational and technology risks\n\nWith the issuance of the new Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module on “Operational Resilience” in May 2022, the HKMA will continue to engage the industry and understand authorized institutions’ (AIs’) progress in developing their operational resilience frameworks.  In parallel, the HKMA will seek to raise the banking sector’s cyber resilience by following up with AIs on issues revealed by the assessments under the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 and monitoring AIs’ implementation of secure tertiary data backup.  Another key supervisory focus will be evaluating and addressing the risks from AIs’ growing dependency on technology service providers.\n\nWith enhanced digital capabilities and extensive remote working experience accumulated during the pandemic, some AIs are planning to transition to a hybrid working model on a business-as-usual basis.  The HKMA will keep track of this development and assess whether the associated risks are adequately addressed by the industry.\n\n# Liquidity and market risks\n\nThe HKMA will focus on the supervision of AIs’ liquidity and market risk management in 2022.  In particular, the HKMA will continue to monitor AIs’ progress in transitioning away from the remaining London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) settings before these settings cease to be published by 30 June 2023.\n\n# Combating money laundering and terrorist financing\n\nIn 2022, the HKMA’s work on anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) will continue to focus on strengthening response to fraud and financial crime through collaboration and information sharing, pursuing closer co-operation with various stakeholders in the AML/CFT ecosystem.  Other priorities are to implement a wider range of risk-sensitive supervisory techniques, by leveraging enhanced data and supervisory technology (Suptech) capabilities, and promote the use of Regtech by banks, including transaction monitoring systems.\n\nThe HKMA will also keep working closely with the Government, the banking and stored value facility (SVF) sectors to publish an updated Hong Kong money laundering and terrorist financing risk assessment, and assist the industry in combatting new and emerging risks.  Work will also continue on understanding evolving money laundering and terrorist financing risks, implementing changes to AML law and related guidance to align with international standards, and maintaining proactive engagement with other regulators and international standard setters.\n\n# Wealth management and mandatory provident fund-related businesses\n\nIn 2022, the HKMA will carry out on-site examinations and off-site surveillance of AIs’ conduct in relation to wealth management and the selling of securities, mandatory provident fund (MPF) and other investment and insurance products, with a focus on the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) Scheme in the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area, digital advisory platforms, complex products, virtual assets and non-investment-linked long term insurance products.\n\nWhile maintaining close communication with other regulators and the banking industry, the HKMA will provide further guidance on regulatory standards in relation to the sale of investment, insurance and MPF products.  This will cover, among other things, investment services related to virtual assets and the selling of Protection Linked Plans, a new subset of investment-linked assurance scheme products with high level of insurance protection.  The HKMA, the Insurance Authority and the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority will jointly launch a mystery shopping programme on the selling practices of intermediaries in respect of Qualifying Deferred Annuity Policies and Tax-deductible Voluntary Contributions.\n\nFollowing the smooth launch of the Cross-boundary WMC, the HKMA will continue engaging the industry and relevant regulatory authorities to enhance the scheme.\n\nMoreover, the HKMA will embark on preparation work for supervising AIs’ trust business under a new SPM module and a new Code of Practice.\n\n# Oversight of financial market infrastructures\n\nThe HKMA will continue to promote the safety and efficiency of the financial market infrastructures (FMIs) under its oversight, in accordance with the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO), the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMI)1, and the various guidances issued by the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI).  It will fine-tune the FMI oversight framework taking into account the latest technological and market developments.\n\nThe HKMA will work with the FMIs on their observance of the PFMI, conducting and updating assessments as appropriate. In addition, the HKMA will continue to participate in the CPMI-IOSCO PFMI implementation monitoring and assessment exercise.  The HKMA will also participate in the work of international standard setting bodies and strengthen its oversight requirements in response to market and technology developments and in line with international practices.  The HKMA will work with relevant authorities to further strengthen co-operative oversight arrangements where appropriate.\n\n# Policy development\n\nThe HKMA will continue to enhance and refine its banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account international standards and best practices.\n\n# Implementation of Basel standards in Hong Kong\n\n# Capital standards\n\nThe HKMA will continue to enhance the capital framework with the implementation of the standards published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) in recent years, which include the following:\n\nThe Capital Requirements for Banks’ Equity Investments in Funds of December 2013 (EIF standard), which will come into effect on 1 July 2022 with the Banking (Capital) (Amendment) Rules 2022 commencing operation after negative vetting by the Legislative Council.\n\nThe revised capital standards set out in the Basel III Finalising Post-crisis Reforms of December 2017, the Minimum Capital Requirements for Market Risk of January 2019 (revised in February 2019), and the Targeted Revisions to the Credit Valuation Adjustment Risk Framework of July 2020, which are collectively referred to as the “Basel III final reform package”.  These revised capital standards set out the revised capital treatment of credit risk, market risk, credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk and operational risk, introduce an output floor requirement, and enhance the leverage ratio framework.  Amendments to the Banking (Capital) Rules (BCR) are being prepared in consultation with the industry with a view to them taking effect from 1 July 2023 as minimum requirements (except for those on market risk and CVA risk2).\n\nGiven that the capital treatment for sovereign concentration risk under the BCR was designed to complement the Basel Committee’s large exposure framework as implemented by the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules, the HKMA will propose amendments to the capital rules in parallel with relevant changes to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules.\n\n# Exposure limits\n\nThe HKMA will continue its work on the proposed amendments to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules in consultation with the industry and the Department of Justice with a target implementation date aligned with the one for the Basel III final reform package, i.e. 1 July 2023.\n\n# Disclosure standards\n\nNew or revised disclosure requirements associated with the revised capital standards in the Basel III final reform package are mainly set out in the Pillar 33 Disclosure Requirements – Updated Framework and the Revisions to Market Risk Disclosure Requirements, published by the Basel Committee in December 2018 and November 2021 respectively.  The Basel Committee also published the Revisions to Leverage Ratio Disclosure Requirements in June 2019 amending the disclosure requirements for leverage ratio to address concerns regarding potential “window-dressing” (i.e. banks reducing the volumes of certain transactions around reporting dates to artificially inflate their leverage ratios for reporting and public disclosure).  Corresponding amendments to the Banking (Disclosure) Rules to implement these new or revised disclosure requirements are also being prepared, with a view to having them take effect in Hong Kong along the same timelines as their associated revised capital standards.\n\n# Other supervisory policies and risk management guidelines\n\nTo reflect developments in regulatory requirements and international standards, the HKMA plans to update certain SPM modules, including those relevant to the implementation of the revised capital and disclosure standards in the Basel III final reform package, “Countercyclical Capital Buffer – Approach to its Implementation”, “Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book”, “New Share Subscription and Share Margin Financing” and “Stress Testing”.  The HKMA will also continue to work on the revised SPM modules on “Code of Conduct” and “Reporting Requirements Relating to Authorized Institutions’ External Auditors under the Banking Ordinance”, with an aim to finalising the revisions within 2022. Consequential to the proposed amendments to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules, the related Code of Practice and SPM modules, e.g. CR-G-8 on “Large Exposures and Risk Concentrations” and CR-G-9 on “Exposures to Connected Parties”, will be updated accordingly.\n", "zh": "# 2022年及未來的優先事項\n\n進入2022年，全球及本地環境惡化顯著。一方面，烏克蘭局勢的升級及美國聯邦儲備局預期加息引發市場波動。另一方面，本地經濟受到新一波新冠病毒疫情的打擊。儘管如此，香港的金融體系憑藉其韌性及多年來建立的儲備，仍有良好位置抵禦不利衝擊。展望未來，金管局將繼續高度重視維護貨幣及金融穩定。在此過程中，我們將努力保持領先，識別新興風險並以敏捷的方式回應。同時，金管局亦將尋找機遇，加強香港作為國際金融中心的地位。在管理外匯基金方面，面對這一複雜的投資環境，金管局將持續謹慎投資，同時保持彈性，適時採取防禦措施，並保持高度流動性。\n\n# 金融系統的穩定與誠信\n\n全球經濟前景仍充滿重大不確定性。金管局將持續追蹤最新發展，保持警惕潛在風險，以維護金融體系的韌性與穩定，這對確保持續提供支持香港經濟運作的關鍵金融服務至關重要。\n\n# 持續警惕潛在風險\n\n展望未來，市場在各方面不確定性增加下，可能出現較高波動性。一方面，美國聯邦儲備局如果以較快速度正常化貨幣政策，或會明顯收緊全球金融條件，增加全球債務服務負擔。另一方面，2022年初烏克蘭局勢升級後，涵蓋中美緊張局勢在內的地緣政治不確定性可能持續高企，並再次引發市場波動。最後，隨著疫情的持續變化，若重新大規模實施封城措施，將可能導致全球供應鏈持續瓶頸，進而不利於全球經濟增長及通脹。儘管如此，香港的金融體系憑藉多年來建立的韌性與儲備，仍有能力應對不利衝擊。金管局亦具備充足資源與承諾，致力保障香港的貨幣和金融穩定。\n\n我們將繼續密切監測國內外環境中的風險與脆弱點，並在必要時採取適切措施，以維持香港的貨幣及金融穩定。2022年的研究計劃將探討影響香港經濟的議題，並評估其潛在風險。同時，金管局持續推進數碼化計劃，提升監控能力，以支援更全面及綜合的金融系統監測與分析。\n\n# 維持銀行穩定\n\n隨著已發展市場緊縮貨幣政策及疫情影響持續，銀行業面臨的信貸環境預計仍具挑戰。同時，快速的科技進步與數碼化，為銀行業帶來機遇與挑戰。在這個瞬息萬變的金融環境中，金管局將持續努力，透過監管，確保銀行能抵禦衝擊。此外，金管局亦將不斷完善及優化銀行監管及規例政策，並參照國際準則及最佳實務。\n\n# 以風險為本的監管重點\n\n# 信用風險\n\n2022年，金管局將加強對銀行信用風險敞口的監察，並採取積極措施，確保整體風險水平受到良好控制。金管局亦將密切追蹤疫情的發展及其對企業經營狀況的影響，並與銀行及商業界保持緊密對話，同時持續檢視各項紓困措施。\n\n# 業務及科技風險\n\n2022年5月，隨著新《監管政策手冊》（SPM）「運作韌性」模組的發布，金管局將繼續與業界合作，了解認可機構（AIs）在建立運作韌性框架方面的進展。同時，金管局將根據「網絡韌性評估框架2.0」的評估結果，跟進AIs在網絡韌性方面的改善情況，並監控AIs在實施安全三級數據備份方面的進展。另一個監管重點是評估與應對AIs對科技服務供應商依賴日增的風險。\n\n隨著數碼能力的提升及疫情期間積累的遠程工作經驗，一些AIs已計劃轉型為混合工作模式，金管局將關注這一趨勢，評估相關風險是否得到充分應對。\n\n# 流動性與市場風險\n\n2022年，金管局將重點監督AIs在流動性及市場風險管理方面的作為。特別是，將持續監控AIs向已停止公布的倫敦銀行同業拆息（LIBOR）過渡的進展，目標是在2023年6月30日前完成相關過渡工作。\n\n# 打擊洗錢與恐怖分子資金籌集\n\n2022年，金管局在反洗錢及反恐怖資金籌集（AML/CFT）方面的工作將著重於加強反應詐騙及金融犯罪的措施，通過合作與資訊分享，推動多方合作與聯合行動。其他重點包括運用數據及監管科技（Suptech）提升風險感知與監管能力，以及促進銀行及儲值支付工具（SVF）行業採用Regtech，包括交易監控系統。\n\n金管局亦將與政府、銀行業和儲值支付工具持牌機構攜手合作，發布新版香港洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險評估，協助行業應對新興風險。工作亦將延伸至了解洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集的變化趨勢，修訂AML相關法律法規及指引，以符合國際標準；並持續積極與其他監管機構及國際標準制定者合作。\n\n# 財富管理与強制性公積金相關業務\n\n2022年，金管局將對有關財富管理、證券銷售、強制性公積金（MPF）及其他投資和保險產品的行為進行實地監查與非實地監測，重點包括粵港澳大灣區跨境財富管理（WMC）計劃、數碼顧問平台、複雜產品、虛擬資產及非投資相連長期保險產品。\n\n在與其他監管機構和銀行業持續密切溝通下，金管局將就投資、保險及MPF產品的銷售規範提供進一步指引，內容包括虛擬資產相關的投資服務及與保障型投資相連壽險（Protection Linked Plans，這是一種具有高保障程度的投資相連產品）的銷售規範。金管局、保險業監管局及強積金計劃管理局將聯合推行“喬裝客戶檢查”計劃，針對合資格延期年金保單（QDAP）及稅務寬減自願性供款的銷售行為進行調查。\n\n在成功推出粵港澳大灣區跨境WMC后，金管局將繼續與行業和相關監管部門合作，完善計劃。\n\n此外，金管局將推進新的SPM模組和行為守則，監督機構的信托業務。\n\n# 監管金融市場基建\n\n金管局將持續推進金融市場基建（FMIs）的安全與效率，依據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（PSSVFO）、《金融市場基建原則》（PFMI）及支付及市場基建委員會（CPMI）發布的指引，微調監管架構以適應最新技術與市場發展。\n\n金管局將與FMIs合作，確保它們遵守PFMI，並根據情況進行評估與更新。將持續參與CPMI-IOSCO的PFMI落實監察與評估工作，並在國際標準制定組織的相關工作中積極發聲，根據市場和技術變化，強化監管要求，並與相關當局進一步合作，加強跨部門協作。\n\n# 政策制定\n\n金管局將不斷優化和完善其銀行監管及規範體系及政策，借鑑國際標準和最佳實務。\n\n# 在香港推行巴塞爾協定標準\n\n# 資本標準\n\n金管局將進一步完善資本框架，落實由巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（巴塞爾委員會）近期發佈的標準，包括：\n\n2013年12月制訂的「銀行對基金的股權投資資本要求」（EIF標準），自2022年7月1日生效，並在立法會負面審查後由《銀行（資本）修訂條例》啟動實施。\n\n2017年12月的《巴塞爾協定三：危機後改革的最終方案》修訂後的資本標準，以及2019年1月的《市場風險最低資本要求》（2019年2月修訂），及2020年7月的《信用估值調整（CVA）風險架構》修訂，合稱為「《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案」。這些修訂標準調整了信用風險、市場風險、CVA風險及操作風險的資本處理，並引入產出底線要求，強化槓桿比率架構。行業正就修改《資本規則》（BCR）進行磋商，預計自2023年7月1日生效，作為最低要求（ Market risk及CVA風險除外）。\n\n由於在《資本規則》下，主權集中風險的資本處理設計旨在配合巴塞爾委員會在《敞口限額》規例下推行的大額風險框架，金管局亦計劃就相關修改提出建議，並同步修訂《敞口限額》規例。\n\n# 敞口限額\n\n金管局將與行業及司法部合作，持續推動《敞口限額》規例的修改，預計自2023年7月1日實施，與《巴塞爾協定三》最終方案同期。\n\n# 披露標準\n\n根據《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案，新增或修訂的披露規定主要在《第三支柱披露規定：更新框架》和《市場風險披露規定修訂》中發布（2018年12月及2021年11月）。另外，巴塞爾委員會亦於2019年6月公布了《槓桿比率披露要求修訂》，旨在防範可能出現的“粉飾公司面貌”問題（即銀行在報告期前後調整交易量以虛增槓桿比率進行操縱）。相關修訂將作為《披露規則》的一部分同步落實，預計在香港與資本標準同步生效。\n\n# 其他監管政策及風險管理指引\n\n為反映監管要求及國際標準的發展，金管局將更新某些SPM模組，包括與《巴塞爾協定三》資本和披露標準、\"逆周期資本緩衝－實施方法\"、\"利率風險\"、《新股認購及股票孖展融資》及\"壓力測試\"等相關模組。並將持續完善“行為守則”及《銀行條例》下的“認可機構外聘核數師的披露要求”模組，力求在2022年完成修訂。 隨著相關修改《資本規則》的調整，配套的“守則”及SPM模組（如“重大敞口及風險集中”及“關連方敞口”）也將相應修訂。"}
{"en": "# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nWith strong merchandise exports, reviving domestic demand and a boost from the Government’s supportive policy measures, the Hong Kong economy resumed positive growth in 2021, reversing the contraction experienced during 2019 and 2020. The labour market also improved, and inflation remained moderate albeit having edged up. While economic recovery is expected to continue after the fifth wave of COVID-19 subsides, its strength and speed are subject to uncertainties and risks, especially those surrounding the pandemic and the path of US monetary policy normalisation.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Real activities\n\nDriven by strong merchandise exports and improving domestic demand, the Hong Kong economy grew by 6.3% in 2021, ending the economic contraction in 2019 and 2020 (Table 1 and Chart 1).  Private consumption recovered, thanks to improved labour market conditions and a boost from the Government’s Consumption Voucher Scheme1. Overall investment spending also rebounded as the business environment and outlook improved2.  Externally, HongKong’s exports of goods saw strong growth for the whole year, in part supported by the continued global economic recovery.  Export of services recorded modest growth, reflecting active regional trade and cargo flows as well as stronger cross-border business and financial activities. Total imports rose appreciably, mainly because of greater domestic and re-export-induced demand.  On a net basis, external trade contributed positively to real gross domestic product (GDP) growth in 2021 (Chart 1) as total exports grew faster than imports.\n\nTable 1 Real GDP growth by expenditure component (period-over-period)\n\nNote: The seasonally-adjusted quarter-on-quarter rates of change in the gross domestic fixed capital formation are not available. Source: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Inflation\n\nInflationary pressures edged up but remained moderate during the year.  Netting out the effects of the Government’s one-off relief measures, the year-on-year underlying inflation rate3 picked up gradually to a mild 1.4% in December (Chart 2)4.  Prices of consumer items such as dining out, transport, clothing and footwear regained upward momentum as local consumption demand improved. Import prices also increased notably alongside bottlenecks in global supply chains and the surge in international energy and commodity prices.  By contrast, the housing component was a drag on overall inflation, reflecting the feed-through of the earlier decline in fresh-letting private residential rentals (Chart 2).  More broadly, slow growth in nominal wage and commercial rentals helped keep domestic business cost pressures in check.  For 2021 as a whole, the underlying and headline inflation rates5 stayed mild at 0.6% and 1.6% respectively.\n\nChart 2 Underlying consumer price inflation\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Labour market\n\nAlongside the domestic economic recovery, the labour market improved in 2021.  After reaching a 17-year high of 7.2% in February, the unemployment rate declined visibly to 4.0% in December6 (Chart 3) and the decline was broad based across most economic sectors.  Overall labour demand strengthened gradually as reflected by a pick-up in total employment (Chart 3) and private sector vacancies, though they were still below their pre-pandemic peaks.  On the other hand, the labour force shrank slightly by 1.3% in December compared with a year earlier, partly due to a modest decline in the labour force participation rate. The year-on-year growth in nominal wage and labour earnings, while moderate, showed signs of acceleration in the first three quarters of 2021, reversing the trend of deceleration during 2019–2020.\n\nChart 3 Labour market conditions\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe local stock market was broadly sluggish during the year, despite a continued rally in some major overseas equity markets (Chart 4).  Extending its rebound in late 2020, the Hang Seng Index rose to a high of 31,085 on 17 February 2021, but market sentiment had turned sharply negative since then owing to a host of factors, including concerns about the new COVID-19 virus variants, potential monetary policy tightening by major central banks and reduced inflows from southbound trading under Stock Connect7.  The Hang Seng Index closed the year at 23,398, down markedly by 14.1% from a year ago.\n\nChart 4 Asset prices\nSources: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market regained some upward momentum in the first half of 2021 alongside better economic prospects, but saw some consolidation in the second half amid weakened asset market sentiments (Chart 4).  Overall, housing prices and transaction volume still recorded an increase of 3.7% and 24.1% respectively in 2021. Household affordability also became even more stretched, partly reflecting reduced household income.  On the other hand, after going through sharp corrections in 2019 and 2020, the non-residential property markets generally improved, with prices and rentals of industrial properties generally rising to their pre-pandemic peaks, whereas those of retail and office spaces remained below their respective peaks.\n\nSee Table B: Major Economic Indicators on pages 326 to 327 for more details, including their trends during 2017–2021.\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nIn early 2022, the fifth wave of local COVID-19 infections has exerted pressures on domestic economic activities. In response, the Government introduced the fifth and the sixth rounds of the Anti-epidemic Fund and additional countercyclical measures under the 2022–23 Budget to help support the economy.  The HKMA, together with the banking sector, also extended the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme to the end of October 2022.\n\nFor 2022 as a whole, economic recovery is expected to continue, albeit at a more moderate pace compared to 2021, partly reflecting the impact of the fifth wave of COVID-19, slower global economic growth, a less favourable base effect and US monetary policy normalisation.  The Government forecasts real GDP growth for 2022 to be in the range of 1–2% and the latest growth estimates by international organisations and private sector analysts averaged 1.1%.  That said, the strength and pace of the recovery are subject to a host of uncertainties and risks, especially those surrounding the pandemic, the Ukraine situation, and the path of US monetary policy normalisation.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nAlongside rising import prices and pandemic-induced logistics disruptions, inflationary pressures are expected to edge up in the near term, but should stay broadly in check owing to soft rentals and mild local labour cost pressures. Market consensus forecasts a headline inflation rate of 2.4% in 2022, while the Government projects the headline and underlying inflation rates to be 2.1% and 2.0% respectively. The fifth wave of local COVID-19 infections has exerted pressures on the labour market in early 2022, especially for contact-intensive sectors.  Further out, labour market conditions will depend on the pandemic developments and the pace of the domestic economic recovery.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector continued to be stable in 2021.  Total banking assets expanded moderately as both loans and deposits increased.  The capital and liquidity positions of the banking sector remained robust. Asset quality stayed at a healthy level by both historical and international standards.\n\n# Balance sheet trends\n\nThe banking sector’s balance sheet grew by 1.9% in 2021. Driven by the economic recovery, total loans recorded a growth of 3.8% during the year, compared with 1.2% in 2020.  Among the total, loans for use in Hong Kong grew by 4.4%, loans for use outside Hong Kong grew by 1.1% and trade finance increased by 14.2%.  Mainland-related lending expanded by 3.6% in 2021, after remaining largely stable in 2020.\n\nOn the liability side, total deposits rose by 4.6% in 2021, compared with 5.4% in 2020.  As total deposits increased at a faster pace than total loans, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio edged down to 71.8% at the end of 2021 from 72.3% a year ago (Chart 5).\n\nChart 5 Loans and deposits of the banking sector\nSource: HKMA.\n\n# Capital adequacy\n\nThe banking sector remained well capitalised. The consolidated total capital ratio of locally incorporated authorized institutions (AIs) stood at 20.2% at the end of 2021.  The Tier 1 capital ratio was 18.2% (Chart 6). Both ratios were well above their respective international minimum requirements of 8% and 6%.\n\nThe Basel III leverage ratio was 7.9% at the end of 2021, well above the statutory minimum requirement of 3% (Chart 7).\n\n# Liquidity\n\nThe liquidity position of the banking sector was sound.  The quarterly average Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) of category 1 institutions8 was 151.9% in the fourth quarter of 2021, well\n\nabove the statutory minimum requirement of 100%. The quarterly average Liquidity Maintenance Ratio (LMR) of category 2 institutions was 59.1%, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 25% (Chart 8).\n\nChart 8 Liquidity ratios of designated AIs\nSource: HKMA.\n\nThe sources of funding of the banking sector remained stable.  The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) of category 1 institutions was 135.3% at the end of 2021, well above the statutory minimum requirement of 100%.  The Core Funding\n\nRatio (CFR) of category 2A institutions9 was 150.3% at the end of 2021, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 75% (Chart 9).\n\nChart 9 Funding ratios of designated AIs\nSource: HKMA.\n\n# Asset quality\n\nAsset quality remained stable during the year and stayed at a healthy level by both historical and international standards. The classified loan ratio was 0.88% at the end of 2021 as compared to 0.90% at the end of 2020, with the overdue and rescheduled loan ratio edging down to 0.56% from 0.57% during the period (Chart 10).  The classified loan ratio for Mainland-related lending was 0.86% at the end of 2021 as compared to 0.96% at the end of 2020.  The delinquency ratios of residential mortgage lending and credit card lending remained low at 0.04% and 0.20% respectively (Chart 11). The HKMA will continue to closely monitor the change in the asset quality of the banking sector.\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe low interest rate environment continued to weigh on the profitability of the banking sector.  The aggregate pre-tax operating profit of retail banks declined by 19.8% in 2021 (Chart 12), mainly attributable to a decrease in net interest income (-13.6%) and an increase in total operating expenses (+7.1%).  These were partly offset by an increase in income from fees and commissions (+9.6%) and a drop in loan impairment charges (-25.1%).  The net interest margin further narrowed to 0.98% in 2021 from 1.18% in 2020 (Chart 13).\n\nRetail banks’ cost-to-income ratio rose to 54.7% in 2021 from 47.0% in 2020 (Chart 14).\n", "zh": "# 經濟及金融環境\n\n憑藉強勁的貨物出口、復甦的本地需求以及政府的支持政策措施，香港經濟於2021年恢復正增長，逆轉了2019和2020年的收縮。勞動市場亦有所改善，通脹保持適度，儘管略有上升。隨著第五波新冠病毒疫情消退，經濟復甦預期將持續，但其力度和速度仍受多種不確定因素和風險影響，尤其是疫情和美國貨幣政策正常化的路徑。\n\n# 回顧經濟\n\n# 實體活動\n\n受貨物出口強勁和本地需求改善推動，香港經濟於2021年增長6.3%，結束了2019和2020年的經濟收縮（表1及圖1）。私營消費在勞動市場條件改善及政府消費券計劃的推動下復甦。整體投資支出亦隨著商業環境及展望改善而反彈。對外方面，香港貨物出口全年表現強勁，部分由於全球經濟持續復甦。服務出口錄得適度增長，反映區域貿易和貨物流活動活躍，以及跨境商業及金融活動的增加。總進口顯著上升，主要由於國內及轉口需求增加。淨出口方面，外貿在2021年對實體國內生產總值（GDP）增長作出正面貢獻（圖1），因為出口增長速度高於進口。\n\n表1 按支出分類的實質GDP增長（期內比較）\n\n註：未提供季節調整後的國內固定資本形成季度變動率。資料來源：統計處。\n\n# 通脹\n\n通脹壓力略有上升，但仍屬適度。在剔除政府一次性紓困措施的影響下，基礎通脹率隨著時間逐步升至2021年12月的1.4%（圖2）。外出用膳、交通、衣著和鞋類等消費品價格回升，主要受本地需求改善影響。同時，受全球供應鏈阻塞及國際能源與商品價格激增影響，進口價格亦明顯上升。相比之下，房地產部分對整體通脹呈拖累，反映早前私人物業租賃價格下降的傳導（圖2）。此外，名義工資和商業租金增長放緩，有助於抑制本地企業成本壓力。2021年全年，基礎和總體通脹率分別維持在0.6%和1.6%的溫和水準。\n\n圖2 消費者物價通脹的基礎指標\n資料來源：統計處。\n\n# 勞動市場\n\n隨著本地經濟復甦，勞動市場亦有所改善。失業率在2021年達到17年高點的7.2%後，於12月明顯下降至4.0%（圖3），且變動較為廣泛，涉及多數經濟部門。隨著總就業人數（圖3）及私營部門空缺數提升，整體勞動需求逐步增強，儘管仍低於疫情前的高點。另一方面，2021年12月，勞動參與率略降1.3%，使勞動力縮減。名義工資和勞動收入較為溫和，但於2021年前三季度出現加速跡象，逆轉2019–2020年的放緩趨勢。\n\n圖3 勞動市場狀況\n資料來源：統計處。\n\n# 股市\n\n儘管海外主要股市持續上升，香港本地股市整體表現較為疲弱（圖4）。恆生指數在2021年2月17日升至31,085點的高位，但由於多重因素，市場情緒自此轉趨偏悲觀，包括新變異新冠病毒株的擔憂、主要央行可能收緊貨幣政策，以及南向「港股通」資金流入減少（圖4）。全年收盤價為23,398點，較去年大幅下跌14.1%。\n\n圖4 資產價格\n資料來源：評估及估值署及香港交易及結算所有限公司。\n\n# 樓市\n\n2021年上半年，伴隨經濟前景較佳，住宅物業市場略見升勢，但在下半年經資產市場所謂情緒轉淡後出現盤整（圖4）。整體而言，2021年樓價和成交量分別升幅3.7%和24.1%。居民負擔能力進一步收緊，部分原因是家庭收入下降。另一方面，經歷2019和2020年的急劇調整後，非住宅物業市場普遍改善，工業物業的價格和租金大致回升至疫情前巔峰，而零售和寫字樓的價格和租金仍低於其各自的巔峰水平。\n\n有關詳細資料，請參見第326至327頁的「主要經濟指標（表B）」，包括2017–2021年的趨勢。\n\n# 經濟展望\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n2022年初，本地疫情第五波衝擊經濟活動。政府因此推出第五和第六輪防疫抗疫基金，以及2022至23年度財政預算案下的額外逆周期措施，以幫助支持經濟。金管局連同銀行業亦延長了預先批核還息不還本計劃至2022年10月底。\n\n展望2022年，經濟復甦仍將持續，但較2021年更為溫和，部分受第五波疫情、全球經濟增長放緩、基期較低及美國貨幣政策正常化等因素影響。政府預測2022年實質GDP增長介乎1%至2%，而國際組織和私營分析機構的最新預測平均為1.1%。儘管如此，經濟復甦的力度和速度仍受多重不確定性和風險影響，尤其是疫情、烏克蘭局勢以及美國貨幣政策正常化的路徑。\n\n# 通脹與勞動市場\n\n隨著進口價格上升和疫情引發的物流中斷，短期內通脹壓力預計將略有上升，但由於租金疲軟及本地勞動成本壓力較輕，整體應維持在可控範圍。市場普遍預測2022年的總體通脹率為2.4%，而政府則預計總體通脹率及基礎通脹率分別為2.1%和2.0%。2022年初，疫情第五波對勞動市場構成壓力，特別是高接觸行業。未來，勞動市場狀況將取決於疫情發展及本地經濟復甦速度。\n\n# 金融機構表現\n\n香港金融業在2021年保持穩健。總資產適度擴展，貸款和存款均有所增加，資本及流動性情況依然充裕。資產質素保持在健康水平，符合歷史和國際標準。\n\n# 資產負債表趨勢\n\n2021年，銀行業資產負債表增長1.9%。疫後經濟復甦推動全年貸款增長3.8%，較2020年的1.2%為高。其中，香港本地貸款增長4.4%，香港以外貸款增長1.1%，貿易融資則增加14.2%。內地相關貸款在2021年擴展3.6%，而2020年基本保持穩定。\n\n在負債方面，存款總額增長4.6%，較2020年的5.4%略低。由於存款增長速度高於貸款，整體貸存比於2021年底微升至71.8%，較去年同期的72.3%略有下降（圖5）。\n\n圖5 銀行業的貸款與存款\n資料來源：香港金融管理局。\n\n# 資本充足率\n\n香港銀行業資本充足良好。2021年底，本地認可機構的綜合資本比率為20.2%。第一支柱資本充足率為18.2%（圖6）。兩者均遠高於國際最低要求8%和6%。\n\n巴塞爾協定三的槓桿比率於2021年底為7.9%，遠高於法定最低要求3%（圖7）。\n\n# 流動性\n\n銀行業的流動性狀況良好。2021年第四季度，一類機構的季度平均流動性覆蓋比率（LCR）為151.9%，遠高於法定最低100%的要求。二類機構的季度平均流動性維持比率（LMR）為59.1%，亦大大高於法定最低25%（圖8）。\n\n圖8 指定認可機構的流動性比率\n資料來源：香港金融管理局。\n\n銀行業的融資來源保持穩定。一類機構的淨穩定資金比率（NSFR）於2021年底為135.3%，遠高於法定最低100%。二類機構的核心資金比率（CFR）為150.3%，亦高於75%的最低要求（圖9）。\n\n圖9 指定認可機構的資金比率\n資料來源：香港金融管理局。\n\n# 資產質素\n\n2021年，資產質素保持穩定，並在歷史和國際標準下均屬健康。2021年底，差餉物業估價署的特定分類貸款比率為0.88%，較2020年底的0.90%略有下降，拖欠和重組貸款比率由0.57%降至0.56%（圖10）。內地相關貸款的分類貸款比率為0.86%，較2020年底的0.96%為低。住宅按揭和信用卡貸款的拖欠率則分別保持低位，為0.04%和0.20%（圖11）。香港金融管理局將繼續密切監測金融業的資產質素變化。\n\n# 盈利走勢\n\n低利率環境持續拖累銀行業盈利。2021年零售銀行的稅前經營溢利合計下降19.8%（圖12），主要因淨利息收入下降13.6%及經營開支上升7.1%。收入來源中的費用及佣金增加9.6%，而貸款減值撥備則下降25.1%，抵銷部分損失。2021年，淨息差進一步由2020年的1.18%收窄至0.98%（圖13）。\n\n零售銀行的費用與收入比率由2020年的47.0%升至2021年的54.7%（圖14）。"}
{"en": "# Monetary Stability\n\nDespite the lingering uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and increased concerns about the pace of US monetary tightening, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to trade in a smooth and orderly manner.  As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability since it was implemented in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System has shown its strength and resilience to external shocks.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability.  This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\n# The Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n\nCertificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks; Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation; the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of clearing account balances kept with the HKMA; and Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs).  With the HKMA standing ready to sell (or buy) Hong Kong dollars to (or from) banks in exchange for US dollars upon request at 7.75 (or 7.85) per US dollar, when the strong-side (or weak-side) CU is triggered, the Aggregate Balance will expand (or contract) to push down (or up) Hong Kong dollar interest rates that would help move the Hong Kong dollar back to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2021\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nDriven by equity-related demand arising from fundraising activities and the southbound Stock Connects1, the Hong Kong dollar traded close to the strong-side CU at the beginning of the year.  Thereafter, the Hong Kong dollar weakened amid stock market correction and repatriation of initial public offering (IPO) proceeds by some newly listed firms before rebounding slightly in the second quarter due to corporates’ dividend payment needs and net inflows from the southbound Stock Connects.  Stepping into the second half of the year, while the Hong Kong dollar drifted lower amid softened equity market sentiment, it stayed mostly at the strong side of the Convertibility Zone and continued to trade in a smooth and orderly manner (Chart 1).  Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market functioned normally throughout 2021.\n\nChart 1 Market exchange rate in 2021\n\nAs the CUs were not triggered, the total of the Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs remained virtually unchanged at around HK$1,526.3 billion in 2021 (Chart 2). During the year, the HKMA issued a total of HK$80 billion additional Exchange Fund Bills to meet the ongoing demand for Exchange Fund paper by banks amid the abundance of liquidity in the banking system, which led to a contraction of the Aggregate Balance from HK$457.5 billion at the end of 2020 to HK$377.5 billion at the end of 2021.\n\nReflecting the additional issuance of Exchange Fund Bills and the issuance of EFBNs to absorb EFBNs’ interest payments according to the established practice, the outstanding EFBNs increased from HK$1,069.2 billion to HK$1,148.8 billion during the year.  The Monetary Base as a whole remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\n# HK$1,526.3 billion\n\nTotal Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs\n\nChart 2 Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding Exchange Fund papers in 2021\n\n# Money market\n\nWith the sizeable Aggregate Balance, the Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained largely stable at low levels throughout the year (Chart 3).  While the demand for the Hong Kong dollar increased along with the IPO activities during the first quarter, Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs) of various tenors saw little fluctuations.  Thereafter, HIBORs remained largely stable despite concerns about the pace of US monetary tightening.  Towards the end of 2021, HIBORs witnessed mild pick-ups, partly reflecting anticipated funding needs towards the year end.  On the retail front, banks kept their Best Lending Rates unchanged.  Overall, Hong Kong’s money markets continued to function normally.  Discount Window borrowing decreased to HK$6.8 billion in 2021 from HK$9.1 billion in 2020.\n\nChart 3 Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates in 2021\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nThe Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has been a strong anchor of Hong Kong’s financial system for more than three decades and has shown its strength and resilience to challenges.  Despite lingering uncertainties surrounding global economic recovery, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to function in an orderly manner, reflecting the robustness of the LERS.  The Government is firmly committed to the LERS.  In its 2021 External Sector Report, the International Monetary Fund once again reiterated that the credibility of the LERS has been assured by a transparent set of rules, ample fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nA robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS.  Hong Kong’s banking sector continued to operate smoothly with liquidity positions and capitalisation faring very well by international standards.  To ensure resilience of the banking sector, the HKMA has been closely monitoring banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and has maintained its supervisory efforts on bank lending.\n\nTo improve transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998.  The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) moved within a range of 109.8–110.5% during 2021, without touching the Upper or the Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 110.2% on 31 December (Chart 4). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate.  The ample financial resources of the Exchange Fund, together with the sound banking system, provide a powerful backstop to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nChart 4 Daily movement of the Backing Ratio in 2021\n\n# Currency Board Sub-Committee\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong.  In 2021, the CBC considered issues, including an assessment of inflation in the US, implications of the US dollar depreciation on Hong Kong, assessment of the taper tantrum risk and its impact on Hong Kong, and understanding the influence of Mainland-related fund flows on monetary conditions in Hong Kong.  Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and reports on the Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Notes and coins\n\nAt the end of 2021, the total value of banknotes issued by note-issuing banks in circulation was HK$592.6 billion, an increase of 5.9% from a year earlier (Charts 5, 6 and 7). The total value of Government-issued notes and coins in circulation amounted to HK$12.9 billion at the end of 2021, up 1.7% year on year (Charts 8 and 9).\n\n# HK$592.6 billion, +5.9%\n\nTotal value of banknotes issued by note-issuing banks\n\n# HK$12.9 billion, +1.7%\n\nTotal value of notes and coins issued by Government\n\n# Chart 5\n\nBanknotes in circulation by note-issuing banks at the end of 2021\n\n# Chart 6 \n\nDistribution of banknotes in circulation at the end of 2021\n\n# Hong Kong banknotes\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA arranged 14 seminars for more than 4,000 participants, including professionals in the banking and retail industries as well as students, to help enhance their knowledge and skills in differentiating between authentic and counterfeit banknotes.  These public education programmes on the design and security features of Hong Kong banknotes are well received.\n\n# Coin Collection Programme\n\nThe Coin Collection Programme continued to be well received by the public.  More information about the Programme can be found in the Sustainability chapter on page 198.\n\n# Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\n\nThe EFBN Programme continued to operate smoothly. To meet the ongoing demand for Exchange Fund paper by banks amid the abundance of liquidity in the banking system, the HKMA issued a total of HK$80 billion additional Exchange Fund Bills in the second half of 2021.  The additional issuance resulted in a corresponding reduction of the Aggregate Balance.  At the end of 2021, the nominal amount of outstanding Exchange Fund papers stood at HK$1,148.6 billion (Table 2).\n\nTable 2 Outstanding issues of Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\n\n# Monetary research\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMR)  maintained a steady research output in 2021 despite the ongoing pandemic.  During the year, the HKIMR released 30 working papers and held nine webinars, which encompassed a wide range of topics including monetary policy, banking stability, market microstructure and financial technology (fintech) development.  The HKIMR also organised an international conference and a webinar in hybrid format.\n\nThe webinar, titled RMB Exchange Rate Formation Mechanism and Exchange Rate Outlook, was co-organised with the Hong Kong Academy of Finance on 17 August.  It was live-streamed on a number of online platforms and attracted a total of over 1.16 million real-time views.\n\nThe 11th Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy, titled On the Path to Common Prosperity: China’s Economic Development in Dual Circulation, was held on 11 November.  The conference discussed recent policy developments related to common prosperity, dual circulation, anti-monopoly regulations, property market, Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect and financial developments in the Greater Bay Area5.  Expert speakers also presented in-depth analyses on the impact of population ageing and the sustainability of social security funds, as well as China’s contribution to global financial stability and world economy.  The six different sessions of the conference attracted over 3,200 online and on-site viewers, totaling 5,900 views.\n\n", "zh": "# 貨幣穩定\n\n儘管新冠病毒疫情的持續不確定性及對美國貨幣收緊步伐的擔憂增加，港元匯率及貨幣市場仍然保持平穩、有序的交易。自1983年實施以來，聯繫匯率制度一直是香港貨幣與金融穩定的基石，展現出其抗外部衝擊的實力與韌性。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的首要目標是貨幣穩定。這指的是港幣在外匯市場與美元之間的匯率於港幣7.75–7.85之間波動的穩定外部匯率價值。貨幣系統的結構由貨幣局制度構成，要求貨幣基數至少由外匯基金持有的美元儲備100%支持，貨幣基數的變動須與美元儲備的相應變動完全匹配。\n\n# 貨幣基數（表1）包括：\n\n提供三家發鈔行發行紙幣的全部支持的負債證明書；在流通中的政府發行紙幣和硬幣；結算戶口餘額之和的「總結餘」；以及由港發行的外匯基金票據和債券（EFBNs）。\n\n港元匯率的穩定主要通過自動利率調整機制及金管局對兌換保證（CUs）的堅定承諾來維持。當強方（或弱方）CU被觸發時，金管局準備在7.75（或7.85）兌1美元的價位，賣出（或買入）港元與美元兌換，總結餘則會擴大（或縮小），以壓低（或抬升）港幣利率，促使港幣回復至7.75到7.85的兌換區間。\n\n# 2021年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n由於募資活動和南向股票通股票連接的股權相關需求，年初港元接近強方CUs水平。此後，由於股市調整及部分新掛牌公司在首次公開募股（IPO）資金匯回，在市場需求下降下，港元進一步貶值。在第二季度，受企業派息需求及南向股通資金淨流入影響，港元匯率略有回升。進入下半年，雖然股市情緒轉弱，港元仍多在兌換區的強邊，並保持平穩有序（見圖1）。整體而言，2021年港元交易市場正常運作。\n\n圖1 2021年市場匯率\n\n由於兌換保證未被觸發，2021年「總結餘」與未到期EFBNs總和幾乎保持不變，約為HK$1,526.3億（見圖2）。年內，金管局為滿足銀行對外匯基金票據的持續需求，發行了共計HK$800億的附加外匯基金票據，拉動銀行體系流動性充裕，導致結算戶口結餘由2020年底的HK$457.5億收縮至2021年底的HK$377.5億。\n\n反映出附加發行的外匯基金票據及按照既定慣例發行EFBNs以吸收EFBNs的利息支付，年內未到期EFBNs由HK$1,069.2億增至HK$1,148.8億。整體貨幣基數仍由外匯儲備全面支持。\n\n# HK$1,526.3億\n\n「總結餘」及未到期EFBNs合計\n\n圖2 2021年「結算前」的「總結餘」及未到期外匯基金票據\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n在較充裕的結算餘額支持下，港元銀行間拆息（HIBOR）全年大致保持低位穩定（見圖3）。雖然在第一季度，伴隨IPO活動增加，港元需求上升，短期HIBOR略有波動，然後在美國貨幣收緊步伐引發擔憂的情況下大多保持穩定。至年底，HIBOR有所升，部分反映年底的資金需求預期。零售端，銀行的最優惠貸款利率保持不變。整體而言，港元貨幣市場持續正常運作。去年，資金中心的貼現窩輪由HK$9.1億減少至HK$6.8億。\n\n圖3 2021年港元銀行間拆息\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n聯繫匯率制度（LERS）已成為香港金融體系超過三十年的堅實支柱，並多次經得起挑戰。儘管國際經濟復蘇仍存不確定因素，港元匯率及貨幣市場仍有序運行，彰顯LERS的韌性。政府堅定支持聯繫匯率制度。在2021年《外部部門報告》中，國際貨幣基金組織重申，LERS的可信度得益於一套透明的規則、充足的財政與外匯儲備、強健的金融監管與監督、靈活的經濟體系及審慎的財政框架。\n\n強健的銀行體系對LERS的正常運作至關重要。香港的銀行業持續平穩運行，流動性位置及資本水平在國際標準下表現良好。為確保銀行業韌性，金管局一直密切監測銀行的信貸、流動性和利率風險管理、壓力測試結果，並持續加強銀行的貸款監管工作。\n\n為改善貨幣局帳戶的透明度，自1998年10月起，一部分外匯基金資產已被分配支持貨幣基數。2021年，Backing Ratio（即支持資產除以貨幣基數）在109.8%至110.5%的範圍內波動，未觸及上限或下限。年度末為110.2%（見圖4）。在LERS體系下，雖有特定支援的外匯基金資產用於支持Backings Portfolio，所有外匯基金資產都能用來支援港幣匯率。豐厚的外匯基金資源及穩健的銀行系統，共同為香港的貨幣與金融穩定提供有力的後盾。\n\n圖4 2021年Backing Ratio每日變動\n\n# 貨幣局分委員會\n\n貨幣局分委員會（CBC）負責監察並檢討與香港貨幣及金融穩定相關的議題。2021年，CBC考慮了美國通脹走勢、美國美元貶值對香港的影響、收縮恐慌（taper tantrum）風險與其對香港的影響、以及內地資金流對香港貨幣狀況的影響。相關討論記錄和貨幣局運作報告均在金管局網站公布。\n\n# 硬幣與紙幣\n\n2021年底，流通中由發鈔行發行的紙幣總值為HK$5926億，較上一年增長5.9%（見圖5、6和7）。由政府發行的紙幣及硬幣總值則為HK$129億，較去年同期升1.7%（見圖8和9）。\n\n# HK$5926億，+5.9%\n\n發鈔行發行的紙幣總值\n\n# HK$129億，+1.7%\n\n政府發行的紙幣與硬幣總值\n\n# 圖5\n\n2021年發鈔行發行的流通紙幣分佈\n\n# 圖6\n\n2021年底流通中紙幣分佈\n\n# 香港紙幣\n\n去年，金管局安排了14個研討會，超過4,000名參與者，涵蓋銀行業、零售業專業人士及學生，旨在提升他們辨識真偽鈔的知識與技巧。這些有關港幣設計與安全特徵的公共教育計劃反響熱烈。\n\n# 硬幣收集計劃\n\n硬幣收集計劃仍然受到大眾歡迎。更多相關信息請參閱可持續發展章節第198頁。\n\n# 外匯基金票據與債券\n\nEFBN計劃持續平穩運作。為滿足銀行在流動性充裕下對外匯基金票據的持續需求，2021年下半年，金管局額外發行HK$800億的外匯基金票據。此次發行相應減少了結算戶口的結餘。2021年底，未到期外匯基金票據的名義金額為HK$1,1486億（見表2）。\n\n表2 2021年外匯基金票據及債券的未到期發行\n\n# 貨幣研究\n\n儘管疫情持續，香港貨幣及金融研究中心（HKIMR）2021年仍保持穩定的研究產出。年內，HKIMR發表了30篇工作論文，舉辦了九場網絡研討會，內容涵蓋貨幣政策、銀行穩定、市場微觀結構和金融科技發展等多個範疇。中心還組織了一場國際會議和一場混合型研討會。\n\n於8月17日，HKIMR與金融學院合辦了一場有關人民幣匯率形成機制與匯率展望的網絡研討會。該活動在多個線上平台直播，吸引超過116萬人次實時觀看。\n\n2022年11月，舉行了第十一屆中國經濟國際研討會，題為「走向共同富裕：雙循環格局中的中國經濟發展」，討論涉及共同富裕、雙循環、反壟斷規定、物業市場、粵港澳大灣區跨境財富管理通和金融發展等最新政策動向。專家針對人口老齡化、社會保障基金的可持續性，以及中國對全球金融穩定和世界經濟的貢獻，作出了深入分析。六個會議時段吸引超過3,200名線上及現場觀眾，總點擊次數達5,900。"}
{"en": "# Banking Stability\n\nThe banking sector in Hong Kong remained sound and stable in 2021, despite the emergence of more contagious COVID-19 variants, causing uncertainty to global economic recovery.  During the year, the HKMA remained focused on the supervision of authorized institutions’ risk management.  Supervision of authorized institutions’ operational and cyber resilience was also stepped up in light of escalating cyber threats and accelerating digitalisation in the banking sector.\n\nOn conduct supervision, the HKMA provided guidance to banks to facilitate the use of non-face-to-face channels for distributing investment and insurance products, and worked with fellow regulators to formulate supervisory requirements on new products in the market such as insurance-linked securities and virtual assets.  The Code of Banking Practice was also revised to enhance consumer protection in digital financial services.\n\nIn the area of anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT), the HKMA’s priority has been to further strengthen banks’ gatekeeper role in the ecosystem and their ability to prevent and detect illicit fund flows associated with increases in online fraud, mule account networks and other financial crimes during the pandemic.  To increase protection for customer accounts against fraud and financial crimes, the HKMA scaled up collaboration and information sharing with other stakeholders via public-private partnerships.  While supporting remote customer on-boarding, the HKMA also encouraged adoption of other technologies including network analytics through the launch of the first AML Regtech Lab in November.  Internationally, proactive engagement has kept the HKMA at the forefront of global AML/CFT efforts in the Financial Action Task Force.\n\nOn the development front, the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Pilot Scheme in the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area was launched smoothly in September.  During the year, the HKMA continued to execute its two-year roadmap for promoting Regtech adoption in Hong Kong.  Several initiatives were rolled out to lay the foundation for banks’ climate risk management and promote green and sustainable banking more broadly, as discussed in the Sustainability chapter. Further efforts were also made in the area of soft infrastructure, including promoting a customercentric corporate culture, as well as working with the banking industry to roll out capacity-building initiatives to facilitate talent development.\n\nMeanwhile, the HKMA has worked closely with the banking industry in optimising supervisory policies and processes. Good progress was made on implementing international supervisory standards locally, including those on capital adequacy and disclosure.  The HKMA continued to advance its work to ensure a credible resolution regime for authorized institutions, including developing new resolution standards and implementing rules on loss-absorbing capacity requirements to enhance authorized institutions’ resolvability.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system.  Achieving this objective is contingent upon a highly resilient financial system that is capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their businesses and, in extreme cases, by failing in a disorderly manner.  The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring that banks are resilient to shocks and able to recover their positions in crises, ultimately helping to prevent failures.  The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks and is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs).\n\nHowever, the Monetary Authority cannot ensure, nor is the Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework designed to ensure, a zero-risk financial system.  Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that, in the event of an AI becoming non-viable, its failure can be managed in an orderly manner.  To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong has been established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs, among other types of institutions.  To operationalise the resolution regime in Hong Kong, it is important to lay down resolution rules and policy standards, undertake resolution planning to remove impediments to AIs’ resolvability and develop the HKMA’s operational capability to resolve a failing AI.  In order to carry out these tasks effectively, the HKMA adopts an internationally harmonised and co-ordinated approach.\n\nThe Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs). In overseeing FMIs, the HKMA aims to promote their general safety and efficiency, limit systemic risk and foster transparency.  Making FMIs more resilient to financial crises protects the monetary and financial systems in Hong Kong from possible destabilising effects arising from disruption to the FMIs.  Information regarding the HKMA’s oversight approach is available on the HKMA website.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2021\n\n# Licensing\n\nAt the end of 2021, Hong Kong had:\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA granted two banking licences and one restricted bank licence to three non-local banks. The HKMA also granted a money broker approval to a foreign trading platform operator.  The authorizations of three licensed banks and two restricted licence banks were revoked during the year.\n\nMore information about the AIs and local representative offices in Hong Kong can be found in the Annex and Tables D to F on pages 321 to 324, and 330 to 333 respectively.\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nThe HKMA conducted 189 off-site reviews covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL rating assessment1, corporate governance, risk management and financial technology (fintech) strategies.  As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance, 40 meetings were held with the AIs’ boards of directors, independent non-executive directors or board-level committees.  A further 38 tripartite meetings were held among the HKMA, AIs and their external auditors.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA conducted regular on-site examinations supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk.  A total of 679 on-site examinations and thematic reviews were carried out during the year with credit risk management as a key focus. Amid growing adoption of technology by banks, management of operational risk and technology risk was another major area of attention.  The HKMA also increased the number of on-site examinations and thematic reviews targeting liquidity and market risk management.  In addition, specialist teams performed on-site examinations and thematic reviews of AIs’ activities in securities, investment products, insurance and mandatory provident fund (MPF)- related businesses, as well as their anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) controls. Table 1 contains a summary of the HKMA’s supervisory activities in 2021.\n\n# Credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nTotal loans increased by 3.8% in 2021, compared with a growth of 1.2% in 2020.  Table 2 shows the breakdown of growth in loans and advances.\n\nMainland-related lending increased by 3.6% to HK$4,725 billion in 2021 (Table 3).\n\nThe asset quality of the banking sector remained largely stable during the year and stayed at a healthy level by both historical and international standards.  The classified loan ratio of the industry was 0.88% at the end of 2021, down from 0.90% at the end of 2020, well below the long-run historical average of 1.8% since 2000.  The ratio for Mainland-related lending also decreased to 0.86% from 0.96% a year ago.\n\nDuring the year, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to weigh on some sectors of the economy, while credit events in the Mainland property sector caught the attention of the market.  The HKMA enhanced the breadth and depth of its surveillance, with deep-dive reviews focused on banks’ exposures to highly leveraged borrowers. Close communication with banks has been maintained to facilitate up-to-date assessment of the impact of economic and market developments as well as the adequacy of banks’ risk management measures.  The overall credit risk facing the banking sector is assessed to be manageable.  The latest results of the HKMA’s solvency stress tests confirm that the banking sector continues to maintain sufficient capital buffers to withstand extreme stress.\n\nTargeted and thematic examinations were conducted during the year to evaluate AIs’ systems and controls over loan classification and loan loss provisioning, overseas lending operations, and collateralised lending to private banking and wealth management customers.\n\n# Alleviating cash-flow pressure faced by customers\n\nIn September, the HKMA and the Banking Sector Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) Lending Coordination Mechanism announced a six-month extension of the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme until the end of April 2022.  This scheme was first launched in May 2020 to defer loan principal payments of eligible corporate customers by six months.  In light of a resurgence of local coronavirus infections, in February 2022, the scheme was further extended until the end of October 2022.  In addition, the scheme was enhanced to offer a one-year partial principal repayment option to those customers who are financially capable and willing to resume principal repayment gradually.\n\nBy the end of December 2021, banks had approved loan tenor extensions and other forms of relief in over 83,000 cases, involving an aggregate amount of over HK$920 billion. For personal customers, banks had approved more than 52,000 cases of principal payment holidays for residential mortgages and other personal relief loans, amounting to over HK$53 billion.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nThe successive rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures introduced by the HKMA since 2009 have strengthened banks’ risk management and the banking sector’s resilience to a possible abrupt downturn in the local property market.  The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of new residential mortgage loans (RMLs) approved in December 2021 was 53%, compared with 64% in September 2009 before the countercyclical measures were first introduced.  The average debt servicing ratio (DSR) of new mortgages remained low at 36% in December 2021, compared with 41% in August 2010, when a cap on DSR was first applied (Chart 1).\n\n# Operational and technology risks\n\nIn light of banks’ increasing reliance on technology to support their operations, the HKMA stepped up supervision of operational and technology risks.  Key supervisory focuses during the year included controls over cloud outsourcing and remote working arrangements.  The HKMA launched an industry consultation in December on a draft new Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module on “Operational Resilience”. The new SPM module seeks to provide guidance to banks on developing a holistic and integrated operational resilience framework.\n\nThe HKMA introduced the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 in January to reflect the latest sound practices on cyber security risk management.  During the year, the HKMA monitored AIs’ implementation of the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 and reviewed their cyber resilience capabilities.  In view of the growing risk of destructive cyber-attacks, in May, the HKMA requested all AIs to critically assess the need for a secure tertiary data backup, taking reference from the Secure Tertiary Data Backup Guideline issued by the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB).\n\nIn response to heightened risks and rising numbers of phishing attacks, the HKMA worked closely with the industry to strengthen the security of internet and mobile banking services.  A large-scale joint HKMA-HKAB public awareness campaign, themed “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!” began in July (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 Raising public awareness of phishing attacks\n\nSlogan icon for the public awareness campaign themed “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!”\n\n# Liquidity and market risks\n\nTo enhance monitoring of AIs’ liquidity risk exposures, the HKMA introduced additional scenarios into its liquidity stress testing framework to evaluate AIs’ ability to cope with liquidity shocks over a prolonged period.\n\nDuring the year, thematic reviews were conducted to assess the adequacy of AIs’ liquidity stress testing programmes and evaluate the sufficiency of their monitoring metrics and control limits for managing liquidity risk.  The HKMA also carried out reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of AIs’ market risk management frameworks for debt securities investments and operational controls over treasury activities.\n\nThe HKMA closely monitored AIs’ progress in preparing for the transition away from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR).  It collaborated with industry associations and developed tools to assist AIs in supporting their customers’ migration to alternative reference rates, including a leaflet to raise corporates’ awareness of the transition and an information note on options available in the loan markets to replace US dollar LIBOR.  AIs have substantially remediated contracts referencing LIBOR settings which ceased to be published after the end of 2021.  They were reminded not to enter into new LIBOR contracts from 1 January 2022 onwards.\n", "zh": "# 銀行體系穩健\n\n儘管新冠病毒變異株日益傳染，導致全球經濟復甦的不確定性，在2021年香港的銀行業仍保持穩健及穩定。在年度內，金管局（HKMA）持續專注於認可機構（AIs）的風險管理監管。面對網絡攻擊威脅升級和銀行行業數碼化加快，監管部門亦加強了對營運和網絡防衛能力的監管。\n\n在操守監管方面，金管局向銀行提供指引，以促進非面對面渠道在資產配置及銷售投資和保險產品中的應用，並與其他監管機構合作制定市場上新產品（如保險相連證券及虛擬資產）的監管要求。此外，銀行營運守則亦已修訂，以增強數碼金融服務的消費者保障。\n\n在打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集（AML/CFT）方面，金管局的重點是進一步強化銀行的「守門人」角色，提升其預防和偵測非法資金流動的能力，以應對疫情期間線上欺詐、傀儡戶口網絡及其他金融犯罪的增加。為保護客戶帳戶免受詐騙及金融犯罪侵害，金管局加強與業界及其他利益相關者的合作與資訊共享，推動公私合作夥伴關係。同時支持遠端開戶，並在2021年11月推出首個反洗錢合規科技實驗室（AML Regtech Lab），鼓勵採用網絡分析等科技。國際層面上，HKMA積極參與全球反洗錢與反恐融資工作，例如在金融行動特別組織（FATF）中保持領先地位。\n\n在發展方面，粵港澳大灣區的跨境財富管理通（Wealth Management Connect Pilot Scheme）於九月順利推行。金管局亦持續推動為期兩年的Regtech應用推廣路線圖。此外，為推動氣候風險管理及促進綠色及可持續銀行業，陸續推出多項措施，並強化軟體基礎建設，包括推動以客為本的企業文化，並協助銀行行業開展人才培育工作。\n\n同時，金管局與銀行業密切合作，優化監管政策和流程。多項國際監管標準已在本地落實，包括資本充足率和信息披露標準。金管局亦持續推進建立可信的認可機構處置制度，包括制定新處置標準及實施吸收虧損能力（LAC）規則，以提升認可機構的解決能力。"}
{"en": "# International Financial Centre\n\nDuring 2021, the HKMA achieved good progress in strengthening Hong Kong’s status as a globally competitive international financial centre through a multi-pronged approach.\n\nThe HKMA unveiled “Fintech 2025” strategy to promote the wide adoption of fintech by the financial sector and bolster Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub more broadly.  On the Faster Payment System, it has seen a surge in turnover during the year amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOn enhancing connectivity, significant progress was made during the year with the addition of the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect and Southbound Trading under Bond Connect to the suite of Connect schemes.  Thanks to its world-class market infrastructure and the Connect schemes, Hong Kong is the favoured platform for Mainland funds to tap into global markets and for international investors to access the fast-growing Mainland markets.\n\nAlso during 2021, the HKMA devoted significant efforts in creating new business opportunities to strengthen the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, in areas including bond issuance, asset and wealth management, corporate treasury centres, and green and sustainable finance.  To promote Hong Kong’s financial services, the HKMA stepped up market outreach to overseas and Mainland stakeholders to keep them informed about the resilience of Hong Kong’s financial system and the prospects it presents.\n\nMeanwhile, the HKMA is active in international and regional central banking and regulatory forums, contributing to global efforts in maintaining financial stability and promoting financial market developments.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nThe HKMA announced its “Fintech 2025” strategy, covering a series of initiatives to promote wide adoption of financial technology (fintech) and strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia.  The HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO), together with the banking departments, played a pivotal role in driving various key initiatives during the year including the following:\n\n- Promoting regulatory technology (Regtech) adoption\n- Rolling out the Tech Baseline Assessment to understand banks' adoption of fintech\n\nHong Kong’s position as an offshore renminbi hub remained firm, with offshore renminbi businesses registering robust growth during the year.  Inflows into renminbi assets continued to gather pace as the inclusion of onshore securities in major financial market indices continued. Hong Kong plays an indispensable role in facilitating international investors’ increased allocation to renminbi assets, with the Mainland–Hong Kong Connect schemes being widely accepted as the channels of choice for international investors to access onshore capital markets. In 2021, daily turnover under Northbound Bond Connect increased 34% to around RMB25.8 billion.\n\nFollowing the success of Northbound Bond Connect, Southbound Bond Connect was launched in September, completing the two-way connection between the Mainland and international bond markets.  In the same month, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), the HKMA and the Monetary Authority of Macao promulgated the implementation details for the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Crossboundary WMC) Scheme in the Guangdong–Hong Kong– Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA).  In October, eligible banks in Hong Kong started providing Cross-boundary WMC services together with their Mainland partner banks.\n\n\n\nTo enhance Hong Kong’s role as a key offshore renminbi centre, a working group comprising the HKMA, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) was formed to conduct a feasibility study on promoting trading of renminbi-denominated equity securities in Hong Kong.  A joint seminar was also co-organised by the PBoC and the HKMA in December, showcasing Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre and a leading renminbi business hub.\n\nThe HKMA continues to make progress towards strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform.  In particular, to increase Hong Kong’s appeal as a preferred fund domicile, the HKMA worked closely with the Government and the financial industry to provide a more facilitating tax and regulatory environment for fund formation.  Significant strides were also made in further elevating Hong Kong’s position as a regional green and sustainable finance hub, and as a bond issuance centre. At the same time, the HKMA stepped up market outreach to promote Hong Kong’s financial services to overseas and Mainland stakeholders.\n\nSafe and efficient operation of financial infrastructure is fundamental for reinforcing Hong Kong’s position as a leading international financial centre.  In 2021, the four interbank Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) and the Hong Kong Trade Repository achieved 100%1 system availability, outperforming the target of 99.95%.  Following the launch of Southbound Bond Connect in September, the CMU became the settlement and custodian service provider for transactions conducted under both Northbound and Southbound Bond Connect.\n\nAdoption of the FPS continued to expand in 2021. The number of registrations grew to 9.6 million at the end of 2021 and the average daily turnover for the year rose by 90% from 2020.  Increased use of the FPS for settling Government bills, making merchant payments and topping up stored value facility (SVF) e-wallets or bank accounts were the key drivers for the continued rise in transaction volume, on top of a steady growth in person-to-person and business payments.\n\nTo promote the safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA oversees six designated retail payment systems (RPSs) and supervises 15 licensed SVFs under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO).  During the year, the HKMA facilitated the smooth implementation of the Government’s Consumption Voucher Scheme by co-ordinating and promoting dialogues and co-operation between the relevant Government parties and the SVF licensees appointed for the scheme.\n\nIn January 2022, the HKMA issued a discussion paper on crypto-assets and stablecoins, setting out the HKMA’s thinking on the relevant regulatory approach and inviting views from stakeholders.  Relevant factors, including feedback to this discussion paper and recommendations of relevant international bodies, will be taken into account when drawing up the appropriate regulatory regime.\n\nInternationally, the HKMA is an active member of the central banking community and plays a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees.  For example, the HKMA chairs the Working Group on Financial Markets (WGFM) established under the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP)2.  The HKMA also co-chairs the Policy and Standards Group of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), the Non-Bank Monitoring Experts Group and the Financial Innovation Network of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), and leads a team that looks into supervisory issues associated with financial benchmark transition.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2021\n\n# Hong Kong as a fintech hub in Asia\n\n# Fintech 2025\n\nIn June, the HKMA unveiled its “Fintech 2025” strategy to drive fintech development in Hong Kong.  The strategy aims to encourage the financial sector to adopt technology comprehensively by 2025, as well as to promote the provision of fair and efficient financial services for the benefit of Hong Kong citizens and the economy.  The five focus areas of the strategy are:\n\n- All banks go fintech\n- Future-proofing Hong Kong for CBDCs\n- Creating the next-generation data infrastructure\n- Expanding the fintech-savvy workforce\n- Nurturing the ecosystem with funding and policies\n\nThe HKMA’s “Fintech 2025” strategy drives fintech development in Hong Kong\n\n# Fintech Adoption in the Banking Sector\n\nTo support the “All banks go fintech” initiative of the “Fintech 2025” strategy, the HKMA rolled out the Tech Baseline Assessment in June 2021.  The assessment aims to help the HKMA develop a better understanding of the current fintech landscape in the banking sector, and identify which fintech areas may warrant the HKMA’s support.  All licensed banks with significant operations in Hong Kong were requested to develop a three-year plan for fintech adoption by the end of 2021.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA also continued to implement its two-year roadmap to promote Regtech adoption by banks in Hong Kong, and incorporate technology in its own supervisory processes to improve efficiency and effectiveness.  See page 98 of the Banking Stability chapter for more details.\n\n# Wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency\n\nThe HKMA and the Bank of Thailand expanded the scope of their joint research project with the joining of the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates and the Digital Currency Institute of the PBoC in February 2021.  Renamed as “Multiple Central Bank Digital Currency Bridge (mBridge)” and strongly supported by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Innovation Hub Centre in Hong Kong, the project further explores the capabilities of distributed ledger technology to facilitate real-time cross-border foreign exchange payment-versus-payment (PvP) transactions in a multi-jurisdictional context and on a 24/7 basis.  A joint report was published in September to deliver the interim findings, followed by the publication of potential use cases and a future roadmap in November.\n\n# Retail Central Bank Digital Currency\n\nTo future-proof Hong Kong in terms of CBDC readiness, the HKMA started a study on the prospect of issuing retail CBDC in Hong Kong, i.e. e-HKD, covering both technical and policy considerations.  In collaboration with the BIS Innovation Hub Centre in Hong Kong, the HKMA embarked on a study called Project Aurum to explore the technical aspect of issuing retail CBDC.  Separately, an internal cross-departmental working group was set up to study the relevant technical, policy and legal issues.  In October, the HKMA released a technical white paper titled e-HKD: A technical perspective to explore and invite comments on potential technical design options for issuing and distributing retail CBDC.\n\nFurthermore, the HKMA supports the Digital Currency Institute of the PBoC on the technical pilot testing of using e-CNY for cross-boundary payments.  This will help promote interconnection in the GBA and bring greater convenience to Hong Kong and Mainland tourists by enhancing the efficiency and user experience of cross-boundary payments.\n\n# Commercial Data Interchange\n\nIn July, the HKMA hosted a virtual symposium to encourage banks and SVF operators to join the CDI, a next-generation financial data infrastructure that aims to enable more efficient financial intermediation in the banking system.  To further facilitate development and adoption, the launch of the CDI Innovation Hub was announced during the symposium. To facilitate small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) financing, the HKMA completed two phases of proof-of-concept study examining the technical feasibility of the CDI.  Applying alternative data to facilitate credit assessment and the underwriting of loans, more than 550 SME loans exceeding HK$900 million in total were approved by the participating banks during the study.  Based on the encouraging results, the HKMA announced the pilot launch of the CDI in November.\n\nSME owners commend the CDI for streamlining their loan applications\n\n# Talent development\n\nTo expand the fintech talent pool, the HKMA continued to run the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme 2.0 in collaboration with its strategic partners3 to nurture young talent at various stages of their career development. More than 180 students benefitted from the scheme in 2021. Separately, the Industry Project Masters Network scheme was piloted in September to provide opportunities for master’s degree students majoring in fintech to work on real-life fintech projects.  To form strategic partnerships and foster collaboration in areas including fintech talent development, the HKMA entered into memorandums of understanding (MoUs) with four local universities in October.\n\nMr Colin Pou (middle), Executive Director (Financial Infrastructure) of HKMA, at the MoU signing ceremony with four local universities\n\n# Fintech Supervisory Sandbox\n\nThe use of Fintech Supervisory Sandbox (FSS) continued to rise during the year.  As of end-December 2021, a total of 234 pilot trials of fintech initiatives had been allowed in the FSS since its launch in 2016, compared with 193 as of end-2020.  As of end-December 2021, the HKMA had also received in total 666 requests to access the FSS Chatroom for supervisory feedback at the early stage of fintech projects since the introduction of the Chatroom in 2017.

{"en": "# Reserves Management\n\nThe global financial markets embarked on a recovery path in 2021.  Although the global economy continued to be affected by the evolving COVID-19 pandemic situation, a number of factors, including an increasing vaccination rate as well as accommodative monetary policies and fiscal measures around the world, have contributed to notable recovery in the global economy and financial markets.  Against this background, a number of overseas equity markets achieved record highs during the year, and the Exchange Fund’s overall equity holdings were able to achieve a decent return despite the sluggish performance in Hong Kong equities. During 2021, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$191.9 billion, representing an investment return of 4.1%.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong.  The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre.  The HKMA, under the delegated authority of the Financial Secretary and within the terms of the delegation, is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(i) to preserve capital;\n(ii) to ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(iii) to ensure that sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(iv) subject to (i)–(iii), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Exchange Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 Portfolio Segregation of the Exchange Fund\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP).  The BP holds highly liquid US dollardenominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The IP invests primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member economies of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of its assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA diversifies part of the Exchange Fund’s investments in a prudent and incremental manner into a wider variety of asset classes.  This includes emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate.  Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP).  The HKMA has put in place a cap1 to guide the pace of diversification into the LTGP since its inception.  As the LTGP has become increasingly mature in investment scale and asset diversity, the EFAC decided in January 2022 to replace the cap by a target asset allocation that is determined concurrently with that of other asset classes, subject to prudent risk management principles.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007, holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that have been acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes.  The Strategic Portfolio is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of its unique nature.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by Fiscal Reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP2, with the major exception of the Future Fund3, which links its interest rate to the return of both the IP and the LTGP in accordance with the portfolio mix.  The portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 40:60 in 2021.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation.  The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents long-term asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund.  Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark.  This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark (or strategic) allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”.  While the benchmark and tracking error4 limit are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with the EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority.  Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may assume positions to take advantage of short-term market movements (Figure 2).\n\nFigure 2 Asset allocation of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nThe HKMA’s Exchange Fund Investment Office houses its investment and related risk management functions. Exchange Fund Investment Office staff members directly manage about 71% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, comprising the entire BP and part of the IP.  This part of the IP includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 29% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes.  The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to realise sustainable returns, draw on diverse and complementary investment styles, and gain market insights and technical expertise in investment.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes.  The expenditure is determined primarily by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe growing complexity of the investment environment underlines the importance of risk management.  The HKMA sets stringent controls and investment guidelines for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and ensures a proper risk monitoring and compliance system is in place. Three lines of defence are in place to implement effective risk management and governance of investment-related activities.  Key risk categories (including credit, market, liquidity and operational risks) are regularly monitored, and the risk management process provides a robust framework to support strategic planning and investment diversification.\n\n# RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT\n\nThe HKMA believes that, by putting an appropriate emphasis on responsible investment and sustainable long-term economic performance, it can better achieve the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund and reduce risks associated with environmental, social and governance (ESG)- related matters of its underlying investments.  The HKMA supports responsible investment by integrating ESG factors into the investment processes for both public and private market investments of the Exchange Fund, underpinned by the guiding principle that priority will generally be given to ESG investments if the long-term risk-adjusted return is comparable with other investments.  For more details about the HKMA’s responsible investment framework and implementation, see the Sustainability chapter on pages 184 to 191.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2021\n\nGlobal equity markets rose sharply and hit new record highs on the back of ultra-loose monetary policies and fiscal measures, driving an accelerated recovery of the global economy and financial markets.  However, Hong Kong and Mainland equity markets underperformed amid market reforms.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index in the US rose by 27%, while the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong dropped by 14%.\n\nFor the bond markets, rising inflation expectations and tapering of asset purchases by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) led to a rise in US Treasury yields and falling bond prices during 2021.  Ten-year US Treasury yields increased by about 60 basis points from 0.9% at the beginning of the year to 1.5% at the end of the year.\n\nIn the currency markets, the US dollar strengthened against other major currencies, particularly towards the end of 2021, on the back of expectations about the Fed’s tapering pace. In particular, the euro and the yen depreciated by 7.1% and 10.3% against the US dollar respectively.\n\nThe performance of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2021 is shown in Table 1.\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$191.9 billion in 2021.  This comprised gains on bonds of HK$12.6 billion, net gains on equities of HK$47.8 billion (with gains of HK$68.8 billion from foreign equities, and losses of HK$21.0 billion from Hong Kong equities), a positive currency translation effect of HK$16.8 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets and gains of HK$114.7 billion on other investments held by the investment-holding subsidiaries of the Fund. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$3.1 billion.\n\nTotal assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,570.2 billion at the end of the year.  The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$515.3 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$392.5 billion and real estate HK$122.8 billion.  Outstanding investment commitments of the LTGP amounted to HK$225.7 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund in 2021, excluding the Strategic Portfolio, was 4.1%.  Specifically, the IP achieved a rate of return of 3.7%, while the BP gained 0.4%.  The LTGP has recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 15.4% since its inception in 2009.\n\nThe annual returns of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2021 are set out in Chart 1.  Table 2 shows the 2021 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over several different time horizons.  The average return was 5.3% during 2019–2021, 4.7% during 2017–2021, 3.3% during 2012–2021 and 4.8% since 1994.  Table 3 shows the currency mix of the Fund’s assets on 31 December 2021.\n\nSee pages 211 to 319 for the audited 2021 financial statements of the Exchange Fund.\n", "zh": "儲備管理\n\n2021年，環球金融市場走上復甦之路。儘管全球經濟持續受到不斷演變的COVID-19疫情影響，但多個因素，包括疫苗接種率的提升以及全球範圍內的寬鬆貨幣政策和財政措施，促成了全球經濟和金融市場的顯著復甦。基於此背景，多個海外股市在年內創下新高，外匯基金的整體股票持倉亦能取得不錯的回報，儘管香港股市表現略顯疲弱。在2021年，外匯基金錄得投資收入1919億港元，投資回報率為4.1%。\n\n外匯基金\n\n according to the《外匯基金條例》，外匯基金的主要目標是影響本港貨幣的匯價，直接或間接。基金亦可用於維持本港的貨幣與金融體系的穩定與完整，以幫助本港保持作為國際金融中心的地位。在金融管理局（HKMA）獲得財經司司長的授權委派下，負責外匯基金的運用與投資管理。\n\n外匯基金的管理\n\n投資目標與組合架構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）已訂定以下投資目標：\n(i) 保持資本\n(ii) 確保貨幣基礎部分始終由高度流動的美元計價資產全額支持\n(iii) 確保有足夠流動性，以維持貨幣及金融穩定\n(iv) 在（i）至（iii）基礎上，實現有助於長期保持外匯基金購買力的投資回報\n\n上述目標全面考慮外匯基金的法定目的，並融入基金的組合結構及目標資產配置（圖1）。\n\n圖1 外匯基金的資產組合劃分\n\n概括而言，外匯基金有兩個主要組合：支持組合（BP）與投資組合（IP）。BP持有高度流動的美元計價資產，以在貨幣局制度下為貨幣基礎提供全額保障。而IP則主要投資於經合組織（OECD）會員經濟體的債券和股票市場，以保值及長期保持資產的購買力。\n\n為更有效管理風險並提升中長期回報，HKMA善用謹慎及逐步的方式，將部分外匯基金投資多元化，涵蓋新興市場及內地的債券與股市、私募股權（包括基建項目）及房地產。新興市場及內地債券股市由IP持有，而私募股權與房地產投資則由長期增長組合（LTGP）持有。自成立以來，HKMA設有上限以規範進入LTGP的投資步伐。隨著LTGP的投資規模與資產多元化日益成熟，EFAC於2022年1月決定由上限改為一致性制定的目標資產配置，並根據謹慎的風險管理原則進行調整。\n\n2007年成立的策略性投資組合，持有由政府出資買入，作為策略用途的香港交易及結算所有限公司股份。由於其特殊性，該組合不列入基金的投資績效評估。\n\n與外匯基金的存款\n\n外匯基金不時收取財政儲備、政府基金及法定機構的存款。利率普遍與IP的表現掛鈎，除未來基金外，該基金的利率與IP及LTGP的投資回報掛鈎。2021年，未來基金在IP與LTGP之間的投資組合約為40：60。\n\n投資流程\n\n外匯基金的投資流程由兩種資產配置決策支撐：策略性資產配置與戰術性資產配置。策略性資產配置反映長期的投資基準，表示根據基金的投資目標制定的長期資產配置。根據策略性配置，資產會進行戰術性配置，以期超越基準獲得額外回報。這通常導致實際配置與基準配置（或策略配置）有所差異，稱為“戰術偏離”。在財經司司長與EFAC協商後，基準及追蹤誤差範圍由HKMA根據授權進行決定。HKMA在允許的偏離範圍內，進行短期市場波動的操作，追蹤偏差則於此範圍內進行調整（圖2）。\n\n圖2 外匯基金的資產配置\n\n投資管理\n\n直接投資\n\nHKMA的外匯基金投資辦公室負責管理投資及相關風險管理功能。投資辦公室的員工直接管理約71%的資產，包括整個支持組合（BP）和部分投資組合（IP），該部分IP包括投資於全球固定收益市場及多種衍生工具Overlay組合，以實施宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n使用外部經理\n\n除內部管理外，HKMA亦聘用外部基金經理管理約29%的外匯基金資產，包括所有上市股權及其他專門資產類別。聘用外部經理的目的是汲取市場上最優秀的投資專才，實現可持續回報，採用多元且互補的投資風格，並獲取市場洞見及技術專業知識。\n\n涉及外聘經理的支出包括基金管理費、託管費、交易成本及預扣稅等，主要由市場因素決定，可能每年波動。\n\n風險管理與合規\n\n日益複雜的投資環境強調風險管理的重要性。HKMA制定嚴格的控制措施與投資指引，確保內部及外聘投資組合均落實有效的風險監控及合規系統。實行三重防線，監控關鍵風險類別（包括信用、市場、流動性及操作風險），並建立堅實的風險管理框架，以支援策略規劃與投資多元化。\n\n負責任投資\n\nHKMA認為，專注於負責任投資及可持續長遠經濟表現，能更好地實現外匯基金的投資目標，並降低與其基礎投資的環境、社會及管治（ESG）相關的風險。HKMA支持將ESG因素融入公私營市場投資流程，並堅持若長期風險調整後回報相若，則優先配置ESG投資，詳情見第184至191頁的可持續發展章節。\n\n外匯基金績效\n\n2021年金融市場情況\n\n由於超寬鬆貨幣政策與財政措施，全球股票市場大幅上升並創新高，推動全球經濟及金融市場快速復甦。然而，市場改革下，香港及內地股市表現較為疲弱。美國標準普爾500指數升27%，而恒生指數則下跌14%。\n\n債券市場方面，通脹預期上升及美聯儲縮減資產購買規模，推動美國國債收益率上升，債券價格下跌。10年期美國國債收益率由年初的0.9%升至年末的1.5%，約升價60個基點。\n\n貨幣市場方面，美元兌其他主要貨幣升值，特別接近年尾，源自市場預期美聯儲逐步縮減量化寬鬆措施。歐元與日圓對美元則分別貶值7.1%與10.3%。\n\n表1列出2021年主要貨幣、債券及股市的表現。\n\n外匯基金的表現\n\n2021年，外匯基金錄得投資收入1919億港元，包括債券收益126億港元，股票淨收益478億港元（其中外國股票收益688億港元，港股虧損210億港元），非港幣資產的貨幣換算正面匯率效應168億港元，以及基金投資控股公司的其餘投資的收益1147億港元。另行，策略性投資組合錄得估值盈利31億港元。\n\n年末，外匯基金總資產達4570億港元，LTGP投資的市值總額為5153億港元，其中私募股權為3925億港元，房地產為1228億港元。LTGP尚未使用的投資承諾為2257億港元。\n\n2021年外匯基金不包括策略性投資組合的投資回報率為4.1%。具體而言，投資組合取得3.7%的回報率，支持組合則獲得0.4%。自2009年成立以來，LTGP的年化內部收益率達15.4%。\n\n圖1展示1994年至2021年的年度投資回報。表2列出2021年的投資回報率及多個不同時段的平均投資回報。2019–2021年平均回報5.3%，2017–2021年為4.7%，2012–2021年為3.3%，自1994年以來平均回報為4.8%。表3顯示2021年12月31日基金的貨幣組合。\n\n詳見第211至319頁的2021年度審計財務報表。"}

It also maintains the register of AIs and local representative offices, as well as the register of securities staff of AIs, for public access as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nTo safeguard public health and safety during the COVID-19 pandemic, special operational arrangements were put in place at the Information Centre.  Cleansing and disinfection were stepped up, and facilities and exhibits were sanitised regularly with anti-microbial coating.\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre’s exhibition area comprises the Policy Section, the Currency Section and the Historical Timeline\n\n# Community engagement and public education\n\nTo reach out to the community and raise public awareness of the HKMA’s work, a public education programme has been running since 1998.  In 2021, a webinar was organised for over 2,300 students and teachers from 84 secondary schools.  The webinar covered an overview of the HKMA’s work, the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, protection of personal digital keys, the Deposit Protection Scheme and career opportunities in the banking industry.  To date, more than 63,000 people have participated in the public education programme.\n\nThe HKMA educates and engages the public on how to be smart and responsible financial consumers.  In view of the increase in phishing scams, the HKMA conducted a public awareness campaign themed “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!” with cross-media promotion to urge the public to stay vigilant against fraudulent hyperlinks embedded in SMS messages and emails purportedly from banks.\n\nCross-media promotion reminding the public to beware of fraudulent hyperlinks\n\nThe HKMA also seeks to enhance the public’s understanding of the financial industry and raise the young generation’s interest in pursuing a career in the industry.  Following positive feedback to the online drama series “STEPS” in 2020, the HKMA launched a new series titled “Four Faces of Talents in Central” featuring four growing areas of the financial industry: data science, fintech, green and sustainable finance, and wealth management.  In the video series, the characters of the market practitioners were portrayed in a humorous manner, and seasoned industry players and young talents shared first-hand information on the nature and requirements of jobs, career opportunities and prospects across the above four growing areas.\n\n“Four Faces of Talents in Central” series keeps the young generation abreast of career opportunities in the financial market\n\nThe “Online Parenting and Educational Campaign” launched in 2020 was recognised with a Silver Award in the “Best Event — Corporate Social Responsibility” category of the MarketingInteractive’s Marketing Events Awards 2021.  Building on the campaign’s success and to sustain momentum, the HKMA rolled out additional initiatives, including a parenting financial education workshop where child education experts shared tips on how to teach kids good money sense and demonstrated a DIY (do-it-yourself) financial educational toy, as well as an animated virtual tour of the HKMA Information Centre.\n\nThe “Online Parenting and Educational Campaign” wins an award at the Marketing Events Awards 2021.  The campaign promotes money management concept and skills to let parents and kids learn in an amusing and entertaining way.\n\nTo enhance financial literacy among secondary school students, the HKMA and various stakeholders co-organised the “Hong Kong Financial Literacy Championship”, which featured a fintech theme.  Apart from an online quiz, a new financial design thinking workshop on personal financial management was added to train the participating students to develop innovative proposals on money management tools.  This initiative won the “Highest Student Participation Award” offered by the Business-School Partnership Programme under the Education Bureau, and the “Investor and Financial Education Award (Corporate) — Gold Award” offered by the Investor and Financial Education Council2 (IFEC).\n\nThe “Hong Kong Financial Literacy Championship” educates students on fintech and design thinking concepts and achieves record-high participation\n\nOther community engagement initiatives included talks or webinars for students and retirees.  The HKMA also participated in a teacher training webinar on economic security organised by the Education Bureau.  Online educational materials offering smart tips on using automated teller machines (ATMs) are available in eight languages3 to cater for people of different backgrounds living in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA supports the IFEC in promoting financial literacy and capacity in Hong Kong, and will explore further collaboration with stakeholders to maximise the impact of community engagement.\n\n# Financial disclosure\n\nTo maintain a high level of transparency, the HKMA adopts international standards in financial disclosure insofar as these are applicable to central banking operations.  These include the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and other applicable reporting requirements, for example, the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard.  The Finance Division works with external auditors and other accounting professionals to prepare and present the Exchange Fund’s financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards.  The HKMA also provides detailed disclosures and thorough analyses of a wide range of expense items and budgetary information in its Annual Report.\n\n# ACCOUNTABILITY AND CONTROLS\n\n# Risk management\n\nOne of the HKMA’s most important tasks is to manage risks to the monetary and banking systems.  Risk management is undertaken both at a working level in the day-to-day operations and at a higher level through strategic planning. Under the HKMA’s risk management framework, there are two high-level committees — the Macro Surveillance Committee and the Risk Committee — both of which are chaired by the Chief Executive of the HKMA.\n\nThe terms of reference of the Macro Surveillance Committee are:\n\n- to identify potential risks and threats to the monetary and financial system in Hong Kong and discuss possible measures to address such risks;\n- to review existing measures for managing risks in the monetary and financial system to identify possible gaps and ensure the adequacy of these measures; and\n- to encourage cross-departmental sharing of relevant information on macro surveillance with a view to enhancing the macro surveillance capability of the HKMA.\n\nThe terms of reference of the Risk Committee are:\n\n- to identify potential risks and threats to the organisation and devise strategies to reduce the impact of such events;\n- to review the existing system for managing risks across different departments to identify possible gaps and significant risks and ensure the adequacy of measures to address them;\n- to harmonise the criteria and methods of risk measurement and prioritise the resources management of risks identified; and\n- to encourage a stronger risk management culture institutionally which promotes the proper levels of authorisation and controls.\n\nA robust operational risk management framework is in place covering organisational risks at two levels: the entity level and the department level.  Entity-level risks refer mainly to those which concern the entire organisation in the medium term, or which might call for a cross-departmental response. Potential and emerging risks identified by business units, and the adequacy of the control measures and mitigating strategies they devise, are reviewed and reported every quarter.  This is supplemented by a top-down approach to manage entity-level risks, in which senior colleagues heading different business units actively identify risks of wider impact and propose mitigating measures.  The Risk Committee discusses these assessments and decides on appropriate follow-up actions.\n", "zh": "# 機構職能\n\n機構職能以高度透明、負責任、高效和專業的標準支持金管局的運作。為促進公眾理解其政策及運作，金管局透過傳統媒體、社交媒體、其網站、資訊中心及其他渠道，與社會及市場保持有效溝通。在機構內，金管局秉持敏捷和可持續發展的人才策略，推行嚴格的財務紀律，並升級資訊科技能力，以因應變化，確保政策和措施的有效落實。\n\n# 透明度\n\n# 媒體關係及社交媒體\n\n金管局與媒體密切合作，以提升透明度並加強公眾對其政策及運作的理解。2021年，金管局舉行或參與了169個實體與虛擬活動，包括8場新聞發布會、8場現場訪談及153場其他公開活動。另外，安排了27次媒體訪問。全年發布了共632份雙語新聞稿，以及每日處理大量媒體查詢。\n\n為提升公眾對金管局主要職能的認識，亦舉辦專為本地、大陸及海外媒體的新聞發布會和簡報會，內容涵蓋連接scheme、金融科技（fintech）及利率基準改革等主題。\n\n為及時與公眾互動，金管局經營五個社交媒體渠道（Facebook、Instagram、LinkedIn、Twitter及YouTube），粉絲人數逾80,000。透過社交媒體，金管局升高公眾對各項話題的認知，特別是疫情期間大幅增加的網絡釣魚騙案。此外，亦透過社交媒體推行促銷活動，宣傳綠色金融、金融科技及連接schemes，以追蹤最新發展趨勢。\n\n余偉文，香港金融管理局行政總裁，於2021年香港金融科技週主持一場虛擬專題討論\n\n李豪威，香港金融管理局副行政總裁，主持“金融科技2025”策略媒體簡報會\n\n阮財福，香港金融管理局副行政總裁，主持有關香港銀行業為倫敦銀行間拆息過渡做準備的媒體簡報\n\n劉志豪，香港金融管理局副行政總裁，接受國際新聞台訪問\n\n# 公眾查詢\n\n公眾查詢服務提供一個有效途徑，讓市民更好了解香港金融管理局的關鍵職能和運作。2021年，接受了9,781宗查詢，約一半與銀行政策、規例、消費者銀行事務、紙鈔及金融基建及債券市場發展有關。其中較為重要的查詢包括硬幣收集計劃、銀行產品與服務、銀行相關指引及通告，以及零售債券發行計劃。\n\n圖表1顯示自2018年以來收集的公眾查詢數量，圖表2則細分2021年的查詢性質。\n\n圖表1 公眾查詢總數\n\n圖表2 2021年查詢性質分佈\n\n# 出版刊物\n\n除了香港金融管理局年報外，局方於2021年亦出版了兩期半年度貨幣及金融穩定報告及四期季報，並定期更新《金融數據月報》，提供最新且具有專題性的貨幣、銀行及經濟資訊與分析。此外，香港金融管理局共發表11篇匯思文章，介紹其主要新措施與政策，以及討論熱門話題。\n\n2020年香港金融管理局年報獲得“非牟利和慈善機構”類別銀獎，並在香港管理專業協會2021最佳年報評選中獲得環境、社會及管治報告卓越獎。\n\n# 機構網站\n\n網站（www.hkma.gov.hk）提供超過44,000頁內容，包括英語、繁體及簡體中文，是公眾獲取最新資訊的主要入口。網站內有認可機構（AIs）及本地代表辦事處名冊，亦有根據《銀行業條例》第20條維護的認可機構證券人名冊，以及根據支付系統及儲值支付工具條例管理的儲值支付工具持牌人名冊。\n\n自2018年以來，金管局逐步透過開放應用程式介面（API）於網站公開金融數據及重要資訊，截至2021年底，局方已開放148套API，符合預定時間表。\n\n# 資訊中心\n\n香港金融管理局資訊中心，設於國際金融中心二期第55樓，是一個重要設施，介紹香港金融管理局的工作，並推廣市民對貨幣和銀行事務的認識。中心設有展覽區及圖書館。展覽區以互動方式呈現香港金融管理局的工作及貨幣與銀行發展歷程，並展示有關香港貨幣、銀行及金融事務的資料和展品。圖書館毗鄰展覽區，收藏超過26,000冊書籍、期刊及其他刊物，範圍涵蓋香港貨幣、銀行、金融事務及中央銀行議題。圖書館亦維持認可機構及本地代表辦事處名冊，以及符合《銀行業條例》第20條規定的認可機構證券人名冊，供公眾查閱。\n\n為保障公共安全，資訊中心在新冠病毒疫情期間，實行特別運作安排，增強清潔與消毒，並定期用抗菌塗層消毒設施和展品。\n\n資訊中心展覽區包括政策展區、貨幣展區及「歷史長廊」\n\n# 社區參與及公眾教育\n\n為拓展社區聯繫，提升市民對香港金融管理局工作的認知，自1998年起推出公眾教育計劃。2021年，局方舉辦了一場超過2,300名中學生與教師參與的網上研討會，內容涵蓋局內工作概述、聯繫匯率制度、香港紙幣、個人數碼鑰匙保障、存款保障計劃以及金融行業的就業機會。至今，已有超過63,000人參與此項公眾教育計劃。\n\n香港金融管理局致力教育和引導市民成為聰明負責的理財消費者。為應對大量網絡釣魚騙案，局方發起「守護你的個人數碼鑰匙，警惕欺詐網絡連結！」的宣傳活動，並多媒體推廣，提醒公眾警惕電子短信和電郵中的虛假超連結。\n\n多媒體推廣提醒市民警惕虛假超連結\n\n局方亦積極推動公眾對金融行業的了解，以及激發年輕一代對金融事業的興趣。繼2020年“STEPS”網上劇集獲得良好反響後，局方推出新系列“中環4型人才”，展示金融行業的四大發展領域：數據科學、金融科技、綠色及可持續金融、財富管理。在視頻系列中，行業專業人士的角色以幽默方式呈現，並分享工作內容、職業前景及需求。\n\n“中環4型人才”系列幫助年輕人掌握金融行業的職業機會\n\n2020年啟動的“網上親子理財教育活動”在2021年MarketiingInteractive「最佳活動 — 企業社會責任」中獲銀獎。為延續活動動力，局方推出更多措施，包括親子理財工作坊，專家分享教子理財技巧，並展示自己動手製作的理財教育玩具，以及一段虛擬之旅。\n\n“網上親子理財教育活動”於2021年獲獎，推廣理財觀念與技能，以趣味方式增進親子財經素養。\n\n為提升中學生的金融素養，局方與相關持份者合辦“香港金融素養錦標賽”，並以金融科技主題進行。除了線上測驗，亦新增個人金融管理設計思維工作坊，訓練學生提出創新管理工具方案。此活動獲教育局“商校合作計劃”最高學生參與獎，以及投資者及理財教育委員會（IFEC）“投資者及理財教育獎（企業）— 金獎”。\n\n“香港金融素養錦標賽”提高學生對金融科技與設計思維的認知，參與人數創新高\n\n其他社區參與活動還包括為學生及退休人士舉辦演講或網上研討會。局方亦參與由教育局舉辦的經濟安全校本培訓研討會。此外，提供用八種語言的智能理財微課資料，方便不同背景人士了解銀行自動櫃員機（ATM）使用技巧。\n\n香港金融管理局支持投資者及理財教育委員會，推動香港金融素養和能力，將來亦會與持份者探索更多合作，以擴大社區參與影響力。\n\n# 財務披露\n\n為維持高度透明，香港金融管理局在財務披露方面採用國際標準，並符合適用於中央銀行運作的相關規定，包括香港財務報告準則及國際貨幣基金組織的特殊數據公布標準等。財務處與外部核數師及其他會計專業人員合作，按照香港財務報告準則編製及呈列外匯基金財務報告。年報亦提供詳細披露及深入分析各項開支及預算資料。\n\n# 責任與內部控制\n\n# 風險管理\n\n香港金融管理局最重要的任務之一是管理貨幣及銀行體系風險。風險管理在日常營運層面由相關單位實務執行，又在高層通過策略規劃進行監控。在其風險管理框架下，設有兩個高層委員會——宏觀監察委員會及風險委員會，均由香港金融管理局行政總裁主持。\n\n宏觀監察委員會職責範圍包括：\n- 識別香港貨幣及金融系統潛在的風險與威脅，並討論應對措施；\n- 檢討現有風險管理措施，找出漏洞並確保措施充分；\n- 鼓勵跨部門資訊共享，提升宏觀監察能力。\n\n風險委員會職責範圍包括：\n- 識別組織的潛在風險與威脅，制定減緩策略；\n- 檢討跨部門風險管理系統，找出重大風險和不足並確保措施得當；\n- 統一衡量和評估風險的標準與方法，合理配置資源；\n- 鼓勵建設風險管理文化，保障權限與控制措施得當。\n\n機構層面的運營風險管理架構也已建立，涵蓋組織層面與部門層面。組織層面風險主要涉及中長期關乎整個機構的風險或需要跨部門應對的威脅。業務單位識別的潛在及新興風險及其控制策略，每季度定期檢討並匯報。此外，採用自上而下的方法，由高層管理不同業務單位的負責人主動識別具有較大影響的風險並提出緩解措施。風險委員會會討論這些評估結果，並決定適當的後續行動。"}
{"en": "# Sustainability\n\nThe HKMA is publishing its first sustainability report, as an integral part of its Annual Report 2021, to set out its strategy on sustainability and document its own efforts, as well as its joint efforts with the financial industry, to support the Government’s climate strategies and contribute to a more climate resilient and sustainable world.\n\nThe HKMA embeds sustainability considerations across its main roles and functions, whether as a banking supervisor, a market facilitator, a responsible investor, or in maintaining financial and monetary stability.  Moreover, the HKMA collaborates with local and overseas counterparts in strengthening the management and disclosures of climate risks, as well as the development of the green and sustainable finance market.\n\nIn addition, the HKMA is committed to fulfilling its corporate social responsibility, and aims to be a responsible and sustainable organisation. This commitment is manifested in various areas, including promoting a sustainable, financially inclusive and environmentally friendly marketplace, supporting the wider community, protecting the environment and nurturing a caring workplace.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nClimate change is one of the most pressing challenges facing the world today.  To combat climate change, countries agreed, under the Paris Agreement1, to take actions to cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and eventually achieve carbon neutrality within this century.  Meeting the Paris Agreement climate change target will require investments of an estimated US$1–2 trillion a year globally2, making sustainability one of the biggest drivers of capital flows in the decades ahead.\n\nHong Kong is determined to be at the forefront of this transition.  The Government announced that it will strive to achieve carbon neutrality before 2050, in line with developed economies globally.  Hong Kong is also the first Asian jurisdiction that has committed to specifically aligning disclosure requirements with recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) by 2025 across relevant sectors.\n\nTo the financial sector, climate change is both a source of risk and opportunity.  While the financial sector cannot be spared from the threats posed by climate change, it has a key role to play in the transition by channelling more financing to activities that are consistent with a pathway towards lower GHG emissions and climate-resilient developments.\n\nThe HKMA is committed to strengthening Hong Kong’s financial system to support a greener and more sustainable future, driving actions to support the Government’s climate goal and contributing to the global agenda.  In doing so, the HKMA incorporates sustainability considerations in carrying out its main functions and in running its operations.\n\nFirst, as a banking supervisor, the HKMA aims to strengthen resilience of the banking system against climate risks and to accelerate banks’ efforts in supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy.  To accomplish this, the HKMA has formulated a regulatory framework setting out supervisory requirements for banks to manage and disclose climate risks.  A pilot exercise on climate risk stress test to assess the resilience of the banking sector was also concluded successfully in 2021.  Meanwhile, on an ongoing basis, the HKMA takes into account climate change in monitoring financial stability risks.\n\nSecondly, in its market development role, the HKMA is focusing its efforts in enhancing Hong Kong’s role as a green and sustainable finance hub in the region, including the Greater Bay Area (GBA).  Hong Kong, being Mainland’s offshore financial centre, is well-positioned to channel global investments into Mainland’s plans to achieve peak carbon emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060.  The HKMA is also working through the Green and Sustainable Finance Cross-Agency Steering Group (CASG)3, which the HKMA co-chairs, to build industry capacity, address data gaps and explore the development of a local green classification framework.\n\nIn fact, Hong Kong is a leader in green finance solutions, having established the world’s first government Global Medium Term Note Programme dedicated to green bond issuances under the Government Green Bond Programme, and increased gradually the diversity of its issuances since 2019, both in terms of currencies and tenors.  To support the issuance of green and sustainable bonds and loans in the private sector, the Government set up the Green and Sustainable Finance Grant Scheme in May 2021. Administered by the HKMA, this scheme has incentivised more corporates to seek green and sustainable financing in Hong Kong, and encouraged more green advisers and external reviewers to establish or expand their presence here.\n\nThirdly, as the manager of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA has ensured that environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations are an integral part of its investment process and asset allocation decisions.  In the latter part of this report, the HKMA makes its inaugural disclosures on its climate scenario analysis and carbon footprint metrics of the Exchange Fund’s portfolios.\n\nFourthly, the HKMA is stepping up its own green office initiatives to ensure its own operations conform to best practices in the management and mitigation of climate risks.  As a start, the HKMA has established its carbon profile across Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions4, and made corresponding disclosures.  At the same time, the HKMA has implemented measures to enhance industry-wide operational efficiency and minimise resource consumption.  In addition, the HKMA holds itself to high standards of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and works with its stakeholders to promote financial inclusion and financial literacy.\n\nGreening the financial system requires close collaboration amongst central banks and supervisors.  The HKMA is an active member of the international community in global policymaking and alignment of sustainability standards. The HKMA has also issued a statement to support the Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) Glasgow Declaration5, reaffirming its commitment to delivering on the NGFS recommendations in taking the necessary measures to foster a greener financial system.\n\nIn driving these sustainability initiatives and assessing climaterelated opportunities and risks, sustainability and green considerations are embedded in the HKMA’s governance and risk management frameworks, in which the leadership is actively involved in setting the overarching objectives and guiding principles, in consultation with the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) and its sub-committees. The HKMA’s CSR and Sustainability Committee (CSC) also assesses the potential impacts of sustainability and climate-related issues on the organisation, and devises strategies to reduce the impacts.  Execution of the relevant strategies and initiatives is closely monitored and reported to the top management regularly.  In addition, external consultants have been engaged to advise the HKMA in selected areas of work.\n\nThe subsequent sections of this chapter will delve into the HKMA’s governance, strategies and risk management measures in undertaking green finance and sustainability work in each of its roles.\n\nThis report is prepared with reference to the disclosure elements recommended in the NGFS’s Guide on Climaterelated Disclosure for Central Banks, published in December 2021.  In addition, information in relation to the HKMA’s office operations makes broad reference to the reporting principles under the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards6 and the ESG Reporting Guide promulgated by the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited.\n\n# Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System\n\nThe NGFS provides a platform for central banks and prudential supervisory authorities to exchange experiences, share best practices, contribute to the development of environmental and climate risk management in the financial sector, and mobilise mainstream finance to support the transition towards a sustainable economy.  Its purpose is to define and promote best practices to be implemented within and outside of the membership of the NGFS, and to conduct or commission analytical work on green finance.\n\n# Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures\n\nIn December 2015, the Financial Stability Board created the TCFD to develop recommendations for more effective climate-related disclosures by companies to investors, lenders and insurance underwriters that could promote more informed decisions.  The TCFD’s recommendations are structured around four thematic areas that represent the core elements of how organisations operate: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets.\n\n# BANKING SUPERVISOR\n\nAs the core part of the financial system, banks should be proactive in managing climate risks, and support channelling more capital to green and sustainable activities.  As a banking supervisor, the HKMA focuses on building banks’ resilience against climate risks and accelerating banks’ efforts in supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\n# Overview of the HKMA’s three-phased approach\n\nSince May 2019, the HKMA has been promoting green and sustainable banking in three phases:\n\n# Phase I\n\nDeveloping a common framework to assess the “greenness baseline” of individual banks, and collaborating with international bodies to provide technical support to banks in Hong Kong.\n\n# Phase II\n\nConsulting the industry and other stakeholders on the supervisory expectations and requirements of green and sustainable banking.\n\n# Phase III\n\nFocusing on the implementation of supervisory requirements, monitoring and evaluation of banks’ progress in green and sustainable banking.\n\n# Guidance\n\n# Supervisory requirements on climate risk management\n\nIn 2020, the HKMA developed a common framework for assessing the “greenness baseline” of individual banks in collaboration with the industry.  The HKMA also conducted the first greenness assessment of banks, which marked the completion of Phase I.  To help banks prepare for the new supervisory requirements, a white paper was published in June 2020, which outlined the HKMA’s initial thinking on supervisory expectations for climate risk management.\n\nIn December 2021, following an industry consultation, the HKMA issued the supervisory requirements for banks to incorporate climate considerations into governance, strategy, risk management and disclosure.  In particular, specific requirements and concrete timeline were set out in mandating climate-related disclosures based on the recommendations of the TCFD before 2025. The requirements will set a benchmark to help banks upgrade their risk management capability.\n\nThe next step is for the HKMA to monitor banks’ implementation of the relevant requirements.  In this regard, the HKMA has stepped up its supervisory capacity by setting up a new dedicated team within its Banking Supervision Department to carry out climate risk supervision.\n\nThis three-phased approach is an iterative and evolving process.  Further to the first round of greenness assessment conducted in 2020, the HKMA is reviewing the framework to encompass the new supervisory requirements on climate risk management and potentially cover a wider scope, such as other environmental risks and measures for supporting the net zero transition.   The HKMA intends to launch an updated framework in the second half of 2022.\n\n# Sound practices supporting the transition to carbon neutrality\n\nApart from incorporating climate risk considerations into the risk management framework, some banks have devoted resources and taken measures to support the goals of the Paris Agreement and contribute to achieving global net zero emissions.  The HKMA issued a circular in December 2021 to share with the industry the sound practices of these banks which would be of reference value to other banks in the industry in formulating their climate strategies.  These sound practices are grouped into four areas: reducing GHG emissions of the banks’ own operations, reducing financed emissions through portfolio alignment, assisting clients to transition, and promoting collective efforts to assist the economy to achieve a net-zero transition.\n\n# Green classification framework to facilitate green finance flows\n\nTo increase transparency across the financial markets and enable consistent policy making on green finance, the HKMA has been working with other financial regulators to explore a local green classification framework, which will facilitate navigation among the Common Ground Taxonomy (CGT) developed by the International Platform on Sustainable Finance (IPSF)8 and the green definitions adopted by China and European Union, for adoption across different financial sectors.  The work will be guided by the principles of interoperability, comparability and inclusiveness, taking into account other definitions of green, transitional activities and local considerations.  This initiative will reduce the risk of green washing, improve product comparability and ultimately enhance investor protection.\n\n# Assessment: climate risk stress test\n\nTo assess the banking sector’s ability to cope with potential shocks brought about by climate change, the HKMA undertook a pilot exercise on climate risk stress test (CRST), which included the participation of 20 major retail banks and seven branches of international banking groups.  A report summarising the results of the pilot CRST exercise was published in December 2021.  The results showed that the banking sector remained resilient even in the face of extreme climate-related shocks, although these shocks could potentially give rise to significant adverse impacts on banks’ financials.  The CRST exercise helped to enhance banks’ capabilities for measuring and assessing climate risks. In light of the CRST results, the participating banks have devised plans to strengthen their climate strategies and risk governance frameworks.  The HKMA will continue to engage the industry to strengthen banks’ capability and enhance the CRST framework, taking into account the lessons learnt from the pilot exercise.\n", "zh": "可持續發展\n\n香港金融管理局（金管局）正在發布其首份可持續發展報告，作為其2021年年度報告的重要組成部分，闡述其關於可持續發展的策略，並記錄其自身的努力，以及與金融行業的共同努力，以支持政府的氣候策略，並為建設一個更具氣候韌性和可持續的世界作出貢獻。\n\n金管局將可持續發展考慮融入其主要職能和角色之中，無論是作為銀行監管機構、市場促進者、負責任的投資者，或是在維持金融和貨幣穩定方面。此外，金管局與本地及海外對口機構合作，加強氣候風險管理和披露，以及推動綠色和可持續金融市場的發展。\n\n此外，金管局致力於履行其企業社會責任，並 aims to成為一個具有責任感和可持續發展的組織。這一承諾體現在多個領域，包括促進一個可持續的、金融普及且環境友善的市場，支持更廣泛的社區，保護環境，以及營造一個充滿關懷的工作場所。\n\n# 概覽\n\n氣候變化是當今世界面臨的最緊迫挑戰之一。為應對氣候變化，各國根據《巴黎協定》達成共識，採取行動減少溫室氣體（GHG）排放，並在本世紀內實現碳中和。達成《巴黎協定》氣候目標，全球每年約需投資1到2萬億美元，這使得可持續發展成為未來數十年資金流動的最大推動力之一。\n\n香港決心在這一轉型中扮演領導角色。政府宣布將努力在2050年前實現碳中和，與全球發達經濟體保持一致。香港也是亞洲首個承諾在2025年前，將披露要求與氣候相關財務披露工作組（TCFD）的建議進行具體對齊的司法管轄區，涵蓋相關行業。\n\n對金融行業而言，氣候變化既是風險源，也是機遇。雖然金融行業無法避免氣候變化帶來的威脅，但其在轉型過程中發揮關鍵作用，通過向符合低碳路徑和氣候韌性發展的活動提供更多資金來促進變革。\n\n金管局致力於加強香港金融體系，支持更綠色、更可持續的未來，推動行動以配合政府的氣候目標，並為全球議程作出貢獻。在此過程中，金管局將可持續發展的考慮融入其主要職能和運作中。\n\n首先，作為銀行監管機構，金管局旨在增強銀行系統對氣候風險的韌性，並加快銀行支持向低碳經濟轉型的努力。為此，金管局制定了一套監管框架，規定銀行管理和披露氣候風險的要求。2021年，金管局成功完成了氣候風險壓力測試的試點工作，以評估銀行業的韌性。同時，金管局持續關注氣候變化在監測金融穩定風險中的作用。\n\n第二，作為市場推動者，金管局致力於提升香港作為區域綠色及可持續金融樞紐的地位，包括大灣區。作為內地的離岸金融中心，香港有良好條件引導全球投資流向內地實現2030年碳達峰和2060年碳中和的規劃。金管局亦透過與其共同牽頭的綠色及可持續金融跨機構督導小組（CASG），促進行業能力建設，解決數據缺口，以及探索本地綠色分類框架。\n\n事實上，香港在綠色金融方案方面已是領先者，建立了全球首個由政府支持的“全球中期票據計劃”，專為綠色債券發行而設，且自2019年起，已逐步擴大其發行品種，涵蓋多種貨幣和期限。為支持私營部門綠色及可持續債券及貸款的發行，政府於2021年5月設立了綠色和可持續金融資助計劃，由金管局管理激勵企業尋求相關融資，並鼓勵更多綠色顧問及外聘評審機構在香港設立或擴展業務。\n\n第三，作為外匯基金的管理者，金管局已確保環境、社會和治理（ESG）因素成為其投資過程和資產配置決策的重要部分。在報告的後部分，金管局首次披露其氣候情境分析和外匯基金投資組合的碳足跡指標。\n\n第四，金管局正推行提升自身綠色辦公措施，確保其運作符合最佳氣候風險管理和緩解實踐。首先，金管局已建立涵蓋範圍1和範圍2的碳足跡資料，並作出相應披露。同時，已採取措施提升行業整體運營效率與資源節約。此外，金管局高度重視企業社會責任（CSR），並與利益相關者合作推動金融普及和金融素養。\n\n推動金融體系的綠化需要中央銀行和監管機構之間密切合作。金管局積極參與國際社群的全球政策制定和可持續性標準落實，亦支持“中央銀行與監管機構綠色金融網絡”（NGFS）格拉斯哥宣言，重申其承諾執行NGFS的建議，採取必要措施促進更綠色的金融體系。\n\n在推動這些可持續發展倡議和評估氣候相關機遇與風險中，香港金融管理局的治理和風險管理框架已將可持續性及綠色因素嵌入其中，由領導層積極參與制定整體目標和指導原則，並與外匯基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）及其下屬小組合作。企業社會責任及可持續發展委員會（CSC）亦負責評估相關氣候和可持續性問題的潛在影響，並制定策略以降低影響。相關策略和措施的執行受到嚴格監督，定期向高層管理匯報。此外，已聘請外部顧問在特定領域提供專業意見。\n\n本章後續部分將深入探討金管局在其不同職能中推行綠色金融和可持續發展工作所展現的治理、策略及風險管理措施。\n\n本報告參考了2021年12月由NGFS發布的《中央銀行氣候相關披露指南》建議的披露要素製作。此外，關於金管局辦公室運作的資料，也廣泛參照《全球報告倡議（GRI）標準》以及香港聯合交易所有限公司公布的《環境、社會及管治（ESG）報告指引》的披露原則。"}
{"en": "# The Exchange Fund\n\nReport of the Director of Audit Exchange Fund Financial Statements\n\n# Audit Commission The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 217 to 319, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2021, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2021, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards.  My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report.  I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards.  I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021.  These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.5, 2.6 and 38.1 to the financial statements.\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, the Group had financial assets totalling HK$4,502,475 million and financial liabilities totalling HK$1,150,861 million valued at fair value.\n\nFor 89% of these financial assets and all these financial liabilities, their fair values were quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 inputs) or were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data (Level 2 inputs).\n\nFor the remaining 11% of these financial assets, their fair values were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data (Level 3 inputs).  Such financial assets totalled HK$517,316 million, including mainly unlisted investment funds.\n\nGiven the substantial amount and the estimations involved, valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value was a key audit matter.\n\nThe audit procedures on valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value included:\n\n- obtaining an understanding of the procedures, including relevant controls, for valuing different categories of financial assets and financial liabilities;\n- evaluating and testing the controls, including relevant application controls of the computer systems;\n- obtaining external confirmations on the valuation, existence, rights and obligations and completeness of the financial assets and financial liabilities;\n- where quoted market prices were used, verifying the prices to independent sources;\n- where valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions, and verifying the inputs to independent sources; and\n- where valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Valuation of investment properties at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.11, 18 and 19 to the financial statements.\n\nThe Group’s investment properties were stated at their fair values, totalling HK$27,089 million as at 31 December 2021. The Group also had interests in one associate and twenty one joint ventures totalling HK$45,172 million, whose principal activities were holding overseas investment properties.  The fair values of these investment properties, whether held by the Group directly or by associate or joint ventures, were mainly determined based on valuations by independent professional valuers.  Such valuations involved significant judgments and estimates, including the valuation methodologies and the assumptions used.\n\nThe audit procedures on valuation of investment properties at fair value included:\n\n- obtaining and reviewing the valuation reports of investment properties held by the Group directly or by associate or joint ventures, and verifying that the fair values were based on the valuations stated in the valuation reports;\n- assessing the independence and qualifications of the valuers; and\n- evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information.  The other information comprises all the information included in the 2021 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.  If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact.  I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.  I also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.  The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.  If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion.  My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report.  However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and\n- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements.  I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit.  I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.  I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nJohn Chu Director of Audit\n", "zh": "外匯基金\n\n審計署署長報告書 外匯基金財務報表\n\n香港特別行政區政府 審計署\n\n獨立核數師報告書 給財政司司長\n\n意見\n\n我證明已審核列於第217至319頁的外匯基金及其附屬公司（「本集團」）的財務報表，包括於2021年12月31日的外匯基金及本集團的資產負債表，以及該年度的收支帳目、全面收益表、權益變動表和現金流量表以及財務報表附註，包括重要會計政策摘要。\n\n依據我之專業判斷，財務報表真實及公平反映基金及本集團於2021年12月31日的財務狀況，以及其截至該日的財務績效和現金流量，並已依據由香港會計師公會（「HKICPA」）發行的《香港財務報告準則》（「HKFRSs」）妥為編制，並符合《外匯基金條例》（第66章）第7條下總裁制定指令的規定。\n\n意見基礎\n\n我根據《外匯基金條例》（第66章）第7條下總裁制定的指令及審計署審計準則進行審核。 本準則下我的職責另於報告中的「我就財務報表審核的責任」部分作進一步說明。 我根據上述準則保持獨立，並已履行我在道德責任方面的其他義務。 我相信我已取得足夠且適當的審計證據，以作出本意見。\n\n主要審核事項\n\n主要審核事項是指，在我專業判斷中，對我在審核2021年終止之財務年度的財務報表時最具重要性之事項。 這些事項於整體財務報表審核中應用，並影響我形成意見的過程，本文不就這些事項作出分別意見。\n\n以公平價值計算的金融資產及金融負債的估值\n\n參照財務報表附註2.5、2.6及38.1。\n\n截至2021年12月31日，本集團持有金融資產合共HK$4,502,475百萬元，金融負債合共HK$1,150,861百萬元，估值按公平值計算。\n\n其中89%的金融資產及所有金融負債的公平值均為在相同資產或負債的活躍市場中報出的價格（Level 1輸入），或使用基於可觀察市場數據的估值技術進行估值（Level 2輸入）。\n\n剩餘11%的金融資產的公平值則是運用非基於可觀察市場數據的估值技術（Level 3輸入）予以估算，這些資產總值HK$517,316百萬元，其中主要為未上市投資基金。\n\n由於金額龐大及涉及估算，使用公平值進行金融資產及金融負債的估值成為主要審核事項。\n\n審核程序包括：\n\n- 了解評值程序，包括關聯控制措施；\n- 評估並測試相關控制措施，包括電腦系統的應用控制；\n- 取得外部確認，核實財務資產及財務負債的估值、存在、權利義務及完整性；\n- 使用報價價格的情況下，對照獨立來源驗證價格；\n- 使用基於可觀察市場數據的估值技術時，評估估值方法的適當性、假設的合理性，並核實輸入資料至獨立來源；\n- 使用非基於可觀察市場數據的估值技術時，評估估值方法的適當性、假設及輸入的合理性。\n\n以公平價值計算的投資物業估值\n\n參照財務報表附註2.11、18和19。\n\n本集團於2021年12月31日的投資物業按公平值列帳，總值HK$27,089百萬元。本集團亦持有一間合資公司及二十一個聯營公司，合共HK$45,172百萬元，主要從事持有海外投資物業。 這些投資物業的公平值主要由獨立專業估值師根據估值報告確定，涉及重要判斷和估算，包括估值方法及所採用的假設。\n\n審核程序包括：\n\n- 取得並審閱本集團直接或由合資和聯營公司持有的投資物業的估值報告，並核實其公平值是否以估值報告中的數據為依據；\n- 評估估值師的獨立性與資格；\n- 評估估值方法的適當性及假設和輸入的合理性。\n\n其他資料\n\n貨幣管理局負責其他資料，該等資料包括除財務報表和本核數師報告外的2021年香港金融管理局年報所有資料。\n\n我對財務報表的意見不包括其他資料，亦不對其作出任何保證。\n\n在審核財務報表時，我的責任是閱覽其他資料，並在此過程中考慮其與財務報表或我在審核中獲得的知識是否有重大不符，或表面上是否存在重大錯誤。如我基於已完成的工作判定此等其他資料存在重大錯誤，則須就此事作出報告。 本次我沒有此方面的事項可以報告。\n\n貨幣管理局與外匯基金顧問委員會審計小組的職責\n\n貨幣管理局負責依照HKFRSs和《外匯基金條例》（第66章）第7條下總裁制定的指令，妥為編製財務報表，提供真實及公平的財務狀況及經營成果。貨幣管理局亦負責制定必要的內部控制措施，以確保財務報表不存在因欺詐或錯誤而引致的重大錯誤。\n\n制定財務報表時，貨幣管理局負責評估本集團的持續經營能力，披露相關持續經營事項，並採用持續經營作會計基礎。\n\n外匯基金顧問委員會的審計小組則負責監督本集團的財務匯報流程。\n\n核數師的審核責任\n\n我旨在獲得合理確信，確保整體財務報表不存在因欺詐或錯誤而引致的重大錯誤，並出具包含我意見的核數報告。合理確信是一種較高水平的確信，但並不保證按審計署審計準則進行的審核一定可以發現所有存在的重大錯誤。錯誤可能因欺詐或失誤而致，若單獨或合計有理由相信，會合理影響用戶基於財務報表作出經濟決策的判斷，即屬重大。\n\n作為審計署審計準則下的審核一部分，我會行使專業判斷，保持專業懷疑，並：\n\n- 識別並評估因欺詐或失誤產生重大錯誤的風險，設計及執行應對措施，並收集足夠且適當的審計證據以支持我之意見。由欺詐引起的重大錯誤未能發現的風險較因失誤而高，因欺詐可能涉及串謀、偽造、蓄意遺漏、虛假陳述或內控制度的凌駕；\n- 了解與審核相關的內部控制，以設計適合的審計措施，但不因此發表對本集團內部控制有效性的意見；\n- 評估貨幣管理局所採用的會計政策的適當性、會計估計的合理性及披露的充分性；\n- 對貨幣管理局採用持續經營的會計基礎的適用性作出結論，並根據已取得的審計證據，確認是否存在可能對本集團能否持續經營形成重大不確定性的事件或條件。如果我認為存在重大的不確定性，須在核數報告中提及相關披露，若披露不足，也需作出修正意見。我的結論根據截止報告之日收集的審計證據，但未來事態或條件可能導致集團停止持續經營；\n- 評估財務報表的整體呈現、架構及內容，包括披露內容，並判定其是否真實反映相關交易及事件，以實現公允表示；\n- 收集足夠且適當的審計證據，以對本集團內相關實體或業務活動的財務資料作出意見。我負責督導、監督及執行集團審計，並獨自承擔我之審計意見的責任。\n\n我會就計劃的審核範圍與時間表及重要審計發現（包括我在審計中識別到的任何重大內部控制缺陷）與外匯基金顧問委員會的審計小組溝通。\n\n我亦會向審計小組出具聲明，證明我已遵守相關的獨立性道德規範，並就任何可能合理影響我獨立性的關係或事宜及相應的保障措施作出披露。\n\n根據與審計小組的溝通，我確定在本期財務報表的審核中具有最高重要性的事項，即為關鍵審核事項。除法律或規例限制外，會在核數報告中描述這些事項。特殊情況下，如我判定披露的風險大於其帶來的公共利益，則可能不會公開披露該事項。\n\n朱仲明 審計署署長"}

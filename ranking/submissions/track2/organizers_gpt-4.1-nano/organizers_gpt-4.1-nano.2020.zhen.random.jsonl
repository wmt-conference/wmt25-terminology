{"zh": "# 總裁報告\n\n2020年可謂是超乎想像的一年。\n\n新冠病毒疫情肆虐全球，令人措手不及，世界各地的經濟活動幾乎陷於停頓。在疫情的打擊下，香港經濟繼2019年後連續第二年收縮，本地生產總值錄得有紀錄以來的最大跌幅。失業率飆升至16年高位，部分行業尤其受到重創。\n\n然而，困境往往是展現我們實力的時候。儘管面對重重挑戰，香港的貨幣及銀行體系再次成功抵禦衝擊。這一切絕非偶然，而是我們多年來一直奉行審慎政策的成果。\n\n復甦前路難望平坦。即使各地央行及政府都全力支持經濟，但前景仍充滿不確定性，包括央行的貨幣政策立場、疫苗接種計劃的進展，以及長期低息環境的潛在影響。另一方面，地緣政治緊張局勢變化不斷，令宏觀形勢更添變數。\n\n縱使面對如此不明朗的形勢，金管局會繼續緊守崗位，維持貨幣及金融穩定，締造有利經濟復甦的環境。與此同時，在不斷演變的銀行及金融業大環境下，我們亦會致力把握機會，提升香港作為全球金融樞紐的競爭力。\n\n# 貨幣及金融穩定：堅穩如昔\n\n聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）在2020年繼續暢順有序地運作。聯匯制度自1983年實施至今，渡過一次又一次的難關，充分展現出抵禦衝擊的能力。儘管面對疫情及波動的宏觀經濟環境，年內港元匯率一直保持平穩。強方兌換保證合共被觸發85次，累計資金流入約3,835億港元。\n\n聯匯制度得以維持穩健，全賴多年來所建立的穩固根基。正如國際貨幣基金組織在其《2020年對外部門報告》中的總結指出，聯匯制度的公信力建基於具高透明度的運作規則、充裕的財政及外匯儲備、穩健的金融監管、靈活的經濟及審慎的財政制度。同時，金管局透過與業界緊密聯繫，以及透過傳統及社交媒體與公眾有效溝通，迅速澄清謠言，並適時提供有關事實與數據的最新資訊。金管局亦利用最新的科技與數據分析技術，繼續提升監察能力，以靈活應對最新市況及新出現的風險。\n\n雖然疫情對經濟造成沉重壓力，但銀行體系維持穩健，資本及流動資金充裕。於2020年底，本地銀行的資本充足比率為20.7%，遠高於國際最低要求的8%。大型銀行的平均流動性覆蓋比率亦遠高於法定最低要求的100%，於2020年第4季達到155.1%。受疫情影響，銀行的資產質素略為轉差，特定分類貸款比率於2020年底上升至0.9%，但仍屬穩健並遠低於自2000年以來的長期平均水平1.8%。\n\n# 銀行體系：經濟命脈\n\n銀行體系在經濟與社會中扮演重要的金融中介角色。年內金管局一方面繼續重點監管銀行的信用及流動性風險，另一方面亦密切留意疫情對銀行營運的影響，並採取多項措施，確保銀行體系能繼續提供基本服務，以及提供貸款支持經濟。金管局在3月下調逆周期緩衝資本比率100基點至1%，又在4月調低監管儲備水平。這些措施為銀行體系合共釋放約1萬億港元的借貸空間。\n\n我們深知中小企在當前的經濟環境下或會面對資金周轉壓力。因此，金管局聯同我們在2019年成立的銀行業中小企貸款協調機制推出多輪紓困措施，包括「預先批核還息不還本」計劃，將合資格企業的所有貸款本金還款延期6個月。截至2020年底，銀行共批出超過58,000宗貸款展期及其他支援措施的個案，涉資超過7,400億港元。鑑於疫情反覆，金管局因應情況將「預先批核還息不還本」計劃展期，並於2021年3月將計劃延長至2021年10月底。香港按揭證券有限公司亦在其中小企融資擔保計劃下推出「百分百擔保特惠貸款」，以紓緩中小企支付僱員薪金及租金的負擔。截至2020年底，共批出超過25,000宗申請，涉資約400億港元。該計劃在2021年第1季作出優化，申請期限亦延長至2021年12月31日。年內銀行亦批出超過28,000宗紓困措施申請，協助個人客戶的資金周轉，涉資440億港元。銀行業同心協力，支持企業及個人客戶，共渡時艱，實在令人鼓舞。\n\n與此同時，金管局繼續推動銀行業加強普及金融與實踐「以客為本」的文化。我們進一步鼓勵銀行格外留意有需要的客戶，並與銀行分享多方面的良好做法，包括為智障人士提供銀行服務，以及提供更多無障礙及方便易用的銀行服務。\n\n隨着科技長足發展，銀行業的經營環境亦急速轉變。因此，金管局的工作不僅限於應對當前的挑戰，亦要放眼未來，擴大人才庫，以配合銀行業的日後發展。我們與香港銀行公會及香港銀行學會聯合展開「提升未來銀行業人才的專業能力」研究計劃，評估銀行業未來幾年的潛在人才缺口，並為銀行規劃清晰的路線圖，以期未雨綢繆，改善人才供應的情況。我們又推出「銀行業人才起動計劃」，為本地大學的應屆畢業生提供為期6個月的實習機會及銀行業相關的特定培訓，藉以為業界培育人才。在本港勞工市場的嚴峻時期推出此計劃，亦正好為有志加入銀行業的年青人提供機會。\n\n# 國際金融中心地位：無懼挑戰\n\n為履行金管局其中一項重要職責，協助鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位，我們的未來規劃涵蓋銀行體系以至整個金融體系，旨在讓香港在不斷演變的金融環境中能夠保持作為國際金融中心的競爭力。在疫情期間，我們仍然穩步推進這些工作，並在幾個重點範疇積極開拓新機遇，以充分把握新趨勢及轉變的契機。\n\n# 推動綠色金融，締造更可持續的未來\n\n第一個範疇是推動綠色及可持續金融。自2019年5月推出分三階段進行的措施以來，相關工作已取得理想進展。我們在2020年完成對47間銀行的「綠色基準」評估，發表白皮書及發出通告，就銀行管理氣候風險提供指引及分享經驗。我們亦全力推進第二階段的工作，制定銀行業管理氣候風險的監管架構。此外，我們會致力在2025年或之前按照氣候相關財務披露工作小組的建議，要求銀行就氣候相關資料作出披露。這將使香港成為亞洲區內首個作出相關具體要求的地區。\n\n金管局作為全球最大的儲備管理人之一，我們積極將環境、社會及管治(ESG)因素納入甄選、委任及監察外聘投資經理的程序。我們亦身體力行作出ESG投資，包括投資於綠色、社會及可持續債券和低碳項目。\n\n為進一步發展香港的綠色金融生態圈，金管局一直協助政府發行綠色債券，而最近發行的第二批政府綠色債券更大受國際投資者歡迎。乘着這個發展趨勢，財政司司長在《2021至22年度財政預算案》中宣布政府會擴大「政府綠色債券計劃」的規模，將借款上限提升一倍至2,000億港元，並會增加日後發行的綠色債券的種類與發行渠道。\n\n為鞏固香港作為區內綠色及可持續金融樞紐，我們整體策略的其中一環，是與本地其他監管機構及國際社會合作，推進綠色金融議程。在本地方面，金管局聯同其他監管機構成立綠色和可持續金融跨機構督導小組，協調金融業的相關措施。該小組已經制定策略性計劃，促進香港的綠色及可持續金融的發展。在國際方面，金管局應國際金融公司的邀請，成為亞洲區域創始成員及首個區域執行理事，與其合力推動「綠色商業銀行聯盟」。聯盟旨在於全球金融市場推動綠色銀行業，並由亞洲開始，逐步擴展至其他地區。\n\n我們期望上述工作有助減低金融業面對的氣候風險，以及促進本港銀行發揮優勢，滿足區內綠色投資的龐大資金需求。\n\n# 金融科技方便市民，裨益經濟\n\n推動金融業增長的另一個主要引擎是金融科技，而在新冠病毒疫情下，這方面的步伐更見加速。\n\n過去一年清楚顯示，金融科技能夠擴展我們的「工具箱」，以應對突如其來的衝擊。面對新冠病毒疫情，電子支付渠道發揮了前所未見的作用。自2018年9月推出快速支付系統「轉數快」至2020年底期間，「轉數快」已錄得690萬個登記賬戶。即使在社交距離措施的限制下，公眾仍能利用「轉數快」這個安全快捷及穩妥的方式收付及轉撥資金，令「轉數快」的平均每日交易量在2020年急增2.3倍。我們亦一直與政府合作，將「轉數快」的應用範圍擴大至繳付更多種政府及公共服務帳單。\n\n此外，金融科技亦有助銀行提供更多元化及便利的銀行客戶服務。獲金管局發牌的所有8間虛擬銀行年內已經全數在香港開業。截至2020年底，在虛擬銀行開設的帳戶共有420,000個，總計客戶存款150億港元。其中部分虛擬銀行已經率先使用新類型數據進行信貸評估，以開拓新的客戶群及促進普及金融。金管局繼續推動在香港發展更具規模及更多元化的合規科技生態圈，作為「銀行易」措施的一部分，從而精簡監管規定，提升客戶體驗。除透過刊發通訊系列，以提高業界對合規科技應用的認知外，金管局亦發表白皮書，載述加快銀行業採用合規科技的兩年計劃。另外，金管局又展開「商業數據通」項目，以便中小企利用自身的數碼足跡更便捷地獲取銀行融資。\n\n金融科技面貌日新月異，科技應用亦日趨普及，金管局需繼續秉持嚴謹的監管。為此，我們推出「網絡防衛計劃2.0」，以提高銀行的網絡防衛能力。我們亦加強對科技風險管理的現場審查，並制定監管框架，評估運用創新信用風險評估方法的個人貸款產品的信用風險。金管局亦展開監管科技應用的三年計劃，以提升監管流程的成效及前瞻性。我們現正進行的有關工作包括更有效地利用數據及科技來加強反洗錢方面的監管。\n", "en": "# President's Report\n\n2020 can be described as an unimaginable year.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic ravaged the world, catching us off guard, and nearly brought global economic activities to a halt. Under the impact of the pandemic, Hong Kong’s economy contracted for the second consecutive year following 2019, recording the largest decline in local gross domestic product in history. Unemployment soared to a 16-year high, with some industries especially severely hit.\n\nHowever, crises often provide opportunities to showcase our strength. Despite numerous challenges, Hong Kong’s monetary and banking systems once again successfully resiliently defended against shocks. None of this is accidental but is the result of our years of adhering to prudent policies.\n\nThe road to recovery remains uncertain. Even with all-out support from central banks and governments around the world, the outlook is still fraught with uncertainties, including the stance of monetary policies, progress of vaccination plans, and the potential impacts of persistently low interest rates. Meanwhile, geopolitical tensions continue to change, adding more variables to the macroeconomic environment.\n\nDespite facing such unpredictable circumstances, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will continue to diligently safeguard currency and financial stability, creating a favourable environment for economic recovery. At the same time, in the evolving banking and financial environment, we will also strive to seize opportunities, enhance Hong Kong’s competitiveness as a global financial hub.\n\n# Currency and Financial Stability: Remain Steady as Always\n\nThe Linked Exchange Rate System (LERs) continued to operate smoothly and orderly in 2020. Since its implementation in 1983, the system has weathered numerous challenges, demonstrating resilience against shocks. Despite the pandemic and macroeconomic fluctuations, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained stable throughout the year. The strong-side convertibility undertakings were triggered a total of 85 times, with cumulative capital inflows amounting to about HK$383.5 billion.\n\nThe sustained robustness of the LERs is based on a solid foundation built over many years. As summarized in the International Monetary Fund’s “2020 External Sector Report,” the credibility of the system is underpinned by high transparency of operational rules, ample fiscal and foreign exchange reserves, prudent financial regulation, flexible economic policies, and a cautious fiscal framework. Moreover, the HKMA, through close ties with the industry and effective communication with the public via traditional and social media, promptly clarified rumors and provided the latest facts and data. The HKMA also continually leverages new technological and data analytics tools to enhance supervisory capabilities, allowing flexible responses to the latest market conditions and emerging risks.\n\nAlthough the pandemic has exerted heavy pressure on the economy, the banking sector remains fundamentally sound, with ample capital and liquidity. By the end of 2020, the local banks’ capital adequacy ratio stood at 20.7%, far above the minimum international requirement of 8%. The average liquidity coverage ratio of major banks also exceeded the statutory minimum of 100%, reaching 155.1% in the fourth quarter of 2020. Due to the pandemic, asset quality has slightly deteriorated, with the ratio of classified loans rising to 0.9% at the end of 2020, but it remains prudent and well below the long-term average of 1.8% since 2000.\n\n# Banking Sector: The Vital Heart of the Economy\n\nThe banking sector plays a crucial intermediary role in the economy and society. During the year, the HKMA continued to monitor banking credit and liquidity risks closely, while also paying close attention to the impact of the pandemic on banking operations. We implemented various measures to ensure the banking system could continue providing essential services and support loans to bolster the economy. In March, we lowered the countercyclical capital buffer ratio by 100 basis points to 1%, and in April, we reduced the required reserve ratio levels. These measures collectively released around HK$10 trillion of lending capacity in the banking sector.\n\nWe recognize that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) may face cash flow pressures in the current economic climate. Therefore, the HKMA, together with the banking industry’s SME loan coordination mechanism established in 2019, launched multiple relief measures, including a “pre-approval for deferred interest payments without principal repayment” scheme, which extended the principal repayment deferral for eligible firms by six months. By the end of 2020, over 58,000 loan extension and support cases with a total amount exceeding HK$740 billion had been approved. Due to recurrent waves of the pandemic, the HKMA extended the “pre-approval for deferred interest payments” scheme to October 2021, with the extension announced in March 2021. The Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation also introduced a “100% Guarantee Special Loan” under the SME financing guarantee scheme, to ease SMEs’ burden in paying wages and rent. By the end of 2020, over 25,000 applications had been approved, involving some HK$40 billion. The scheme was further optimized in the first quarter of 2021, with the application deadline extended to December 31, 2021. Throughout the year, banks approved over 28,000 relief measure applications, helping individual clients with liquidity needs of about HK$44 billion. The banking industry’s concerted efforts to support enterprises and individuals through these difficult times are truly inspiring and encouraging.\n\nMeanwhile, the HKMA continues to promote the banking sector’s widespread financial literacy and foster a “customer-centric” culture. We further encourage banks to pay close attention to the needs of vulnerable customers, and share good practices, including providing banking services for people with intellectual disabilities and offering more accessible and user-friendly banking services.\n\nAs technology advances rapidly, the banking environment is also undergoing swift transformation. Therefore, the HKMA’s work is not only about addressing current challenges but also about looking ahead—expanding talent pools to support future development. We have launched a joint research project with the Hong Kong Association of Banks and the Hong Kong Institute of Bankers to assess future talent gaps in the banking industry and to develop clear roadmaps to better prepare for the supply of talent. Additionally, we introduced the “Banking Talent Development Scheme,” providing six-month internships and specialized training for fresh graduates from local universities, aiming to cultivate talent for the industry. Implementing this scheme during challenging times in Hong Kong’s labour market also provides opportunities for young people aspiring to join the banking sector.\n\n# International Financial Centre: Facing Challenges with Confidence\n\nTo fulfill one of the HKMA’s key responsibilities—helping to consolidate Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre—our future planning encompasses the banking system and the overall financial ecosystem, aiming to maintain Hong Kong’s competitive edge amidst a continually evolving financial environment. Throughout the pandemic, we have steadily advanced these efforts and actively explored new opportunities in key areas to capitalize on emerging trends and shifts.\n\n# Promoting Green Finance for a More Sustainable Future\n\nThe first focus is on promoting green and sustainable finance. Since implementing a three-phase measure starting in May 2019, we have made good progress. In 2020, we completed the “Green Benchmark” assessments on 47 banks, published a white paper, and issued a circular providing guidance and sharing experiences on climate risk management. We are also actively progressing with the second phase—developing the regulatory framework for banks to manage climate risks. Moreover, we aim to require banks to disclose climate-related data by 2025 or earlier, based on the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, making Hong Kong the first region in Asia to set such specific requirements.\n\nAs one of the world’s largest reserve managers, the HKMA actively incorporates environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors into the process of selecting, appointing, and monitoring external investment managers. We practice ESG investing ourselves, including investments in green, social, and sustainable bonds as well as low-carbon projects.\n\nTo further develop Hong Kong’s green finance ecosystem, the HKMA has been assisting the government in issuing green bonds. The recently issued second batch of government green bonds received strong international investor interest. Riding this momentum, the Financial Secretary announced in the 2021–22 Budget that the government will double the quota of the “Government Green Bond Scheme” to HK$200 billion, and will expand the types and issuance channels of future green bonds.\n\nTo reinforce Hong Kong’s position as a green and sustainable finance hub in the region, our overall strategy includes collaborating with local regulators and the international community to advance the green finance agenda. Locally, the HKMA has co-established an inter-agency Green and Sustainable Finance Supervisory Working Group to coordinate measures across the financial sector. This group has already devised strategic plans to promote green and sustainable finance in Hong Kong. Internationally, at the invitation of the International Finance Corporation, the HKMA has become the founding member and first regional executive director of the “Green Business Banking Alliance,” aiming to promote green banking practices globally, starting from Asia and expanding gradually to other regions.\n\nWe hope that these initiatives will help reduce climate-related risks faced by the financial industry and support local banks in leveraging their strengths to meet the large-scale green investment needs of the region.\n\n# Financial Technology Facilitates Citizens and Benefits the Economy\n\nAnother major driver of growth in the financial sector is financial technology (fintech), which has accelerated significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe past year has vividly demonstrated how fintech can expand our “toolbox” to respond to sudden shocks. In the face of the pandemic, electronic payment channels played an unprecedented role. Since the launch of the Faster Payment System “FPS” in September 2018, the number of registered accounts reached 6.9 million by the end of 2020. Despite social distancing measures, the public could still use the secure, fast, and reliable “FPS” for payment and transfer needs, leading to a 2.3-fold surge in daily transaction volume in 2020. We also worked with the government to expand the application of “FPS” to include more types of government and public service bill payments.\n\nAdditionally, fintech has helped banks offer more diversified and convenient banking services. All eight virtual banks licensed by the HKMA had fully commenced operations in Hong Kong by the end of the year. By the end of 2020, there were 420,000 accounts opened with virtual banks, holding total deposits of HK$15 billion. Some virtual banks have pioneered the use of new data types for credit assessment to develop new customer bases and promote financial inclusion. The HKMA continues to promote the development of a larger and more diverse compliant technology ecosystem, as part of the “Banking Easy” initiative, aimed at streamlining regulatory requirements and enhancing customer experience. Besides issuing newsletters to raise awareness of regtech applications, we also published a white paper outlining a two-year plan to accelerate the adoption of regtech by banks. Moreover, we launched the “Financial Data Connect” initiative to enable SMEs to utilize their digital footprints to more easily access banking financing.\n\nFintech is evolving rapidly, with innovative applications becoming more widespread. The HKMA must continue to exercise strict regulatory oversight. Accordingly, we have launched the “Cyber Defence Scheme 2.0” to enhance cybersecurity capabilities among banks. We also strengthen on-site inspections of technological risks, and have formulated a regulatory framework to assess credit risks of personal loan products utilizing innovative credit scoring methods. Additionally, the HKMA is rolling out a three-year plan for regtech applications to improve the effectiveness and foresight of our supervisory processes. Current efforts include better leveraging data and technology to strengthen anti-money laundering regulation."}

The labour market deteriorated rapidly, while inflation was somewhat alleviated. The government and the HKMA implemented relief measures to support the economy amid the challenging environment.\n\nDespite numerous challenges, the banking system in Hong Kong remained robust, with healthy financial conditions and continued deposit growth. Capital and liquidity levels were maintained at abundant levels, and asset quality remained resilient.\n\n# Currency Stability\n\nAlthough the pandemic heightened uncertainties, the functioning of the Hong Kong dollar forex and currency markets remained smooth and orderly, reflecting the stability of Hong Kong’s monetary system. The HK dollar exchange rate was generally supported by a strong bias throughout most of 2020, with the strong-side convertibility guarantee being triggered multiple times. This demonstrates the robustness of the Linked Exchange Rate system and market confidence in the regime.\n\n# Banking System Stability\n\nWhile closely monitoring the pandemic’s impact on banking operations, the HKMA continued to focus on supervising credit and liquidity risk management. Given the increasing cyber risks and the acceleration of technology adoption by the industry, the HKMA strengthened supervision of banks’ technology risk management and operational resilience, as well as consumer protection in digital financial services.\n\nThe HKMA granted banks flexibility to enable them to continue serving customers during the pandemic. It also collaborated with relevant authorities to formulate implementation details for the “Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect” pilot scheme, and issued guidelines for family offices and wealth management businesses.\n\nIn tackling anti-money laundering and terrorist financing risks, the HKMA swiftly took actions to clarify how risk-based approaches and technology could help banks respond more effectively to COVID-19-related issues, while prudently managing the impact of rising geopolitical tensions on the banking sector. The HKMA also promoted sharing of information between public and private sectors and supported banks in adopting RegTech.\n\nDuring the year, new rules and regulations were introduced to strengthen the supervision of the banking sector in line with the latest international standards. In the green and sustainable banking sector, the HKMA progressed to the second phase of a three-stage plan to develop relevant supervisory requirements. The HKMA continued to work on developing resolution standards, contingency planning, and building resolution capabilities to ensure Hong Kong maintains a credible resolution mechanism for banks.\n\n# Hong Kong’s Status as an International Financial Centre\n\nThe HKMA continued to promote the development of the fintech ecosystem, with increasing adoption of financial technology by banks and payment service providers. The Faster Payment System (FPS) saw an exponential increase in transaction volumes. The HKMA actively participated in cross-border cooperation in areas such as central bank digital currencies.\n\nHong Kong’s position as a global offshore RMB business hub remained strong, continuing to serve as the primary gateway into Mainland China. Financial linkages with the Mainland continued to tighten through world-class market infrastructure and connectivity mechanisms. Progress was also made within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area development.\n\nThe HKMA actively explored new opportunities to further enhance Hong Kong’s financial platform, including asset and wealth management, treasury centres, and increasing competitiveness in green and sustainable finance.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\nDespite the complex and volatile investment environment, the Exchange Fund achieved an investment income of HK$235.8 billion in 2020, with a return of 5.3%. All five major asset classes recorded positive returns.\n\nThe HKMA continued to promote responsible investment and asset diversification. Since commencing investments in 2009, the long-term internal rate of return for the diversified portfolio has averaged 13.7% annually.\n\n# Institutional Roles and Social Responsibility\n\nThroughout the year, the HKMA maintained effective communication channels with society and markets, enhancing public understanding of its policies and operations. The HKMA upheld high standards of corporate governance while supporting staff in enhancing their professional capabilities, strictly managing finances, and strengthening information technology and security to meet new challenges, initiatives, and increasing workloads.\n\nSimultaneously, the HKMA continued to dedicate itself to social responsibility, striving to be a responsible and sustainable institution. During the COVID-19 pandemic, special measures were introduced to ensure the continuity of essential functions while safeguarding staff health. The HKMA also launched various initiatives to support individuals and enterprises in need, alleviating the adverse effects caused by the pandemic."}

{"zh": "# 經濟及金融環境\n\n面對新冠病毒疫情，香港經濟在2020 年連續第二年收縮，並錄得歷年來最嚴重的跌幅。消費及旅遊相關行業尤其受到重創，其收縮幅度較整體經濟更大。與此同時，勞工市場急速惡化，通脹有所緩和。政府及金管局為應對嚴峻的經濟環境，推出歷來最大規模的紓困措施以支持經濟。新冠病毒疫苗接種可望使經濟活動回復正常，預期2021年經濟會恢復增長，然而經濟復甦的力度及步伐仍受疫情發展以及疫苗供應、覆蓋範圍和成效等眾多不明朗因素影響。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 實體經濟活動\n\n受新冠病毒疫情打擊，香港經濟在2020年收縮6.1%，是連續第二年收縮，亦是有紀錄以來最嚴重的年度跌幅（表1）。經濟活動急跌主要是本地需求急劇收縮所致（圖1）。疫情爆發及相應的社交距離措施令本地消費活動受到重創。由於營商環境轉差，整體投資支出亦明顯減少。對外方面，儘管疫情導致供應鏈受干擾及全球需求萎縮，但部分受惠於中國內地迅速恢復生產和經濟活動，全年合計香港貨物出口僅略為下降。相比之下，由於封城、關閉邊境及旅客流量限制令全球旅遊業陷入停頓，所以香港服務輸出嚴重受挫。本地及轉口帶動的需求疲弱，亦令貨物進口及服務輸入轉差。由於進口總額下跌步伐較出口快，淨出口（貿易順差）為本地生產總值帶來支持（圖1）。按經濟行業分析，消費及旅遊相關行業，例如零售、住宿及膳食服務業受到的打擊尤其嚴重，收縮情況較整體經濟更差，而金融業則溫和增長。\n\n表 1 按開支項目計的實質本地生產總值增長（比對上期）\n\n# 經濟及金融環境\n\n圖 1 組成部分對實質本地生產總值增長的貢獻\n\n政府為應對疫情，透過2020至21年度《財政預算案》迅速推出歷來最大規模的紓困措施，並從「防疫抗疫基金」發放4輪補助，合共超過3,000億港元。這些措施包括向合資格居民發放一筆過10,000港元現金、透過「保就業」計劃提供工資補貼，以及為受疫情重創的行業提供一筆過資助、寬減租金及豁免收費。金管局則採取三管齊下的方式支持銀行業，從而支撐實體經濟。有關措施包括與銀行業積極協調，減輕企業及家庭的資金周轉壓力，釋放緩衝以提高銀行的借貸能力，並確保銀行有足夠流動性支持本地經濟活動。\n\n# 通脹\n\n通脹壓力在2020年明顯減弱。剔除政府一次性紓困措施的影響，基本通脹率放緩至1.3%，是2009年全球金融危機以來最小的升幅。基本食品（尤其新鮮豬肉）的價格壓力明顯減退；而自行烹煮以外，由於飲食業提供大幅度折扣，所以外出用膳的價格在下半年亦有所下降。隨着早前新簽訂的私人住宅租金回落，消費物價指數租金項目的增長亦回軟（圖2）。更廣泛而言，由於名義工資增長減慢及商業樓宇租金偏軟，本地營商成本壓力減少；而在疲弱的全球經濟狀況下，進口價格通脹有所緩和。\n\n圖 2 基本消費物價通脹\n\n# 勞工市場\n\n勞工市場在2020年急速惡化。經季節性調整的失業率年內由3.3%飆升至6.6%，為16年的高位（圖3），其中零售、住宿及膳食服務等受疫情重創行業的失業率達到10%以上。就業不足率亦於8月升至3.8%，為沙士疫情後的高位。部分由於經濟狀況急速惡化造成的周期性反應，勞動人口參與率輕微減少。總就業人數（圖3）及私營機構職位空缺急跌，反映整體勞工需求進一步收縮。名義工資及收入增長進一步放緩。政府推出「保就業」計劃，為僱主提供有時限的財政支援以保留僱員，使勞工市場獲得一定程度的支持。\n\n圖 3 勞工市場狀況\n\n# 股市\n\n隨着新冠病毒疫情爆發，恒生指數在首季急跌至3年低位。繼各國中央銀行及政府推出大型支持措施後，股市在第2季及第3季略為回穩（圖4）。由於新冠病毒疫苗研發出現突破，股市於接近年底時重拾一些上升動力。恒生指數於年底收報27,231點，全年計錄得3.4%跌幅。受惠於內地企業在香港的第二上市活動，2020年本港首次公開招股集資總額約4,000億港元，以集資額計全球排名第二。\n\n圖 4 資產價格\n\n# 物業市場\n\n部分受到超低利率所支持，住宅物業市場在2020年大致平穩（圖4）。整體樓價及成交量較前一年均無大變動。然而，由於家庭住戶入息減少，置業負擔能力更為偏緊。另一方面，非住宅物業市場進一步轉弱，物業價格錄得不同程度跌幅，成交量亦見底。受經濟下滑及空置率上升的影響，寫字樓及零售物業租金大幅下跌。鑑於2019年以來非住宅物業市場已出現大幅調整，並預期會持續受壓，加上考慮到經濟基調及外圍環境等其他因素，金管局於8月調整非住宅物業的逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施。政府因應市場需求回落，亦於11月撤銷購置非住宅物業的雙倍從價印花稅這項需求管理措施。\n\n# 經濟前景\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n新冠病毒疫苗接種可望使經濟活動回復正常，預期香港經濟在2021年（全年合計）重拾正增長，然而經濟復甦的力度及步伐仍受疫情發展及疫苗供應、覆蓋範圍和成效等眾多不明朗因素影響。具體而言，疫苗廣泛接種需時，因此本地經濟在2021年早段仍面對相當程度的挑戰。對外方面，預計內地經濟會進一步增強，並為香港貨物及服務輸出帶來支持，然而其他主要經濟體的復甦步伐將取決於其大規模接種疫苗計劃的成效。政府預測2021年實質本地生產總值增長率介乎3.5至5.5%之間，與國際組織及私營機構分析員對香港最新的增長預測平均4.4%相符。\n\n# 通脹及勞工市場\n\n鑑於環球及本地經濟狀況仍具挑戰，預期2021年的通脹壓力將維持輕微。此外，早前新簽訂私人住宅租金回落的傳遞效應，將繼續令本地通脹受到抑制。市場共識預測2021年整體通脹率為1.5%，而政府預期整體及基本通脹率分別為1.6%及1%。由於經濟前景在2021年早段仍具挑戰，加上私營機構分析員預計2021年全年失業率仍會在約5.9%的偏高水平，因此短期內勞工市場將繼續受壓。\n\n# 銀行體系表現\n\n香港銀行體系在2020年保持穩健，銀行財務狀況良好。儘管新冠病毒疫情帶來挑戰，銀行資產負債表繼續擴大，存款資金增加。銀行體系資本及流動性狀況維持充裕，資產質素輕微轉差，但仍處穩健水平。\n\n# 資產負債表走勢\n\n2020年銀行體系資產負債表擴大5.7%。由於經濟下滑，年內貸款增長減慢至1.2%，相比2019年的增幅為6.7%；其中在香港使用的貸款增加2.2%，在香港境外使用的貸款微增0.1%，貿易融資減少6.2%。2020年中國內地相關貸款微跌0.2%，相比2019年錄得7.4%的增長。\n\n銀行資產負債表的負債方面，存款總額在2020年增加5.4%，相比2019年的增幅為2.9%。由於存款總額增長較貸款總額快，整體貸存比率由2019年底的75.3% 降至 2020 年底的 72.3%（圖 5）。\n\n圖 5 銀行體系的貸款及存款\n\n# 資本充足水平\n\n2020年銀行體系資本狀況維持穩健，為抵禦潛在衝擊提供強大的緩衝。2020年底本地註冊認可機構的綜合總資本比率與2019年底相比維持穩定，為20.7%。一級資本比率於同期由18.5%微升至18.7%（圖 6）。\n\n2020年底《巴塞爾協定三》槓桿比率與2019年底相比維持穩定，仍為8.2%，遠高於3%的法定最低要求（圖 7）。\n\n圖 6 本地註冊認可機構的綜合資本比率\n\n圖 7 本地註冊認可機構的綜合槓桿比率\n\n# 流動性狀況\n\n銀行體系的流動性狀況維持穩健，有能力抵禦受壓時的流動性衝擊。第1類機構的季度平均流動性覆蓋比率在第4季為155.1%，遠高於100%的法定最低要求。第2類機構的季度平均流動性維持比率為57.9%，亦遠高於25%的法定最低要求（圖 8）。\n\n圖 8 指定認可機構的流動性比率\n\n銀行體系的資金來源維持穩定。於2020年底，第1類機構的穩定資金淨額比率為138.6%，遠高於100%的法定最低要求。第2A類機構的核心資金比率為139.5%，亦遠高於75%的法定最低要求（圖 9）。\n\n圖 9 指定認可機構的資金比率\n\n# 資產質素\n\n新冠病毒疫情影響下，年內銀行體系資產質素略為下降，但以歷史及國際標準計仍然維持良好。特定分類貸款比率由2019年底的0.57%上升至2020年底的0.90%，逾期及經重組貸款比率於同期由0.34%上升至0.57%（圖10）。中國內地相關貸款的特定分類貸款比率由 2019 年底的 0.75% 上升至 2020 年底的 0.96%。住宅按揭貸款及信用卡貸款的拖欠比率仍然處於低位，分別為0.04%及0.27%（圖11）。\n\n圖 10 銀行體系的資產質素\n\n圖 11 住宅按揭貸款及信用卡貸款的拖欠比率\n\n# 盈利走勢\n\n低息環境加上資產質素略為下降，令銀行體系盈利受壓。零售銀行的整體除稅前經營溢利在2020年下降29.4%（圖12），主要是淨利息收入減少（-21.9%）及貸款減值撥備增加（+61.3%）所致。淨息差由2019年的1.63% 收窄至 2020 年的 1.18%（圖 13）。\n\n由於收入減少，零售銀行的成本與收入比率由2019年的39.5%，上升至2020年的46.8%（圖 14）。\n\n圖 12 零售銀行的表現\n\n圖 13 零售銀行淨息差\n\n圖 14 零售銀行成本與收入比率\n", "en": "# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Hong Kong's economy contracted for the second consecutive year in 2020, recording the most severe decline on record. Consumption and tourism-related industries were especially hit hard, with contraction magnitudes exceeding the overall economy. Meanwhile, the labor market deteriorated rapidly, and inflationary pressures eased. The government and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) launched the largest-scale relief measures in history to support the economy. The rollout of COVID-19 vaccines is expected to enable a return to normal economic activity, with forecasts for 2021 projecting an economic recovery. However, the strength and pace of the recovery will remain uncertain, influenced by factors such as the pandemic situation, vaccine supply, coverage, and effectiveness.\n\n# Economic Review\n\n# Real Economy Activities\n\nStricken by the COVID-19 pandemic, Hong Kong's economy shrank by 6.1% in 2020, marking the second year of contraction and the worst annual decline on record (Table 1). The sharp decline in economic activity was mainly driven by a sudden drop in domestic demand (Figure 1). The outbreak and accompanying social distancing measures severely impacted local consumption activities. Due to deteriorating business environment, overall investment expenditures also decreased significantly. On the external front, despite disruptions to supply chains and a global demand slowdown, some benefits were derived from Mainland China’s swift recovery of production and economic activities, resulting in only a slight decline in Hong Kong's total merchandise exports for the year. In contrast, as city lockdowns, border closures, and restrictions on traveler flows caused a halt in global tourism, Hong Kong’s services exports were severely affected. Weakened demand driven by local and re-exports also led to declines in imports and services inputs. Since import total fell faster than exports, the trade surplus contributed to supporting the gross domestic product (GDP) (Figure 1). Industry-wise analysis indicates that consumption and tourism-related sectors, such as retail, accommodation, and catering services, were hit especially hard, with contractions worse than the overall economy, while the financial sector experienced moderate growth.\n\nTable 1 Real Hong Kong dollar GDP growth by expenditure component (compared to previous period)\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nFigure 1 Contributions of components to real GDP growth\n\nIn response to the pandemic, the government swiftly introduced the largest relief measures in history in the 2020–21 Budget, including four rounds of subsidies from the Anti-Epidemic Fund, totaling over HKD 300 billion. These measures included providing a one-off HKD 10,000 cash payout to eligible residents, wage subsidies through the “Employment Support Scheme,” as well as lump-sum grants, rent waivers, and fee waivers for severely affected industries. The HKMA adopted a three-pronged approach to support banks, thereby underpinning the real economy. Measures included active coordination with the banking sector to ease liquidity pressures on businesses and households, releasing buffers to enhance banks’ lending capacity, and ensuring sufficient liquidity to support local economic activities.\n\n# Inflation\n\nInflationary pressures significantly weakened in 2020. After excluding the impact of government one-off relief measures, the underlying inflation rate slowed to 1.3%, the smallest increase since the global financial crisis of 2009. Price pressures for staples, especially fresh pork, notably eased; outside home-cooked meals, consumer prices for dining out also declined in the second half of the year amid widespread discounts offered by eateries. With earlier private residential rents falling, the growth rate of rent components in the Consumer Price Index also softened (Figure 2). More broadly, nominal wage growth slowed, and commercial property rents remained subdued, reducing local business costs. Additionally, amid weak global economic conditions, import price inflation eased.\n\nFigure 2 Basic consumer price inflation\n\n# Labor Market\n\nThe labor market deteriorated sharply in 2020. Seasonally adjusted unemployment jumped from 3.3% to 6.6% within the year, reaching a 16-year high (Figure 3). Unemployment rates in sectors severely affected by the pandemic, such as retail, accommodation, and catering, exceeded 10%. Underemployment rose to 3.8% in August, the highest since the SARS outbreak. Partly due to rapid economic deterioration causing cyclical reactions, labor force participation slightly declined. Total employment (Figure 3) and vacancies in the private sector plunged, reflecting further contraction in overall labor demand. Nominal wages and income growth further slowed. The government’s “Employment Support Scheme” provided temporary financial assistance to employers for retaining workers, offering some support to the labor market.\n\nFigure 3 Labor Market Conditions\n\n# Stock Market\n\nFollowing the outbreak of COVID-19, the Hang Seng Index plummeted to a three-year low in the first quarter. After large-scale support measures by central banks and governments worldwide, the stock market stabilized somewhat in the second and third quarters (Figure 4). Anticipation of breakthroughs in COVID-19 vaccine development led to a partial rebound toward year-end. The Hang Seng Index closed at 27,231 points at year-end, recording an overall decline of 3.4%. Benefiting from mainland Chinese companies’ secondary listings in Hong Kong, the total fundraising from IPOs in Hong Kong reached about HKD 400 billion in 2020, ranking second globally in terms of fundraising amount.\n\nFigure 4 Asset Prices\n\n# Property Market\n\nSupported partly by ultra-low interest rates, the residential property market remained broadly stable in 2020 (Figure 4). Overall property prices and transaction volumes showed little change compared to the previous year. However, due to reduced income for households, affordability became more strained. Conversely, the non-residential property market further weakened, with property prices declining to varying degrees and transaction volumes bottoming out. Affected by economic slowdowns and rising vacancy rates, rents for office and retail properties plunged significantly. Given the large adjustments since 2019 and ongoing pressures, along with other factors such as economic outlook and external environment, the HKMA adjusted the countercyclical macroprudential measures for non-residential properties in August. In response to declining market demand, the government also rescinded the double stamp duty measure for non-residential property purchase in November.\n\n# Economic Outlook\n\n# Economic Environment\n\nThe widespread deployment of COVID-19 vaccines is expected to facilitate a return to normalcy in economic activity. Hong Kong’s economy is projected to resume positive growth in 2021 (full-year total), but the strength and pace of recovery will remain influenced by the pandemic’s evolution, vaccine supply, coverage, and effectiveness. Specifically, the widespread vaccination will take time, meaning the local economy will face significant challenges in early 2021. On the external front, Mainland China’s economy is expected to further strengthen, supporting Hong Kong’s merchandise and services exports. However, the recovery trajectories of other major economies depend on the success of their large-scale vaccination programs. The government forecasts real GDP growth between 3.5% and 5.5% in 2021, which aligns with the latest estimates by international organizations and private sector analysts, averaging around 4.4%.\n\n# Inflation and Labor Market\n\nGiven ongoing global and local economic challenges, inflationary pressures are expected to remain moderate in 2021. Moreover, the lagged effects of earlier private residential rent declines will continue to suppress inflation. Market consensus projects an overall inflation rate of about 1.5% in 2021, with the government estimating overall and core inflation at 1.6% and 1%, respectively. Due to the challenging outlook and analysts’ expectations that the unemployment rate will stay high at around 5.9%, the labor market is expected to remain under pressure short-term.\n\n# Banking System Performance\n\nHong Kong’s banking system remained resilient in 2020, with sound financial health. Despite challenges from the pandemic, banks’ balance sheets continued to expand with rising deposits. Capital and liquidity positions remain ample; asset quality has slightly deteriorated but is still at a robust level.\n\n# Asset and Liability Trends\n\nIn 2020, the banking sector’s balance sheets expanded by 5.7%. Loan growth slowed to 1.2%, compared with 6.7% in 2019. Mainland China-related loans declined slightly by 0.2% in 2020, after a 7.4% increase in 2019. Loans used domestically in Hong Kong increased by 2.2%, while offshore loans increased marginally by 0.1%, with trade financing decreasing by 6.2%. Regarding liabilities, total deposits rose by 5.4% in 2020, compared to a 2.9% increase in 2019. Since deposit growth outpaced loan growth, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio declined from 75.3% at the end of 2019 to 72.3% at year-end (Figure 5).\n\nFigure 5 Loans and Deposits of the Banking Sector\n\n# Capital Adequacy\n\nIn 2020, the capital positions of the banking sector remained solid, providing strong buffers against potential shocks. The combined capital adequacy ratio (CAR) for locally incorporated authorized institutions was steady at 20.7%, compared to the end of 2019. The Tier 1 capital ratio slightly increased from 18.5% to 18.7% during the same period (Figure 6).\n\nThe Basel III leverage ratio also remained stable at 8.2%, well above the statutory minimum of 3% (Figure 7).\n\nFigure 6 Capital Adequacy Ratio of Locally Registered Institutions\n\nFigure 7 Basel III Leverage Ratio of Locally Registered Institutions\n\n# Liquidity Conditions\n\nThe liquidity position of the banking sector remained resilient, capable of withstanding liquidity shocks. The average quarterly liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) of Category 1 institutions stood at 155.1% in Q4, well above the statutory minimum of 100%. Category 2 institutions maintained an average quarterly net stable funding ratio (NSFR) of 57.9%, also well above the minimum requirement of 25% (Figure 8).\n\nFigure 8 Liquidity Ratios of Designated Authorized Institutions\n\nFunding sources for the banking sector remained stable. At the end of 2020, the net stable funding ratio for Category 1 institutions was 138.6%, well above the 100% statutory minimum. The core funding ratio for Category 2A institutions was 139.5%, also significantly above the 75% minimum requirement (Figure 9).\n\nFigure 9 Funding Ratios of Designated Authorized Institutions\n\n# Asset Quality\n\nAmid the COVID-19 pandemic, asset quality of the banking sector slightly declined in 2020 but remained in good standing by both historical and international standards. The special mention loan ratio rose from 0.57% at the end of 2019 to 0.90% at year-end 2020, and overdue and restructured loan ratios increased from 0.34% to 0.57% during the same period (Figure 10). Mainland China-related loans' special mention ratio increased from 0.75% at the end of 2019 to 0.96% at year-end 2020. Delinquencies for residential mortgage loans and credit card loans remained low at 0.04% and 0.27%, respectively (Figure 11).\n\nFigure 10 Asset Quality of the Banking Sector\n\nFigure 11 Delinquency Ratios for Residential Mortgage and Credit Card Loans\n\n# Profitability Trend\n\nLow interest rates combined with slightly deteriorated asset quality have put pressure on the profitability of the banking sector. Retail banking’s pre-tax operating profit fell by 29.4% in 2020 (Figure 12), mainly due to a 21.9% decline in net interest income and a 61.3% increase in loan impairment charges. The net interest margin shrank from 1.63% in 2019 to 1.18% in 2020 (Figure 13).\n\nAs income decreased, the cost-to-income ratio for retail banks increased from 39.5% in 2019 to 46.8% in 2020 (Figure 14).\n\nFigure 12 Retail Banking Performance\n\nFigure 13 Retail Banking Net Interest Margin\n\nFigure 14 Retail Banking Cost-to-Income Ratio"}
{"zh": "# 貨幣穩定\n\n儘管新冠病毒疫情增加不確定因素，港元外匯及貨幣市場運作暢順有序。受到大量股票相關的資金流入所支持，港元匯率於2020 年內大部分時間偏強，而強方兌換保證多次被觸發。聯繫匯率制度是香港金融體系的基石，充分展現強大的抵禦衝擊的能力。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的主要目標是維持貨幣穩定，即確保港元匯價穩定，使港元在外匯市場兌美元的匯率保持在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的區間內。該貨幣體制主要採用貨幣發行局制度，規定由外匯基金所持的美元儲備向貨幣基礎提供最少百分之百的支持；貨幣基礎若有變動，美元儲備亦必須作出相應增減，與貨幣基礎的變動百分之百配合。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n- 負債證明書（為3間發鈔銀行發行的銀行紙幣提供十足支持）\n- 政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣\n- 設於金管局的結算戶口結餘總額（即總結餘）\n- 金管局代表政府發行的外匯基金票據及債券。\n\n表 1 貨幣基礎\n\n金管局透過自動利率調節機制及履行兌換保證的堅決承諾來維持港元匯率的穩定。當強方（或弱方）兌換保證被觸發，金管局會應銀行要求，按每美元兌7.75港元向銀行沽出港元、買入美元（或按7.85港元買入港元、沽出美元），使總結餘增加（或減少），令港元利率下跌（或上升），從而促使港元匯率回復到7.75至7.85 的兌換範圍。\n\n# 2020年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n隨着3月全球爆發新冠病毒疫情，避險情緒下環球投資者增持美元，令美元資金狀況明顯收緊。在聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）下，由於港元利率受同期美元利率影響，美元流動性緊張令香港貨幣狀況收緊。儘管其後美國聯邦儲備局實施流動資金計劃，美元資金壓力有所紓緩，但由於股票相關需求及季結效應，令香港貨幣狀況仍維持偏緊。而港元需求殷切，加上港元與美元的正息差刺激套息交易活動，促使港元匯率偏向強方兌換保證匯率（圖1），強方兌換保證最終於4月被觸發。其後新股集資活動暢旺，以及「滬港通」與「深港通」下的南向資金帶動股票相關資金流入，令港元一直維持接近7.75水平，並導致強方兌換保證在2020年內多次被觸發。強方兌換保證在4月21日至10月28日期間合共被觸發85次，累計資金流入3,835億港元。整體而言，港元外匯市場在2020年全年運作正常。\n\n圖 1 2020年市場匯率\n\n總結餘（進行貼現窗活動前）與未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額由2019年底的11,330億港元，增加至2020年底的15,266億港元（圖2）。隨着強方兌換保證被觸發，金管局應銀行要求合共沽出3,835億港元。新冠病毒疫情引致環球宏觀環境波動，金管局為了提供額外港元流動性，亦於4月底及5月初逐步減發總計200億港元外匯基金票據。由於強方兌換保證被觸發及外匯基金票據發行量減少，總結餘（進行貼現窗活動前）由2019年底的543億港元，增加至2020年底的4,575億港元。年內未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額由10,787億港元，稍降至10,692億港元，反映外匯基金票據發行量減少，這抵銷了按一貫做法以新發行的外匯基金票據及債券來吸納未償還外匯基金票據及債券的利息。整體貨幣基礎仍然由外匯儲備提供十足支持。\n\n圖 2 2020年總結餘（進行貼現窗活動前）及未償還外匯基金票據及債券\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n隨着農曆新年假期後流動性需求減退，香港銀行同業拆息在2月普遍下降（圖3）。踏入3月，由於美元資金壓力，連同新股集資相關及季結資金需求等本地因素，香港銀行同業拆息一度上升。其後由於強方兌換保證被觸發及外匯基金票據發行量減少，令總結餘增加，港元流動性狀況逐步紓緩。\n\n因應美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍於3月兩度下調，以及反映年內隔夜與1個月香港銀行同業拆息變動，基本利率由年初的2.73厘下降至年底收報0.50厘。在零售層面，儘管美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍調低，銀行仍維持最優惠貸款利率不變。整體而言，香港貨幣市場繼續正常運作。貼現窗借貸由2019年的383億港元降至2020年的91億港元。\n\n圖 3 2020 年香港銀行同業拆息\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n過去30多年來，聯匯制度一直是香港金融體系的重要支柱，歷經考驗均能展現強大的抵禦衝擊的能力。儘管2020年面對挑戰，港元外匯及貨幣市場保持正常運作，一再證明聯匯制度穩健有效。年內面對一些毫無根據的謠言，質疑聯匯制度以至香港的金融穩定，金管局迅速向公眾重申香港會繼續實施聯匯制度，同時資金自由流動及港幣自由兌換受到《基本法》第112條保障。金管局另又發表多篇文章，闡明逆境下香港金融體系繼續展現強大抵禦衝擊能力的事實。政府亦堅決維持聯匯制度。香港的金融市場有序運作，以及港元繼續如常作為支付及保值貨幣，反映上述措施有效維持公眾對聯匯制度的信心。國際貨幣基金組織在《2020年對外部門報告》重申香港擁有具透明度的規則、充裕的財政及外匯儲備、穩健的金融規管與監管、靈活的經濟，以及審慎的財政架構，確保聯匯制度具公信力。\n\n穩健的銀行體系對聯匯制度的正常運作具關鍵作用。儘管新冠病毒疫情構成負面影響，香港銀行體系繼續運作暢順，流動性及資本水平以國際標準而言均非常充裕。為確保銀行體系具備承受衝擊的能力，金管局一直密切監察銀行的信用、流動性及利率風險管理，以及壓力測試結果，並維持對銀行貸款的監管。與此同時，金管局亦為銀行體系提供更多流動性，維持貨幣及金融穩定。除減發外匯基金票據以增加港元流動性外，金管局為銀行設立一系列流動資金安排。此外，金管局與銀行保持聯繫，確保它們在緊張情況時利用這些流動資金安排。因應新冠病毒疫情為環球金融市場帶來波動及不確定因素，金管局推出臨時性美元流動資金安排，為持牌銀行提供美元流動性支援，有助紓緩環球美元銀行拆借市場流動性緊絀的情況。\n\n為提高貨幣發行局帳目的透明度，自1998年10月起，外匯基金已有部分資產被指定用作支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（即支持資產相對貨幣基礎的比率）於2020年在109.8至112.1%之間上落，並無觸及上限或下限。該比率於12月31日收報109.9%（圖4）。在聯匯制度下，雖然已指定某些外匯基金資產作為支持組合，但外匯基金的全部資產均可用作支持港元匯率。外匯基金的龐大財政資源，加上香港穩健的銀行體系，為保障香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供強而有力的後盾。\n\n圖 4 2020年支持比率每日變動\n\n# 其他事務\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的貨幣發行委員會負責監察及探討與香港貨幣及金融穩定有關的課題。在2020年，貨幣發行委員會探討的課題包括香港經濟的情景分析、香港物業市場的評估、了解跨境資金流的概念架構，以及了解香港銀行同業市場。貨幣發行委員會會議紀錄及金管局向其呈交的貨幣發行局制度運作報告，均載於金管局網站。\n\n# 貨幣研究\n\n疫情持續下，香港貨幣及金融研究中心（研究中心）在2020年仍能維持一定數量的研究成果。在2020年，研究中心合共發表20篇研究論文，涵蓋貨幣政策、銀行體系穩定、市場微觀結構和金融科技發展等廣泛議題，部份論文已獲接納或正被評審在專業期刊中刊登。在疫情下由於要實施社交距離及旅遊限制，研究中心舉辦的研討會、講座及到訪研究計劃等主要活動需要押後，待日後公共衛生和旅遊條件回復正常後，研究中心將會復辦上述活動。\n\n# 紙幣及硬幣\n\n截至2020年底，流通銀行紙幣（指發鈔銀行發行的紙幣）總值5,595億港元，較上年增加8.3%（圖5、6及7）。政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣總值127億港元，較上年減少0.6%（圖8及9）。在政府發行的紙幣及硬幣中，10港元流通紙幣總值46億港元，其中塑質鈔票佔79%。\n\n圖 5 2020年底按發鈔銀行分析的銀行紙幣流通金額\n\n圖 6 2020年底流通銀行紙幣分布情況\n\n圖 7 2020 年底銀行紙幣流通金額\n\n圖 8 2020年底政府發行紙幣及硬幣流通金額\n\n圖 9 2020年底政府發行流通紙幣及硬幣分析\n\n# 香港鈔票\n\n繼於2020年1月推出20港元及50港元面額新鈔，2018年新鈔系列所有5款面額鈔票已在市面流通。該系列鈔票具備更強固及應用方便的防偽特徵，廣受市民歡迎，並逐漸取代舊版鈔票。\n\n年內金管局繼續舉辦講座，介紹香港鈔票的設計及防偽特徵。金管局舉辦8場講座(包括網上形式)，增進公眾對香港鈔票的認識，吸引2,000多名人士參加，包括銀行櫃位職員、商戶及學生等。\n\n# 硬幣收集計劃\n\n硬幣收集計劃於2014年10月推出，年內繼續廣受大眾歡迎。這是全球首個有系統的流動硬幣收集計劃，設有兩部收銀車輪流停駐全港18區。每部收銀車均裝設兩部高速硬幣點算機，市民可選擇將硬幣轉換成鈔票或用作八達通卡或電子錢包等儲值支付工具增值，亦可將款項放入車內的公益金捐款箱。此外，金管局與香港社會服務聯會合作，在非政府組織賣旗日派出收銀車收集硬幣。收銀車亦到訪學校，增進學生對硬幣收集計劃的認識。過去多年硬幣收集計劃曾獲頒多個本港及國際獎項，對其創新及環保的處理方法予以肯定。\n", "en": "# Currency Stability\n\nDespite the increased uncertainties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Hong Kong dollar foreign exchange and currency markets operated smoothly and in an orderly manner. Supported by substantial capital inflows related to stocks, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained relatively strong for most of 2020, with the strong-side Convertibility Undertaking triggered multiple times. The Linked Exchange Rate System is the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s financial system, demonstrating strong resilience and ability to withstand shocks.\n\n# Objectives\n\nHong Kong's monetary policy’s main goal is to maintain currency stability, ensuring that the HK dollar exchange rate remains stable against the US dollar, within a range of 7.75 to 7.85 HKD per 1 USD. The currency regime primarily adopts the issuer system, stipulating that at least 100% of the monetary base is supported by US dollar reserves held by the Exchange Fund; any changes in the monetary base must be fully matched by corresponding adjustments in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe monetary base (Table 1) includes:\n- Certificates of Indebtedness (fully backing banknotes issued by three note-issuing banks)\n- Circulating banknotes and coins issued by the government\n- Total balances in the Clearing House Account (i.e., total reserves)\n- Foreign Exchange Fund notes and bonds issued by the Exchange Fund on behalf of the government.\n\nTable 1 Monetary Base\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority maintains exchange rate stability through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and a firm commitment to uphold the convertibility guarantee. When the strong-side (or weak-side) guarantee is triggered, the HKMA will, at banks’ request, sell HK dollars and buy US dollars at 7.75 HKD per USD (or buy HK dollars and sell USD at 7.85 HKD per USD), causing the total reserves to increase (or decrease), which in turn lowers (or raises) the Hong Kong dollar interest rate and helps to restore the exchange rate to within the 7.75 to 7.85 range.\n\n# 2020 Review\n\n# Exchange Rate Stability\n\nAs the COVID-19 outbreak spread globally in March, risk aversion led investors to buy more US dollars, tightening global dollar liquidity. Under the linked exchange rate system (Currency Board), since HK dollar interest rates are influenced by US dollar rates, the tightening of US dollar liquidity caused HK monetary conditions to tighten. Although the Federal Reserve later implemented liquidity programs, easing dollar pressures, due to stock-related demand and quarter-end effects, HK monetary conditions remained somewhat tight. The strong demand for HK dollars, coupled with the positive interest differential with the USD that encouraged carry trade, caused the HK dollar to be increasingly biased towards the strong-side convertibility rate (see Figure 1), with the strong-side convertibility guarantee being triggered multiple times, most notably in April. Subsequently, thriving new share offerings and inbound capital flows via the Shanghai-Hong Kong and Shenzhen-Hong Kong Connect programs maintained the HK dollar close to 7.75, leading to frequent activation of the strong-side guarantee in 2020. Between April 21 and October 28, the guarantee was triggered a total of 85 times, with net capital inflows totaling HK$ 385.3 billion. Overall, the foreign exchange market operated normally throughout 2020.\n\nFigure 1. Market Exchange Rate in 2020\n\nThe total reserves (before discount window operations) and the amount of outstanding Exchange Fund notes and bonds increased from HK$ 1,133 billion at the end of 2019 to HK$ 1,526.6 billion at the end of 2020 (see Figure 2). Following the activation of the strong-side guarantee, the HKMA sold HK$ 385.5 billion at banks’ request. To provide additional liquidity amid global macroeconomic volatility caused by COVID-19, the HKMA also gradually reduced HK$ 20 billion in Exchange Fund notes at the end of April and early May. Due to the triggering of the strong-side guarantee and reduced issuance of Exchange Fund notes, total reserves (before discount window operations) increased from HK$ 54.3 billion at the end of 2019 to HK$ 457.5 billion at the end of 2020. The total amount of outstanding Exchange Fund notes and bonds slightly decreased from HK$ 1,078.7 billion to HK$ 1,069.2 billion within the year, reflecting decreased issuance of Exchange Fund securities offsetting interest payments on outstanding securities, thus ensuring that the overall monetary base remains fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\nFigure 2. Total Reserves (before discount window operations) and Outstanding Exchange Fund Notes and Bonds in 2020\n\n# Money Market\n\nAs liquidity needs declined after the Lunar New Year holiday, Hong Kong’s interbank offered rate (HIBOR) generally fell in February (see Figure 3). In March, due to US dollar liquidity pressures and local factors such as new share issuance and quarter-end demand, HIBOR rose temporarily. Subsequently, triggered guarantees and reduced issuance of Exchange Fund securities eased liquidity pressures, causing reserves to grow and HK dollar liquidity conditions to gradually ease.\n\nIn response to two cuts to the US federal funds rate target range in March, and reflecting the movement of HK interbank rates over the year, the baseline interest rate decreased from 2.73% at the beginning of the year to 0.50% at year-end. Despite the US rate cuts, commercial banks maintained their best lending rates unchanged. Overall, Hong Kong’s money market continued to operate smoothly. Discount window borrowings decreased from HK$ 38.3 billion in 2019 to HK$ 9.1 billion in 2020.\n\nFigure 3. HK Interbank Offered Rate in 2020\n\n# Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nFor over 30 years, the Linked Exchange Rate System has been an important pillar supporting Hong Kong’s financial stability, demonstrating its strong resilience through various tests. Despite challenges in 2020, the HK dollar and foreign exchange markets continued to operate normally, reaffirming the robustness and effectiveness of the system. During the year, amid unfounded rumors questioning the linked exchange rate and Hong Kong’s financial stability, the HKMA promptly reaffirmed the continuation of the system, emphasizing that capital flows freely and the HK dollar’s convertibility are protected under Article 112 of the Basic Law. The HKMA also published multiple articles explaining how Hong Kong’s financial system remains resilient in adversity. The government remains firmly committed to maintaining the linked exchange rate system. The orderly functioning of Hong Kong’s financial markets and the HK dollar’s continued role as a medium of exchange and store of value reflect the effectiveness of these measures in preserving confidence. The International Monetary Fund, in its 2020 External Sector Report, reaffirmed that Hong Kong's transparent rules, ample fiscal and foreign exchange reserves, prudent financial regulation and supervision, economic flexibility, and cautious fiscal architecture underpin the credibility of the linked exchange rate system.\n\nA robust banking system plays a key role in the smooth operation of the linked exchange rate system. Despite the negative impact of COVID-19, Hong Kong’s banking system continued to function effectively, with liquidity and capital levels well above international standards. To ensure banks' resilience, the HKMA closely monitors credit, liquidity, and interest rate risk management, as well as stress test outcomes, and maintains regulatory oversight of bank lending. Meanwhile, the HKMA also provided additional liquidity to ease market pressures and maintain monetary and financial stability. Apart from reducing the issuance of Exchange Fund notes to inject HK dollars, the HKMA established a series of liquidity arrangements with banks. It maintains close communication with banks to ensure they utilize these facilities during stressful times. In response to global market volatility, the HKMA launched temporary US dollar liquidity facilities to support licensed banks’ dollar funding, helping to alleviate dollar liquidity shortages in the global banking market.\n\nTo enhance transparency of the issuer’s accounting, since October 1998, part of the Exchange Fund’s assets have been designated to support the monetary base. The support ratio (assets supporting the monetary base relative to the monetary base) fluctuated between 109.8% and 112.1% in 2020, with no breach of upper or lower limits. The ratio closed at 109.9% on December 31 (see Figure 4). Under the linked exchange rate system, although certain assets of the Exchange Fund are designated as part of the support portfolio, all assets are available to support the HK dollar exchange rate. The large fiscal reserves of the Exchange Fund, combined with Hong Kong’s resilient banking system, provide a strong backing for maintaining the stability of the currency and financial system.\n\nFigure 4. Daily Fluctuations of the Support Ratio in 2020\n\n# Other Matters\n\nThe Currency Issuance Committee, under the Foreign Reserves Advisory Committee, is responsible for monitoring and discussing issues related to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. In 2020, topics included scenario analyses of Hong Kong’s economy, assessments of the property market, conceptual frameworks for cross-border capital flows, and understanding the local interbank market. Minutes of the committee meetings and the HKMA’s reports on the operation of the monetary authority’s system are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Currency Research\n\nDespite ongoing pandemic challenges, the Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (the Research Center) maintained a steady output of research in 2020. A total of 20 research papers were published, covering topics such as monetary policy, banking system stability, market microstructure, and financial technology developments. Some papers have been accepted or are under review for publication in professional journals. Due to social distancing and travel restrictions, seminars, lectures, and research visits organized by the Research Center were postponed. Once health and travel conditions normalize, these activities will resume.\n\n# Banknotes and Coins\n\nBy the end of 2020, the total value of circulating banknotes issued by banks amounted to HK$ 559.5 billion, an increase of 8.3% from the previous year (see Figures 5, 6, and 7). The total value of government-issued circulating banknotes and coins was HK$ 12.7 billion, a slight decrease of 0.6% from the previous year (see Figures 8 and 9). Among government-issued banknotes and coins, the HK$ 10 note accounted for HK$ 4.6 billion, with polymer notes constituting 79%.\n\nFigure 5. Distribution of Banknotes in Circulation by Issuer as at End of 2020\n\nFigure 6. Distribution of Circulating Banknotes in 2020\n\nFigure 7. Total Banknotes in Circulation at End of 2020\n\nFigure 8. Value of Government-Issued Banknotes and Coins in Circulation at End of 2020\n\nFigure 9. Analysis of Government-Issued Circulating Banknotes and Coins at End of 2020\n\n# Hong Kong Banknotes\n\nFollowing the issuance of new HK$ 20 and HK$ 50 banknotes in January 2020, all five denominations of the new banknote series introduced in 2018 have been in circulation. This series features enhanced anti-counterfeiting measures, strengthened durability, and greater convenience, widely welcomed by the public and gradually replacing the older series.\n\nThroughout the year, the HKMA continued to hold seminars introducing the design and security features of Hong Kong’s banknotes. A total of eight sessions, including online formats, were held to increase public awareness, attracting over 2,000 participants, including bank staff, merchants, and students.\n\n# Coin Collection Program\n\nLaunched in October 2014, the coin collection program continued to be popular among the public throughout 2020. It is the world’s first systematic circulation coin collection initiative, featuring two mobile cash-in-hand vehicles rotating through all 18 districts of Hong Kong. Each vehicle is equipped with two high-speed coin counters, allowing citizens to convert coins into banknotes or load funds onto Octopus cards or electronic wallets. Contributions can also be placed into donation boxes inside the vehicles, supporting charitable causes. \n\nAdditionally, in partnership with the Hong Kong Council of Social Service, the HKMA deployed cash-in-hand vehicles during the NGO’s Flag Day to collect coins.

{"zh": "# 銀行體系穩定\n\n儘管新冠病毒疫情爆發為經濟帶來重大挑戰，香港銀行體系於2020年維持穩健。年內金管局除密切留意疫情對銀行營運及監管活動的影響並靈活應變外，繼續將監管重點放在認可機構的信用及流動性風險管理上。鑑於網絡威脅持續增加及銀行業使用金融科技的上升趨勢，金管局加強對認可機構科技風險管理及運作穩健性的監管。金管局亦與銀行及國際組織緊密合作，促進業界過渡至備用參考利率。\n\n在操守監管方面，金管局給予認可機構在遵守監管規定上彈性處理的空間以及提供指引，以便一方面協助銀行在疫情下的業務運作及繼續為客戶提供服務，另一方面則繼續確保投資者及消費者得到保障。金管局聯同有關當局制定「跨境理財通」業務試點的建議實施細則，並諮詢業界。金管局與證券及期貨事務監察委員會合作，就精簡有關家族辦公室及擁有高資產淨值並精於財務事宜的投資者的銷售程序提供指引。此外，金管局加強對數碼金融服務消費者的保障，並繼續推動以客為本的企業文化。\n\n在打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集方面，金管局迅速採取行動，不但釐清風險為本方法及科技如何協助認可機構更有效應對與新冠病毒疫情相關的情況，並同時審慎應對持續升溫的地緣政治緊張局勢對銀行體系造成的影響。金管局繼續支持有關提升打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集工作的成效與效率的措施，包括增加參與公私營夥伴共享訊息的認可機構數目，以及支持銀行業採用合規科技。金管局又順應科技及數據運用的國際發展趨勢，展開進一步加強打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集監察能力的計劃。\n\n與此同時，金管局與銀行業緊密合作，優化監管政策與程序，以及推行提升人才專業能力的措施。香港在實施國際監管標準方面取得理想進展，包括資本充足標準和披露標準。在促進綠色及可持續銀行業的發展方面，金管局已進入三個階段中的第二階段，正制定相關監管規定。金管局亦繼續致力確保香港備有具公信力的認可機構處置機制，包括制定新處置標準及實施吸收虧損能力規定的規則，以提升認可機構的處置可行性。\n\n# 目標\n\n金管局的整體目標之一是促進銀行體系的安全及穩定。要達致這個目標，實有賴建立及維持具高度應對能力且能為香港經濟提供所需關鍵金融服務的金融體系。\n\n銀行可能因營運方式，甚或在極端情況下因失序地倒閉而影響銀行體系的穩定。作為監管當局，金融管理專員在保障金融穩定方面擔當重要角色，確保銀行有能力抵禦衝擊、應對危機及自危機中恢復常態，以最終有助防止出現倒閉。金融管理專員負責對銀行進行審慎監管，以及認可香港的持牌銀行、有限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司（統稱「認可機構」）。金融管理專員亦負責某些金融市場基建的指定及監管。\n\n然而，金融管理專員不能確保金融體系全無風險，香港的審慎監管制度亦並非為確保「零風險」而設。作為其中一個處置機制當局，金融管理專員力求確保一旦有認可機構不再可持續經營，能有秩序地處理其倒閉。為此，香港已設立金融機構處置機制，金融管理專員在該機制下為認可機構（以及其他類型機構）的處置機制當局。為落實香港的處置機制，必須制定處置規則及政策標準、進行處置規劃以排除認可機構處置可行性的障礙，以及建立金管局處置瀕臨倒閉認可機構的運作能力。為有效執行上述工作，金管局採納與國際一致及協調的方法。\n\n# 2020年回顧\n\n# 監管工作概覽\n\n金管局在2020年共進行186次非現場審查，涵蓋範圍甚廣，包括認可機構的CAMEL評估、企業管治、風險管理及金融科技策略。為繼續加強認可機構的風險管治水平，金管局與認可機構董事局、獨立非執行董事或董事局轄下委員會共舉行30次會議，並與認可機構及其外聘核數師共舉行30次三方聯席會議。\n\n除了非現場審查工作外，金管局亦進行定期現場審查，並以專題評估作為配合，以審視被評估屬較高風險的範疇。金管局於年內共進行610次現場審查及專題評估，並繼續以信用風險管理作為審查及評估的主要重點之一。另一個重點是在新冠病毒疫情下的業務操作風險及科技風險管理。此外，金管局又增加針對流動性及市場風險管理的現場審查及專題評估次數。同時，專項審查小組亦對認可機構的證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（強積金）相關業務進行現場審查及專題評估。\n\n儘管面對疫情，金管局維持監管力度，並作出彈性安排，靈活有效地履行監管職責，包括在提交申報表及進行現場審查方面給予彈性處理的空間；加強數據收集以補足現場審查，以及利用網上會議平台。\n\n表1載有金管局於2020年的監管工作概要。\n\n表 1 監管工作概要\n\n# 信用風險的監管\n\n# 信貸增長及資產質素\n\n2020年貸款總額增加1.2%，2019年的增幅為6.7%。表2列載各類貸款及墊款的增長情況。\n\n表 2 貸款及墊款的增長\n\n於2020年，內地相關貸款總額略為減少0.2%至45,530億港元（表3）。\n\n表 3 內地相關貸款增長\n\n受到新冠病毒疫情影響，認可機構的資產質素略為轉差。年內銀行業的特定分類貸款比率由0.57%上升至0.90%，仍維持在穩健水平，遠低於2000年以來的長期平均水平1.8%。內地相關貸款方面，相關比率亦由一年前的0.75%上升至0.96%。\n\n鑑於與新冠病毒疫情相關的不明朗因素為經濟帶來重大挑戰，金管局深入檢視認可機構資產質素，以評估資產質素轉差的趨勢。尤其金管局透過收集有關銀行在行業及借款人層面的信用風險承擔數據，加強對大額借款人及在目前的經濟環境下較易受影響行業的監察。金管局進行的特別壓力測試分析顯示，銀行有能力抵禦新冠病毒疫情帶來的經濟壓力。\n\n年內金管局進行專題評估，檢視認可機構對內地相關貸款、同業貸款，以及對私人銀行及財富管理客戶的有抵押貸款等不同範疇的信用風險管理方法。\n\n# 紓緩客戶資金周轉壓力的措施\n\n因應新冠病毒疫情爆發，金管局於2019年10月成立的銀行業中小企貸款協調機制（協調機制）推出多輪協助企業及個人客戶的紓緩措施，鼓勵銀行在審慎風險管理原則容許下繼續支持借款人的融資需要。其中最主要的是協調機制於5月推出的「預先批核還息不還本」計劃。計劃下合資格的企業客戶的所有貸款本金還款可延期6個月。該計劃在11月延長6個月後，在2021年3月再度延長6個月至10月底。該計劃約有100間銀行參與，覆蓋12萬合資格企業客戶。截至12月底，銀行共批出58,000多宗企業客戶貸款展期及其他支援措施的個案，涉及金額超過7,400億港元。個人客戶方面，銀行亦推出住宅按揭「還息不還本」計劃，「居者有其屋計劃」下資助房屋的相關按揭亦涵蓋在內。此外，銀行亦提供應急貸款予從事受疫情嚴重打擊行業的客戶、延長個人貸款期限，以及下調各種個人信貸的收費。截至12月底，銀行共批出28,000多宗住宅按揭「還息不還本」及其他個人應急貸款的個案，涉及金額超過440億港元。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n金管局自2009年起先後推出多輪逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施，已經加強銀行的風險管理及香港銀行體系應對本港樓市一旦突然逆轉的抵禦能力。新批出住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數於2020年12月為57%，而有關按揭成數於2009年9月推出首輪逆周期措施前為64%。2020年新批出住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數有所上升，主要由於當中涉及按揭保險的貸款的佔比有所增加，而這類貸款的按揭成數一般較高。新批出按揭的平均供款與入息比率亦維持在低水平，於12月為37%，而在2010年8月首度推出有關比率上限時為41%（圖1）。\n\n考慮到非住宅物業的價格走勢與交投量、經濟基調及外圍環境等因素，金管局在8月放寬非住宅物業按揭貸款的逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施，將這類貸款的適用按揭成數上限上調10個百分點，一般個案的上限由四成上調至五成。\n\n圖 1 新批出住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數及供款與入息比率\n\n# 業務操作及科技風險的監管\n\n因應2020年初爆發新冠病毒疫情，金管局採取連串措施減低疫情對銀行業務運作的影響。有關措施包括要求認可機構檢討其持續業務運作計劃，並採取適當的預防措施，以保障員工與客戶的健康，以及維持重要銀行服務。此外，金管局提醒認可機構加強與員工及客戶的溝通，就其處所可能出現確診個案的情況作好準備，以及制定應對較為嚴峻但可能發生的風險情境的持續業務運作計劃。金管局與業界保持緊密聯繫，又要求認可機構保持警覺，並因應疫情的最新發展及政府的社交距離措施，不時審視其持續業務運作計劃。\n\n金管局完成對「網絡防衛計劃」的全面檢討及廣泛的業界諮詢後，於11月推出「網絡防衛計劃2.0」，因應海外網絡風險管理的最新做法，進一步提升「網絡防衛計劃」。當中「網絡防衛評估框架」加入了有關網絡事故應對及恢復的最新國際穩健做法。「網絡防衛計劃」下的「專業培訓計劃」方面，資歷認證清單的範圍有所擴大，納入主要海外地區的同等資歷。金管局又向香港銀行公會（銀行公會）提出多項建議，令「網絡風險資訊共享平台」更易於使用。「網絡防衛計劃2.0」於2021年1月1日生效。\n\n# 智慧銀行\n\n經過在「金融科技監管沙盒」進行嚴謹的測試與試行後，所有在2019年獲發銀行牌照的8間虛擬銀行都已經於年內開業。虛擬銀行運用創新科技，提供全新的客戶體驗，例如利用大數據分析進行中小企貸款的信貸評估，以加快貸款批核程序。為加強客戶參與及建立客戶對品牌的忠誠，部分虛擬銀行更在其定期存款及獎賞計劃等服務中加入遊戲元素。\n\n# 流動性及市場風險的監管\n\n金管局在4月推出一系列措施，確保銀行同業市場及銀行體系在疫情下繼續暢順運作。這些措施包括釐清「金管局流動資金安排」的操作細則及推出臨時美元流動資金安排，並重申在監管架構下認可機構可使用流動性緩衝的彈性。金管局又與認可機構進行演習，確保認可機構已經作好準備，能夠在有需要時運用這些措施。\n", "en": "# Stability of the Banking System\n\nDespite the significant challenges posed to the economy by the COVID-19 pandemic, Hong Kong's banking system remained resilient in 2020. During the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) closely monitored the impact of the pandemic on bank operations and regulatory activities and responded flexibly. It continued to focus its regulation on credit and liquidity risk management of recognized institutions. Given the ongoing increase in cyber threats and the rising trend of financial technology (fintech) usage in the banking industry, the HKMA strengthened its supervision of technological risk management and operational resilience of recognized institutions. The HKMA also collaborated closely with banks and international organizations to facilitate the industry’s transition towards alternative reference rates.\n\nIn terms of conduct regulation, the HKMA provided recognized institutions with a degree of flexibility and guidance in complying with regulatory requirements, helping banks to continue their business operations and serve customers during the pandemic while ensuring investor and consumer protection. The HKMA, together with relevant authorities, formulated draft implementation details for the cross-boundary wealth management pilot scheme and consulted industry. It cooperated with the Securities and Futures Commission to provide guidance on streamlined sales procedures for family offices and high-net-worth investors with sophisticated financial affairs. Additionally, the HKMA enhanced protections for digital financial services consumers and continued to promote a customer-centric corporate culture.\n\nRegarding anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing efforts, the HKMA promptly implemented actions, clarifying the risk-based approach and how technology can assist recognized institutions more effectively respond to pandemic-related situations, while prudently addressing the impact of rising geopolitical tensions on the banking system. The HKMA continued to support measures to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing activities, including increasing the number of recognized institutions participating in public-private information sharing and supporting the adoption of regtech by banks. Following international developments in technology and data utilization, the HKMA launched further plans to strengthen its monitoring capabilities against anti-money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\nMeanwhile, the HKMA worked closely with the banking sector to optimize regulatory policies and procedures and promoted measures to enhance talents’ professional capabilities. Hong Kong made good progress in implementing international regulatory standards, including capital adequacy and disclosure standards. In advancing green and sustainable banking, the HKMA entered the second stage of its three-phase plan and is developing relevant regulatory regulations. It remains committed to ensuring a credible recognized institution disposition mechanism in Hong Kong, including formulating new disposition standards and rules to strengthen the feasibility of resolution for recognized institutions.\n\n# Goals\n\nOne of the HKMA’s overarching goals is to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this depends on establishing and maintaining a highly resilient financial system capable of providing the necessary critical financial services for Hong Kong’s economy.\n\nBanks may influence the stability of the banking system due to their operating models or, in extreme cases, collapse in a disorderly manner. As a regulator, the Financial Secretary plays a vital role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring banks are capable of resisting shocks, responding to crises, and recovering from them, ultimately helping prevent bank failures. The Financial Secretary is responsible for prudential supervision of banks and for recognizing licensed banks, banks with restricted licenses, and deposit-taking companies (collectively referred to as “recognized institutions”). The Financial Secretary also oversees certain designated financial market infrastructure.\n\nHowever, the Financial Secretary cannot guarantee that the financial system is entirely risk-free, nor is Hong Kong’s prudential regulatory regime designed to ensure “zero risk.” As part of its resolution framework, the Financial Secretary endeavors to ensure that, if a recognized institution becomes insolvent, its failure can be managed in an orderly manner. To this end, Hong Kong has established a resolution regime for financial institutions, under which the Financial Secretary acts as the resolution authority for recognized institutions (and other types of institutions). Implementing Hong Kong’s resolution regime requires developing resolution rules and policy standards, conducting resolution planning to eliminate obstacles to the resolution of recognized institutions, and building operational capacity for the HKMA to manage failing recognized institutions. The HKMA adopts a coordinated approach aligned with international standards to effectively execute these functions.\n\n# Review of 2020\n\n# Overview of Regulatory Work\n\nIn 2020, the HKMA conducted a total of 186 off-site reviews, covering a broad range of areas including CAMEL assessments of recognized institutions, corporate governance, risk management, and fintech strategies. To enhance the risk governance of recognized institutions, the HKMA held 30 meetings with the boards of recognized institutions, independent non-executive directors, or committees under the boards, and 30 tripartite meetings with recognized institutions and their external auditors.\n\nIn addition to off-site reviews, the HKMA carried out regular on-site examinations and thematic assessments focusing on higher-risk areas. Throughout the year, the HKMA conducted 610 on-site reviews and assessments, with credit risk management remaining a key area of focus. Another emphasis was on operational risks and technological risks associated with the pandemic. The HKMA also increased the frequency of on-site reviews and assessments related to liquidity management and market risk management. Furthermore, a dedicated review team conducted onsite examinations and thematic assessments of recognized institutions’ securities, investment products, insurance, and MPF-related operations.\n\nDespite the pandemic, the HKMA maintained stringent regulatory oversight, applying flexible arrangements to perform oversight effectively. This included providing flexibility in submission of reports and on-site reviews, strengthening data collection to supplement onsite examinations, and utilizing online meeting platforms.\n\nTable 1 summarizes the HKMA’s regulatory activities in 2020.\n\nTable 1 - Summary of Regulatory Activities\n\n# Regulation of Credit Risks\n\n# Credit Growth and Asset Quality\n\nIn 2020, total loans increased by 1.2%, compared to a 6.7% rise in 2019. Table 2 lists the growth figures for various types of loans and advances.\n\nTable 2 - Growth of Loans and Advances\n\nAs of 2020, the total Mainland-related loans slightly decreased by 0.2% to HKD 4,553 billion (see Table 3).\n\nTable 3 - Mainland-related Loan Growth\n\nDue to the impact of COVID-19, asset quality of recognized institutions slightly deteriorated. The ratio of classified loans in the banking sector increased from 0.57% to 0.90% in 2020, remaining at a stable level well below the long-term average of 1.8% since 2000. For Mainland-related loans, the ratio rose from 0.75% to 0.96% over the same period.\n\nIn light of the significant economic challenges posed by the uncertainties related to COVID-19, the HKMA conducted a thorough review of recognized institutions’ asset quality to assess the trend of deterioration. This included collecting credit risk exposure data at industry and borrower levels, with particular focus on large borrowers and susceptible sectors under current economic conditions. Special stress testing analyses showed banks are capable of withstanding the economic pressures from COVID-19.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA conducted thematic assessments on recognized institutions’ credit risk management approaches for Mainland-related loans, interbank loans, and secured loans to private banking and wealth management clients in various categories.\n\n# Measures to Alleviate Customer Funding Pressures\n\nIn response to the outbreak of COVID-19, the HKMA launched multiple rounds of support measures through the Banking Sector SME Loan Coordination Mechanism (the Coordination Mechanism), established in October 2019, which encouraged banks to continue supporting borrowing needs within prudent risk management principles. The most notable was the “Pre-approval of interest-only payments without principal repayment” scheme introduced in May. Under this scheme, qualifying corporate clients could defer all principal repayment for six months. This scheme was extended by another six months in November, and then again until the end of October 2021. Approximately 100 banks participated, covering around 120,000 eligible corporate clients. By the end of December, over 58,000 cases of loan extensions and other support measures had been approved, involving over HKD 740 billion. For personal clients, banks introduced interest-only mortgage schemes, including those supporting homeownership programs, which covered relevant mortgage payments. Banks also offered emergency loans to clients in heavily impacted industries, extended personal loan tenures, and lowered charges on various personal loans. By the end of December, over 28,000 cases of interest-only mortgage and other emergency personal loans had been approved, amounting to more than HKD 44 billion.\n\n# Property Mortgage Lending\n\nSince 2009, the HKMA has implemented several rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures to strengthen banks’ risk management and resilience against sudden reversals in the local property market. The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio for new residential mortgages in December 2020 was 57%, compared to 64% before the first set of countercyclical measures launched in September 2009. The rise in weighted average loan amounts in 2020 was mainly due to an increase in mortgage loans with mortgage insurance, which tend to have higher LTV ratios. The average debt service ratio (DSR) for new mortgages remained low, at 37% in December, down from 41% when the LTV cap was first introduced in August 2010 (see Figure 1).\n\nConsidering the price trends of non-residential properties, trading volumes, economic outlook, and external factors, the HKMA relaxed the countercyclical macroprudential measures for non-residential mortgages in August, raising the maximum applicable LTV ratio by 10 percentage points from 40% to 50% for typical cases.\n\nFigure 1 - Average LTV and Debt Service Ratios for New Residential Mortgages\n\n# Regulation of Business Operations and Technological Risks\n\nIn response to the outbreak of COVID-19 early in 2020, the HKMA implemented a series of measures to mitigate the impact on bank operations. These included urging recognized institutions to review their Business Continuity Plans (BCPs), adopt appropriate prevention measures to protect staff and customers’ health, and maintain essential banking services. The HKMA reminded institutions to strengthen communication with staff and customers regarding potential COVID-19 cases at their premises, and formulate ongoing operational plans to address more severe but possible risk scenarios. It also maintained close contact with the industry, urging recognized institutions to remain vigilant and review their BCPs periodically based on the latest developments and government social distancing measures.\n\nAfter a comprehensive review and extensive industry consultation, the HKMA launched the “Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative 2.0” on January 1, 2021, enhancing its “Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework” with the latest international best practices for cyber incident response and recovery. The Professional Training Program under the Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative expanded its certification scope to include equivalent credentials from major overseas regions. The HKMA also proposed several suggestions to the Hong Kong Association of Banks to improve the usability of the “Cyber Risk Information Sharing Platform.”  \n\n# Smart Banking\n\nFollowing rigorous testing and trials under the “Fintech Supervisory Sandbox,” all eight virtual banks granted banking licenses in 2019 had gone live within the year. These virtual banks leverage innovative technology to offer brand-new customer experiences, such as utilizing big data analytics for SME loan credit assessments to expedite approval processes. To enhance customer engagement and foster loyalty, some virtual banks incorporated gamification elements into deposit and rewards programs.\n\n# Liquidity and Market Risks Supervision\n\nIn April, the HKMA introduced a series of measures to ensure the smooth operation of the interbank market and banking system amid the pandemic. These included clarifying the operational details of the “HKMA Liquidity Arrangement” and launching a temporary USD liquidity facility, while reaffirming that recognized institutions could flexibly utilize liquidity buffers within the regulatory framework. The HKMA also conducted drills with recognized institutions to ensure preparedness for deploying these measures when needed."}
{"zh": "# 香港的國際金融中心地位\n\n香港繼續是具全球競爭力的國際金融中心。年內金管局採取多項措施，促進銀行及支付行業開發與應用金融科技。在新冠病毒疫情下年內快速支付系統「轉數快」交易量急增。\n\n香港位處內地金融市場對外開放的要衝，能充分把握開放過程中的契機。憑藉世界級的市場基建以及「滬港通」、「深港通」與「債券通」，香港既是深受內地企業垂青的集資平台，亦是國際投資者進入增長迅速的內地市場的窗口。年內在促進粵港澳大灣區金融合作，尤其便利香港居民在大灣區內使用金融及銀行服務方面取得良好進展。\n\n與此同時，金管局積極開拓新機遇，提升香港金融平台，包括資產及財富管理、企業財資中心，以及可持續金融範疇的競爭力。金管局亦加強市場推廣，向海外及內地持份者推廣香港的金融服務。在環球層面，金管局在多個區內及國際委員會擔當領導角色，充分凸顯香港在相關國際工作的專業知識及承擔。\n\n# 概覽\n\n為鞏固香港的亞洲金融科技樞紐地位，金管局繼續致力實施各項措施，促進銀行及支付行業開發與應用科技。年內的主要進展包括：\n- 推動更廣泛使用快速支付系統「轉數快」；\n- 促進銀行業實施開放應用程式介面（開放API）；\n- 連接貿易融資平台「貿易聯動」與中國人民銀行（人民銀行）轄下的貿易金融區塊鏈平台，促進貿易融資數碼化；\n- 研究央行數碼貨幣於跨境支付的應用；\n- 探討「商業數據通」的技術可行性及研究新類型信貸評分模型，以助中小型企業（中小企）獲取融資；\n- 公布旨在發展更具規模及更多元的合規科技生態圈的兩年計劃，進一步推動合規科技的應用；\n- 加強培育人才；及\n- 推進跨境金融科技合作。\n\n金管局金融科技促進辦公室(FFO)與金管局各銀行部門聯手，在推動上述措施中發揮關鍵作用。\n\n隨着主要金融市場指數開始加入內地在岸證券或增加其權重，流入人民幣資產的資金繼續加快步伐。香港得天獨厚，憑藉連繫內地資本市場的「滬港通」、「深港通」及「債券通」，在促進國際投資者增加人民幣資產配置方面發揮關鍵的作用。在2020年，「債券通」平均每日交易額增加82%，至約193億元人民幣。為完善「債券通」運作，金管局推出新措施，包括新設特別結算周期服務、延長交易時間及引入新安排，讓投資者在選擇銀行進行貨幣兌換與外幣對沖方面有較多彈性。繼「債券通」北向通取得成功，金管局又與人民銀行組成工作小組研究南向通的框架。\n\n金管局亦繼續致力加強香港與粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）內地城市之間的金融配套措施。內地當局公布一系列政策措施，支持區內金融發展。於6月，人民銀行、金管局與澳門金融管理局（澳門金管局）聯合宣布決定實施跨境「理財通」。金管局一直與內地和本地當局以及業界緊密合作，制定有關實施細則。金管局亦就其他措施與內地當局保持聯繫，尋求為香港銀行擴大政策空間拓展更廣闊的跨境業務範疇。年內，香港繼續保持作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位。香港的人民幣即時支付結算(RTGS)系統平均每日交易額創出1.2萬億元人民幣的新高。\n\n金管局積極開拓新機遇，提升香港金融平台競爭力。為促進香港基金業務的發展，金管局與政府及業界緊密合作，為基金在本地落戶締造更有利的稅務及監管環境。金管局亦投入大量工作，繼續提升香港作為區內綠色及可持續金融樞紐的地位。與此同時，金管局加強市場推廣，向海外及內地持份者推廣香港的金融服務。\n\n在中央銀行領域，金管局在多個區內及國際委員會擔當領導角色。例如，金管局為巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（巴塞爾委員會）轄下政策及標準小組，以及東亞及太平洋地區中央銀行會議(EMEAP)轄下金融市場工作小組主席。金管局亦擔任金融穩定理事會轄下非銀行監察專家小組及金融創新網絡聯席主席，並領導探討基準過渡相關監管事項的小組。\n\n香港金融基建的安全及有效運作，為香港的國際金融中心地位奠定穩固基礎。處理銀行同業交易的4個RTGS系統、債務工具中央結算系統（CMU系統）及香港交易資料儲存庫（香港儲存庫）在2020年達到100%的系統可供使用率，高於99.95%的目標水平。透過於內地兩個中央證券託管機構的帳戶，CMU系統繼續協助結算「債券通」北向通交易，以及替相關CMU系統成員持有內地債務證券。\n\n轉數快使用量在2020年繼續增長。截至2020年底合共錄得690萬個登記，全年交易量較2019年上升兩倍。政府接受以轉數快繳費及更多商戶採用，是轉數快在個人對個人支付穩步增長以外，交易額錄得顯著增長的主要原因。\n\n為確保本地零售支付業的整體安全及效率，金管局根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（《支付條例》）指定及監察6個零售支付系統。金管局亦繼續監管18個儲值支付工具持牌人。\n\n# 2020年回顧\n\n# 香港的亞洲金融科技樞紐地位\n\n# 轉數快\n\n自2018年9月轉數快推出以來，已有35間銀行及12間儲值支付工具營運商加入，其中在2020年增加了5間銀行及1間儲值支付工具營運商。轉數快使用量亦穩步增長。截至12月31日，轉數快共錄得690萬個登記（圖1）。為方便市民收取由機構發出的款項，轉數快於12月6日起新增以香港身份證號碼作帳戶識別代號。引入這項功能後不足1個月已錄得超過110,000個登記。這項新功能並非用於個人對個人轉帳，只供已有收款人身份證號碼的機構發放款項（例如發放薪酬）之用。由於每名市民的身份證號碼都是獨一無二，市民利用香港身份證號碼作為帳戶識別代號，即使不提供銀行帳戶號碼都能夠確保準確收取款項。\n\n圖 1 轉數快帳戶登記數目\n\n新冠病毒疫情及保持社交距離措施為使用電子支付服務帶來新動力。年內轉數快交易量增長尤其迅速（圖2），於2020年12月的平均每日交易量達505,000宗即時交易（涉及52億港元及9,500萬元人民幣），相當於2019年12月168,000宗的3倍，更是2018年10月轉數快推出首月的10倍。轉數快使用量增加，亦受惠於應用範圍逐步擴大，由最初主要用作個人對個人支付，逐步擴展至繳付帳單（包括政府帳單）、零售及商業支付。\n\n圖 2 港元即時支付平均每日交易數字\n\n金管局與多個政府部門及銀行業一直合作，將轉數快的應用範圍由個人對個人支付，擴展至繳付帳單及其他商戶支付。政府於2019年11月起接受以轉數快繳付帳單，以推廣使用轉數快及便利市民。市民以支援轉數快的手機銀行或電子錢包掃描印於帳單上的二維碼，即可輕鬆繳付稅款、差餉及地租、水費及政府發出的一般繳費單。截至2020年12月經轉數快繳付政府帳單的交易達180萬宗，涉及22億港元。繼繳付政府帳單服務成功推出後，再有4個政府部門由2020年12月21日起接受在指定繳費櫃枱及自助服務機以轉數快二維碼繳費。政府亦正在探討於網上採用轉數快付款的安排。\n\n另一正面的發展是越來越多大小商戶採用轉數快以加強業務營運。支付商戶的交易在2020年12月急增至平均每日100,000宗，較2019年12月增加38倍轉數快普遍用作繳付帳單、應用程式內直接扣帳，以及進行其他網上購物。電子錢包日益普及，亦帶動了以轉數快為帳戶增值的交易量顯著增長。2020年12月平均每日增值的交易量，是2019年12月的7倍。\n\n為加強市民對轉數快的認識，金管局製作各類教育及宣傳資料，包括電視廣告及在社交媒體平台提供一系列精明使用錦囊。金管局亦舉辦中學生Whatsapp Stickers設計比賽，增加他們對電子支付的認識。此外，金管局向多個慈善團體及街市營運商推廣使用轉數快收付款項。多間參與轉數快的銀行及儲值支付工具營運商亦推出宣傳活動，包括提供優惠，吸引客戶登記及利用轉數快轉帳及支付帳單。在2020年的成果上，金管局在2021年初與銀行及儲值支付工具營運商合作，推廣透過轉數快以電子方式派利是。一方面金管局推出宣傳活動，另一方面銀行及儲值支付工具營運商則提供優惠，鼓勵客戶以電子方式派利是，既環保又有助抗疫。\n\n# 開放應用程式介面\n\n金管局繼續促進銀行業按照開放API框架研發及提供開放API。該框架分4個階段實施，銀行已推出第一及第二階段開放API，並以這些開放API與第三方服務提供者合作，開拓各項創新服務，提升客戶體驗。另一方面，金管局就實施第三及第四階段開放API進行調查研究，並於11月刊發小冊子，刊載調查結果。\n\n# 貿易聯動\n\n為使進出口商獲得更方便的貿易融資服務，金管局於年內展開概念驗證研究，探討連接「貿易聯動」與人民銀行轄下的貿易金融區塊鏈平台。該研究的首階段於年內第4季完成，並隨後開始試行。香港和內地銀行已用該連接成功完成多項跨境貿易融資交易。\n\n# 跨境支付\n\n央行數碼貨幣方面，金管局與泰國中央銀行繼續進行聯合研究，探討央行數碼貨幣於跨境支付的應用藉此促進香港與泰國兩地銀行之間港元和泰銖的外匯交易同步交收。雙方完成第一階段研究，並於1月發表聯合報告闡述主要研究結果；另亦開發以區塊鏈為基礎的跨境走廊網絡原型，致力提高跨境支付的效率及降低成本。項目第二階段已展開，旨在探討跨境貿易結算及資本市場交易的商業應用案例。其他央行亦對項目深感興趣。國際結算銀行、阿拉伯聯合酋長國中央銀行和人民銀行數字貨幣研究所於2021年初宣布參與項目。\n", "en": "Hong Kong's Status as an International Financial Centre\n\nHong Kong continues to be a globally competitive international financial centre. Throughout the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has taken various measures to promote the development and application of financial technology in the banking and payments sectors. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the transaction volume of the rapid payment system \"FPS\" surged significantly.\n\nHong Kong is strategically located at the forefront of Mainland China's financial market opening, able to seize the opportunities during the opening-up process. Leveraging world-class market infrastructure and programs such as \"Shanghai-Hong Kong Connect,\" \"Shenzhen-Hong Kong Connect,\" and the \"Bond Connect,\" Hong Kong serves as a fundraising platform highly valued by Mainland Chinese enterprises and a gateway for international investors into the rapidly growing Mainland Chinese market. Within the year, good progress was made in promoting financial cooperation among Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macau, especially in facilitating Hong Kong residents' access to financial and banking services within the Greater Bay Area.\n\nMeanwhile, HKMA actively explores new opportunities to enhance Hong Kong’s financial platform, including asset and wealth management, corporate treasury centres, and sustainable finance competitiveness. HKMA also intensifies market promotion to overseas and Mainland stakeholders, showcasing Hong Kong’s financial services. Globally, the HKMA plays leadership roles in multiple regional and international committees, demonstrating Hong Kong’s expertise and responsibilities in relevant international engagements.\n\nOverview\n\nTo consolidate Hong Kong’s position as an Asian fintech hub, HKMA continues to implement various measures to promote the development and application of technology in banking and payments. Major developments this year include:\n- Promoting wider use of the FPS;\n- Encouraging banks to implement open Application Programming Interfaces (APIs);\n- Connecting the Trade Finance Platform \"TradeLink\" with the Mainland’s trade finance blockchain platform under the People's Bank of China (PBOC) to digitalize trade finance;\n- Researching central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) for cross-border payments;\n- Exploring the technical feasibility of \"Trade Window\" and researching new types of credit scoring models to assist SMEs in obtaining financing;\n- Announcing a two-year plan to develop a more scalable and diversified regulatory technology ecosystem, further promoting RegTech application;\n- Strengthening talent cultivation; and\n- Advancing cross-border fintech cooperation.\n\nThe HKMA FinTech Facilitation Office (FFO) and various banking departments within the HKMA have played key roles in promoting these initiatives.\n\nAs major financial markets indices begin incorporating Mainland Chinese onshore securities or increasing their weights, capital inflows into RMB assets continue to accelerate. Hong Kong, with its unique advantage of connecting Mainland China capital markets through \"Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect,\" \"Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect,\" and the \"Bond Connect,\" plays a crucial role in encouraging international investors to increase RMB asset allocations. In 2020, the average daily trading volume on the \"Bond Connect\" increased by 82%, reaching about RMB 19.3 billion. To improve the operation of the \"Bond Connect,\" HKMA introduced new measures, including new special settlement cycles, extended trading hours, and new arrangements, providing investors with greater flexibility in currency exchange and foreign currency hedging through banks. Following the success of the Northbound Bond Connect, HKMA and PBOC formed a working group to explore the framework for the Southbound Bond Connect.\n\nHKMA continues to strengthen financial arrangements between Hong Kong and Mainland cities within the Greater Bay Area. Mainland authorities announced a series of policies to support regional financial development. In June, the PBOC, HKMA, and the Monetary Authority of Macau jointly announced the implementation of cross-border \"Wealth Management Connect.\" HKMA closely collaborates with Mainland and local authorities and industry players to develop detailed implementation rules. HKMA also maintains communication with Mainland authorities on other measures to expand policy space for Hong Kong banks and develop broader cross-border business models. Throughout the year, Hong Kong maintained its position as a global offshore RMB business hub, with the real-time RMB payment and settlement (RTGS) system achieving a record daily transaction amount of RMB 1.2 trillion.\n\nHKMA actively explores new opportunities to enhance Hong Kong’s financial platform competitiveness. To promote the development of the local funds industry, HKMA works closely with the government and industry to create a more favourable tax and regulatory environment for fund domicile. HKMA also invests heavily in elevating Hong Kong’s status as a green and sustainable finance hub in the region. Meanwhile, HKMA enhances market promotion efforts, promoting Hong Kong’s financial services internationally and within Mainland China.\n\nIn the realm of central banking, HKMA assumes leadership roles in multiple regional and international committees, including chairing the Policy and Standards Group under the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the Financial Markets Working Group under the East Asia and Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP). HKMA also chairs the Non-bank Supervisory Expert Group and the Fintech Network co-chairs under the Financial Stability Board, leading efforts on regulatory issues related to transition to new benchmarks.\n\nThe security and efficient operation of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure underpin Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre. In 2020, the four Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems for interbank transactions, the Central Maturity and Settlement System for debt instruments (CMU), and the Hong Kong Trade Data Repository all achieved 100% system availability, surpassing the target level of 99.95%. The CMU system continues to facilitate the settlement of \"Bond Connect\" Northbound transactions and hold Mainland securities on behalf of relevant CMU members through accounts at two Mainland depositories.\n\nThe usage of \"FPS\" continued to grow in 2020. By the end of the year, there were a total of 6.9 million registrations, with transaction volume doubling from 2019. The government’s acceptance of FPS payments and increased merchant adoption are key reasons for the remarkable growth in personal peer-to-peer transactions.\n\nTo ensure overall safety and efficiency of local retail payments, HKMA supervises six retail payment systems under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVO). HKMA also continues to regulate 18 stored value facility licensees.\n\n2020 Review\n\nHong Kong’s Position as an Asian Fintech Hub\n\nFPS\n\nSince its launch in September 2018, 35 banks and 12 stored value facility operators have joined, including five banks and one stored value facility operator added in 2020. The use of FPS has steadily increased. As of December 31, there were 6.9 million registrations (see Figure 1). To facilitate citizens in receiving payments from institutions, FPS introduced a new feature in December that uses Hong Kong ID card numbers as account identifiers. Within less than a month, over 110,000 registrations were recorded. This feature is not for personal transfers but for institutions issuing payments to recipients with Hong Kong ID numbers (e.g., salary payments). Because each citizen’s ID number is unique, using it as an account identifier ensures accurate receipt of payments even without providing bank account numbers.\n\n[Figure 1: Number of FPS account registrations]\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing measures provided a new impetus for electronic payment services. During the year, FPS transaction volume grew rapidly (see Figure 2). As of December 2020, the average daily transactions reached 505,000 real-time transactions involving HKD 5.2 billion and RMB 95 million, three times the 168,000 transactions in December 2019 and ten times the first month’s volume when FPS was launched in October 2018. The growth was also supported by expanding application scope—from primarily P2P payments to bill payments (including government bills), retail, and commercial transactions.\n\n[Figure 2: Average daily transaction volume of instant HKD payments]\n\nHKMA has cooperated with multiple government departments and banks to extend FPS’s application from P2P payments to bill payments and other merchant payments. The government began accepting bill payments via FPS in November 2019 to promote its use and make life more convenient for citizens. Citizens can scan QR codes printed on bills via mobile banking or e-wallets supporting FPS to pay taxes, rates, rents, water bills, and general government bills easily. By December 2020, the number of government bills paid via FPS reached 1.8 million transactions, involving HKD 2.2 billion. Following the successful rollout of government bill payment services, four additional government departments started accepting FPS payments at designated counters and self-service machines from December 21, 2020. The government is also exploring online FPS payment arrangements.\n\nAnother positive trend is the increasing adoption of FPS by merchants of all sizes to enhance business operations. By December 2020, the number of merchant transactions reached an average of 100,000 per day, a 38-fold increase from December 2019, with widespread use for bill payments, in-app direct debits, and online shopping. The rising popularity of e-wallets has further driven the significant increase in transactions involving account top-ups via FPS. In December 2020, the average daily value of top-up transactions was seven times that of December 2019.\n\nTo raise public awareness about FPS, HKMA produces educational and promotional materials, including TV ads and a series of \"smart tips\" on social media platforms. HKMA held a WhatsApp sticker design contest for secondary school students to increase their awareness of electronic payments. Additionally, HKMA promoted FPS usage among charitable organizations and street market operators. Many participating banks and stored value facility operators launched campaigns with incentives to encourage registration and use of FPS for transfers and bill payments. In early 2021, HKMA collaborated with banks and operators to promote digitalized \"lai see\" payments during the Lunar New Year, simultaneously launching promotional campaigns and offering incentives to encourage customers to give lai see electronically—supporting environmental protection and pandemic response."}
{"zh": "# 儲備管理\n\n2020年是峰迴路轉的一年，新冠病毒疫情為全球經濟帶來前所未有的挑戰。資產市場於第1 季經歷了大幅調整和震盪後，在主要央行推出超寬鬆的貨幣政策及各地政府實施大規模的財政紓困措施帶動下，得以迅速反彈。由於主要央行大幅下調基準利率並重啟量化寬鬆措施，令國債收益率顯著下跌、債券價格上升。在此投資環境下，外匯基金在2020 年錄得2,358 億港元的投資收入，回報率為5.3%。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》，外匯基金的首要目的是直接或間接影響港元匯價，亦可運用於保持香港貨幣及金融體系穩定健全，藉此保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。金管局根據財政司司長轉授的權力及轉授權力的條款，就外匯基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標及組合架構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會為外匯基金制定下列投資目標：\n(a) 保障資本；\n(b) 確保整體貨幣基礎在任何時候都由流通性極高的美元資產提供十足支持；\n(c) 確保流動資金足以維持貨幣及金融穩定；以及\n(d) 在符合上述(a)至(c)項的前提下盡量爭取投資回報，以保障基金的長期購買力。\n\n以上目標全面顧及外匯基金的法定目的，並已於外匯基金的組合結構及目標資產配置中反映。\n\n外匯基金大致上分成兩個主要組合：支持組合及投資組合。支持組合持有流通性極高的美元資產，按照貨幣發行局制度的規定為貨幣基礎提供十足支持。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債市及股市，以保障資產的價值及長期購買力。\n\n為能更妥善管理風險及提高中長期回報，金管局以審慎及循序漸進方式將外匯基金的部分資產配置於較多元化的資產類別，包括新興巿場及內地債券與股票、私募股權（包括基建）及房地產。新興巿場及內地債券與股票由投資組合持有，私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合持有。長期增長組合的市值上限為外匯基金累計盈餘的三分之一，以及未來基金存款與外匯基金附屬公司存款中與長期增長組合掛鈎部分的總和。\n\n策略性資產組合於2007年設立，一直持有政府基於策略性目的而為外匯基金帳目購入的香港交易及結算所有限公司股份。由於這個組合性質獨特，因此外匯基金的投資表現評估並無將其包括在內。\n\n# 於外匯基金的存款\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定組織的存款，利率一般與投資組合的表現掛鈎，但未來基金屬主要個別例子。未來基金存款的利率與投資組合及長期增長組合的表現掛鈎，實際利率視乎組合比重而定。未來基金在投資組合與長期增長組合的比重約為40：60。\n\n# 投資程序\n\n外匯基金的投資程序分別以策略性資產配置及戰略性資產配置作基礎。策略性資產配置，會以投資基準方式反映，亦即外匯基金為達到投資目標而可作出的長線資產配置。外匯基金以策略性配置作為指引，透過戰略性的資產配置，以爭取超越基準的回報。因此，實際配置往往會與基準配置（亦即策略性配置）有所偏離，而實際與基準配置之間的差距稱為「戰略性偏離」。財政司司長經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後制定投資基準及循跡誤差限額，金管局獲授權決定戰略性資產配置及定出戰略性偏離的容許範圍。投資組合經理可在戰略性偏離的容許範圍內管理倉盤，從短期市場變化中獲利。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局的外匯基金投資辦公室專責投資及相關風險管理職能。該辦公室職員負責直接管理外匯基金約72%的投資，包括整個支持組合及部分投資組合。該部分投資組合包括不同的環球定息市場投資，並透過衍生工具執行外匯基金的宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 外聘投資經理\n\n除透過內部職員管理資產外，金管局亦僱用外聘投資經理負責管理外匯基金約28%的資產，包括所有上市股票組合及其他特別資產。僱用外聘投資經理的目的是要運用市場上最佳的專業投資專才為外匯基金投資，獲取可持續回報，並讓外匯基金受惠於多元化及互補的投資方式，以及汲取市場心得與專門的投資知識。\n\n僱用外聘投資經理的相關支出包括基金管理與託管費、交易費、預扣稅及其他稅項。這些支出主要受市場因素影響而每年不同。\n\n# 風險管理及監察\n\n投資環境越趨複雜，風險管理的重要性不言而喻。金管局為內部及外聘投資經理所管理的投資組合均訂下嚴格管控措施及投資指引，並設立嚴謹的風險監察及合規制度。金管局為投資相關活動設有三重防線以確保有效的風險管理及監察。金管局亦定期監察主要投資風險類別（包括信用、市場、流動性及業務操作風險），並已加強風險管理程序以配合外匯基金的多元化投資。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n金管局支持負責任投資，將環境、社會及管治(ESG)因素併入外匯基金的公開市場及私募市場的投資管理過程。\n\n金管局訂有一套原則，以評估外匯基金投資項目的ESG風險與機會。就外聘投資經理所管理的資產組合而言，金管局透過獲委任的投資經理執行負責任投資。在甄選、委任及監察外聘投資經理的過程中，金管局會評估其落實ESG的不同範疇，包括ESG管治方面的組織架構、ESG標準及政策、將ESG因素併入投資程序中的情況，以及管理督導的業務活動，即代理投票和與投資組合公司的溝通（例如與投資組合公司管理層商討ESG的事宜）。為彰顯對負責任投資的重視，金管局透過外聘投資經理在管理督導方面扮演的角色，推動更完善的ESG做法。負責管理金管局的香港股票組合及中國內地股票主動投資管理組合的外聘投資經理，須承諾遵守證券及期貨事務監察委員會頒布的《負責任的擁有權原則》，若未能遵守則須作出解釋。至於負責管理已發展市場股票組合的外聘投資經理則需恪守國際公認的ESG標準。此外，金管局又展開聘任後監察計劃，以審視外聘投資經理的代理投票及與投資組合公司溝通的落實概況。\n\n由金管局內部人員負責管理的定息投資組合，亦將ESG因素融入債券投資的信用風險分析中。藉著擴大ESG數據來源以及在量化評估中提高ESG因素的權重，加強相關的分析。\n\n至於在公開市場的ESG投資，金管局自2015年起投資於綠色、社會責任及可持續債券（ESG債券），是這個市場的早期投資者之一。此外，金管局亦參與國際金融公司的「聯合貸款組合管理計劃」，而其投資對象聚焦於新興市場的可持續發展項目。在2020年，適逢市場供應增加，金管局增加ESG債券的投資。展望未來，金管局將繼續透過直接投資或持有ESG債券基金等方式，壯大其ESG債券組合。此外，金管局將透過採納ESG股票指數作為被動投資組合的投資基準，推動外聘投資經理建立以ESG為主題的股票投資方針。金管局在未來幾年將會繼續留意以ESG為主題的投資機會，例如主動式的ESG投資組合及低碳為題的投資工具。\n\n私募市場投資方面，金管局在盡職審查過程中檢視專責合夥人的ESG政策及具體措施。金管局的長期增長組合積極投資於具備可持續特點的項目，包括可再生能源基建，而在房地產投資組合亦有吸納具有綠色及可持續特點的倉庫及其他建築物。金管局將在未來繼續物色具備可持續特點的項目，並在房地產投資方面將綠色認證列入為重要考慮因素。金管局與專責合夥人舉行年度ESG工作坊，就良好的ESG作業手法交流意見及經驗。在11月舉行的ESG工作坊上，一眾專責合夥人就新冠病毒疫情對其投資組合公司及ESG投資發展所造成的影響交換意見。為提高私募市場投資的ESG透明度，金管局已要求專責合夥人提供有關其投資項目的ESG資訊，例如氣候變化風險等，以便監察。\n\n金管局往後仍會密切觀察ESG標準的發展，評估如何將有關標準進一步融入投資程序，當中包括與理念相近的投資者及國際組織互動合作。金管局作為聯合國支持的《負責任投資原則》的簽署人之一，肩負作為全球倡導者的責任，日後將會參與制定ESG最佳作業手法，並推動其他投資者採納負責任的投資方法。金管局亦是非牟利機構 FCLTGlobal 的成員，該機構旨在透過舉辦工作坊及研究，鼓勵以長遠目標為本的業務及投資決策。金管局亦有參與「氣候相關財務資訊披露工作小組」，並為「央行與監管機構綠色金融網絡」的成員。此外，金管局籌辦講座及積極參與投資業界舉辦的活動，分享及推廣有關ESG投資的理念。\n\n有關金管局的負責任投資政策架構，詳見「機構社會責任」一章。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2020年的金融市場\n\n因應受新冠病毒疫情為全球經濟帶來的重大挑戰而推出的寬鬆貨幣及財政政策支持下，環球金融市場在年底時升至高位。環球股票市場於第1季經歷了大幅調整和震盪後迅速反彈，主要市場更錄得雙位數字的增長。美國標準普爾500指數上升16%，是2020年表現最佳的七大工業國股票指數。\n\n債市方面，主要已發展國家的債券收益率在第1季顯著下跌後繼續受壓。10年期美國國債收益率由年初的1.9%下跌約100基點，至年底的0.9%。由於主要國債價格急升，2020年從債市錄得非常可觀的估值收益。\n\n貨幣市場方面，美國息率向下令息差收窄，促使美元兌主要貨幣轉弱，而2020年下半年情況更為顯著，其中歐元及人民幣兌美元分別升值約9.0%及6.5%。\n\n表1列載主要貨幣、債巿及股市在2020年的表現。\n\n表 1 2020年市場回報\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n外匯基金在2020年錄得2,358億港元的投資收入，其中包括債券投資收益927億港元、香港股票投資收益40億港元、其他股票投資收益699億港元、非港元資產外匯估值上調96億港元，以及外匯基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資收益596億港元。另一方面，策略性資產組合錄得140億港元估值收益。\n", "en": "# Reserve Management\n\n2020 was a year of significant turnaround. The COVID-19 pandemic brought unprecedented challenges to the global economy. After experiencing substantial adjustments and volatility in the asset markets in the first quarter, a rapid rebound was achieved thanks to ultra-loose monetary policies introduced by major central banks and large-scale fiscal relief measures implemented by governments around the world. Due to significant cuts in benchmark interest rates and the resumption of quantitative easing by major central banks, government bond yields fell sharply and bond prices rose. In this investment environment, the Foreign Exchange Fund recorded investment income of HK$235.8 billion in 2020, with a return of 5.3%.\n\n# Foreign Exchange Fund\n\nUnder the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the primary purpose of the Exchange Fund is to directly or indirectly influence the exchange rate of the HK dollar, as well as to maintain the stability and soundness of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems, thereby safeguarding Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre. The Monetary Authority, under delegated authority from the Financial Secretary and according to the terms of such delegation, is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# Management of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Investment Objectives and Portfolio Structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) has established the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n(a) To safeguard the capital;\n(b) To ensure that the overall monetary base is always fully supported by liquidity-high US dollar assets;\n(c) To ensure sufficient liquidity to maintain monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) To strive for investment returns compatible with the above (a) to (c) to safeguard the fund’s long-term purchasing power.\n\nThese objectives fully reflect the statutory purpose of the Exchange Fund and are incorporated into its portfolio structure and target asset allocation.\n\nBroadly, the Exchange Fund is divided into two main portfolios: the support portfolio and the investment portfolio. The support portfolio holds highly liquid US dollar assets, which, according to the Monetary Authority’s system, provide full support to the monetary base. The investment portfolio mainly invests in bond and equity markets of member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), aimed at preserving asset value and long-term purchasing power.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance medium- to long-term returns, the Monetary Authority adopts a prudent and gradual approach, diversifying the assets of the Exchange Fund to include emerging markets and Mainland China bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate. Emerging markets and Mainland China bonds and equities are held within the investment portfolio, while private equity and real estate investments are held within the long-term growth portfolio. The market value cap for the long-term growth portfolio is one-third of the cumulative surplus of the Exchange Fund, as well as the total of future fund deposits and the portion linked to long-term growth portfolios of subsidiaries of the Exchange Fund.\n\nThe strategic asset portfolio was established in 2007 and has maintained holdings of shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited purchased for strategic purposes. Due to the unique nature of this portfolio, its investment performance is not included in the overall evaluation of the Exchange Fund’s performance.\n\n# Deposits in the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund occasionally receives deposits from fiscal reserves, government funds, and statutory organizations. The interest rate typically tracks the performance of the investment portfolio, but the future fund’s deposits are the principal cases. The interest rate on future fund deposits is linked to the performance of the investment portfolio and the long-term growth portfolio, with the actual rate depending on the portfolio proportions. The approximate ratio of future fund deposits in the investment portfolio to those in the long-term growth portfolio is about 40:60.\n\n# Investment Procedures\n\nThe investment procedures of the Exchange Fund are based on strategic asset allocation and tactical asset allocation. The strategic asset allocation, reflected through investment benchmarks, represents the long-term asset mix designed to meet the investment objectives. The Exchange Fund uses strategic targets as guidance and adopts tactical adjustments to strive for returns exceeding benchmarks. As a result, actual allocations often deviate from benchmarks, with the difference termed “strategic deviation.” The Financial Secretary, after consulting EFAC, sets investment benchmarks and permissible tracking error limits, while the Monetary Authority is authorized to determine the strategic asset allocation and establish acceptable ranges for strategic deviations. Portfolio managers may manage holdings within these limits to profit from short-term market fluctuations.\n\n# Investment Management\n\n# Direct Investment\n\nThe Exchange Fund Investment Office (EFIO) of the Monetary Authority is responsible for investment and related risk management functions. Staff in EFIO manage approximately 72% of the assets directly, including the entire support portfolio and part of the investment portfolio. These investments include various global fixed income markets and macro-risk management strategies using derivatives.\n\n# External Investment Managers\n\nIn addition to internal staff managing assets, the Monetary Authority employs external investment managers responsible for approximately 28% of the assets, including all listed equity portfolios and other special assets. The purpose of appointing external managers is to leverage market-leading professional expertise, gaining sustainable returns, and benefitting from diversified and complementary investment approaches, as well as market insights and specialized knowledge.\n\nExpenses related to external managers include fund management and custody fees, transaction costs, withholding taxes, and other applicable taxes, which vary annually depending on market conditions.\n\n# Risk Management and Oversight\n\nAs the investment environment becomes increasingly complex, effective risk management is of utmost importance. The Monetary Authority has established strict controls and investment guidelines for both internal and external managers, along with rigorous risk monitoring and compliance systems. To ensure effective risk management and oversight, the Authority employs a three-tiered defense system. It also regularly monitors key categories of investment risks—including credit, market, liquidity, and operational risks—and has strengthened risk management procedures to support the diversification of the Exchange Fund’s investments.\n\n# Responsible Investment\n\nThe Monetary Authority supports responsible investment, integrating environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors into the management processes of both public market and private market investments of the Exchange Fund.\n\nThe Authority has a set of principles to evaluate ESG risks and opportunities of investment projects. For assets managed by external managers, the Authority executes responsible investment through delegated managers. During the process of selecting, appointing, and monitoring external managers, the Authority assesses their implementation of ESG practices, including organizational structure, standards and policies, integration of ESG factors into investment procedures, and oversight activities such as proxy voting and engagement with portfolio companies. To underscore the importance of responsible investment, the Authority promotes better ESG practices by leveraging the role of external managers in stewardship activities. External managers responsible for actively managing the Hong Kong stock portfolio and Mainland China stock active portfolios must commit to adhering to the Securities and Futures Commission’s Principles for Responsible Ownership; failure to comply requires explanation. Managers overseeing developed market equity portfolios are required to follow internationally recognized ESG standards. Additionally, the Authority has initiated post-appointment monitoring programs to review how external managers implement proxy voting and engagement.\n\nFor fixed income portfolios managed internally by the Authority, ESG factors are incorporated into credit risk analyses. By expanding ESG data sources and increasing the weight of ESG factors in quantitative assessments, the Authority enhances related analysis.\n\nIn terms of public market ESG investments, the Authority has been investing in green, social responsibility, and sustainable bonds (ESG bonds) since 2015, being among the early investors in this market. The Authority also participates in the International Financial Corporation’s (IFC) “Sustainable Lending Portfolio Management Program,” focusing on projects supporting sustainable development in emerging markets. In 2020, amid increased market supply, the Authority increased investments in ESG bonds. Looking ahead, the Authority will continue expanding its ESG bond portfolio through direct investments and holdings of ESG bond funds. Additionally, it plans to promote an ESG-themed stock investment approach for external managers by adopting ESG stock indices as benchmarks for passive portfolios. The Authority will also continue to monitor opportunities in ESG-focused investments, such as active ESG portfolios and low-carbon investment tools.\n\nIn private markets, the Authority reviews ESG policies and specific measures of dedicated partnerships during due diligence. The long-term growth portfolio actively invests in sustainable projects, including renewable energy infrastructure, and its real estate investments include green-certified warehouses and other buildings. The Authority plans to continue identifying projects with sustainable features and will consider green certification as a key criterion in real estate investments. The Authority holds annual ESG workshops with dedicated partners to exchange insights and best practices. During the November workshop, participants discussed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their portfolio companies and ESG development. To increase transparency of ESG investments in private markets, the Authority has requested partners to provide ESG information (such as climate risk data).\n\nThe Authority will continue to closely observe the development of ESG standards, considering how to further incorporate these standards into investment processes, including engaging with like-minded investors and international organizations. As a signatory of the UN-supported Principles for Responsible Investment, the Authority commits to advocating best practices and promoting responsible investing among other investors. It is also a member of the non-profit organization FCLTGlobal, which encourages long-term value-based decision-making through workshops and research. The Authority participates in the Climate-related Financial Disclosures Working Group and is a member of the Central Bank and Supervisors’ Green Finance Network. Furthermore, the Authority organises seminars and actively participates in industry events to promote and share ESG investment principles.\n\nFor details of the Monetary Authority’s responsible investment policy framework, please refer to the chapter on “Corporate Social Responsibility.”\n\n# Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Financial Markets in 2020\n\nSupported by accommodative monetary and fiscal policies introduced in response to the significant challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic to the global economy, the global financial markets reached record highs at the end of the year. After experiencing major adjustments and volatility in the first quarter, global stock markets rebounded rapidly, with major markets attaining double-digit growth. The US S&P 500 index rose by 16%, making it one of the best-performing among the seven major industrialized countries’ stock indices in 2020.\n\nIn the bond markets, yields of bonds from major developed countries continued to come under pressure after a marked decline in the first quarter. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury note fell approximately 100 basis points from 1.9% at the start of the year to 0.9% at year-end. The sharp rise in government bond prices resulted in notable valuation gains in 2020.\n\nIn the money markets, declining US interest rates narrowed the interest rate differentials, weakening the US dollar against major currencies.

{"zh": "# 機構社會責任\n\n金管局致力履行機構社會責任，以成為負責任及可持續發展的機構為目標。金管局在不同領域履行此承諾，包括推動可持續發展及具環保意識的市場、關懷廣大社會、保護環境及締造友善的工作環境。\n\n為應對新冠病毒疫情，金管局推出多項措施，支援有需要的個人及企業，從而協助香港經濟渡過難關。\n\n# 市場環境\n\n# 綠色及可持續金融\n\n氣候變化是影響人類福祉及全球經濟可持續性的主要風險之一，作為社會重要環節之一的金融體系，亦難免會受到影響；而銀行作為金融體系的一部分，應更積極管理氣候風險。有見及此，金管局致力探究應對這項挑戰的方法，並正落實多項於2019年5月宣布推出的措施，促進綠色金融在香港的發展。有關措施包括分三階段推動綠色及可持續銀行業的發展：\n\n# 第一階段\n\n與業界建立一個共同框架，評估銀行目前的「綠色基準」，以及與國際組織合作，為本港銀行提供技術支援；\n\n# 第二階段\n\n就綠色及可持續銀行業的監管期望及要求諮詢業界及其他持份者；以及\n\n# 第三階段\n\n集中落實、審視及評估銀行在這方面的進度。\n\n在國際層面，金管局參與多個國際組織，包括央行與監管機構綠色金融網絡、巴塞爾銀行監管委員會轄下的氣候相關財務風險高級別工作組、東亞及太平洋地區中央銀行會議轄下銀行監管工作小組之下的可持續金融關注組及國際可持續金融平台。透過參與這些國際組織，金管局有機會為中央銀行界及監管機構在應對氣候變化的工作上作出貢獻，並能在制定本地架構時借鑑其他地區的經驗與觀點。\n\n金管局亦參與央行與監管機構綠色金融網絡下的多個工作組，包括微觀審慎監管工作組、宏觀金融工作組及促進綠色金融工作組。此外，金管局亦加入了兩個新設的工作組：研究工作組及彌補數據缺口工作組。研究工作組負責相關研究工作，而彌補數據缺口工作組旨在制定監管當局及金融機構評估氣候相關風險與機遇所需、但目前卻並未掌握的數據項目詳盡清單。有關金管局年內在推動綠色及可持續銀行業發展方面的工作，詳見「銀行體系穩定」一章。\n\n金管局在11月與國際金融公司聯合推出綠色商業銀行聯盟，協助各新興市場的銀行制定應對氣候變化的方案。作為聯盟的創始成員及首個區域執行理事，金管局i)在全球金融市場推動發展綠色商業銀行；ii)為商業銀行提供互相學習平台，獲取所需知識、工具及商業資訊，以制定其本身的綠色金融路線圖，並轉型為具公信力的綠色銀行；iii)促進溝通，並探討前沿議題推動全球綠色議程；以及iv)協助聯盟的成員合作，以及把握國際金融公司所識別在未來10年估計高達23萬億美元的新興市場綠色及氣候相關投資機會。\n\n本地方面，金管局與其他金融監管機構合作，協調金融業針對氣候和環境風險的措施應對。除了協助政府落實政府綠色債券計劃的相關工作外，金管局亦與證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）共同發起成立了綠色和可持續金融跨機構督導小組（督導小組），處理跨行業的監管及市場發展事宜。有關金管局年內在發展香港成為綠色及可持續金融樞紐方面的工作，詳見「香港的國際金融中心地位」一章。\n\n# 綠色和可持續金融跨機構督導小組\n\n督導小組旨在協調金融業針對氣候及環境風險的措施應對、加快香港綠色及可持續金融的發展，以及支持政府的氣候策略。督導小組由金管局與證監會於5月共同發起成立，其他成員包括環境局、財經事務及庫務局、香港交易及結算所有限公司、保險業監管局及強制性公積金計劃管理局。\n\n自成立以來，督導小組設立了兩個技術工作專責團隊，分別負責研究及處理跨部門的監管事宜，以及協調跨機構的市場發展工作。\n\n督導小組在12月發布綠色及可持續金融策略，提出從六方面鞏固香港金融生態系統，長遠共建更綠色及更可持續的未來。督導小組亦宣布5個短期行動綱領，處理發展過程中一些最迫切的問題。\n\n金管局舉辦督導小組成立大會，金管局總裁余偉文先生（右三）為該小組的聯席主席。\n\n督導小組發布香港的綠色和可持續金融策略計劃及5個主要行動綱領。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n金管局支持負責任投資，即將環境、社會及管治(ESG)因素融入投資活動中。金管局作為規模龐大的資產擁有人，日益關注負責任投資，將對其基金經理如何進行投資活動產生影響。\n\n# 金管局的信念\n\n金管局相信透過適度強調負責任投資及考慮各項投資的可持續長期表現，將更有效達致外匯基金的投資目標，並且減低投資活動所涉及的ESG相關風險。\n\n# 金管局的原則\n\n按金管局採取的指導性原則，當ESG投資與其他投資項目的經風險調整長期收益相若時，一般會優先考慮ESG投資。作為負責任的長期投資者，金管局在投資管理過程中，會因應情況採納以下的負責任投資原則：\n\n# 融入\n\n金管局相信ESG因素會對投資項目的長期價值帶來重大影響，因此將ESG因素融入投資分析程序，以辨察風險及物色良機。金管局將ESG因素併入公開市場及私募市場的投資管理過程中。\n\n# 主動行使資產擁有權\n\n金管局就所持有的上市公司股票適當地行使股東權利，以維護投資的長期價值。金管局相信，顧及ESG因素的負責任企業行為，將有助創造長綫的股東利益。金管局期望外聘投資經理透過行使表決權及與獲投資公司溝通時，主動行使資產擁有權，藉以協助金管局履行對投資項目的擁有權責任。\n\n# 合作\n\n金管局致力與理念相近的投資者及監管機構合作，推動良好的長期投資管理手法，又出席公開活動並發表演講，分享更完善的ESG作業手法及鼓勵投資界採納負責任投資理念。\n\n有關金管局年內在負責任投資方面的工作，詳見「儲備管理」一章。\n\n# 金管局作為主動的負責任投資者，監察外聘投資經理的ESG作業手法\n\n# 金管局的期望\n\n金管局非常重視將ESG因素融入投資決定及主動行使資產擁有權等概念。為此，金管局在甄選聘任及監察外聘投資經理時，皆會考慮ESG因素。由於金管局認為就所持有的上市公司股票行使股東權利，是維護投資的長期價值的基本方針，因此會要求獲聘任的投資經理嚴肅對待主動行使資產擁有權一事。\n\n# 金管局的監察\n\n外聘投資經理須就其替金管局管理的上市股票組合的ESG表現接受評估。金管局透過溝通計劃，有系統地檢視外聘投資經理在不同範疇的ESG作業手法，例如其ESG評估架構、與獲投資公司的溝通，以及代理投票方面的工作。金管局在2020年選出若干外聘投資經理率先進行溝通計劃，當中不僅評估其ESG表現，亦檢視其有否代表金管局妥善行使資產擁有權。\n\n# 溝通成果\n\n金管局透過計劃識別出作業手法有問題的外聘投資經理，並採取跟進行動。下文列舉其中兩個例子。\n\n# 個案1\n\n金管局留意到股票投資經理A的ESG架構有改善空間，尤其應設立更有系統的方法去評估獲投資公司。金管局就此與A跟進，其後A進行全面的公司政策檢討，以實施一個更穩健的ESG架構。A更特別委任外聘顧問就ESG程序提供意見，反映加快落實改革的決心，並新設由高級管理層組成的ESG委員會，顯示對ESG的承擔及高級管理層對有關措施的支持。\n\n# 個案2\n\n金管局在檢視股票投資經理B的投票方法後，發現B的投票政策在多個範疇上都有不足之處，並要求其ESG主管作出審視。尤其B在過往的投票全數贊成管理層的建議，偏離其本身的代理投票指引。B其後承諾會加強公司的投票政策以符合期望，其中包括會提高ESG團隊成員的參與度，以及在遇上涉及重大管治問題時有可能對管理層投下反對票。\n\n在私募市場投資方面，金管局藉着其專責合夥人致力與相關投資組合公司在ESG事宜上合作，從而實現負責任投資。金管局留意到專責合夥人都貫徹對ESG的承擔，因他們認為此舉可有利創造投資組合公司的長期價值和確保回報的可持續性。下文列舉的兩個例子顯示可透過(i)設計改動及利用創新運作技術；以及(ii)在建造及營運綠色及可持續倉庫時融入減碳因素，以管理氣候變化風險。兩個例子都對環境產生顯著的正面影響，減少碳排放，避免有害物質，並同時透過降低成本及節省能源，提升運作效率。\n\n(i) 金管局有投資一間採用環保方案的害蟲防治公司。雖然傳統殺蟲劑及化學製品能有效殺滅害蟲，但若未能迅速清除或妥善棄置蟲屍，將會危害公共衛生。此外，化學成分的滲漏及棄置亦會造成環境問題。該公司採用的不含生物殺滅劑方案，透過設置捕蟲器以減少使用有害化學品。該公司亦利用與互聯網相連的動態感應器，遙距偵察是否已捕獲害蟲。藉着此項新技術，該公司能作出完善的路線規劃以收集捕獲的害蟲，減低出行里程，從而減少碳排放。該公司採用的方案令公司整體碳排的淨效應達到每美元淨銷售額0.36千克二氧化碳當量的低水平，接近法律服務及軟件出版等低碳行業的平均水平，實在令人鼓舞。\n\n(ii) 金管局有投資綠色及可持續倉庫。雖然建造業是碳排放的一大源頭，但有關的倉庫發展商在其整體倉庫建造與營運中，採用淨零碳排放程序，並制定衡量淨零碳排放基準的標準及指標，而建築計劃亦顧及所用材料與部件的可持續性。因此，所建造的倉庫減碳效率高，並具備可持續特點，包括太陽能加熱系統、電動車充電設施、自然採光及雨水收集等。\n\n根據獨立顧問的評估，按淨額計，有關倉庫建造的碳足跡較一般物流大廈的碳排放量低25.8%。為進一步抵銷建築工程所造成的碳排放，建造過程中更種植了32,799棵樹（以淨額計）。建成後倉庫的日常運作的碳排放量較一般倉庫少26.9%。\n", "en": "# Corporate Social Responsibility\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is committed to fulfilling its corporate social responsibility goals by becoming a responsible and sustainable institution. The HKMA undertakes this commitment across various areas, including promoting sustainable development and environmentally conscious markets, caring for society at large, protecting the environment, and creating a friendly working environment.\n\nTo address the COVID-19 pandemic, the HKMA introduced multiple measures to support individuals and enterprises in need, thereby assisting Hong Kong's economy in overcoming difficult times.\n\n# Market Environment\n\n# Green and Sustainable Finance\n\nClimate change is one of the major risks affecting human well-being and the global economy's sustainability. As a crucial part of society, the financial system is inevitably impacted; banks, as part of the financial system, should proactively manage climate risks. In this regard, the HKMA is dedicated to exploring approaches to tackle this challenge and is implementing several measures announced in May 2019 to promote the development of green finance in Hong Kong. These measures include the phased promotion of green and sustainable banking development:\n\n# Phase One\n\nEstablishing a common framework with industry players to evaluate banks' current “green benchmarks” and collaborating with international organizations to provide technical support to local banks;\n\n# Phase Two\n\nConsulting industry and other stakeholders on regulatory expectations and requirements for green and sustainable banking; and\n\n# Phase Three\n\nFocusing on implementing, reviewing, and assessing the progress of banks in this area.\n\nAt the international level, the HKMA participates in multiple organizations, including the Central Banks and Supervisors Green Finance Network, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s Climate-related Financial Risks Task Force, the Bank Regulatory Working Group under the Central Bank and Monetary Authorities’ East Asia and Pacific Central Bank Governors’ Meeting, the Sustainable Finance Concern Group, and the International Platform on Sustainable Finance. Through engagement with these international organizations, the HKMA has opportunities to contribute to the work of central banks and regulators in addressing climate change, and can draw on experiences and perspectives from other regions when developing local frameworks.\n\nThe HKMA also participates in several working groups under the Central Banks and Supervisors Green Finance Network, including the Microprudential Supervision Working Group, the Macroeconomic and Financial Stability Working Group, and the Green Finance Promotion Working Group. Additionally, the HKMA has joined two newly established groups: the Research Working Group and the Data Gaps Filling Working Group. The Research Group is responsible for related research activities, while the Data Gaps Filling Group aims to develop a comprehensive list of data points currently lacking but necessary for regulators and financial institutions to assess climate-related risks and opportunities. Further details about the HKMA’s work in promoting green and sustainable banking this year can be found in the chapter on “Banking System Stability.”\n\nIn November, the HKMA jointly launched the Green Business Banking Alliance with the International Finance Corporation to assist banks in emerging markets in formulating responses to climate change. As a founding member and the first regional executive director of the Alliance, the HKMA is i) promoting the development of green commercial banking globally; ii) providing a platform for commercial banks to learn from each other, acquire knowledge, tools, and business information, thereby developing their own green finance roadmaps and transforming into credible green banks; iii) facilitating communication and discussing cutting-edge topics to advance the global green agenda; and iv) helping members collaborate and seize the green and climate-related investment opportunities estimated by the World Bank to reach up to USD 23 trillion over the next ten years in emerging markets.\n\nLocally, the HKMA collaborates with other financial regulators to coordinate measures for the financial industry to tackle climate and environmental risks. In addition to supporting the government in implementing the Green Bond Program, the HKMA co-established the Cross-Agency Supervisory Group for Green and Sustainable Finance with the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), which oversees cross-sector regulation and market development. Further details on the HKMA’s efforts this year to develop Hong Kong as a green and sustainable finance hub are available in the chapter on “Hong Kong’s Status as an International Financial Centre.”\n\n# Cross-Agency Supervisory Group for Green and Sustainable Finance\n\nThe Group aims to coordinate the financial industry’s measures in response to climate and environmental risks, accelerate the development of green and sustainable finance in Hong Kong, and support the government’s climate strategies. Established jointly by the HKMA and the SFC in May, the Group’s other members include the Environment Bureau, the Financial Services and Treasury Bureau, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, the Insurance Authority, and the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority.\n\nSince its inception, the Group has established two technical working teams responsible for researching and handling cross-departmental regulatory issues, as well as coordinating cross-agency market development initiatives.\n\nIn December, the Group issued a Green and Sustainable Finance Strategy, proposing six key areas to strengthen Hong Kong’s financial ecosystem and collaboratively build a greener and more sustainable future. The Group also announced five short-term action plans to address the most pressing issues in the development process.\n\nThe HKMA convened the inaugural meeting of the Group, with Chief Executive Mr. Eddie Yue (third from right) serving as co-chair.\n\nThe Group released Hong Kong’s Green and Sustainable Finance Strategy and five major action plans.\n\n# Responsible Investment\n\nThe HKMA supports responsible investment, meaning the integration of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors into investment activities. As a large asset owner, the HKMA’s increasing focus on responsible investment will influence how its fund managers conduct investment processes.\n\n# HKMA’s Beliefs\n\nThe HKMA believes that by appropriately emphasizing responsible investment and considering the long-term sustainability of investment performance, it can more effectively achieve the investment goals of the Exchange Fund and reduce ESG-related risks involved in investment activities.\n\n# HKMA’s Principles\n\nAccording to the guiding principles adopted by the HKMA, when ESG investments have comparable risk-adjusted long-term returns to other investment options, priority is generally given to ESG investments. As a responsible long-term investor, the HKMA adopts the following principles in its investment management:\n\n# Integration\n\nThe HKMA believes that ESG factors significantly impact the long-term value of investments, and therefore integrates ESG considerations into its investment analysis processes to identify risks and opportunities. These factors are incorporated into the investment management processes in both public markets and private equity markets.\n\n# Active Exercise of Ownership Rights\n\nThe HKMA appropriately exercises shareholder rights for its holdings in listed companies to safeguard long-term investment value. The HKMA believes that responsible corporate behavior, considering ESG factors, will help create long-term shareholder benefits. The HKMA expects external investment managers to actively exercise ownership rights, including voting and engaging with investee companies, to assist it in fulfilling its ownership responsibilities.\n\n# Collaboration\n\nThe HKMA strives to cooperate with like-minded investors and regulators to promote sound long-term investment management practices. It also participates in public events and delivers speeches to share improved ESG practices and encourage the investment community to adopt responsible investment principles.\n\nFurther details of the HKMA’s work on responsible investment this year can be found in the chapter on “Reserves Management.”\n\n# HKMA as an Active Responsible Investor Monitoring External Managers’ ESG Practices\n\n# HKMA’s Expectations\n\nThe HKMA attaches great importance to integrating ESG considerations into investment decisions and actively exercising ownership rights. Accordingly, it considers ESG factors when selecting and supervising external investment managers. Since exercising shareholder rights in listed companies is fundamental to maintaining long-term investment value, the HKMA requires appointed managers to take this responsibility seriously.\n\n# HKMA’s Oversight\n\nExternal investment managers are evaluated on their ESG performance in managing HKMA’s listed equity portfolios. Through systematic communication programs, the HKMA reviews their ESG practices in various areas, including ESG evaluation frameworks, engagement with investee companies, and proxy voting. In 2020, the HKMA selected several external managers to initiate communication programs, assessing not only their ESG performance but also whether they appropriately exercise ownership rights on behalf of the HKMA.\n\n# Communication Outcomes\n\nThe HKMA identifies external managers with problematic practices through these programs and takes follow-up actions. Here are two examples:\n\n# Case 1\n\nThe HKMA observed that Asset Management Company A’s ESG framework had room for improvement, especially in establishing more systematic methods for evaluating investee companies. The HKMA followed up with A, which subsequently conducted a comprehensive policy review to establish a more robust ESG framework. A also appointed external consultants for ESG processes, reflecting a determination to accelerate reforms, and established an ESG Committee composed of senior management, demonstrating commitment and support for ESG initiatives.\n\n# Case 2\n\nAfter reviewing Asset Management Company B’s voting procedures, the HKMA found deficiencies in B’s voting policies across multiple areas and requested an ESG review by B’s ESG head. Notably, B had historically voted in favor of management’s proposals in all cases, diverging from its own proxy voting guidelines. B subsequently committed to strengthen its voting policies to meet expectations, including increasing the participation of its ESG team members and considering opposition votes against management in cases involving significant governance issues.\n\nIn private markets, the HKMA leverages its dedicated partners to collaborate with portfolio companies on ESG matters, thereby advancing responsible investment. The HKMA has observed that these dedicated partners consistently uphold their commitments to ESG, believing that such efforts can generate long-term value for portfolio companies and ensure sustainable returns. The following two examples illustrate how innovations in approach and operational practices, including incorporating carbon reduction factors in building and operating green and sustainable warehouses, can significantly benefit the environment by reducing carbon emissions, preventing harmful substances, and simultaneously lowering costs and energy consumption:\n\n(i) The HKMA invested in a pest control company that adopts environmentally friendly solutions. While conventional pest control agents and chemicals effectively kill pests, improper disposal or rapid removal of pest carcasses could jeopardize public health. The company uses a biocide-free approach, employing traps to reduce chemicals usage. It also utilizes internet-connected dynamic sensors to remotely detect pest captures. These innovations enable the company to plan routes efficiently for pest collection, reduce travel mileage, and consequently lower carbon emissions. The scheme results in a net carbon emission of only 0.36 kg of CO2 equivalent per dollar of net sales, comparable to low-carbon industries such as legal services and software publishing.\n\n(ii) The HKMA invested in green and sustainable warehouses. Although the construction industry is a major source of carbon emissions, the warehouse developers implement net-zero CO2 emissions procedures and set standards and indicators for measuring these standards. Building plans also consider the sustainability of materials and components used. As a result, the warehouses have high carbon reduction efficiency and possess features such as solar thermal heating systems, electric vehicle charging facilities, natural lighting, and rainwater harvesting.\n\nAccording to an independent assessment, the carbon footprint of these warehouses is approximately 25.8% lower than that of typical logistics warehouses.

{"zh": "# 外匯基金\n\n# 審計署署長報告\n\n# 獨立審計師報告致財政司司長\n\n# 意見\n\n茲證明我已審計列載於第187至289頁外匯基金及其附屬公司（「集團」）的財務報表，該等財務報表包括外匯基金及集團於2020年12月31日的資產負債表與截至該日止年度的收支帳目、全面收益表、權益變動表和現金流量表，以及財務報表的附註，包括主要會計政策概要。\n\n我認為，該等財務報表已按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》真實而中肯地反映外匯基金及集團於2020年12月31日的財務狀況及截至該日止年度的財務表現和現金流量，並已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》（第66章）第7條下所發出的指示妥為擬備。\n\n# 意見的基礎\n\n我已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示及審計署的審計準則進行審計。我根據該等準則而須承擔的責任，詳載於本報告「審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任」部分。根據該等準則，我獨立於集團，並已按該等準則履行其他道德責任。我相信，我所獲得的審計憑證是充足和適當地為我的審計意見提供基礎。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項是根據我的專業判斷，對截至2020年12月31日止年度財務報表的審計最為重要的事項。我對整體財務報表進行審計及形成意見時處理了這些事項，而我不會對這些事項提供單獨的意見。\n\n# 其他資料\n\n金融管理專員須對其他資料負責。其他資料包括金融管理局2020年年報內的所有資料，但不包括財務報表及我的審計師報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見並不涵蓋其他資料，我亦不對其他資料發表任何形式的鑒證結論。\n\n就財務報表審計而言，我有責任閱讀其他資料，從而考慮其他資料是否與財務報表或我在審計過程中得悉的情況有重大矛盾，或者似乎存有重大錯誤陳述。基於我已執行的工作，如果我認為其他資料存有重大錯誤陳述，我需要報告該事實。在這方面，我沒有任何報告。\n\n# 金融管理專員及外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會就財務報表而須承擔的責任\n\n金融管理專員須負責按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》及行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示擬備真實而中肯的財務報表，及落實其認為必要的內部控制， 使財務報表不存有因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在擬備財務報表時，金融管理專員須負責評估集團持續經營的能力，以及在適用情況下披露與持續經營有關的事項，並以持續經營作為會計基礎。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會負責監督集團的財務報告過程。\n\n# 審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任\n\n我的目標是就整體財務報表是否不存有任何因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述取得合理保證，並發出包括我意見的審計師報告。合理保證是高水平的保證，但不能確保按審計署審計準則進行的審計定能發現所存有的任何重大錯誤陳述。錯誤陳述可以由欺詐或錯誤引起，如果合理預期它們個別或滙總起來可能影響財務報表使用者所作出的經濟決定，則會被視作重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在根據審計署審計準則進行審計的過程中，我會運用專業判斷並秉持專業懷疑態度。我亦會：\n- 識別和評估因欺詐或錯誤而導致財務報表存有重大錯誤陳述的風險；設計及執行審計程序以應對這些風險；以及取得充足和適當的審計憑證，作為我意見的基礎。由於欺詐可能涉及串謀、偽造、蓄意遺漏、虛假陳述，或凌駕內部控制的情況，因此未能發現因欺詐而導致重大錯誤陳述的風險，較未能發現因錯誤而導致者為高；\n- 了解與審計相關的內部控制，以設計適當的審計程序。然而，此舉並非旨在對集團內部控制的有效性發表意見；\n- 評價金融管理專員所採用的會計政策是否恰當，以及其作出的會計估計和相關資料披露是否合理；\n- 判定金融管理專員以持續經營作為會計基礎的做法是否恰當，並根據所得的審計憑證，判定是否存在與事件或情況有關，而且可能對集團持續經營的能力構成重大疑慮的重大不確定性。如果我認為存在重大不確定性，則有必要在審計師報告中請使用者留意財務報表中的相關資料披露。假若所披露的相關資料不足，我便須發出非無保留意見的審計師報告。我的結論是基於截至審計師報告日止所取得的審計憑證。然而，未來事件或情況可能導致集團不能繼續持續經營；\n- 評價財務報表的整體列報方式、結構和內容，包括披露資料，以及財務報表是否中肯反映交易和事項；及\n- 就集團中實體或業務活動的財務資料獲取充足和適當的審計憑證，以對財務報表發表意見。我負責指導、監督和執行集團審計。我對我的審計意見承擔全部責任。\n\n我會與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通計劃的審計範圍和時間以及重大審計發現等事項，包括我在審計期間識別出內部控制的任何重大缺陷。\n\n我亦會向外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會提交聲明，說明我已符合有關獨立性的相關道德要求，並與他們溝通所有被合理認為可能會影響我獨立性的關係和其他事項，以及在適用的情況下，相關的防範措施。\n\n從與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通的事項中，我會決定哪些事項對本期財務報表的審計最為重要，因而構成關鍵審計事項。我會在審計師報告中描述這些事項，除非法律法規不允許對某件事項作出公開披露，或在極端罕見的情況下，因為有合理預期在我報告中溝通某事項而造成的負面後果將會超過其產生的公眾利益而我決定不應在報告中溝通該事項。\n\n審計署署長\n朱乃璋\n\n2021年4月1日\n\n# 1 主要業務\n\n金融管理專員根據財政司司長以外匯基金（基金）管理人身分授予的權力，按照《外匯基金條例》（第66章）的條文管理基金。基金的主要業務為捍衛港元匯率及維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定健全。\n\n基金的資產分作四個不同的組合來管理：支持組合、投資組合、長期增長組合及策略性資產組合。根據香港的貨幣發行局制度，支持組合的資產與貨幣基礎完全相配。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債券及股票市場。長期增長組合持有私募股權及房地產投資。策略性資產組合持有香港特別行政區（香港特區）政府為策略目的而購入，並列入基金的帳目內的香港交易及結算所有限公司的股票。經營分部資料載於附註32。\n\n# 2 主要會計政策\n\n# 2.1 符合準則聲明\n\n本財務報表是按照香港財務報告準則（此乃綜合詞彙，包括香港會計師公會頒布的所有適用個別香港財務報告準則、香港會計準則及詮釋）及香港公認會計原則而編製。有關基金及其附屬公司（統稱為「集團」）所採納的主要會計政策摘要如下。\n\n香港會計師公會頒布了若干新增或經修訂的香港財務報告準則並於集團的本會計期首次生效或可供提前採納。集團因首次採納其中適用的準則而引致本會計期及前會計期的會計政策改變（如有）已反映在本財務報表，有關資料載於附註3。\n\n# 2.2 財務報表的編製基準\n\n集團財務報表包括集團的財務報表，以及集團於聯營公司及合營公司的權益。主要附屬公司、聯營公司及合營公司的主要業務載於附註17及18。\n\n本財務報表的編製基準是按原值成本法計量，惟下述按公平值計量的資產及負債除外：\n- 衍生金融工具（附註2.6）；\n- 按公平值計入收支帳目的金融資產及金融負債（附註2.6）；\n- 按公平值計入其他全面收益的金融資產（附註2.6）；\n- 黃金（附註2.10）；及\n- 投資物業（附註2.11）。\n\n編製符合香港財務報告準則的財務報表需要管理層作出判斷、估計及假設，而有關判斷、估計及假設會影響會計政策的採納及資產、負債、收入及支出的呈報數額。此等估計及相關的假設是根據以往經驗及其他在有關情況下認為合適的因素而制定。在欠缺其他現成數據的情況下，則採用此等估計及假設作為判斷有關資產及負債的帳面值的基準，估計結果與實際價值或有不同。\n\n此等估計及相關假設將不斷檢討修訂。如作出的修訂只影響本會計期，有關修訂會在該期間內確認，但如影響本期及未來的會計期，有關修訂便會在該期及未來期間內確認。\n\n管理層就採納香港財務報告準則所作出對財務報表有重大影響的判斷以及估計不確定性的主要來源於附註2.19披露。\n\n若干2019年的比較數字已重新分類，以配合本年度集團財務報表的呈報方式。\n\n# 2.3 附屬公司及非控股權益\n\n附屬公司指集團所控制的實體。如集團因其參與該實體的營運而承擔有關浮動回報的風險或享有有關權利，且有能力對該實體行使權力而影響該等回報時，即屬擁有該實體的控制權。在評估集團是否擁有權力時，只考慮由集團及其他方所持有的實質權利。\n", "en": "# Exchange Fund\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit\n\n# Auditor’s Report to the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI hereby certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (the \"Group\") from pages 187 to 289, which comprise the balance sheet of the Exchange Fund and the Group as at December 31, 2020, and the income and expenditure account, comprehensive income statement, statement of changes in equity, and cash flow statement for the year then ended, together with the notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Exchange Fund and the Group as at December 31, 2020, and their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directives issued by the Chief Executive under Section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for Opinion\n\nI have conducted my audit in accordance with the directives issued by the Chief Executive under Section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the auditing standards of the Department of Audit. My responsibilities under those standards are described in the “Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements” section of this report. Those standards require that I comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Details of the procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. I believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements of the year ended December 31, 2020. These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and I do not provide separate opinions on these matters.\n\n# Other Information\n\nThe Financial Secretary is responsible for other information. Other information comprises all the information included in the Annual Report of the Office of the Commissioner of the Monetary Authority of Hong Kong for 2020, but does not include the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. \n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read this other information identified above to consider whether it is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I report that I believe there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report this fact. I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Financial Management Officer and the Audit Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the Financial Statements\n\nThe Financial Management Officer is responsible for preparing true and fair financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants and directives issued by the Chief Executive under Section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for implementing internal controls that the Officer deems necessary to ensure that the financial statements do not contain any material misstatements due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Financial Management Officer must evaluate the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclose related matters if necessary, and use the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\n\nMy objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Department of Audit’s standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nIn performing an audit in accordance with the Department of Audit’s standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. I also:\n\n- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and gather sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for error, as fraud may involve collusion, falsification, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or override of internal controls.\n- Obtain an understanding of internal controls relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures, but not to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls.\n- Evaluate whether the accounting policies adopted by management are appropriate and whether the accounting estimates and related disclosures are reasonable.\n- Conclude on whether management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting is appropriate, and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether there are material uncertainties related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude there is a material uncertainty, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements. If disclosures are inadequate, I am required to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report; however, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease continuing as a going concern.\n- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure, and content of the financial statements, including disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events fairly.\n- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for directing, supervising, and performing the audit, and I bear all the audit’s substantive and overall audit responsibility.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding the scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control identified during the audit.\n\nI also communicate with the Audit Committee regarding my independence and any relationships or other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, in accordance with relevant ethical requirements, and to provide any safeguards that are applicable.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Committee, I determine which are the most significant for the audit of the current-year financial statements and therefore constitute key audit matters. I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure, or in extremely rare cases, I decide that the adverse consequences of disclosing a particular matter would outweigh the public interest benefits of such disclosure.\n\nThe Director of Audit\n朱乃璋\n\nApril 1, 2021"}

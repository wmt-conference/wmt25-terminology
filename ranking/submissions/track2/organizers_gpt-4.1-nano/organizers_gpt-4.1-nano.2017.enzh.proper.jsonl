{"en": "# Chief Executive’s Statement\n\nIn 2017, the global economy and financial markets performed much better than expected: the real economy saw steady growth; inflation remained subdued; the three interest rate hikes and the reduction in the balance sheet by the US Federal Reserve during the year did not result in capital outflows from emerging market economies or a strengthening of the US dollar. Amid bullish sentiment, global stock markets, including the three major US stock indices, kept hitting new highs. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index surged by 34%. The Hang Seng Index gained nearly 8,000 points (or 36%) in 2017 and surpassed the 30,000-point level to reach an all-time high in January 2018.\n\nMany investors were filled with optimism, even exuberance, in such a favourable environment. However, this was until early February this year when the latest data showed a higher than expected wage increase in the US, prompting investors to reappraise inflation risks and triggering significant corrections to global stock markets. The Dow Jones Index fell more than 1,000 points in two days during the second week of February, and the Hang Seng Index dropped more than 3,000 points in the same week. The 10-year US Treasury yield surged to as high as 2.95%. The swift reversal of fund flows indicated that the record high market valuation was not built on a solid foundation. It also reminded us of the importance of a sound and robust financial system for Hong Kong to meet the challenges brought by asset market volatility and capital outflows.\n\n# Banking system resilience boosted by precautionary measures\n\nAs the saying goes, “prevention is better than cure”. The HKMA implemented further risk mitigation measures in 2017 to safeguard the stability of Hong Kong’s banking and financial systems. In May, we introduced the eighth round of countercyclical measures for banks’ mortgage loans and strengthened banks’ credit risk management on lending to property developers, with the aim of enhancing the banking system’s resilience to shocks arising from any downturn in the property market. With the several rounds of measures, the average loan-to-value ratio of new residential mortgage loans fell to 49% at the end of 2017 from 64% in September 2009, while the average debt servicing ratio also declined to 35% from 41% in August 2010.\n\nIn 2017, we established the Resolution Office to implement international standards on the resolution of non-viable financial institutions that are considered “too big to fail”. This will help prevent a recurrence of a global financial crisis similar to the one in 2008 where public money was used to save failing financial institutions, and will minimise the impact of their closures on the financial system, the economy and the community at large.\n\nRobust risk management is the cornerstone of steady and sustainable development of the banking sector. The liquidity ratio and capital adequacy ratio of Hong Kong’s banking system are well above the applicable statutory requirements and among the highest in the world. This undoubtedly reflects the high resilience of Hong Kong’s banking system. Indeed, the banking sector registered strong growth in 2017, with total loans increasing by 16%, while the asset quality also held up well. The classified loan ratio of retail banks fell to 0.54% from 0.72% in 2016, well below the long-term average of 2.2% since 2000. The banking industry’s overall return on equity (based on pre-tax operating profits) reached 11.74% in 2017, a very healthy level compared with other international financial centres.\n\n# Sound banking the key to long-term financial stability\n\nThe 2008 global financial crisis revealed the limitations of relying solely on rules and regulations to restrain the financial industry from pursuing profitability without regard to their primary responsibilities. In light of this, the HKMA has stepped up the promotion of “sound banking” practices in recent years, encouraging banks to develop and pursue good corporate culture and values. In particular, to address the issue of bank staff pursuing short-term profits at the expense of the long-term interests of their customers or banks, we are encouraging banks to put in place appropriate incentive systems that are in line with their corporate culture and values. As part of this campaign, we arranged the inaugural Annual Conference for Independent Non-Executive Directors (INEDs) in March 2017 to highlight the importance of establishing a good banking culture and to empower the INEDs to perform their oversight and monitoring roles more effectively.\n\nWith the support of the banking industry, 2017 was a successful year for the HKMA in the advancement of financial inclusion. Six physical bank branches and three mobile branches began operating in remote areas. The Hong Kong Association of Banks worked out an arrangement with EPS and a convenience store chain to launch a pilot scheme allowing the elderly to withdraw cash from the stores in remote areas without the need to make purchases. Hongkong Post is also launching this year a cash withdrawal service for the elderly at seven Post Offices mainly on outlying islands and in the New Territories. Regarding account opening, the HKMA last year set up a webpage and an email account with a dedicated team to follow up public enquiries or complaints relating to the opening of bank accounts. Thanks to the concerted efforts of various stakeholders, there has been a significant improvement in customer experience in opening individual and corporate bank accounts.\n\n# Fintech a game changer for the banking industry\n\nIn an era of rapid technological advancement, fintech has been gradually integrated into our daily lives. In this ever changing technological environment, banks must embrace new developments and pursue innovation in their application of fintech. With the new era of Smart Banking, the HKMA launched seven initiatives in September (see page 106 for details) promoting the adoption of fintech in banking to improve the quality of banking products and services for customers. While these initiatives are independent of one another, they are complementary and will be a game changer for the future landscape of payment and banking services in Hong Kong. Customers will not only enjoy more convenient, efficient and secure payment and banking services, they will also have more choices and greater control over their financial transactions. Fintech will be the key to banks’ future business success, and moving into the new era of Smart Banking will be a great opportunity for the banks to upgrade and transform themselves.\n\n# Enormous opportunities created by the Belt and Road and the Bay Area Initiatives\n\nWith competition among international financial centres becoming more intense, a diversified financial industry is of paramount importance to Hong Kong. In 2017, the HKMA stepped up its work on enhancing Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre. Given Hong Kong’s unparalleled advantage of “having the Mainland as our hinterland while maintaining an international outlook”, the Belt and Road Initiative and the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Bay Area (Bay Area) will offer enormous opportunities for the financial and banking sectors and give new impetus to the economic growth of Hong Kong. The HKMA Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office, which was established in response to the Belt and Road Initiative, saw the number of its partners grow to around 90 since launch, laying a solid foundation for promoting Hong Kong as a financing hub for infrastructure investments. The issuance of the first Belt and Road bond in Hong Kong by the China Development Bank in 2017 highlighted the pivotal role Hong Kong can play in facilitating the financing of these infrastructure projects.\n\nIn addition to infrastructure financing, we are actively involved in the development of Hong Kong as a hub for corporate treasury centres, private equity funds and Asian derivatives businesses, by attracting multinational corporations and major financial institutions to manage their funds, assets and various financial risks in the city. These initiatives will further consolidate and upgrade Hong Kong’s financial and related professional services sectors. The HKMA also maintains close dialogue with the relevant authorities responsible for the development of the Bay Area to strengthen collaboration with a view to contributing to the financial development of the area as a world-class city cluster.\n\nOver the years, Hong Kong’s financial industry has been developing under the theme of “leveraging Hong Kong’s advantages, meeting the country’s needs”. With the introduction of the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect in 2014, the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect in 2016 and the Northbound Trading of Bond Connect in July last year, the mutual market access between the Mainland and the rest of the world through Hong Kong’s financial platform has been expanded from stock markets to bond markets. This underscores Hong Kong’s unique role as a financial intermediary in facilitating global investors’ access to the Mainland’s financial markets. In 2017, Hong Kong maintained its position as the leading global hub for offshore renminbi business. Average daily turnover of the renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement system stood at RMB900 billion. In addition, according to SWIFT statistics, more than 70% of global renminbi payment transactions were handled through Hong Kong during the year. The offshore renminbi market continued to operate smoothly and develop steadily.\n\n# Nurturing talent to strengthen the soft power of the banking industry\n\nWith the continuing growth of the financial industry, nurturing talent is crucial to its sustainable development. The HKMA attaches great importance to the soft power of the banking industry, and we have been encouraging and supporting ongoing capacity building of banking practitioners. Following the introduction of two modules on anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism and cybersecurity under the Enhanced Competency Framework, we expanded its coverage last year by including retail wealth management and treasury management to enhance the level of core competence of banking practitioners through continuing professional development. The HKMA is also committed to nurturing young talent for the banking industry. In 2017, we launched the Pilot Apprenticeship Programme for Private Wealth Management and the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme in collaboration with the industry. Given the overwhelming response, the coverage of these programmes will be further expanded in the future.\n\n# Prudent investment strategy achieving a reasonable and stable return over the medium to long term\n\nOn the back of strong global economic growth, the Exchange Fund achieved a record high investment income of HK$264 billion last year with gains across the board, including equities, bonds and foreign exchange. The overall investment return was 7.4%. The Investment Portfolio achieved a rate of return of 12.1%, while the Backing Portfolio gained 1.8%. The Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP)’s annualised internal rate of return since its inception in 2009 reached as high as 13.7%. While the investment performance last year was satisfactory, the increasingly complex investment environment requires the HKMA to continue its prudent management of the Exchange Fund. We will remain agile and nimble, monitor market developments closely and deploy defensive measures as and when appropriate. Investments under the LTGP will also be further expanded. As always, the investment principle of “capital preservation first, long-term growth next” within acceptable risk levels will be adhered to when managing the wealth for the people of Hong Kong.\n\nWhile the global real economy is extending last year’s growth momentum, uncertainties and risks still abound in 2018. These include a faster-than-expected pace of US interest rate hikes in case inflation picks up, escalating trade frictions and a deteriorating geopolitical landscape. Should these downside risks materialise, they will have significant and widespread implications for global financial markets, and knock-on effects for Hong Kong’s fund flows, asset prices and real economy. It is therefore advisable that we should all manage the risks prudently.\n\nIn the coming months, it is likely Hong Kong dollar interest rate movements will remain in the spotlight. The US Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times since December 2015. With widening spreads between Hong Kong dollar interest rates and their US dollar counterparts, there is a greater incentive for funds to flow from the Hong Kong dollar into the US dollar. The Hong Kong dollar has been under weakening pressure recently and the 7.85 weak-side Convertibility Undertaking (CU) has been triggered. As we have repeatedly stated, when the 7.85 weak-side CU is triggered, the HKMA will act as a “super money changer” by buying Hong Kong dollars and selling US dollars in the market to ensure that the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate will not weaken beyond the 7.85 level. Such operations are normal and in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System. This should not cause any concern. Indeed, the Exchange Fund currently holds more than HK$4 trillion worth of assets, of which the Hong Kong dollar Monetary Base amounts to about HK$1.7 trillion, providing a strong buffer in the event of fund outflows. Over the years, the HKMA has put in place various lines of defence to safeguard the stability of the banking and financial systems. From a positive perspective, capital outflows will lead to a gradual increase in Hong Kong dollar interest rates, which will be conducive to the normalisation of the interest rate environment in Hong Kong and hence the sustainable development of the local economy and asset markets. During this process, the HKMA will stay vigilant and make every effort to maintain monetary and banking stability in Hong Kong.\n", "zh": "# 行政長官的聲明\n\n2017年，全球經濟和金融市場的表現遠超預期：實體經濟穩步增長；通脹保持低迷；年內美國聯邦儲備局三次加息及縮減資產負債表並未引致新興市場資金外流或美元走強。在看漲情緒帶動下，全球股市，包括美國三大股指，不斷創出新高。MSCI新興市場指數猛升34%。恒生指數在2017年升幅接近8,000點（或36%），並在2018年1月突破30,000點大關，創下歷史新高。\n\n許多投資者在這樣一個有利的環境中充滿樂觀，甚至是亢奮的心情。然而，況至今年二月初，最新數據顯示美國工資增長超出預期，促使投資者重新評估通脹風險，引發全球股市大幅修正。二月第二週，道瓊斯工業平均指數兩日內跌逾1,000點，恒生指數同期則暴跌逾3,000點。十年期美國國債收益率升至2.95%。資金流動的迅速反轉顯示，市場的歷史高估值並非建立在堅實的基礎上，也提醒我們，香港擁有一個健全和穩健的金融系統，方能應對資產市場波動和資金外 flowing 所帶來的挑戰。\n\n# 以預防措施增強銀行體系韌性\n\n俗話說：「預防勝於治療」。金管局在2017年進一步實施風險緩解措施，以維護香港金融體系的穩定。今年五月，我們推出第八輪逆周期措施，針對銀行抵押貸款並加強對銀行向發展商提供信貸的管理，旨在提升銀行體系應對房市調整的韌性。通過多輪措施，新住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數（loan-to-value ratio）由2009年9月的64%降至2017年底的49%，而債務償還比率（debt servicing ratio）亦由2010年8月的41%調低至35%。\n\n2017年，我們成立了處置辦公室，執行國際對「過大而不能倒」的金融機構的處置標準，助力預防類似2008年全球金融危機的重演，避免公共資金援救倒閉的金融機構，並最大程度地減少其結束運作對金融系統、經濟及社會的影響。\n\n堅實的風險管理是銀行業穩健可持續發展的基石。香港銀行體系的流動性比率和資本充足率遠高於法定要求，皆位居世界前列，充分反映其高韌性。實際上，2017年銀行業錄得強勁增長，總貸款增加16%，資產質素亦表現良好。零售銀行分類貸款比率由2016年的0.72%降至0.54%，遠低於自2000年以來長期的平均2.2%。整體而言，銀行業的平均股東權益回報率（基於稅前經營溢利）達到11.74%，在國際金融中心中屬高水平。\n\n# 健全銀行為長遠金融穩定的關鍵\n\n2008年全球金融危機揭示了僅依靠規則和法規限制金融行業追求盈利，忽視其核心責任的局限性。在此背景下，金管局近年來大力推廣「健全銀行」實踐，鼓勵銀行締造良好的企業文化與價值觀。特別是為了解決銀行員工為追求短期利潤而忽視客戶或行業長遠利益的問題，我們鼓勵銀行建立符合法文化和價值觀的激勵制度。2017年三月，我們舉辦了首屆獨立非執行董事（INEDs）年會，強調建立良好銀行文化的重要性，並賦能INEDs更有效履行其監督與監控角色。\n\n在銀行業界的支持下，2017年是金管局推動金融包容的重要成果年。六個實體分行和三個流動分行在偏遠地區啟動營運。香港銀行公會與快銀和便利店連鎖合作，推出試點方案，讓長者無需購物即可在偏遠地區的店鋪取款。今年，香港郵政亦將在新界及離島的七個郵政局推出長者取款服務。在開戶方面，去年我們建立了一個專門的網頁和電郵帳戶，並配備專責團隊，跟進有關開戶的公眾查詢和投訴。在多方共同努力下，個人和企業開立銀行帳戶的客戶體驗取得顯著改善。\n\n# 金融科技為銀行業帶來變革\n\n在科技快速發展的時代，金融科技已逐步融入我們的日常生活。在這個不斷變革的科技環境中，銀行必須擁抱新技術，推動創新應用金融科技。隨著智慧銀行時代的來臨，金管局於九月推行七項措施（詳見第106頁），促進金融科技在銀行業的應用，以提升產品和服務質素。這些措施雖相互獨立，卻相互補充，將對香港未來支付和銀行服務版圖產生重大變革。顧客不僅可以享受更便捷、高效和安全的支付與銀行服務，亦能擁有更多選擇，更好掌控自己的金融交易。金融科技將是銀行未來成功的關鍵，邁向智慧銀行新時代亦是銀行升級轉型的良機。\n\n# 一帶一路和粵港澳大灣區倡議帶來巨大機遇\n\n隨著國際金融中心競爭日益激烈，多元化的金融產業對香港尤為重要。2017年，金管局加強提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。憑藉「內地作為後盾、保持國際視野」的獨特優勢，一帶一路倡議和粵港澳大灣區建設，將為金融及銀行業帶來豐富機遇，為香港經濟增長注入新動力。由於響應一帶一路，金管局成立的基建融資促進辦公室自成立以來合作夥伴已擴展至約90家，奠定了香港作為基建投資融資中心的堅實基礎。2017年，中國國家開發銀行在香港發行的首批一帶一路債券，更彰顯了香港在促進這些基建項目融資方面的關鍵角色。\n\n除了基建融資，我們積極促進粵港澳大灣區作為企業財資中心、私募股權基金與亞洲衍生工具業務樞紐的發展，吸引跨國企業和主要金融機構在本地管理資金、資產及多種金融風險，進一步鞏固並升級香港的金融及相關專業服務產業。金管局亦與有關部門保持密切對話，以加強合作，共同推動大灣區的金融發展，打造世界一流的城市群。\n\n多年來，香港的金融業一直在「充分發揮優勢、配合國家需求」的主題指引下發展。自2014年推出滬港通，2016年推出深港通，及去年七月推出北向通以來，滬港通、深港通及債券通三條互聯互通渠道，從股票市場擴展至債券市場，突顯香港作為全球資金流入內地金融市場的獨特中介角色。2017年，香港依然是離岸人民幣業務的全球主要中心，人民幣即時支付結算系統的日均成交額達人民幣9000億元；根據SWIFT統計，去年超過70%的全球人民幣支付交易均通過香港處理。離岸人民幣市場運作平穩，持續穩健發展。\n\n# 培育人才，強化銀行業的軟實力\n\n隨著金融行業的不斷擴大，人才培育是可持續發展的關鍵。金管局高度重視銀行業的軟實力，並持續推動和支援行內能力建設。去年，我們在增強資歷架構下完善了兩個 modules，包括反洗錢與反恐融資，以及網絡保安，並加入零售財富管理和財資管理以提升從業員的核心能力。金管局亦致力培育年輕人才，去年推出私房財富管理見習計劃和金融科技人才培育計劃，並獲行業熱烈響應，計劃範圍將在未來進一步擴展。\n\n# 審慎投資策略在中長期實現合理穩定回報\n\n憑藉全球經濟的強勁增長，外匯基金去年創出歷史新高，投資收益達港幣2640億元，涵蓋股票、債券和外匯等多個範疇，整體回報率為7.4%。投資組合的回報率達12.1%，而支持資產組合則回報1.8%。自2009年成立以來，長期增長組合（LTGP）的年化內部回報率高達13.7%。儘管去年投資表現令人滿意，但不斷變化與愈加複雜的投資環境，要求金管局繼續審慎管理外匯基金。我們將保持敏捷，密切關注市場動向，適時採取保守措施。同時，LTGP的投資規模將進一步擴大。在管理香港人民財富時，始終將「資本優先、長遠增值」及在可接受風險範圍內的投資原則持續貫徹。\n\n隨著全球實體經濟延續去年增長動能，2018年仍充滿不確定與風險，包括美國加息步伐可能超出預期、貿易摩擦升級，以及地緣政治局勢惡化。如若這些下行風險成真，將對全球金融市場產生重大廣泛影響，並牽動香港資金流向、資產價格和實體經濟。故此，我們必須審慎管理各類風險。\n\n未來數月，美元利率走勢將仍是焦點。自2015年12月以來，美聯儲已六次加息，伴隨美元與港元利差擴大，資金流向美元的誘因增加。近期，港元持續承受壓力，7.85弱方兌換保證（CU）已被觸發。正如我們一再強調，當7.85弱方CU觸發時，金管局將行動如「超級買銀紙大王」，透過買入港元和市場賣出美元，確保港元匯率不會突破7.85水平。這些操作屬於正常範圍，並符合聯匯制度的設計，無需擔憂。事實上，外匯基金目前持有超過港幣4兆元資產，其中港元貨幣基礎約為港幣1.7兆，形成強大的緩衝。多年來，金管局已建立多條防線，保障銀行和金融系統的穩定。從積極角度分析，資金外流將促使港元利率逐步上升，有助於香港利率環境的正常化，從而促進本地經濟和資產市場的可持續發展。在此過程中，金管局將保持警覺，竭力維持貨幣和銀行體系的穩定。"}

{"en": "# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nAgainst the backdrop of a more synchronised expansion of the global economy, Hong Kong saw faster economic growth, tighter labour market conditions and subdued inflationary pressures in 2017. Economic growth for 2018 is expected to remain solid.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Real activities\n\nAmid a more synchronised expansion of the global economy, the Hong Kong economy grew faster in 2017. Growth in real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increased to 3.8%, much higher than the 2.1% growth in 2016 and the long-term growth of about 3% over the past decade (Chart 1 and Table 1). Domestic demand firmed up, with private consumption growth accelerating and overall investment spending reviving. Stronger domestic demand reflected favourable job and income conditions, booming asset prices and improved business sentiment. Externally, Hong Kong’s exports of goods expanded at a faster pace due to increased global trade flows, and exports of services recovered because of vibrant trade and cargo flows and improving inbound tourism. Imports of goods recorded stronger growth on export-induced demand, and imports of services increased steadily amid strong travel interest among residents. On a net basis, the overall trade surplus shrank, making a negative contribution to GDP growth.\n\n\n# Monetary conditions\n\nOn the monetary front, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate generally eased against the US dollar driven primarily by interest rate arbitrage activities amid the negative interest rate differentials between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar. This reflected the normal functioning of the Linked Exchange Rate System in accordance with its design. While still at relatively low levels, Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates faced more upward pressures towards the end of 2017 due to Initial Public Offeringrelated funding demand and banks’ year-end liquidity needs. For credit growth, after two years of single-digit growth, total bank loans increased at a notably faster pace of 16.1% in 2017, reflecting improving economic conditions and positive financial market sentiment. Despite faster loan growth, there were no signs of loosening of banks’ credit underwriting standards, and overall loan quality remained good.\n\n# Inflation\n\nInflationary pressures remained well contained throughout 2017 (Chart 2). Netting out the effects of the Government’s one-off relief measures, the underlying inflation rate declined to 1.7%, down from 2.3% in 2016. In particular, the housing component of the price index increased at a milder pace, reflecting the filter-through of slower increases in fresh-letting private residential rentals in 2016. More broadly, milder increases in nominal wages and earnings amid strong output growth helped keep local cost pressures in check. Import price inflation was also tame, in line with low inflation in Hong Kong’s major import sources despite a weaker US dollar.\n\n# Labour market\n\nThe labour market tightened in 2017 along with above-par economic growth. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell from 3.4% in 2016 to 2.9% towards the end of 2017, below 3% for the first time in nearly 20 years (Chart 3). Most major economic sectors registered decreases in their respective unemployment rates, with more notable declines seen in the retail, financing and professional and business services sectors. As total employment grew faster and the number of private-sector vacancies picked up, overall labour demand continued to strengthen. The labour force also expanded, partly reflecting more active participation of older-age workers (aged 55 and above). Consistent with tighter labour market conditions and lower inflation, real wages and earnings saw faster increases.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe Hong Kong stock market had an almost uninterrupted rally in 2017. The Hang Seng Index rose by 36%, the largest annual gain since 2010 (Chart 4). The rally reflected optimism about the global economy and corporate earnings, and was in part supported by substantial fund inflows from Mainland investors through the Stock Connects. The Hang Seng Index hit a ten-year high in November and remained at high levels towards the end of 2017. Average daily turnover expanded to HK$88.3 billion from HK$66.9 billion in the previous year, and overall equity funds raised from the local market also increased to HK$581.4 billion, compared with HK$490.1 billion a year earlier.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market maintained its upward momentum throughout the year (Chart 4). Transaction volume expanded from 54,701 units a year ago to 61,591 units and housing prices increased by 14.8% in 2017. Housing affordability stretched further, with a price-toincome ratio of 16.4, higher than the previous peak in 1997, and an income-gearing ratio of 74.1, far above its long-term average.1 In view of rising property prices and the intensifying competition for mortgage business among banks, the HKMA introduced the eighth round of prudential measures in May to strengthen banks’ risk management and safeguard banking stability. Housing price growth moderated temporarily following these measures before accelerating in the fourth quarter. As for the commercial and industrial property markets, trading activities increased significantly during the year, with both transaction value and volume registering double-digit growth. With the pick-up in non-residential property prices, corresponding rental yields fell slightly compared to the previous year.\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nEconomic growth for 2018 is expected to remain solid. The Government forecasts growth in the range of 3–4%, while private-sector analysts project the economy to expand at an average rate of 3.2%. Externally, Hong Kong’s export performance will continue to benefit from the improving global growth outlook and the gradual recovery in inbound tourism. Domestically, private consumption growth is expected to hold up mainly as a result of favourable labour market conditions. As for fixed capital formation, building and construction activity should progress steadily on the back of rising housing supply and continuing infrastructure projects. While improved economic conditions will support business capital spending, headwinds may come from potential rises in interest rates.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nWith still-moderate global inflation and steady increase in local costs, inflationary pressures in Hong Kong are anticipated to remain moderate in 2018, but the inflation rate is likely to pick up gradually from the low in 2017. For example, the rental component of inflation may gather momentum in the latter part of 2018 because of feedthrough from increases in fresh-letting private residential rentals. Market consensus predicts the headline inflation rate to be a still-moderate 2.2% for 2018, and the Government projects the underlying inflation rate to be 2.5%. On the other hand, sustained economic growth, expanding building and construction activity and the gradual recovery in inbound tourism are expected to keep the labour market tight in the near future. Private-sector analysts forecast the unemployment rate to stay at about 3.0% in 2018.\n\n# Uncertainties and risks\n\nThe economic outlook for 2018 is subject to a number of uncertainties and risks including those relating to major central banks’ monetary policy normalisation and global financial market stability, as well as heightened protectionist sentiment and deteriorating geopolitical tensions. In particular, if such risks materialise to trigger reversal of fund flows in Hong Kong, local monetary conditions could tighten faster than expected, putting downward pressures on the real economy and asset prices.\n\nThe outlook for the residential property market remains uncertain. In the near term, the current favourable domestic economic conditions, perceived housing shortage, low mortgage rates and alternative sources of home financing (including mortgage loans provided by property developers and financial support from parents), will continue to support the demand for properties. However, the recent sell-off in global financial markets may dampen sentiments. Over the longer term, the property market will continue to face a number of headwinds. In particular, as the US monetary policy normalisation continues, domestic mortgage rates will rise eventually. In addition, on the back of the Government’s effort to increase the supply of land and residential properties, the housing demand-supply gap is expected to narrow gradually, which would ease the upward pressure on property prices in the longer term.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector continued to be safe and sound in 2017 notwithstanding uncertainties surrounding the global economy. The capital and liquidity positions of authorized institutions (AIs) remained strong, asset quality stayed at healthy levels, and profitability improved notably thanks to increased interest margins and robust credit growth.\n\n# Interest rate trends\n\nAs the US interest rate normalisation continued, the onemonth and three-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) fixings increased by 49 basis points and 39 basis points respectively in 2017. More notable rises were observed in the fourth quarter. Nevertheless, the Hong Kong dollar funding cost of retail banks, as measured by the composite interest rate, remained broadly stable over the year (Chart 5).\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe aggregate pre-tax operating profits of retail banks’ Hong Kong offices grew by 15.8% in 2017. The improved performance was mainly due to increases in net interest income (+20.3%) and fee and commission income (+9.4%). However, these increases were partially offset by a decline in income from foreign exchange and derivatives operations (-29.9%) and a growth in operating expenses (+8.4%). The aggregate post-tax profit of retail banks dropped by 18.1% because of certain non-recurring items recorded in 2016. The post-tax return on average assets of retail banks dropped to 1.07% from 1.44% in 2016 (Chart 6).\n\nRetail banks’ net interest margin widened to 1.45% in 2017 from 1.32% in 2016 (Chart 7) mainly due to rising market interest rates.\n\nThe proportion of retail banks’ non-interest income to total operating income decreased to 40% from 44.3% in 2016. While fee and commission income increased by 9.4%, income originated from foreign exchange and derivatives operations dropped by 29.9%.\n\nRetail banks’ cost-to-income ratio declined to 41.9% in 2017 from 43.2% in 2016, as operating costs (+8.4%) increased at a slower pace than operating income (+11.8%) (Chart 8). Retail banks’ loan impairment charges decreased to HK$7.3 billion from HK$8 billion in 2016.\n\n# Asset quality\n\nLoan quality of retail banks improved during the year, with the classified loan ratio decreasing to 0.54% from 0.72% a year earlier. The overdue and rescheduled loan ratio also decreased to 0.4% from 0.53% in 2016 (Chart 9). Similarly, the classified loan ratio and the overdue and rescheduled loan ratio of the whole banking sector decreased to 0.67% and 0.52%, from 0.85% and 0.67% respectively.\n\nThe quality of banks’ residential mortgage lending portfolios remained good, with the delinquency ratio staying at a low level of 0.03% at the end of 2017 (Chart 10). The rescheduled loan ratio was close to 0%. There was no residential mortgage loan in negative equity at the end of the year, as compared with four cases a year ago.\n\nThe delinquency ratio of credit card lending stayed low at 0.22% at the end of 2017, compared with 0.24% a year ago (Chart 10). The combined delinquent and rescheduled loan ratio edged down to 0.31% from 0.33% during the period. The charge-off ratio also fell slightly to 1.75% from 1.92% in 2016.\n\n# Balance sheet trends\n\nTotal loans of the banking sector grew by 16.1% in 2017, compared with 6.5% in 2016. Demand for credit increased, driven by optimism about the global economic outlook. As total deposits increased at a slower pace than total loans, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio rose to 73% at the end of 2017 from 68.4% a year earlier. The Hong Kong-dollar loan-to-deposit ratio also increased to 82.7% from 77.1% during the same period (Chart 11).\n\nMainland-related lending (including loans booked in Mainland subsidiaries of locally incorporated banks) increased by 17.5% in 2017, compared with a growth of 7% recorded in 2016.\n\n# Holdings of negotiable debt securities\n", "zh": "# 經濟與金融環境\n\n在環球經濟同步擴張的背景下，香港在2017年經濟增長較快，勞動市場收緊，通脹壓力低迷。預計2018年的經濟增長仍將保持穩健。\n\n# 評述經濟情況\n\n# 實體活動\n\n在環球經濟同步擴張的情況下，香港經濟於2017年增長較快。經常帳本地GDP（國內生產總值）增長至3.8%，遠高於2016年的2.1%及過去十年的長期增長約3%（圖1及表1）。內需趨於堅實，私人消費增長加快，整體投資支出回暖。強勁的內需反映就業及收入情況良好、資產價格升勢旺盛及企業信心改善。在外部方面，香港貨物出口由於全球貿易流量增加而擴張速度加快，服務出口則因貿易和貨運流動活躍及入境旅遊業成長而復甦。貨物進口受出口導致的需求推動而增長較快，服務進口隨居民旅遊熱潮穩步上升。從淨出口角度看，整體貿易盈餘縮小，對GDP增長形成負面貢獻。\n\n# 貨幣條件\n\n在貨幣方面，港元兌美元匯率基本呈趨緩走勢，主要由於利率套利活動，反映港元與美元之間的利率差異為負，這是與聯絡匯率制度正常運作一致的表現。儘管仍處於較低水平，因首次公開招股（IPO）相關融資需求及銀行年末流動性需求，2017年底港元同業拆息面臨較大上行壓力。就信貸增長而言，連續兩年單位數增長後，2017年銀行貸款總額以16.1%的顯著速度上升，反映經濟情況改善及金融市場情緒向好。儘管貸款增幅加快，銀行的信貸審批標準並無鬆動，整體貸款質素保持良好。\n\n# 通脹\n\n2017年，通脹壓力得到良好控制（圖2）。扣除政府一次性紓困措施的影響，核心通脹率由2016年的2.3%下降至1.7%。住房價格指數中的住房組件較為溫和，反映2016年私人住宅租金新租金增幅放緩的傳導效果。更廣泛地看，名義工資及收入增長趨緩，有助於遏抑本地成本壓力。進口物價通脹亦較為溫和，與香港主要進口來源地的低通脹率一致，儘管美元走弱。\n\n# 勞動市場\n\n2017年伴隨經濟增長超越潛在水平，勞動市場趨於緊縮。經季節調整的失業率由2016年的3.4%降至2017年底的2.9%，首次跌破3%，為近20年來首次（圖3）。大多數主要經濟行業的失業率均有下降，零售、金融及專業及商業服務行業的降幅較為明顯。隨著就業人數加快增長及私營部門職位空缺回升，整體勞動需求持續改善。勞動力亦有所擴大，部分原因是較年長的就業者（55歲及以上）參與度提高。勞動市場收緊及通脹放緩的情況下，實質工資及收入加快增長。\n\n# 股票市場\n\n2017年，香港股市幾乎持續上揚。恒生指數升幅達36%，為2010年以來最大年度升幅（圖4）。這漲勢反映了對全球經濟和企業盈餘的樂觀預期，亦部分得益於內地投資者通過「港股通」大量資金流入。恒指於11月創下十年新高，並在年末保持在高位。平均每日成交額由去年的66.9億港元擴大至88.3億港元，整體本地股票基金募資額亦由4901億港元增加至5814億港元。\n\n#樓市\n\n住宅物業市場全年保持上升勢頭（圖4）。成交量由去年54,701個單位增加至61,591個，而房價則上升14.8%。樓市負擔能力進一步惡化，樓價對收入比率升至16.4，超出1997年的峰值，同時收入槓桿比率達74.1%，遠高於長期平均水平1。由於物業價格持續上升及銀行之間競爭激烈，金管局於5月推行第八輪審慎措施，以加強銀行風險管理，保障銀行體系穩定。措施後，房價增長暫時放緩，第三季度再度加快。至於商業及工商物業市場，交易活動顯著增加，成交價值及成交量均錄得雙位數升幅。隨著非住宅物業價格回升，相應的租金收益率較去年略有下降。\n\n# 經濟展望\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n預計2018年經濟增長將依然穩健。政府預測增長約在3%至4%的範圍內，私營部門分析師平均預測增長率約為3.2%。外部方面，港--------------準續受惠於全球增長前景改善及入境旅遊逐步復甦。內部方面，私人消費預計維持升勢，主要由於就業及收入條件良好。固定資本形成方面，隨住房供應增加及基建工程推進，建設活動將穩步進行。經濟狀況改善亦有助於企業資本支出，但可能受到利率上升的逆風影響。\n\n# 通脹與勞動市場\n\n由於全球通脹仍屬溫和，本地成本持續上升，預計2018年的通脹壓力將維持溫和，但較2017年底有逐步升高的趨勢。例如，租金組成部分可能在2018年後半段趨勢上升，因為新租房市場的租金漲幅傳導。市場預測整體通脹率在2018年約為2.2%，核心通脹率則約為2.5%。此外，持續的經濟增長、建設活動擴展及入境旅遊的逐步復甦預期將令勞動市場在短期內保持緊張。私營部門分析師預測失業率仍將維持在約3%的水平。\n\n# 不確定性與風險\n\n2018年的經濟展望存在若干不確定性和風險，包括主要中央銀行貨幣政策正常化及環球金融市場穩定性，亦包括保護主義情緒上升及地緣政治緊張局勢惡化。尤其是，若相關風險發生，引發資金流回轉港，則本地貨幣條件可能急劇收緊，對實體經濟和資產價格產生下行壓力。\n\n樓市前景仍充滿不確定性。短期內，現有有利的內部經濟狀況、房屋短缺的認知、低利率及其他家庭融資渠道（包括房地產發展商提供的按揭貸款及父母提供的資助）將繼續支持買家需求。然而，近期全球金融市場的拋售可能會影響市場情緒。長遠來看，房市將面臨多重逆風，特別是美國貨幣政策正常化進程持續推進，最終將帶動國內按揭利率上升。此外，隨著政府努力增加土地和住宅供應，住房需求與供應缺口有望逐步縮小，長期內將減輕物業價格上行的壓力。\n\n# 銀行業表現\n\n儘管環球經濟存在不確定性，香港銀行業在2017年仍保持安全穩健。認可機構的資本及流動性充足，資產質素維持健康，盈利顯著改善，主要得益於利差擴大及信貸增長強勁。\n\n# 利率趨勢\n\n隨著美國貨幣政策持續正常化，2017年一個月及三個月香港銀行同業拆息（HIBOR）分別上升49及39個基點。第四季度尤為顯著。然而，按一籃子衡量的港元融資成本（構建利率）全年大致持平（圖5）。\n\n# 盈利趨勢\n\n2017年，香港本地零售銀行在港的總體稅前經營利潤增長15.8%。其中，淨利息收入（+20.3%）和費用及佣金收入（+9.4%）的改善是主要原因。然而，這些增長部分被外匯及衍生產品業務收入（-29.9%）的下挫及營運開支（+8.4%）的上升所抵消。2016年度錄得的非經常性項目，使稅後總盈利較去年下跌18.1%。零售銀行的稅後平均資產回報率由1.44%降至1.07%（圖6）。\n\n由於市場利率上升，零售銀行的淨息差由2016年的1.32%擴大至2017年的1.45%（圖7）。\n\n零售銀行非利息收入佔營運總收入的比例由2016年的44.3%降低至40%。儘管費用及佣金收入增加了9.4%，但來自外匯及衍生產品的收入則下跌29.9%。\n\n零售銀行的費用與收入比率由2016年的43.2%下降至2017年的41.9%，主要因營運成本（+8.4%）較營收增長（+11.8%）的速度較慢（圖8）。貸款減值撥備由2016年的80億港元減少至73億港元。\n\n# 資產質素\n\n零售銀行的貸款質素在年內改善，分類貸款比率由去年的0.72%降至0.54%。逾期及重組貸款比率亦由0.53%降至0.4%（圖9）。整個銀行業的分類貸款比率及逾期重組貸款比率分別降至0.67%及0.52%，較去年分別為0.85%及0.67%。\n\n住宅按揭貸款組合的質素良好，年末拖欠比率維持在低水平的0.03%（圖10），重組貸款比率接近0%。年末沒有出現負資產的住宅按揭貸款案例，而去年則有四宗。\n\n信用卡貸款的拖欠比率亦較低，年末為0.22%，較去年0.24%略有下降（圖10）。拖欠及重組貸款總比率由0.33%降至0.31%。呆帳撥備率亦輕微下降至1.75%，去年為1.92%。\n\n# 資產負債表走勢\n\n2017年，銀行體系的總貸款額增長16.1%，而2016年為6.5%。信貸需求受益於對全球經濟展望的樂觀預期而上升。由於存款總額增長速度較貸款慢，年末整體貸款存款比率由去年68.4%升至73%。港元貸款存款比率亦由77.1%升至82.7%（圖11）。\n\n內地相關貸款（包括在內地子公司註冊的本地認可機構的貸款）2017年增長17.5%，而2016年則增長7%。"}
{"en": "# Monetary Stability\n\nDespite weakening pressure on the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to operate in an orderly manner with ample liquidity. The Linked Exchange Rate System has served as a strong anchor for Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability and proved to be highly resilient against various shocks.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability. This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n- Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three noteissuing banks\n- Government-issued notes and coins in circulation\n- the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of the clearing account balances of banks kept with the HKMA\n- Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the HKMA’s firm commitment to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs). When the demand for Hong Kong dollars is greater than the supply and the market exchange rate strengthens to the strong-side CU of HK$7.75 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to sell Hong Kong dollars to banks for US dollars. The Aggregate Balance will then expand to push down Hong Kong dollar interest rates, creating monetary conditions that move the Hong Kong dollar away from the strong-side limit to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if the supply of Hong Kong dollars is greater than the demand and the market exchange rate weakens to the weak-side CU of HK$7.85 to one US dollar, the HKMA will buy Hong Kong dollars from banks. The Aggregate Balance will then contract to drive Hong Kong dollar interest rates up, pushing the Hong Kong dollar away from the weak-side limit to stay within the Convertibility Zone.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2017\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate generally saw weakening pressure in 2017 (Chart 1). Driven mainly by interest carry trade activities amid widened negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates, the Hong Kong dollar eased gradually against the US dollar, from 7.7566 on 3 January to the year-low of 7.8265 on 22 August. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate gained some strength between late September and early November, underpinned by a tightening of Hong Kong dollar liquidity due to initial public offering (IPO)-related funding demand, and traded steadily within a narrow range of 7.80–7.81. Weakening pressures on the Hong Kong dollar were seen again towards the end of the year, partly reflecting slightly improved Hong Kong dollar liquidity conditions as well as increased year-end commercial demand for the US dollar. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market functioned normally throughout 2017.\n\nAs the CUs were not triggered, the total of the Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs remained virtually unchanged at around HK$1,225.3 billion in 2017 (Chart 2). During the year, the HKMA issued a total of HK$80 billion additional Exchange Fund Bills to meet banks’ increased demand for liquidity management. This led to a contraction of the Aggregate Balance to HK$179.8 billion at the end of 2017. The issuance of additional Exchange Fund Bills was consistent with Currency Board principles, as it only represented a change in the composition of the Monetary Base, with a shift from the Aggregate Balance to the outstanding EFBNs. The Monetary Base remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\n# Money market\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates stayed soft in the first eight months of 2017 before facing more upward pressure towards the end of the year (Chart 3). Despite concerns about the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes and balance sheet normalisation, the Hong Kong dollar interbank rates generally remained soft for the first eight months. As such, the negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates widened between January and August. From September onward, the shortdated Hong Kong dollar interbank rates witnessed large pick-ups, driven mainly by IPO-related and year-end funding demand. Correspondingly, the negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates narrowed in the short-dated segment. Overall, the short-dated interbank rates traded mostly below the Base Rate in 2017.\n\nThe Base Rate was adjusted upwards on 16 March, 15 June and 14 December, by a total of 75 basis points from 1.00% to 1.75%, as the target range for the US federal funds rate moved upward three times by a total of 75 basis points from 0.50–0.75% to 1.25–1.50% during the year. The adjustment of the Base Rate was in accordance with the revised formula announced on 26 March 2009, in which the Base Rate is set at either 50 basis points above the lower bound of the prevailing target range for the US federal funds rate or the average of the five-day moving averages of the overnight and one-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs), whichever is the higher.\n\nRoughly tracking the movements of the Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads, the discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points widened gradually during the first three quarters, with the 12-month Hong Kong dollar forward points reaching about -615 pips in midSeptember (Chart 4). In the fourth quarter, the discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points narrowed slightly along with the narrowing of the negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates. Overall, Hong Kong’s money market continued to operate in an orderly manner and interbank liquidity remained ample. Discount Window borrowing increased from HK$5.3 billion in 2016 to HK$10.3 billion in 2017.\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nSince its establishment in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has served as a strong anchor for Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, and proved to be highly resilient in a series of regional and global financial crises. The Government has reasserted its full commitment to the LERS and the credibility of its commitment was further reinforced by the stability in the foreign exchange and money markets. There is also continued strong public confidence in the Hong Kong dollar as a means of payment and a storage of value. In its 2017 Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund reaffirmed its support for the LERS, commenting that the LERS remained the best exchange rate arrangement for Hong Kong. Combined with robust financial supervision and regulation, prudent fiscal management, and flexible markets, the LERS has worked well to help Hong Kong navigate successfully through both external and domestic challenges.\n\nInternational Monetary Fund: “The Linked Exchange Rate System remains the best arrangement for Hong Kong.”\n\nA sound banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS. During 2017, the HKMA continued to monitor closely banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and stepped up its supervisory efforts on corporate, property-related and mainland-related lending to bolster the resilience of the banking sector. As the US Federal Reserve continues to normalise its monetary policy, the Hong Kong dollar interest rates will gradually normalise as well. The HKMA reiterated that, under the design of the LERS, the outflow of capital, the weakening of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, the triggering of the weak-side CU and the reduction of the Monetary Base are part of the necessary process of the normalisation of Hong Kong dollar interest rates. The HKMA also reminded the public to manage their risks prudently and be well prepared for potential financial turbulence.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio, defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base, moved within a range of 106.7–108.2% during 2017, without touching the Upper or Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 108.1% on 31 December (Chart 5). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. In the event of abrupt shocks, the sizeable amount of financial resources of the Exchange Fund will provide a powerful backstop in protecting Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\n# Other activities\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to the monetary and financial stability of Hong Kong. In 2017, the CBC considered various issues, including the drivers of short-run dynamics in Hong Kong’s housing prices, the determinants of HIBOR-London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) spreads, the effect of property valuation changes on corporate borrowing in Mainland China, and the effect of mortgage debt service burden on private consumption in Hong Kong. Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and the reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research (HKIMR) continued to sponsor research in the fields of monetary policy, banking and finance. Over the past three years, the HKIMR has been re-orienting its activities towards higher policy relevance. This is reflected, in particular, in its conference activities and visiting fellowship programmes. The HKIMR has been collaborating with major central banks and policy institutions to jointly organise more policyfocused conferences. Meanwhile, a thematic research fellowship programme introduced in 2016 has been supporting more research projects related to policy issues that are of importance to the HKMA.\n\nIn 2017, the HKIMR hosted 18 research fellows and published 29 working papers. It also organised four international conferences and workshops during the year:\n- The Eighth Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy, titled “China’s Economic Rebalancing: Where is it Heading?”, was held in January in Hong Kong. The conference provided a forum for academics, policy makers and business economists to discuss important analytical and policy issues related to the Mainland economy. 11 highquality research papers were presented, covering a wide variety of issues including Mainland’s economic rebalancing, structural reform and international spillovers, issues on the renminbi exchange rate, and Mainland’s monetary policy framework and transmission.\n- The 15th HKIMR Summer Workshop was held in July. The workshop was intended to provide an opportunity for staff members of the HKIMR and the HKMA to present their research papers, and to enhance interaction between research staff and visiting fellows.\n- A joint conference organised by the HKMA and the Bank for International Settlements, titled “The Price, Real and Financial Effects of Exchange Rates”, was held in August. The conference provided a platform for in-depth and insightful discussion.

The conference reviewed lessons learned from the unconventional monetary policies (UMP) of major central banks over the past ten years.

{"en": "# Banking Stability\n\nIn 2017, the HKMA continued to place its supervisory focus on the effectiveness of authorized institutions’ risk governance framework, including credit and liquidity risk management systems. During the year, another round of countercyclical macro-prudential measures was introduced to strengthen the resilience of the banking sector to cope with any downturn in the property market. With cyber threats on the rise, the HKMA stepped up the supervision of authorized institutions’ technology risk management. At the same time, the HKMA launched seven initiatives that prepare Hong Kong to move into a New Era of Smart Banking. The effectiveness of authorized institutions’ anti-money laundering and counterterrorist financing controls remained a key supervisory focus of the HKMA as part of its efforts to combat financial crimes. On conduct supervision, the HKMA took further steps to promote a customer-centric corporate culture, foster financial inclusion, and address difficulties encountered by small and medium-sized enterprises and start-up companies in opening and maintaining bank accounts in Hong Kong. Efforts were also made to enhance the supervision of authorized institutions’ sales practices for investment and insurance products to further strengthen customer protection.\n\nSubstantial progress was made on the local implementation of international supervisory and accounting standards, including capital adequacy standards, disclosure standards, the Net Stable Funding Ratio, large exposure limits, recovery planning and International Financial Reporting Standard 9. In support of the need for capacity building amid an ever-changing banking environment and evolving risk landscape, the HKMA co-ordinated with the industry to develop director empowerment programmes and the Enhanced Competency Framework for banking practitioners.\n\nThe Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance came into operation on 7 July 2017, making Hong Kong one of the few Financial Stability Board member jurisdictions with a fully cross-sectoral resolution regime for financial institutions. The Ordinance, establishing a new line of defence for financial stability, confers necessary powers on the Monetary Authority to manage, in an orderly manner, failure of a financial institution in circumstances where such failure could have adverse systemic consequences.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this objective is contingent upon the financial system being highly resilient and capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their business and, in extremis, by failing in a disorderly manner. The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring banks are resilient to shocks and are able to recover their positions in response to crises, which ultimately helps prevent failures. The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banking business, which includes the business of taking deposits, in Hong Kong. It is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposittaking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs). The Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs).\n\nHowever, the Monetary Authority cannot ensure, nor is the Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework designed to ensure, a zero-risk financial system. Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that in the event of an AI’s failure, resolution may be conducted in an orderly manner such that continuity in critical financial services provided by AIs to their customers can be maintained. To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong is established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs, amongst other financial institutions.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2017\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nIn 2017, 192 off-site reviews were conducted covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL ratings1, corporate governance, business operations and risk management of AIs. As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance at AIs, 30 meetings were held with the boards of directors or board-level committees of AIs, with the discussions focused on important risk management issues. The HKMA also conducted a survey to monitor the adoption of its recent guidance on corporate governance. 27 tripartite meetings among the HKMA, AIs and their external auditors were also held.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA continued to conduct regular on-site examinations supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk. This approach has allowed the HKMA to prioritise its supervisory resources to focus on emerging and more significant risks faced by AIs. The HKMA conducted 401 on-site examinations and thematic reviews during the year. Credit risk management and controls remained the key focus of these examinations and reviews. Another major focus was technology risk and operational risk management. The HKMA also increased the number of overseas examinations and the number of on-site examinations and thematic reviews targeted at liquidity and market risk management as well as anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML/CFT) controls. On-site examinations of AIs’ activities in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses were also conducted by specialist teams.\n\n# Supervision of credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nTotal bank lending grew by 16.1%, compared with a growth of 6.5% in 2016. As shown in Table 2, the loan growth was broad-based.\n\nSpecifically, Mainland-related lending grew by 17.5% to HK$4,188 billion at the end of 2017 (Table 3). This included HK$644 billion of loans booked with Mainland subsidiaries of banks incorporated in Hong Kong.\n\nThe asset quality of AIs remained healthy in 2017. Retail banks’ classified loan ratio edged down from 0.72% at the end of 2016 to 0.54% at the end of 2017, well below the long-run historical average of 2.2% since 2000. For the banking industry as a whole, the classified loan ratio decreased from 0.85% to 0.67%. As regards Mainlandrelated lending, retail banks’ classified loan ratio of such lending edged down to 0.75% in 2017 from 0.82%. For the banking industry as a whole, the ratio decreased to 0.67% from 0.80% a year ago.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA stepped up its supervisory efforts to ensure that AIs continued to adopt prudent credit risk management standards. In particular, the surveillance of AIs’ exposures to major corporates was enhanced. Targeted thematic examinations were conducted, focusing on key credit risk management controls such as loan underwriting standards, the loan classification and provisioning system, credit risk governance framework and risk management for lending to property developers, asset-backed financing and insurance premium financing.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nProperty prices continued to rise in 2017. There were more loans extended by AIs involving borrowers with multiple mortgages or with income derived from outside of Hong Kong. In view of these developments, the HKMA introduced another round of countercyclical macroprudential measures on 19 May. The eighth round of measures included raising the risk-weight floor for the calculation of capital charges for new residential mortgage loans granted by AIs, lowering the applicable loan-to-value (LTV) ratio cap for property mortgage loans extended to borrowers with pre-existing mortgages, and lowering the applicable debt servicing ratio (DSR) limit for property mortgage loans extended to borrowers whose income is derived mainly from outside of Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA’s macro-prudential measures on property mortgage loans, introduced since 2009, have enhanced banks’ resilience to risks associated with the property market. The average LTV ratio of new residential mortgage loans fell to 49% in December 2017 from 64% in September 2009, before the countercyclical measures were first introduced. The average DSR also decreased to 35% in December 2017 from 41% in August 2010, when a cap on DSR was first applied (Chart 1).\n\nThe HKMA observed that some developers financed their property development projects with high gearing and some of them provided mortgages with high LTV ratios to buyers of properties. To address the risks associated with these developments, the HKMA introduced new risk management measures for lending to property developers on 12 May. These included requiring AIs to lower the financing caps for construction financing; requiring AIs to set aside more capital for their lending to property developers with a higher proportion of mortgage loans relative to equity; and performing a round of thematic examinations to ensure that banks continue to follow prudent underwriting standards in their lending to property developers.\n\nSeparately, the HKMA worked with the Land Registry in launching an e-Alert service in February. The e-Alert service provides a notification to the AI concerned whenever a further mortgage in respect of the mortgaged property is lodged with the Land Registry for registration, so that the mortgagee bank can take appropriate risk mitigating actions as appropriate.\n\n# Supervision of operational and technology risks\n\nCybersecurity threats continued to increase over the year. The HKMA stepped up its supervisory efforts in a bid to enhance the cyber resilience of the banking sector. As part of the Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative (CFI) rolled out by the HKMA in 2016, 30 AIs completed an assessment of the maturity of their cyber defences. Separately, the HKMA and the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), after extensive consultation with the banking and securities industry, jointly decided to introduce a mandatory twofactor authentication for online share trading. A round of on-site examinations focused on banks’ cybersecurity controls and operational resilience was also conducted. The HKMA further completed a round of discussions with the senior management of major banks to assess how the banks were managing strategic risks posed by potential new market entrants powered by technological advancement.\n\n# Smart Banking\n\nIn September, the HKMA announced a package of measures to assist Hong Kong’s banking sector in migrating to a new era of Smart Banking. On the supervisory front, the HKMA enhanced the Fintech Supervisory Sandbox to version 2.0, with new features including a Chatroom facility accessible by both banks and technology firms and the establishment of linkages among the sandboxes of the HKMA, the SFC and the Insurance Authority (IA), so as to provide a single point of entry for conducting trials of cross-sector fintech products.\n\nThe HKMA also launched a Banking Made Easy initiative to identify and minimise regulatory frictions with the aim of further improving customers’ experience in using fintech and digital banking services. A taskforce has been set up with the current focus on remote onboarding and account maintenance, online finance and online wealth management.\n\nA review of the existing Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks has commenced to facilitate the introduction of virtual banking in Hong Kong.\n\n# Supervision of treasury activities and liquidity risk\n\nAs the US continued to normalise its monetary policy, global fund flows might become increasingly volatile. In consideration of this, the HKMA placed increased focus on the supervision of liquidity risk during the year. The HKMA enhanced its supervisory liquidity stress testing with additional scenarios, including a more stressful but plausible scenario of fund outflows and a short-term, confidencedriven bank run scenario. The HKMA also stepped up the monitoring and analysis of individual AIs’ liquidity profiles and required selected AIs to strengthen their liquidity risk management capability.\n\nSeparately, the HKMA conducted more on-site examinations of AIs’ market risk management in respect of their debt securities portfolios. A round of thematic reviews were carried out to evaluate potential risks arising from AIs’ increased investment activities in foreign currency bonds and to assess the effectiveness of the corresponding risk management, including hedging practices.\n\n# Prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF)\n\nThe Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) (Amendment) Bill 2017 was gazetted on 23 June and will come into operation in 2018. The amendment is intended to update Hong Kong’s regulatory regime for AML/CFT in line with the latest international requirements as promulgated by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). These changes, together with updates to the statutory guideline on AML/CFT, will help clarify and implement the risk-based approach in customer due diligence (CDD) processes for account opening and the maintenance of bona fide customers, and encourage innovation where such processes are carried out remotely.\n", "zh": "# 銀行體系穩定\n\n2017年，金管局繼續將監管重點放在認可機構的風險管治架構的有效性，包括信貸和流動性風險管理系統。當年，另一輪逆周期宏觀審慎措施推出，以加強銀行業應對樓市任何下行的抗逆力。隨著網絡威脅不斷增加，金管局加強了對認可機構科技風險管理的監管。同時，金管局推出七項措施，為香港進入智慧銀行新紀元做好準備。認可機構的反洗錢及打擊恐怖分子資金籌集控制措施的成效，仍是金管局核心的監管重點，以配合打擊金融罪行的努力。在操守監管方面，金管局進一步推動以客為本的企業文化，促進金融包容，以及協助中小企和初創企業解決在香港開戶和持續運作過程中遇到的困難。亦加強了對認可機構投資及保險產品銷售行為的監管，以進一步保障客戶權益。\n\n在國際監管及會計準則本地落實方面取得重大進展，包括資本充足率標準、披露標準、淨穩定資金比率、大額風險承擔限額、恢復規劃以及國際財務報告準則第9號。為配合快速變化的銀行環境和風險格局，並提升行業能力，金管局協調行業制定董事授能計劃和資歷架構，以增強銀行從業人員的專業能力。\n\n金融機構（處置機制）條例於2017年7月7日正式實施，使香港成為少數具有跨行業金融穩定理事會會員資格、擁有完整處置規範的管轄區之一。該條例建立了保障金融穩定的防線，賦予金融管理專員必要的權力，以有序處理金融機構的失敗，防止對系統產生嚴重不良影響。\n\n# 目標\n\n金管局的總體目標是促進銀行體系的安全與穩定。達成此目標，須建立一個高度抗逆且能提供香港經濟所需關鍵金融服務的金融體系。\n\n銀行可通過其經營行為影響系統穩定，甚至在失序情況下引發金融動盪。作為監管機構，金管局在保障金融穩定方面扮演關鍵角色，確保銀行具備抗震能力，並能從危機中恢復，最終有助於防止銀行失敗。金管局負責香港的銀行業務審慎監管，包括吸收存款等業務。它負責授權持牌銀行、有限牌照銀行和存款附屬公司，合稱認可機構（AIs）。此外，金管局亦負責指定及監督某些金融市場基建（FMIs）。\n\n然而，金管局不能，也不是設計來確保零風險的金融體系。作為處置機制當局，金管局旨在確保在認可機構失敗時，可以有序展開處置程序，讓認可機構向客戶提供的重要金融服務得以持續。為此，在香港建立了一套金融機構的處置規範，金管局在其中為認可機構等金融機構的處置當局。\n\n# 2017年回顧\n\n# 監管活動概覽\n\n2017年，金管局進行了192次非現場審查，內容涵蓋範圍廣泛，包括CAMEL評級、企業管治、業務操作及風險管理。為促進認可機構的風險管治，加強風險管理，金管局與認可機構董事會或高層委員會召開30次會議，焦點放在重要風險管理議題上。金管局亦進行調查，以監測其近期指引在企業管治方面的採用情況，並與認可機構及其外聘核數師進行27次三方會議。\n\n除了非現場活動外，金管局持續進行定期現場檢查，並補充高風險領域的專題審查。此策略使得金管局能夠針對新興及較重大風險資源配置優先，並在年內完成401次現場檢查及專題審查。信貸風險管理及控制依然是重點，科技風險與營運風險管理亦獲得更多關注。金管局亦增加了海外檢查次數，以及針對流動性、市場風險、反洗錢及打擊恐怖分子資金籌集（AML/CFT）控制的現場檢查與專題審查。專家團隊亦對認可機構在證券、投資產品、保險及強積金（MPF）業務的活動進行了審查。\n\n# 信貸風險監管\n\n# 貸款增長與資產質素\n\n2017年，銀行授信總額增長16.1%，高於2016年的6.5%。如表2所示，貸款增長呈全行業多元化發展。\n\n特別是，內地相關貸款於2017年底達到香港元4,1880億，按年增長17.5%（見表3）。其中包括港資銀行內地子公司入帳借貸6440億。\n\n認可機構的資產質素在2017年保持健康。零售銀行的分類貸款比率由2016年底的0.72%略降至2017年底的0.54%，遠低於2000年以來的長期平均水平2.2%。整體銀行業的分類貸款比率由0.85%降至0.67%。就內地相關借貸而言，零售銀行的相關分類貸款比率由0.82%降至0.75%。整體銀行業的該比率由0.80%降至0.67%。\n\n年內，金管局加強監管力度，確保認可機構持續採用謹慎的信貸風險管理標準，尤其是針對主要企業的曝險控制方面。針對性專題檢查聚焦於主要信貸管理控制措施，如貸款批核標準、分類及撥備制度、信貸風險管治架構，以及針對房地產開發商、有抵押資產融資和保費融資的信貸風險管理。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n2017年樓市持續升溫。銀行提供更多涉及多重按揭或來自香港以外收入者的貸款。針對這些變化，金管局於5月19日推出另一輪逆周期宏觀審慎措施。第九輪措施包括：提高新住宅按揭貸款的資本充足率底線；降低面向已有按揭的借款人之按揭成數上限；以及降低主要收入來源於香港以外的借款人的債務供款比率（DSR）上限。\n\n自2009年起實施的宏觀審慎措施提升了銀行應對樓市風險的韌性。上載新住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數（LTV）於2017年12月降至49%，較2009年9月引入措施前的64%有所下降。平均DSR亦由2010年8月的41%下降至2017年12月的35%（見圖1）。\n\n金管局注意到部分地產商利用高槓桿資金進行樓房開發，一些亦向買家提供高LTV的按揭額度。為因應這些風險，金管局於5月12日推出新措施，包括：要求認可機構降低建築融資的資金上限；要求認可機構為高比例按揭貸款的樓房開發商預留更多資本；並進行專題檢查，以確保銀行繼續嚴格遵守謹慎的批核標準。\n\n另外，金管局與土地註冊處合作，在2月份啟動e-Alert電子通知服務。該服務在有額外按揭登記時，向相關銀行發出通知，讓抵押銀行可及時採取相應的風險緩解措施。\n\n# 營運及科技風險監管\n\n網絡安全威脅持續增加。金管局加強監管，以提升銀行業的網絡抗禦能力。作為2016年推出的網絡防衛計劃（CFI）的一部分，30家認可機構完成了其資安防禦成熟度評估。此外，金管局與證監會（SFC）在廣泛咨詢銀行和證券業界後，決定推行強制性雙重認證（雙 factor authentication）用於網上證券交易。同期亦進行銀行的科技控制和營運韌性的現場檢查。金管局亦就大型銀行的戰略風險管理，與其高層管理層進行討論評估技術進步帶來的新市場進入者可能引發的風險。\n\n# 智慧銀行\n\n2017年9月，金管局宣布推出一系列措施，幫助香港銀行業邁入智慧銀行新時代。在監管方面，金管局將金融科技監管沙盒（Fintech Supervisory Sandbox）升級至2.0版，新增聊天室等功能，並建立金管局、證監會和保險署（IA）沙盒之間的聯動機制，提供一站式測試跨行業金融科技產品的平台。\n\n另外，金管局推出「輕鬆銀行」倡議，旨在疏通監管障礙，進一步改善客戶使用金融科技和數碼銀行服務的體驗。該專責小組目前主要聚焦於遠程開戶、帳戶維持、網上理財和財富管理等方面。\n\n同時，金管局已啟動評估虛擬銀行認可指引，促進香港虛擬銀行的落地推行。\n\n# 營運資金及流動性風險監管\n\n隨著美國持續貨幣政策正常化，全球資金流向或變得更加波動。在此背景下，金管局於年內加大對流動性風險的監管力度，提升流動性壓力測試，加入更多場景，包括更嚴峻但合理的資金外流情境，以及短期信心驅動的銀行擠提情境。亦加強對個別認可機構流動性資料的監測與分析，並要求部分銀行增強其流動性風險管理能力。\n\n另外，金管局亦對認可機構在外幣債券投資的市場風險管理進行更多現場檢查，並通過專題審查評估其風險控制措施，包括對沖策略的有效性。\n\n# 打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集\n\n《2017年打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集（金融機構）(修訂)條例》已在6月23日頒佈，將於2018年正式生效。該修訂旨在根據財務行動特別組織（FATF）最新國際規範，更新香港的AML/CFT監管體系。此等變革，連同修訂後的法定指引，將有助於明確和實施客戶盡職審查（CDD）程序的風險為本原則，並促進遠程操作的創新應用。"}
{"en": "# International Financial Centre\n\nTo consolidate Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre, the HKMA strives to enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. On fintech, the seven new initiatives aimed at facilitating the development and use of fintech in the banking and payment industries were well received by stakeholders and the public. Hong Kong’s international profile as a financing hub for infrastructure investments was raised further, thanks to a series of efforts on network and capacity building on this front. The launch of Bond Connect reinforced Hong Kong’s position as the main gateway to opportunities in Mainland China. The HKMA’s efforts on other areas such as corporate treasury centres were also bearing fruits.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nIn view of the rapid technological advancements, the HKMA in September announced the launch of seven initiatives to prepare Hong Kong to move into a new era of Smart Banking. These initiatives included:\n- developing the Faster Payment System (FPS) to achieve full connectivity of digital retail payments;\n- introducing an Open Application Programming Interface (Open API) framework;\n- enhancing fintech research and talent development;\n- stepping up cross-border collaboration in fintech;\n- upgrading our existing Fintech Supervisory Sandbox (FSS) 1.0 to Version 2.0;\n- facilitating the introduction of virtual banking; and\n- promoting a new Banking Made Easy initiative to minimise regulatory frictions in customers’ digital experience.\n\nThe HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO), together with the banking departments of the HKMA, played a pivotal role in driving the implementation of these initiatives to strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia.\n\nHong Kong’s international profile as a financing hub for infrastructure investments was raised further, as the number of partners of the HKMA Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO) grew to 87 as at 31 January 2018 from about 40 at inception. During the year, IFFO organised and participated in more than 10 seminars and workshops to facilitate experience sharing and collaborative networking among key stakeholders. In particular, IFFO steered the development of an infrastructure equity investment reference term sheet in its inaugural Debt Financing and Investors’ Roundtables with a view to enhancing infrastructure projects’ bankability and investability.\n\nBond Connect was launched in July, marking another major milestone in mutual access between the Hong Kong and Mainland capital markets, and further solidifying our gateway position for international investors seeking to enter the Mainland market. During the year, Hong Kong’s Renminbi Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (RQFII) quota was increased to RMB500 billion from RMB270 billion. Hong Kong maintained the world’s largest offshore renminbi liquidity pool, with vibrant renminbi financial intermediation activities as evidenced by a high turnover of our renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system and the lion’s share of Hong Kong’s renminbi payment activities in the world.\n\nFollowing the introduction of the tax regime for corporate treasury centres (CTCs) in 2016, the HKMA stepped up its outreach efforts with a view to attracting more multinational corporates to set up treasury centres in Hong Kong. By the end of 2017, more than 40 corporates reflected to the HKMA that they were actively planning to set up, or had set up, treasury centre operations in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA actively contributed to international discussions on issues of significance to global and regional financial stability. The Chief Executive of the HKMA became the Chair of the Standing Committee on Supervisory and Regulatory Co-operation (SRC) of the Financial Stability Board (FSB)1 in April to lead discussions on key financial stability issues.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure lays a solid foundation for Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre and global offshore renminbi business hub. The four interbank RTGS systems and the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) achieved 100% system availability in 2017, as compared to the target of 99.95%. To support Northbound Trading of Bond Connect, CMU has set up accounts with the two Mainland central securities depositories (CSDs) to facilitate the settlement of Bond Connect transactions and holding of Mainland debt securities on behalf of relevant CMU members.\n\nTo promote the general safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA designated four retail payment systems (RPSs) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO) in August to bring their operations under the HKMA’s oversight. The HKMA also conducted supervision of 16 stored value facility (SVF) licensees which actively launched new products and services that sought to offer customers more choices and better user experience. Separately, the coverage of e-Cheque and Electronic Bill Presentment and Payment (EBPP) service was further expanded to include crossboundary payments between Hong Kong and the entire Guangdong Province.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2017\n\n# Hong Kong as a fintech hub in Asia\n\n# Smart Banking Initiatives\n\nIn light of the rapid technological advancements, the HKMA in September announced seven initiatives that would prepare Hong Kong to move into a new era of Smart Banking. The initiatives aimed to help the banking sector to rise to a higher level and embrace the enormous opportunities brought about by the convergence of banking and technology.\n\n“Smart Banking would offer full interconnectivity amongst retail and corporate customers and allow financial services and transactions to be undertaken with great mobility, speed, ease and safety.”\n\nThe HKMA has been working closely with the banking industry and the fintech community, and made good progress in implementing the seven initiatives.\n\n# Faster Payment System\n\nThe FPS is a multi-currency platform that would enable the public to make round-the-clock funds transfers in a real-time manner with ease, through using mobile phone numbers or email addresses. It can support payments in Hong Kong dollars and renminbi. Banks and non-bank payment service providers can participate in the FPS, enabling full connectivity among all payment participants. With system development work close to completion, the FPS is scheduled to launch in September 2018.\n\nFurthermore, the HKMA led a working group, comprising major credit card scheme operators, banks, licensed SVF operators and merchant acquirers, to establish a common QR code standard for retail payments in Hong Kong. A common QR code standard would facilitate merchants in using a single QR code to accept QR code payment solutions from multiple payment service providers, providing greater convenience to customers and merchants. The working group has finalised the relevant technical specification, and would work out the implementation arrangements.\n\n# Open Application Programming Interface\n\nOpen API allows banks’ data to be accessed by third parties to facilitate better and easier integration of services offered by banks and other industries. Users can therefore conveniently stay on one system to enjoy integrated services in a secure environment. To facilitate the development and adoption of Open API by the banking sector, the HKMA has come up with a draft Open API framework, comprising a selection of Open API functions and deployment time frame, technical standards, third-party service provider governance, facilitation measures and maintenance models, for a two-month industry consultation.\n\n# Research and talent development\n\nOne of the major research projects was on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). Following the first DLT whitepaper in 2016, the second whitepaper on DLT was published in October 2017. The second whitepaper further explores the three Proof-of-Concept works, namely trade finance, digital identity management and mortgage application. It also offers advice on the implementation issues relating to governance, legal and compliance, and general control principles on deploying DLT for the banking and payment industries.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan, announces the release of the second whitepaper on DLT at the HKMA Fintech Day.\n\nRiding on the success of the Proof-of-Concept work on trade finance led by the HKMA, seven banks in Hong Kong decided to commercialise the prototype into a production system named Hong Kong Trade Finance Platform (HKTFP) to digitise and share trade documents and automate processes with a view to improving the overall trade process and reducing risks and fraud in the trade finance business.\n\nIn an effort to enlarge the talent pool in the fintech industry, the HKMA launched the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme in collaboration with the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute in December 2016. Response from students was positive. More than 3,000 applications from 421 applicants were received. Finally, 74 students accepted internship offers from the HKMA and 12 banks to work on fintech-related projects for six months or one year starting from July.\n\n# Cross-border collaboration\n\nAs the first step of strengthening our collaboration within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Bay Area, we are partnering with Shenzhen to promote fintech and talent developments. Specifically, the HKMA and the Office of Financial Development Service, the People’s Government of Shenzhen Municipality (OFDS) entered into an agreement in June to (i) provide reciprocal soft-landing support for fintech firms, (ii) co-organise the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Fintech Award in October to recognise and reward outstanding fintech products and solutions in the two cities; and (iii) arrange summer internships at Shenzhen fintech and techfin firms for Hong Kong students.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan (middle), signs and exchanges Memoranda of Understanding on softlanding arrangements with OFDS Director-General, Mr He Xiaojun (left), and Cyberport Chairman, Dr Lee George Lam, at the HKMA Fintech Day.\n\nE-leaflet for the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Fintech Award.\n\nThe HKMA also signed fintech co-operation agreements with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Dubai Financial Services Authority on innovation projects, referrals of innovative businesses, information sharing and exchange of expertise.\n\nIn November, the HKMA further signed a Memorandum of Understanding with MAS to jointly build the Global Trade Connectivity Network (GTCN), which would connect Singapore’s National Trade Platform to the HKTFP to form a cross-border DLT infrastructure in order to digitalise cross-border trade and trade finance processes, making them safer, more efficient and costeffective. It will be an open platform that allows other interested jurisdictions to participate in the future. The GTCN is expected to be launched in the first quarter of 2019.\n\n# Fintech Supervisory Sandbox\n\nThe FSS launched by the HKMA in September 2016 was upgraded to FSS 2.0 to expedite communication with banks and tech firms to facilitate new ideas and initiatives. Specifically, FSS 2.0 has the following new features:\n- A Fintech Supervisory Chatroom is set up to provide feedback to banks and tech firms at an early stage of their fintech projects.\n- Tech firms can access the FSS by seeking feedback from the Chatroom without going through a bank.\n- The sandboxes of the HKMA, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Insurance Authority are linked up so that there is a single point of entry for pilot trials of cross-sector fintech products.\n\nAs of end-2017, 28 new technology products have been tested in the FSS. Out of these cases, 14 pilot trials have been completed, and the relevant products have been rolled out to the market subsequently.\n\n# Banking Made Easy initiative\n\nA Banking Made Easy initiative was launched to minimise regulatory frictions hindering technological innovations. A taskforce has been set up with current focus on the following areas:\n- Remote onboarding and account maintenance\n- Online finance\n- Online wealth management\n\n# Virtual Banking\n\nVirtual banks, which operate without physical branches, are expected to provide additional impetus to the application of fintech in Hong Kong and offer a new kind of customer experience in mobile and digital banking. They may also help promote financial inclusion as they normally target the retail segment, be they individuals or small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The HKMA has commenced the review of the existing Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks with a view to facilitating the introduction of virtual banking in Hong Kong.\n\n# A New Era of Smart Banking\n\n# Supervision and Innovation\n\nThe seven initiatives unveiled by the HKMA last year to prepare Hong Kong for a new era of Smart Banking are a large-scale project involving cooperation among various departments within the HKMA. With fintech becoming an unstoppable force, Mr Raymond Chan, Executive Director (Banking Supervision) of the HKMA, indicated that the HKMA, as a regulator, must embrace this new trend by keeping abreast of the latest technological developments and adjusting its supervisory mindset and approach as appropriate, in order to take bank services and customer experience to a new level.\n", "zh": "# 國際金融中心\n\n為鞏固香港作為國際金融中心的地位，金管局致力提升香港金融平台的競爭力。在金融科技方面，七項促進銀行及支付行業發展與應用的全新措施獲得業界和公眾的熱烈支持。香港作為基礎建設投資融資樞紐的國際形象進一步提升，這得益於在網絡及能力建設方面的一系列努力。 Bond Connect的推出進一步鞏固了香港作為內地資本市場主要入口的地位。金管局在企業財資中心等其他領域的努力亦取得了實質成果。\n\n# 概覽\n\n面對科技快速進步，金管局於九月宣布推出七項措施，為香港進入智慧銀行（Smart Banking）新時代做好準備。這些措施包括：\n- 發展快速支付系統（FPS），實現數字零售支付的全面互聯；\n- 引入開放應用程式介面（Open API）框架；\n- 加強金融科技研究與人才培育；\n- 推動跨境金融科技合作；\n- 升級現有的金融科技監管沙盒（FSS）1.0至版本2.0；\n- 促進虛擬銀行的推出；\n- 推廣「銀行易」新倡議，以減少客戶數碼體驗中的監管摩擦。\n\n金管局金融科技促進辦公室（FFO）聯同多個銀行部門，為實施這些措施發揮了關鍵作用，以鞏固香港作為亞洲金融科技樞紐的地位。\n\n香港作為基建投資融資的國際融資樞紐的形象進一步提升，截至2018年1月31日，香港金融基建促進辦公室（IFFO）合作夥伴由成立初期約40家增至87家。今年，IFFO舉辦並參與逾10場研討會和工作坊，促進經驗交流和關鍵利益相關者合作。特別是在首屆債務融資與投資者圓桌會議中，IFFO領導制定了基礎建設股權投資參考清單，以提升基建項目的可融資性和投資吸引力。\n\nBond Connect於七月推出，標誌著香港與內地資本市場互通合作的又一重大里程碑，並進一步鞏固香港作為國際投資者進入內地市場的主要門戶。在年度內，香港人民幣合格境外機構投資者（RQFII）配額由人民幣2700億元增至人民幣5000億元。香港亦保持全球最大的離岸人民幣資金池，人民幣金融中介活動繁榮：人民幣即時支付結算系統（RTGS）的成交量高企，佔全球香港人民幣支付佔比最大。\n\n自2016年推出企業財資中心（CTC）稅制以來，金管局加大推廣力度，吸引更多跨國企業在港設立財資中心。截至2017年底，逾40家企業表示正積極籌劃或已設立財資中心。\n\n金管局積極參與國際討論，關乎全球及區域金融穩定的重大議題。金管局行政長官於四月當選金融穩定理事會（FSB）監管與協作常設委員會（SRC）主席，領導討論關鍵金融穩定議題。\n\n香港金融基建的安全高效運作為其作為國際金融中心及全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的角色奠定了堅實基礎。2017年，四個銀行間RTGS系統及中央貨幣市場單元（CMU）達到百分之百的系統可用率，遠超99.95%的目標。為支持Bond Connect的北向交易，CMU已與兩個內地央行證券存管機構（CSD）建立帳戶，以促進Bond Connect交易的結算以及代表相關CMU會員持有內地債券。\n\n為促進本地零售支付行業的安全與效率，金管局於八月根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（PSSVFO）設立四個零售支付系統（RPS），將其運營納入監管範圍。同時，對16家積極推出新產品及服務的儲值支付工具（SVF）持牌公司進行監管。另將電子支票及電子帳單及繳費（EBPP）服務擴展至涵蓋香港與廣東省的跨境支付。\n\n# 2017年回顧\n\n# 香港作為亞洲金融科技樞紐\n\n# 智慧銀行措施\n\n面對科技快速發展，金管局於九月宣布七項措施，旨在幫助香港步入智慧銀行（Smart Banking）新時代。這些措施旨在提升銀行業等級，並擁抱銀行與科技融合帶來的巨大機遇。\n\n「智慧銀行將提供零售及企業客戶之間的全面互聯，並使金融服務和交易能以高度流動性、速度、便利及安全進行。」\n\n金管局一直與銀行業界和金融科技社群密切合作，並在落實這七項措施方面取得良好進展。\n\n# 快速支付系統\n\nFPS是一個多幣種平台，讓市民可以輕鬆實時進行全天候的資金轉賬，支援手機號碼或電郵地址作為支付識別。支援港幣和人民幣支付。銀行和非銀行支付服務提供者皆可參與FPS，實現所有支付參與方的全面互聯。目前系統開發已接近完成，預計將於2018年九月啟動。\n\n此外，金管局領導一個由主要信用卡方案經營者、銀行、持牌SVF經營者和商戶收單機構組成的工作小組，制定零售支付的統一二維碼標準。這一標準將便利商戶用單一二維碼接受多個支付方案，為客戶及商戶帶來更大便利。工作小組已完成相關技術規範，並將制定實施安排。\n\n# 開放應用程式介面\n\nOpen API使第三方可以訪問銀行的數據，以促進更佳更便利的服務整合。用户可在一個安全環境中通過同一系統享受整合服務，提升用戶體驗。為推動銀行業界開發和採用Open API，金管局制定了Open API框架草案，內容包括選定的Open API功能、部署時間表、技術標準、第三方服務供應商治理、促進措施及維護模型，並進行為期兩個月的業界諮詢。\n\n# 研究及人才培育\n\n其中一個重點研究項目是分布式分類帳技術（DLT）。2016年首份DLT白皮書發布後，2017年十月再推出第二份白皮書，進一步深入探討交易融資、數碼身份管理和按揭申請三大Proof-of-Concept工作。白皮書亦就治理、法律合規以及部署DLT的整體控制原則提供建議。\n\n金管局行政長官陳德霖先生於金管局金融科技日宣布推出第二份DLT白皮書。\n\n基於在交易融資Proof-of-Concept的成功，香港的七家銀行決定將原型商業化，命名為香港貿易融資平台（HKTFP），旨在數碼化共享貿易文件並自動化流程，以提升整體貿易效率和降低風險與詐騙。\n\n為擴大金融科技人才庫，2016年12月，金管局與香港應用科技研究院合作，推出金融科技人才培育計劃。反響熱烈，共收到超過3,000份申請，來自421名申請人。最終，74名學生接受了由金管局和12家銀行提供的實習職位，從7月起進行為期六個月至一年的實習。\n\n# 跨境合作\n\n作為深化粵港澳大灣區合作的第一步，金管局與深圳合作推動金融科技和人才發展。特別是在六月，金管局與深圳市金融發展服務辦公室（OFDS）簽訂協議，內容包括：\n(i) 提供互惠的金融科技企業落地支持；\n(ii) 於十月聯合主辦深港金融科技獎，表彰兩城卓越的金融科技產品與方案；\n(iii) 為香港學生安排在深圳金融科技及科技金融企業的暑期實習。\n\n金管局行政長官陳德霖先生（中）與OFDS署長何曉軍（左）及數碼港主席林喬喆博士，在金管局金融科技日簽署並交流「落地支持」合作備忘錄。\n\n此外，金管局亦與新加坡金融管理局（MAS）和迪拜金融服務管理局（DFSA）簽訂創新合作協議，內容包括創新項目推介、業務合作、資訊分享及專業交流。\n\n去年十一月，金管局更與新加坡金融管理局共同簽訂備忘錄，合作建立全球貿易連接網絡（GTCN），將新加坡的國家貿易平台連接至香港貿易融資平台（HKTFP），打造跨境DLT基礎設施，實現跨境貿易與融資流程的數碼化，提升安全性、效率及成本效益。未來將成為一個開放平台，歡迎其他司法管轄區參與。GTCN預計於2019年第一季度啟用。\n\n# 金融科技監管沙盒\n\n由金管局於2016年九月推出的金融科技監管沙盒（FSS）已升級至FSS 2.0，以加快與銀行和科技企業的溝通，促進新思路和新措施的測試與應用。FSS 2.0新增特點包括：\n- 設立金融科技監管聊天室，代表早期提供反饋；\n- 科技公司可直接通過聊天室獲取反饋，無需經過銀行；\n- 與證券及期貨事務監察委員會（SFC）及保險業監管局對接，以形成一個跨行業的試點平台。\n\n截止2017年底，已有28個新技術產品在FSS中測試，其中14個完成試點，相關產品已陸續推出市面。\n\n# 銀行易\n\n「銀行易」倡議旨在減少阻礙科技創新的監管摩擦。一個專責小組已成立，重點推展以下範疇：\n- 遠端開戶及帳戶維護\n- 線上金融\n- 線上財富管理\n\n# 虛擬銀行\n\n虛擬銀行是無需實體分行的網絡運作模式，預計將進一步推動金融科技在香港的應用，並為用戶提供全新的行動及數碼銀行體驗。它們亦可能促進金融包容性，因為通常面向零售客群，包括個人和中小企（SMEs）。金管局正著手修訂現有的「虛擬銀行的認可」指引，以便推動虛擬銀行在香港的推出。\n\n# 智慧銀行新時代\n\n# 監管與創新\n\n去年推出的七項措施旨在為香港開啟智慧銀行的全新篇章，這是涉及多個部門合作的大型項目。隨著金融科技勢不可擋，金管局營運董事（銀行監理）陳偉文表示，作為監管機構，必須擁抱新趨勢，緊跟科技最新發展，並適時調整監管思維與手法，以將銀行服務和客戶體驗提升至新水準。"}
{"en": "# Reserves Management\n\nThe global economy and financial markets performed better than expected in 2017. Global equity markets went up on the back of synchronised economic growth in major developed and emerging market economies, strong corporate earnings, and market expectation of slow and gradual tightening of monetary policies by major central banks. While the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates three times as expected, and began to reduce its balance sheet in October, the 10- Year US Treasury yield remained stable and the US dollar weakened (rather than strengthened) against other major currencies. Under such a favourable environment, the Exchange Fund’s investment income reached a record high of HK$264 billion in 2017, representing an investment return of 7.4%.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary and may be invested in securities or other assets he considers appropriate, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC).\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nEFAC has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n(a) to preserve capital;\n(b) to ensure the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(c) to ensure sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) subject to (a)–(c), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the Fund’s long-term purchasing power.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund.\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP). The BP holds highly liquid US dollardenominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The IP is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of the assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA has been diversifying part of the Exchange Fund’s investments, in a prudent and incremental manner, into a wider variety of asset classes, including emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity and real estate. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The cap for the market value of investments under the LTGP is set at onethird of the accumulated surplus of the Exchange Fund, with further capacity arising from the allocation of part of the Future Fund to long-term assets.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007 to hold shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that were acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes, is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of the unique nature of this Portfolio.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by fiscal reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP1, with the exception of the Future Fund which links its interest rate to both the IP and the LTGP depending on the portfolio mix. As at the end of 2017, the portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 65:35. The portion of the Future Fund linked with the LTGP is expected to gradually build up to around 50% by 2018.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation. The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents the long-term optimal asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark, or strategic allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and tracking error limit are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may take positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nHKMA staff in the Reserves Management Department directly manage about 73% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, which includes the entire BP and part of the IP. This part of the IP includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 27% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes. The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to capture sustainable returns, to benefit from diverse and complementary investment styles and to share market insights and technical expertise with the Exchange Fund.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is primarily determined by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe high volatility of the financial markets subsequent to the 2008/09 global financial crisis has highlighted the importance of risk management. Stringent controls and investment guidelines have been established for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and compliance with guidelines and regulations is closely monitored. Risk assessment has been strengthened to support the Exchange Fund’s increased pace of investment diversification. Risk-control tools are deployed to assess market risks under both normal and adverse market conditions. Detailed performance attribution analyses are also conducted to identify sources of performance, allowing the HKMA to make the best use of the investment skills of internal and external managers.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nThe HKMA is supportive of responsible investment. For instance, the HKMA supports the Principles of Responsible Ownership issued by the Securities and Futures Commission on 7 March 2016, which are voluntary and help investors determine how best to meet their ownership responsibilities in relation to their investments in Hong Kong-listed companies. For the management of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA has encouraged the appointed external fund managers for its Hong Kong equity portfolio to adopt the Principles of Responsible Ownership in managing the investments. Furthermore, the front offices and the Risk Management and Compliance Division have incorporated environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into various internal procedures for making and monitoring investment activities. The HKMA will closely monitor the development of ESG standards and assess how these standards can be further integrated into the investment process.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2017\n\nThe global economy and financial markets in 2017 performed better than expected. On the back of synchronised economic growth in major developed and emerging market economies, strong corporate earnings, and market expectation of slow and gradual tightening of monetary policies by major central banks, the global equity markets performed well. In particular, the Hong Kong equity market rose by 36%, outperforming other major equity markets.\n\nIn the bond markets, short-dated US Treasury yields shot up as the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates three times as expected, and began to reduce its balance sheet in October. Nevertheless, the 10-year US Treasury yield remained stable at about 2.4% over the year. Other major 10-Year government bond yields also ended the year little changed, with the exception of German Bunds which rose on the euro area’s solid economic growth and market expectation of the European Central Bank’s policy tightening.\n\nIn the currency markets, the US dollar weakened against other major currencies, despite the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes and the beginning of its balance sheet reduction. The depreciation of the US dollar was a result of the reviving economic growth in Europe and Japan, and market expectation of diminishing monetary policy divergence between the US and other major economies. The euro and yen appreciated by around 14% and 4% respectively against the US dollar in 2017.\n\nThe performance of major currencies as well as bond and equity markets in 2017 is shown in Table 1.\n\nTable 1 2017 market returns\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$264 billion in 2017. This comprised gains of HK$80.4 billion on overseas equities, gains of HK$58.3 billion on Hong Kong equities, gains of HK$34.4 billion on bonds, a positive currency translation effect of HK$53.5 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets and gains of HK$37.4 billion on other investments held by the investment holding subsidiaries of the Exchange Fund. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$4.5 billion.\n\nThe investment income of HK$264 billion last year is a record high for the Exchange Fund, surpassing the previous record in 2007 (HK$142.2 billion) by HK$121.8 billion.\n\nThe total assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,015.3 billion at year end. The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$235.6 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$157.2 billion and real estate at HK$78.4 billion. Outstanding investment commitments amounted to HK$162.4 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund (excluding the Strategic Portfolio) in 2017 was 7.4%. Specifically, the IP achieved a rate of return of 12.1%, while the BP gained 1.8%. The LTGP recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 13.7% since its inception in 2009.\n\nThe annual return of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2017 is set out in Chart 1. Table 2 shows the 2017 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over several different time horizons. The average return was 2.9% over the past three years, 2.5% over the past five years, 2.2% over the past ten years and 4.9% since 1994.

{"en": "# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communication with the community and the market through the media, public education programmes and other various channels to facilitate public understanding of its policies and operations. During the year, the HKMA continued to improve corporate governance by supporting professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline and enhancing IT security to cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives and the increasing complexity of work.\n\n# ENGAGING THE COMMUNITY CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT\n\n# Media relations\n\nThe HKMA works closely with the media to enhance transparency and promote public understanding about its policies and work. In 2017, 86 open press events were organised, comprising nine press conferences, 16 stand-up interviews and 61 other public functions. In addition, 42 media interviews were arranged and a total of 360 bilingual press releases were issued. It also handles a large number of media enquiries every day.\n\nTo raise awareness of the HKMA’s key functions, guided tours were organised for the media to visit the newly revamped HKMA Information Centre. Furthermore, indepth media briefings and educational workshops were conducted for local and overseas media on a wide range of topics, including the Bond Connect scheme, prudential measures for property mortgage loans, the Resolution Regime and Exchange Fund investments.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan, introduces a mosaic artwork called “Small Change, Big Ode” to the media at the HKMA Information Centre. The artwork, featuring the Victoria Harbour and the Hong Kong skyline, was created using a total of 135,811 pieces of Hong Kong coins in different denominations.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan, conducts a media interview with local newspapers regarding the key initiatives of the HKMA’s Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office and Fintech Facilitation Office.\n\n# Public enquiries\n\nThe Public Enquiry Service provides an effective means for the public to better understand the key functions and operations of the HKMA. A total of 8,752 enquiries were handled in 2017, about half of which were related to banking policies and regulations, monetary and economic issues, consumer banking issues as well as notes and coins. Notable examples included the Coin Collection Programme, banking products and services, bankingrelated guidelines and circulars, monetary and economic statistics, prudential measures for property mortgage loans, and prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received since 2014 and Chart 2 provides a breakdown in terms of the nature of enquiries received in 2017.\n\nChart 1 Total number of public enquiries\n\nChart 2 Nature of enquiries received in 2017\n\n# Publications\n\nApart from the HKMA Annual Report, in 2017 the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report and four issues of the Quarterly Bulletin, and released regular updates of the Monthly Statistical Bulletin to provide up-to-date and thematic information and analyses on monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. In addition, the HKMA issued a total of 23 inSight articles, covering various topical issues related to its work.\n\n# HKMA website\n\nThe HKMA corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk), with over 60,000 pages in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, is the public access gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It also contains the register of authorized institutions (AIs) and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the register of stored value facility (SVF) licensees under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance. Dedicated webpages and eye-catching short-cut links are designed to draw public attention to the new initiatives of the HKMA, such as account opening, the regulatory regime for SVFs, the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office and the Fintech Facilitation Office, as well as important and timely information, such as reminders on the need to remain vigilant against bogus telephone calls and the location of Coin Carts under the Coin Collection Programme.\n\n# Public Education Programme\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre is an important resource for introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters. It consists of an exhibition area and a library, and is open to the public six days a week. The exhibition area introduces the work of the HKMA and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong. It also contains reading materials and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nThe new look of the policy section of the Information Centre, which introduces the work of the HKMA and related financial concepts, was re-opened to the public on 24 February 2017 upon completion of the refurbishment work. The revamped policy section contains various interactive games and devices that integrate play into learning and explain complicated financial concepts in a simple way. Feedback from the visitors has been positive.\n\nStudents try out the educational games at the policy section of the Information Centre to learn about the work of the HKMA.\n\nGuided tours of the Information Centre are organised for visitors. During the year, it received more than 59,000 visitors and hosted over 650 guided tours for schools and other groups (Chart 3). More than 645,000 people have visited the Information Centre since it opened in December 2003.\n\nThe library, situated next to the exhibition area, houses more than 23,000 books, journals and other publications for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs and central banking topics. It also maintains the register of AIs and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nThe library in the HKMA Information Centre.\n\nTo reach out to the community and raise public awareness of the HKMA’s work, the HKMA organised four public education seminars for about 2,000 secondary school students and teachers in 2017. Topics covered in the seminars included the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, banking stability, consumer protection, the Deposit Protection Scheme, fintech, the Belt and Road Initiative and careers in the financial industry. More than 58,400 people have participated in this public education programme since its launch in 1998.\n\nStudents and teachers from secondary schools in different districts participate in one of the public education seminars.\n\nChart 3 Types of group visits to the Information Centre in 2017\n\n# HUMAN RESOURCES\n\nThe HKMA recruits, develops and maintains a highly professional workforce to support its policy objectives and respond flexibly to changing work priorities. While the HKMA is an integral part of the Government, it employs staff on terms different from those of the civil service to attract personnel with the right experience and expertise. As a public organisation, the HKMA aims to maintain a lean and flexible structure and, where possible, to redeploy staff resources to undertake new initiatives and meet increasing workload.\n\n# Organisational changes\n\nThe Resolution Office was established on 1 April 2017 to implement the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance enacted in June 2016. The Office aims to ensure that the Hong Kong resolution regime is operational for banks. This is essential to enhancing the resilience of the Hong Kong banking sector in the event of any crisis.\n\n# Staffing\n\nThe establishment of the HKMA in 2017 was 927. This will be increased by 35 to 962 in 2018 (an increase of 3.8%) to ensure that sufficient resources are provided to cope with the new initiatives and the increasing complexity and volume of existing work. The new posts are deployed to the following functions:\n\n- Enhancing banking and financial stability, which includes:\n    – enhancing capacity to support the launch of the Faster Payment System and easy banking initiatives;\n    – strengthening supervisory capacity to deal with the regional and business expansion of banks and to facilitate (i) the wider adoption of fintech in the provision of banking services and (ii) collaboration with other regulatory authorities on cyber security and fintech issues; and\n    – supporting the work of the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce to fight against fraud, money laundering and other types of financial crimes, and strengthening legal support for enforcement actions under legislation governing anti-money laundering and SVFs.\n- Strengthening investment, risk management and other related support for the further expansion and diversification of the Exchange Fund’s investment activities.\n- Stepping up global macro and financial-sector surveillance, and strengthening talent development programmes to ensure that the HKMA has the necessary human capital to meet the long-term development needs of the organisation.\n\nTable 1 gives a breakdown of the establishment and strength of the HKMA.\n\nTable 1 Establishment and strength of the HKMA on 1 January 2018\n\nTemporary resources are deployed to meet other work demands. The HKMA also transfers staff members on secondment to other international or local organisations, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Services Development Council, to assist in activities or policy initiatives in which Hong Kong or the HKMA has an interest. Some staff members are deployed on a full-time or part-time basis to provide operational support to the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board and the Treasury Markets Association.\n\n# Remuneration policies and pay review mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary (FS) determines the pay and conditions of service for HKMA staff on the advice of the Governance Sub-Committee (GSC) through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC), taking into account the prevailing market rates and practices. Remuneration comprises a total cash package and a provident fund scheme, with minimal benefits in kind. The cash package consists of monthly fixed pay (or basic pay) and variable pay, which may be awarded to individual staff members as a lump sum once a year, depending on performance.\n\nPay for HKMA staff is reviewed annually by the FS in the light of recommendations made to him by the GSC through the EFAC, taking into account the GSC’s assessment of the performance of the HKMA in the preceding year, the paysurvey findings of the financial sector conducted by independent human resources consultants, and any other relevant factors. Special pay adjustments may be made from time to time for individual meritorious staff members to maintain their pay competitiveness.\n\nAny approved annual adjustments to the fixed pay and any variable pay awards for the HKMA are distributed to individual staff members based on their performance. Investment professionals in the HKMA are subject to a variable pay system that seeks to strengthen the link between their investment performance and remuneration award. The pay adjustments and awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Executive Director and above are approved by the FS on the advice of the GSC. The staff members concerned are not present at the meetings when their pay is discussed. The pay adjustments and awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Division Head and below are determined by the Chief Executive of the HKMA under delegated authority from the FS and within the approved overall pay awards.\n\n# Remuneration of senior staff members\n\nThe remuneration packages of senior staff members in 2017 are shown in Table 2.\n\nTable 2 Remuneration packages of HKMA senior staff members in 2017\n\n# Manager Trainee (MT) and Graduate Economist (GE) programmes\n\nTo develop a pool of young talent with sharp analytical minds, strong communication skills and good team spirit for a long-term career in central banking, the HKMA runs two trainee programmes: the MT programme and the GE programme. Each programme lasts for a period of two years.\n\nThe MT programme prepares young graduates interested in central banking work to become the HKMA’s future key management staff and contribute to the financial stability and prosperity of Hong Kong. Each MT undergoes on-the-job training in two to three departments to acquire hands-on experience on the important functions of the HKMA. For the GE programme, young graduates interested in economic research are offered the opportunity to harness their research skills in two to three departments to provide important input to the policy formulation process.\n\nBoth the MT and GE programmes provide an all-rounded career development environment for the trainees.

{"en": "# The Exchange Fund\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 157 to 243, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2017, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2017, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards.  My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report.  I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards.  I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017.  These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information.  The other information comprises all the information included in the 2017 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.  If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact.  I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.  I also:\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.  The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.  If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion.  My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report.  However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and\n- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements.  I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit.  I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nDavid Sun\nDirector of Audit\n\n11 April 2018\n\n# 1 PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES\n\nThe Monetary Authority, under delegated authority from the Financial Secretary as Controller of the Exchange Fund (the Fund), manages the Fund in accordance with the provisions of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).  The principal activities of the Fund are safeguarding the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong and maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems.\n\nThe assets of the Fund are managed as four portfolios: the Backing Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio and the Strategic Portfolio.  The assets of the Backing Portfolio fully match the Monetary Base, under Hong Kong’s Currency Board system.  The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.  The Long-Term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments.  The Strategic Portfolio holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited acquired by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) for the account of the Fund for strategic purposes. Operating segment information is set out in note 30.\n\n# 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n# 2.1 Statement of compliance\n\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with all applicable Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRSs), which is a collective term that includes all applicable individual Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, Hong Kong Accounting Standards (HKASs) and Interpretations issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), and accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong.  A summary of the significant accounting policies adopted by the Fund and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) is set out below.\n\nThe HKICPA has issued certain new and revised HKFRSs that are first effective or available for early adoption for the current accounting period.  Note 3 provides information on the changes, if any, in accounting policies resulting from initial adoption of these developments to the extent that they are relevant to the Group for the current and prior accounting periods reflected in these financial statements.\n\n# 2.2 Basis of preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe Group financial statements include the financial statements of the Group as well as the Group’s interests in associates and joint ventures.  The principal activities of the principal subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are shown in notes 16 and 17.\n\nThe measurement basis used in the preparation of the financial statements is historical cost except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair values as explained in the accounting policies set out below:\n- trading financial instruments (note 2.6.2.1);\n- financial assets and financial liabilities designated at fair value (note 2.6.2.2);\n- available-for-sale securities (note 2.6.2.5);\n- gold (note 2.11); and\n- investment properties (note 2.12).\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with HKFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure.  The estimates and associated assumptions are based on experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.  Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nNote 18 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of investment properties.  Note 36 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of financial instruments.  Apart from the accounting judgements involving these fair value estimations, there are no other critical accounting judgements involved in the application of the Group’s accounting policies.\n\n# 2.3 Subsidiaries and non-controlling interests\n\nA subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group.  The Group controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.  When assessing whether the Group has power, only substantive rights (held by the Group and other parties) are considered.\n", "zh": "外匯基金\n\n審計署署長報告\n\n獨立核數師報告 致財政司司長\n\n意見\n\n本人證明，已審核外匯基金及其附屬公司（「本集團」）第157至243頁的財務報表，包括截至2017年12月31日的外匯基金及本集團的資產負債表，以及其本年度的收支帳目、全面收益表、權益變動表和現金流量表，並包括財務報表附註及重要會計政策摘要。\n\n本人認為，該等財務報表在所有重大方面真實準確地反映了外匯基金及本集團於2017年12月31日的財務狀況，以及該年度的經營成果和現金流量，並根據香港會計師公會（\"HKICPA\"）發出的《香港財務報告準則》（\"HKFRSs\"）編製，並已符合根據《外匯基金條例》（第66章）第7條由行政長官作出的指示。\n\n意見的依據\n\n本人根據《外匯基金條例》（第66章）第7條由行政長官作出的指示和審計署審計準則進行審核。本次審核的責任，於審計準則的《我在財務報表審核中的責任》部分進一步描述。本人依照該等準則保持獨立，並已遵守相關職業操守責任。本人相信，所收集的審核證據充分且恰當，可作為提出意見的基礎。\n\n主要審核事項\n\n主要審核事項是指在本人專業判斷中，於審核截止2017年12月31日之財務報表時，最具重要性。本等事項在審核整體財務報表及形成意見的過程中已作出處理，本人不就此作出獨立意見。\n\n其他資料\n\n貨幣管理局負責其他資料。其他資料包括香港金融管理局2017年年報內所有內容，除了財務報表及本人審計報告。\n\n本人對財務報表的意見不包括其他資料，也不提供任何保證性結論。\n\n在審核財務報表的相關工作中，本人責任為閱讀其他資料，並判斷該等資料是否在重大程度上與財務報表或本人從審計中獲得的知識矛盾或明顯錯誤。如根據本人所作工作，認為該等資料存在重大錯誤，即須就此作出報告，至今本人沒有此方面的匯報。\n\n貨幣管理局和外匯基金顧問委員會審計分委會對財務報表之責任\n\n貨幣管理局負責根據香港會計師公會（\"HKICPA\"）發出的《香港財務報告準則》及《外匯基金條例》（第66章）第7條的指示編製正確反映基金真實情況的財務報表，並負責任何內部控制措施，旨在確保財務報表能免於由欺詐或錯誤引起的重大錯漏。\n\n在編製財務報表時，貨幣管理局須評估本集團能否繼續作為持續經營，披露有關持續經營的事項並採用持續經營基準進行會計處理。\n\n外匯基金顧問委員會的審核分委會負責監督本集團的財務報告程序。\n\n審計師對財務報表的責任\n\n本人的目標是取得合理保證，即整體財務報表不包含由欺詐或錯誤引起的重大錯漏，並就此作出審計報告。合理保證是一個較高層次的保證，並不保證在依照審計署審計準則進行的審核中，始終能發現所有重大錯漏。錯漏可能源自欺詐或錯誤，若該等錯漏在個別或合併的情況下，可能合理地影響用戶根據財務報表所作的經濟決策，即屬重大。\n\n作為依照審計署審計準則進行審核的一部分，本人履行專業判斷，保持職業懷疑精神，並：\n- 識別及評估財務報表由欺詐或錯誤引起的重大錯誤風險，設計並執行應對該等風險的審計程序，並收集充分恰當的審核證據，以作出意見。由欺詐造成的重大錯漏未被發現的風險高於由錯誤引起的風險，因為欺詐可能涉及串謀、偽造、故意遺漏、虛假陳述或內部控制的超越；\n- 了解與審計相關的內部控制，以便設計合適的審計程序，但不對本集團內部控制的有效性作出意見；\n- 評估貨幣管理局所採用的會計政策是否恰當，以及其會計估計和披露是否合理；\n- 就貨幣管理局使用持續經營基准的適切性作出結論，並根據已收集的審核證據，判斷是否存在可能對本集團持續經營能力產生重大不確定性的事件或條件。如認為存在重大不確定性，則須在審核報告中提請注意財務報表的相關披露，若披露不足，則須作出修正。我的結論基於至我審核報告日已收集的證據，但未來事件或條件可能導致本集團停止持續經營；\n- 評估財務報表的整體呈現、結構及內容，包括披露，是否能適當反映交易和事項，達到公允列示；以及\n- 收集充分恰當的審核證據，以對本集團內的實體或業務活動的財務資料作出意見。本人負責指導、督導和執行集團審計，並對本人之審計意見負全責。\n\n本人會就計劃範圍、時間安排及重要審計事項（包括在審核過程中發現的任何重大內部控制缺陷）向外匯基金顧問委員會的審核分委會作出溝通。\n\n我亦向外匯基金顧問委員會的審核分委會提交聲明，證明我已遵守相關獨立性之道德規範，並就所有可能合理影響我獨立性的關係和其他事項作出溝通，如適用者，亦包括相關保障措施。\n\n根據與外匯基金顧問委員會的溝通事項，我確定在本期財務報表審核中最重要的事項，亦即關鍵審計事項，除非法律或規定禁止公開披露，或在極少數情況下，我認為不公開披露（因公開披露的負面後果可能超過公眾利益），皆會在審計報告中描述這些事項。\n\n審計署署長\n孫卓勤\n2018年4月11日"}

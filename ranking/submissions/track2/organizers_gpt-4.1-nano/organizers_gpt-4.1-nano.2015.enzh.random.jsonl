{"en": "# Highlights of 2015\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nEconomic growth in Hong Kong moderates, reflecting weaker domestic demand and subdued export performance. Local stock market sees large swings amid heightened volatility in global financial markets. The residential property market starts to soften after the announcement of the seventh round of prudential measures in February.\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector remains resilient. Locally incorporated authorized institutions (AIs) are well capitalised, and the liquidity positions of AIs continue to be sound. The asset quality of retail banks deteriorates slightly, but stays at healthy levels.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchang rate remains broadly stable against the US dollar, with the strong-side Convertibility Undertaking triggered repeatedly in April, September and October. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate market continues to operate in an orderly manner despite turbulent global financial market conditions, reflecting resilience of the Linked Exchange Rate System to external shocks.\n\nThe money market continues to function normally with ample interbank liquidity. Following the decision of the US Federal Reserve to raise the target range for the Federal Funds Rate, the Base Rate in Hong Kong is adjusted upwards by 25 basis points to 0.75% in December.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nSupervisory efforts on AIs’ risk governance, including credit and liquidity risk management systems, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing controls, and selling practices for investment and insurance products, have been stepped up.\n\nThe HKMA announces a countercyclical capital buffer for Hong Kong and designates five authorized institutions as domestic systemically important banks. Legislative proposals to establish a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong and enhance the Deposit Protection Scheme by achieving faster payouts are respectively introduced into the Legislative Council.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\nThe HKMA continues to actively participate in international and regional forums while sparing no effort in raising Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre. Legislative proposal to improve the tax environment for promoting Hong Kong as a hub for corporate treasury centres is introduced into the Legislative Council in December.\n\nHong Kong remains the global offshore renminbi business hub with a market of considerable depth and breadth. The Mainland-Hong Kong Mutual Recognition of Funds initiative is implemented in July, further expanding Hong Kong’s renminbi product offering.\n\nHong Kong’s financial infrastructure is further enhanced by the successful launch of the e-Cheque service in December, allowing customers to issue and deposit cheques online. A new regulatory regime which provides for licensing of multipurpose stored value facilities and designation of important retail payment systems commences operation in November.\n\n# Reserves Management\nAmid the challenging and difficult investment environment, the Exchange Fund records an overall investment return of -0.6%. Total assets of the Fund reach HK$3,422.9 billion at the end of 2015.\n\nthe HKMA quickens the pace of investment diversification, especially through investments under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). At the end of 2015, the market value of investments under the LTGP totals HK$142.1 billion, made up of HK$91.3 billion in private equity and HK$50.8 billion in real estate, with outstanding investment commitments amounting to HK$122.4 billion.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communications with the community and the market through the media, public education programmes, and various other channels to facilitate understanding of its policies and operations. Corporate governance is further improved by supporting professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline, enhancing it security, and realigning duties among senior management to help cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives and the increasing complexity of work.", "zh": "2015年亮點\n\n經濟及金融環境\n\n香港經濟增長趨於轉弱，反映內需較弱及出口表現低迷。全球金融市場波動加劇，導致本港股市出現大幅震盪。二月份第七輪審慎措施公布後，住宅物業市場開始轉弱。\n\n本港銀行業保持韌性。境內設立的持牌金融機構（AIs）資本充裕，流動性持續穩健。零售銀行的資產質素輕微轉差，但仍處於健康水平。\n\n貨幣穩定\n\n香港元兌美元匯率大致保持穩定，並在四月、九月及十月反覆觸發強市兌換保證承諾。儘管全球金融市場動盪，香港與美元的匯市仍有序運作，彰顯聯繫匯率制度抗禦外來震盪的韌性。\n\n貨幣市場正常運作，銀行間流動性充裕。美國聯邦儲備局決定上調聯邦基金利率目標區間後，香港基準利率於十二月上調25個基點至0.75%。\n\n銀行穩健\n\n加強對AIs風險管理的監管工作，包括信貸及流動性風險管理系統、反洗錢與反恐怖融資措施，以及投資和保險產品銷售實踐的管控。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）宣布對抗經濟循環波動的逆周期資本緩衝，並指派五間持牌金融機構為本地系統重要銀行。立法會分別提交建立金融機構破產解散制度的立法建議，以及透過加快撥付速度來優化存款保障計劃的提案。\n\n國際金融中心\n\nHKMA積極參與國際及區域論壇，並全力提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。十二月推出的立法建議，旨在改善稅務環境，推動香港成為企業財資中心。\n\n香港仍是全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐，市場規模廣闊。七月推行的內地與香港基金互認制度進一步擴展了香港的人民幣產品服務。\n\n香港的金融基礎設施得以進一步提升，十二月成功推出電子支票服務，使客戶能在網上開立及存款支票。十一月起新啟用一套針對多用途儲值支付工具的牌照制度和重要零售支付系統的指定規管制度。\n\n儲備管理\n\n面對挑戰重重的投資環境，匯控基金全年錄得整體投資回報率為負0.6%。截止2015年底，基金資產總值達到3,422.9億港元。\n\nHKMA加快多元化投資的步伐，尤其是在長遠增長組合（LTGP）中的投資。年末，其投資市值合共142.1億港元，其中私募股權91.3億港元，房地產50.8億港元，未來投資承諾金額達122.4億港元。\n\n企業職能\n\nHKMA通過媒體、公共教育計劃及各種渠道與社會和市場保持有效溝通，促進公眾理解其政策和操作。通過支持員工專業發展、實施嚴格的財務紀律、提升資訊安全，以及重整高層職責來應對新措施執行及工作日益複雜帶來的挑戰，企業管治亦進一步加強。"}
{"en": "# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nThe Hong Kong economy experienced slower growth in 2015 reflecting weaker domestic demand and poor export performance. Economic growth for 2016 is expected to remain soft amid stiff external headwinds and fragile financial market conditions.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Overview\n\nEconomic growth in Hong Kong moderated during the year, with real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth slowing to 2.4% from 2.6% in 2014 (Table 1). This reflected milder expansion in domestic demand, although net exports reverted to a positive contributor to GDP growth as total imports declined faster than total exports (Chart 1). Despite the modest economic performance, the labour market held broadly stable, with the unemployment rate staying low at about 3.3%. Inflation eased further due to subsiding pressures on domestic costs and import prices. Local stock prices saw large swings amid heightened volatility in global financial markets. The residential property market started to soften after the announcement of the seventh round of prudential measures in February, with housing prices showing further signs of consolidation towards the end of the year.\n\nChart 1 Real GDP growth by contribution\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\nTable 1 Real GDP growth by expenditure component (period-over-period)\n\nNote: The seasonally-adjusted quarter-on-quarter rates of change in the gross domestic fixed capital formation are not available.\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nOn the monetary front, exchange-rate stability was maintained in 2015, with the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate hovering near 7.75 against the US dollar. The strong-side Convertibility Undertaking was triggered in April due to equity-related inflows, and again in September and October reflecting conversions of the offshore renminbi into Hong Kong dollars and some commercial demand for Hong Kong dollars. With the enlarged Aggregate Balance, local interest rates continued to stay low, while the HKMA Base Rate was adjusted upwards from 0.5% to 0.75% following the US interest rate lift-off in mid-December. Because of softer credit demand, total loan growth in the banking sector slowed further to 3.5% in 2015 from 12.7% in 2014. The banking industry's overall loan quality weakened slightly, but the classified loan ratios remained at low levels.\n\n# Domestic demand\n\nDomestic demand grew at a slower pace in 2015. While broadly stable job and income conditions continued to provide support, weak consumer confidence and corrections in asset prices weighed on private consumption growth in the second half of the year. However, due to the relatively strong growth momentum in the first half, the full-year growth in private consumption increased to 4.8% from 3.3% in 2014. Government consumption increased slightly faster by 3.4%. In fact, the slower growth in domestic demand was mainly due to the 2.2% decline in gross domestic fixed capital formation (Chart 2). Private-sector machinery and equipment acquisition contracted for the second consecutive year amid deteriorating business sentiment, and building and construction activities also showed weaker growth momentum alongside slower progress in public projects.\n\n# External demand\n\nHong Kong’s export performance deteriorated in 2015 (Chart 3). Exports of goods recorded a broad-based 1.7% decline, the first time since 2009. Exports to Japan and the European Union declined, while those to the US recorded little growth. The feeble final demand from these advanced markets also weighed on regional industrial activities and intra-regional trade. As a result, Hong Kong’s exports to Mainland China, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan also decreased amid weak intermediate and final demand from these economies. Hong Kong’s exports of services continued to moderate from a high growth path in earlier years, which culminated in a 0.6% decline in 2015, mainly due to the slowdown in inbound tourism. Imports of goods also fell back alongside weaker domestic and export-induced demand. In contrast, growth in imports of services accelerated due to strong travel interest among local residents. On a net basis, the overall trade surplus improved slightly in 2015, leading to a modest positive contribution to GDP growth.\n\nChart 2 Domestic demand\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Inflation\n\nUnderlying inflation eased further in 2015 amid moderated domestic cost pressures and reduced import price inflation. After netting out the effects of the Government's one-off relief measures, the underlying inflation rate dropped to 2.5% from 3.5% in 2014 (Chart 4). With subdued economic activity, labour cost pressures remained steady, while commercial and industrial rental cost pressures eased, particularly in the second half. Thanks to softened global commodity prices and the strong Hong Kong dollar, import price pressures abated, while food inflation also stayed low. As the feed-through of fresh-letting housing rentals in earlier quarters had been moderate, the rental component of inflation remained contained.\n\nChart 3 Exports of goods and services\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\nChart 4 Underlying consumer price inflation\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\n# Labour market\n\nLabour market conditions remained stable in 2015. Labour demand held up, with the decline in employment in trade and tourism-related sectors being largely offset by the steady pace of hiring in other business sectors, resulting in an increase in total employment of 1.3% from a year earlier. With labour supply also picking up by 1.3%, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate stayed at around 3.3% throughout the year (Chart 5). Given the still-tight labour market, labour earnings in nominal terms rose by 4.7% in the first three quarters of the year, compared with 4.3% in 2014. With inflationary pressures easing, real labour earnings increased by 1.3% in the first three quarters, compared with a decline of 0.1% in 2014.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe Hong Kong stock market experienced a volatile year due to drastic changes in the external environment. After a flat first quarter, the local stock market was buoyant in the second quarter amid the bullish sentiment in the Mainland A-share market and capital inflows. The Hang Seng Index surged to a seven-year high in April, with the Southbound Daily Quota under the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect being exhausted for the first time since its inception in November 2014 (Chart 6). However, the local market reversed course starting from late June, with the Hang Seng Index plunging 28% to a year-low in September amid the sell-offs in the Mainland A-share market and global stock markets, the heightened volatility in the global foreign exchange market, and weaknesses in international commodity prices. The Hong Kong stock market recovered some ground in the last quarter as global and Mainland financial markets stabilised. For 2015 as a whole, the Hang Seng index recorded a decline of 7.2%, the worst performance since 2011, while the average daily turnover rose to HK$105.6 billion from HK$69.5 billion in 2014. Although fund-raising activities moderated in the second half, the overall equity funds raised from the local stock market increased to HK$1,115.6 billion from HK$942.7 billion a year earlier.\n\n# Property market\n\nSigns of consolidation emerged in the residential property market. After experiencing a buoyant period in early 2015, the residential property market softened following the announcement of the seventh round of prudential measures in February. With housing prices picking up at a slower pace before declining in the last quarter, the cumulative increase in housing prices in 2015 was 2.5%, smaller than the 13.5% increase in 2014 (Chart 6). Meanwhile, the transaction volume decreased by 12.3% from a year ago to 55,982 units as trading activities in the secondary market fell noticeably in the second half. Speculative transactions, including confirmor transactions and short-term flipping trades, continued to stay low. Despite this, household affordability remained stretched, with the price-to-income ratio reaching 15.7 and the income-gearing ratio remaining far above its long-term average. The commercial and industrial property markets were buoyant in the first half, but trading activities then softened, with both prices and rents registering declines in the last quarter. Rental yields remained broadly the same from a year earlier and stayed near their historical lows.\n\nChart 6 Asset prices\nSources: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nHong Kong’s economic growth for 2016 is expected to remain soft. Private-sector analysts project the economy to expand at a slower average rate of 1.7% while the Government forecasts growth in the range of 1–2%. More specifically, the lacklustre global growth prospects, sustained weakness in inbound tourism, and the negative spillovers from turbulent global financial market conditions will continue to restrain the performance of Hong Kong’s exports. Domestically, private consumption is anticipated to grow moderately, as labour market conditions will likely face some pressures amid weaker economic momentum, and local asset price adjustments may dent consumer confidence and induce negative wealth effects. Building and construction activities may hold up, but weak business sentiment and interest rate rises will weigh on private capital investment.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nInflationary pressures are expected to remain contained in 2016. Import price pressures will likely stay soft, while domestic cost pressures are expected to be modest amid moderate economic growth momentum. The rental component of inflation may also ease due to diminishing pressures in fresh-letting housing rentals towards the end of 2015. Market consensus predicts the headline inflation rate at 2.5% in 2016, while the Government projects the underlying inflation rate at 2.0%. The labour market may also soften somewhat due to the slowdown in inbound tourism and continued sluggishness in the export sector. Private-sector analysts now expect the unemployment rate to increase to 3.5% in 2016.\n\n# Uncertainties and risks\n\nThe economic outlook for 2016 is subject to a number of uncertainties and risks. In particular, the pace of further US interest rate rises, the global growth prospects and commodity price movements will continue to be the major sources of uncertainty. Any significant adverse developments could heighten volatilities in global financial markets and international capital flows, thereby tightening domestic monetary and financial conditions and casting a shadow over Hong Kong's growth prospects. The resulting impact of these external factors on the domestic economy will depend crucially on their impact on the property market through the wealth and balance-sheet effects. While the property market is facing increasing downside risks stemming from weakening sentiment in the global and domestic financial markets, the normalisation of US interest rates, and a narrowing housing demand-supply gap, more time is needed to establish whether the property market has entered a down-cycle. Although an abrupt adjustment in the property market could pose significant headwinds to the broader economy, the introduction of counter-cyclical macroprudential measures and other supervisory measures over the past few years has significantly enhanced the resilience of Hong Kong's banking system.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector remained resilient during the year, notwithstanding a further divergence in the monetary policies of advanced economies and the build-up of vulnerabilities in emerging market economies. The liquidity positions of authorized institutions (AIs) continued to be sound, and locally incorporated AIs were well capitalised. The asset quality of retail banks deteriorated slightly, but stayed at a healthy level.\n\n# Interest rate trends\n\nIn line with the US dollar interest rates, Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates were low throughout the year. The Hong Kong dollar funding cost of retail banks declined in the first half of the year as indicated by a downward trend in the composite interest rate, and remained stable in the second half (Chart 7).\n\nChart 7 HIBOR fixings, composite rate and best lending rate (BLR)\nNotes:\n1. HiBoR fixings refer to the Hong Kong Dollar interest Settlement Rates released by the Hong Kong Association of Banks and are monthly averages.\n\n2. BlR refers to the best lending rate quoted by the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (monthly averages).\n\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe profitability of the banking sector moderated in 2015. The aggregate pre-tax operating profits of retail banks' Hong Kong offices declined by 2.8%, as growth in fee and commission income (up 9.7%), foreign exchange and derivatives operation income (up 22.4%), and net interest income (up 1.3%) was offset by an 8.8% increase in operating expenses and a 76% increase in loan impairment charges. However, the post-tax profit of retail banks increased by 14.7%, mainly due to gains from disposals of strategic investments. The post-tax return on average assets of retail banks improved to 1.05% from 0.99% in 2014 (Chart 8).\n", "zh": "# 經濟及金融環境\n\n香港經濟在2015年呈現較為轉弱的增長，反映內需轉弱及出口業績不佳。預計2016年經濟增長仍將保持低迷，受到嚴峻的外部逆風及金融市場脆弱的影響。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 概覽\n\n香港經濟在年內適度放緩，實際國內生產總值（GDP）增長由2014年的2.6%轉為2.4%（表1）。這反映內需擴張較為溫和，儘管淨出口重返增長貢獻，因為進口總額下降速度快於出口（圖1）。儘管經濟表現有限，但就業市場仍較穩定，失業率保持在約3.3%的低水平。由於國內成本及進口價格的下行壓力，通脹進一步緩和。由於全球金融市場波動加劇，本港股市出現較大波動。二月第七輪嚴格控管措施公布後，住宅市場開始轉弱，房價逐步收斂，並在年底顯示進一步企穩的跡象。\n\n圖1 實質GDP按貢獻度之增長\n資料來源：統計處。\n\n表1 按支出成分之實質GDP增長（期比較）\n\n註：未提供季節調整後的季度變化率數據。\n資料來源：統計處。\n\n# 經濟及金融環境\n\n在貨幣方面，2015年匯率保持穩定，港元兌美元匯率在7.75附近浮動。由於股市相關資金流入，強方可兌承諾於4月被觸發，9月及10月則因為離岸人民幣兌港元的轉換及部分商業需求而再度觸發。隨著資金餘額擴大，當地利率持續偏低。12月中美國加息後，港幣基準利率由0.5%上調至0.75%。由於信貸需求較為疲軟，銀行業的整體貸款增長在2015年進一步放緩至3.5%，低於2014年的12.7%。行業的整體貸款質素略微轉弱，但分類貸款比率仍保持較低水平。\n\n# 本港需求\n\n2015年本港需求增長放慢。盡管就業和收入狀況大致維持穩定，但消費者信心轉弱及資產價格調整影響了後半年的私人消費增長。不過，受惠於上半年較強的增長動能，全年私人消費增長由2014年的3.3%上升至4.8%。政府消費稍微加快增長至3.4%。但整體本港需求放緩主要由國內資本形成的下跌所致，該數據較去年同期下降2.2%（圖2）。私營行業的機械及設備購入連續第二年收縮，商業信心惡化，公共工程進展較慢亦使建築與施工活動的增長動能轉弱。\n\n# 外部需求\n\n2015年香港出口表現惡化（圖3）。商品出口出現廣泛下跌，首次自2009年以來錄得1.7%的普遍下跌。出口至日本及歐盟均錄得下跌，對美國的出口增幅則幾乎持平。這些先進經濟體的終端需求疲軟，亦拖累區域內工業活動和區內貿易。因此，香港對內地、新加坡、韓國及台灣的出口也因需求疲軟而下降。服務出口雖然由早前的高速增長轉為轉弱，2015年較上年下降0.6%，主要因入境旅遊放緩。商品進口則因本地及出口帶動需求轉弱而回落，但由於本地居民的旅遊需求強勁，服務進口則加快增長。整體貿易順差在2015年略有改善，對GDP形成正面貢獻。\n\n圖2 本港需求\n資料來源：統計處。\n\n# 通脹\n\n2015年，基礎通脹進一步緩和，主要原因是國內成本壓力減輕及進口物價上升放慢。在扣除政府一次性紓困措施影響後，核心通脹率由2014年的3.5%下降至2.5%（圖4）。隨著經濟活動疲弱，勞工成本保持穩定，而商業及工業租金的成本壓力亦有所緩和，特別是下半年。由於全球大宗商品價格走軟及港幣匯率堅挺，進口物價壓力緩解，食品通脹亦維持低水平。由於早期季度的租金傳導相對溫和，租金項目在通脹中仍保持可控。\n\n圖3 商品與服務出口\n資料來源：統計處。\n\n圖4 核心消費者物價指數通脹\n資料來源：統計處。\n\n# 經濟及金融環境\n\n# 薪酬市場\n\n2015年，薪酬市場保持穩定。就業需求持續，貿易及旅遊相關行業的就業減少大致被其他業務部門的招聘所抵銷，導致就業總數較去年同期增加1.3%。由於勞動供應亦增加約1.3%，季節調整後失業率全年維持約3.3%（圖5）。由於就業市場仍較緊張，名義工資在前三季度上升4.7%，高於2014年的4.3%。通脹壓力放緩，實質工資在前三季度增加1.3%，較2014年0.1%的下降有所改善。\n\n# 股市\n\n由於外部環境劇變，香港股市經歷濃烈波動。第一季基本持平，第二季在內地A股牛市情緒及資金流入帶動下，市場表現較為熱烈，恒生指數於4月飆升至七年高位，並且自2014年11月以來首次用完滬港通南向每日額度（示意圖6）。不過，自6月底開始，市場轉為下行，恒指於9月暴跌28%，創下一年新低，原因包括大陸A股的拋售、全球股市的震盪、外匯市場波動加劇及國際商品價格轉弱。在全球及內地金融市場逐步穩定後，港股在最後一季有所回升。2015年首循，恒生指數下跌7.2%，為2011年以來最差表現，日均成交額由2014年的695億港元升至1056億港元。儘管第二季募資活動收縮，但整體股本融資從942.7億港元增加至1115.6億港元。\n\n# 房地產市場\n\n住宅房地產出現企穩跡象。在2015年初經歷一段繁榮期後，二月公布第七輪嚴格控制措施後，住宅市場開始轉弱。房價增長速度放慢，年底前房價較年初累計上升2.5%，遠低於2014年的13.5%（示意圖6）。同期，成交量較去年同期減少12.3%，達55,982宗，二手交易明顯減少。投機性交易，包括轉讓及短線倒賣，仍處於低迷狀態。儘管如此，家庭負擔能力仍較吃緊，房價與收入比率達15.7，收入負擔比仍長期偏高。商用及工用物業在上半年較為活躍，但交易和租金在最後一季均錄得下跌。租金收益率較去年幾乎未變，並持續逼近歷史低位。\n\n圖6 資產價格\n資料來源：評樓署及香港交易所。\n\n# 經濟及金融環境\n\n# 預測展望\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n預計香港2016年經濟增長仍較為轉弱。私營分析師預測全年經濟將以較慢的1.7%平均增長，政府則預測在1%至2%之間。全球經濟增長前景欠佳、入境遊客持續疲弱及全球金融市場動盪帶來的負面溢出影響，將繼續限制香港出口的表現。在內需方面，隨著經濟增長動能較弱，勞工市場所面臨的壓力可能加大，資產價格調整亦或削弱消費者信心及引發負富效應。建築與施工或可保持平穩，但商業信心低迷及加息將對私人資本投資帶來壓力。\n\n# 通脹及薪酬市場\n\n2016年，通脹壓力預計仍維持可控水平。進口物價壓力料保持溫和，內需成本壓力亦將較為溫和，伴隨經濟增長動能放緩，租金通脹可能進一步緩和，特別是12月前新租房屋租金的壓力減弱。市場普遍預測2016年整體通脹率約為2.5%，而政府則估計核心通脹率約為2.0%。由於入境旅遊放緩及出口疲軟，薪酬市場亦可能略為轉弱，預計失業率將升至3.5%。\n\n# 不確定性及風險\n\n2016年經濟前景存在諸多不確定性與風險，尤其包括美國加息步伐、全球增長前景及商品價格變動等，將是主要的不確定因素。任何重大負面發展都可能加劇全球金融市場和國際資金流動的波動，進而收緊內部貨幣及金融狀況，令香港經濟增長蒙上陰影。這些外部因素對內地房地產市場的影響，將主要取決於其對財富效應和資產負債表的影響。儘管全球與本地金融市場的不景氣增加下行風險，且房地產市場正面臨負面風險，包括全球及本地市場信心轉弱、加息預期以及房市供求趨緊，仍需時間評估樓市是否已進入下行週期。若房地產突然大幅轉弱，可能對整體經濟構成重大阻力，但過去推行的反循環宏觀審慎措施及其他監管措施，已大幅提升香港銀行體系的抗震能力。\n\n# 銀行業表現\n\n儘管全球主要經濟體貨幣政策分歧擴大，新興市場經濟脆弱性增加，香港銀行業仍展現韌性。授權機構（AIs）資金流動狀況保持良好，本地成立的金融機構資本充裕。零售銀行的資產質素稍有惡化，但仍屬健康水平。\n\n# 利率趨勢\n\n沿襲美金利率變動，2015年期間，港元拆放利率保持低位。受惠於一季的整體利率走跌，零售銀行的港幣融資成本一度降低，之後則於下半季保持穩定（示意圖7）。\n\n圖7 港幣拆息（HIBOR）定價、綜合利率及最佳貸款利率（BLR）\n註：\n1.

{"en": "# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained broadly stable throughout 2015 despite turbulent financial market conditions and the US interest rate lift-off in December. The money market also continued to function normally with ample interbank liquidity. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability over the past few decades, the Linked Exchange Rate System continued to be hiqhly resilient to external shocks.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong's monetary policy is currency stability. This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong's currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75 - 7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises\n\n* Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks\n* Government-issued notes and coins in circulation \n* the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of clearing account balances of banks kept with the HKMA \n* Exchange Fund Bills and Notes issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs). When the demand for Hong Kong dollars is greater than the supply and the market exchange rate strengthens to the strong-side CU of HK$7.75 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to sell Hong Kong dollars to banks for US dollars. The Aggregate Balance will then expand to push down Hong Kong dollar interest rates, creating monetary conditions that move the Hong Kong dollar away from the strong-side limit to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if the supply of Hong Kong dollars is greater than demand and the market exchange rate weakens to the weak-side CU of HK$7.85 to one US dollar, the HKMA will buy Hong Kong dollars from banks. The Aggregate Balance will then contract to drive Hong Kong dollar interest rates up, pushing the Hong Kong dollar away from the weak-side limit to stay within the Convertibility Zone.\n\nThe Certificates of Indebtedness and the government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation shown here are stated at Hong Kong dollar face values. The corresponding items shown in the balance sheet of the Exchange Fund in this Annual Report are in Hong Kong dollars equivalent to the US dollar amounts required for their redemption at the prevailing exchange rates on the balance sheet date. This arrangement is in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong.\n\nThe amount of EFBN shown here is different from that in the balance sheet of the Exchange Fund in this Annual Report. In accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong, the EFBN held by the HKMA on behalf of the Exchange Fund in relation to its trading of the EFBN in the secondary market are offset against the EFBN issued, and the net amount is recorded in the balance sheet.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\n# REVIEW OF 2015\n\n# Exchange-rate stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained broadly stable in 2015, trading within a narrow range of 7.7500 to 7.7657 against the US dollar (Chart 1). In the early part of 2015, the Hong Kong dollar was under slight weakening pressures amid market concerns about the US interest rate lift-off. However, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate strengthened close to 7.75 during the second quarter, with the strong-side CU being triggered repeatedly in April mainly due to a surge in equity-related demand for the Hong Kong dollar amid buoyant stock market activities. Moving into the second half of the year, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate continued to hover close to 7.75 against the US dollar in August, despite the notable sell-off in Hong Kong and Mainland’s equity markets, and increased volatilities in the global currency markets (including the renminbi). Driven by conversions of the offshore renminbi into the Hong Kong dollar, the strong-side CU was triggered again in September and October. While the US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) raised the target range for the Federal Funds Rate by 25 basis points in mid-December, the Hong Kong dollar continued to move within a tight range against the US dollar without notable outflow pressures. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market operated in an orderly manner throughout 2015, despite the turbulent global financial market conditions.\n\nChart 1 Market exchange rate in 2015\n\nAs the strong-side CU was repeatedly triggered in April, September and October, the HKMA passively purchased a total of US$29.3 billion from banks in exchange for HK$227.2 billion, in accordance with the Currency Board principles. This led to a corresponding expansion in the Aggregate Balance, with part of the expansion being offset by additional issuance of Exchange Fund Bills in response to banks’ strong demand for liquidity management (Chart 2). The additional issuance of Exchange Fund paper is consistent with Currency Board principles, as it represents a change in the composition of the Monetary Base with the Monetary Base fully backed by foreign exchange reserves. The total of Aggregate Balance and outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and notes increased to HK$1,221.0 billion at the end of 2015 from HK$992.5 billion a year earlier.\n\nChart 2 Aggregate Balance and outstanding Exchange Fund paper in 2015\n\n# Money market\n\nWith ample liquidity in the banking system, Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained low throughout 2015. As the target range for the US Federal Funds Rate was adjusted upwards from 0–0.25% to 0.25–0.5% on 16 December (US time), the Base Rate was also adjusted upwards from 0.5% to 0.75% on 17 December according to the pre-set formula. For 2015 as a whole, interbank interest rates for tenors from overnight to three months stayed below the Base Rate (Chart 3), with moderate fluctuations driven by banks’ seasonal liquidity needs and tightened liquidity amid volatile financial market conditions in August. Broadly tracking the spreads between the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) and the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), the Hong Kong dollar forward points turned to notable premiums in August amid tightened market liquidity, and then subsequently dipped into discounts towards the end of the year due to the broad-based increases in the US dollar interest rates (Chart 4). Overall, the money market continued to function normally. Discount Window borrowing was not active, amounting to only HK$2.8 billion in 2015.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nChart 3 Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates in 2015\n\nChart 4 Hong Kong dollar forward points in 2015\n\n# Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nSince its establishment in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has continued to function smoothly and contributed significantly to Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability over the past few decades. Given Hong Kong's small and open economy and its role as an international financial hub, the LERS remains the most suitable exchange rate regime for Hong Kong. The Hong Kong SAR Government is firmly committed to maintaining the LERS. Indeed, stability in the foreign exchange and money markets further reinforces the credibility of the Government's commitment, and the public continues to have strong confidence in the Hong Kong dollar as a means of payment and storage of value. In its 2015 Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) continued to endorse the LERS as the best monetary arrangement for Hong Kong, citing Hong Kong's robust institutional, legal and policy framework, ample fiscal reserves, flexible markets, and sound financial system as key factors supporting the smooth functioning of the LERS.\n\nGiven that a robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS, the HKMA continued to closely monitor banks' management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and stepped up its supervisory efforts on banks' corporate and property-related lending to enhance the resilience of the banking sector. In view of the rise in US interest rates, the HKMA reminded the public to make necessary preparations in managing risks, noting that any triggering of the weak-side CU and outflow of Hong Kong dollars are a natural and necessary step in the process of the normalisation of the Hong Kong dollar interest rates.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) moved within a narrow range of 106.3-107.5% during 2015, without touching the Upper or Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 106.3% on 31 December (Chart 5). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. The large amount of financial resources of the Fund provides a powerful backstop to protect Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability in the event of abrupt shocks.\n\nChart 5 Daily movement of the Backing Ratio in 2015\n\n# Other activities\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) Currency Board Sub-Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong. In 2015, the Sub-Committee considered issues including the supply of international US dollar loans by global banks, the international use of macro-prudential measures, the implications of US interest rate hikes for Hong Kong's property market, the formula for the determination of the Base Rate, macroeconomic implications of the Hong Kong dollar real effective exchange rate rise, and the sovereign risk of emerging market economies. Records of the Sub-Committee’s discussions and the reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the Sub-Committee are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research (HKIMR) continued to sponsor research in the fields of monetary policy, banking and finance. In 2015, the Institute hosted 16 research fellows and published 27 working papers.\n\nThe Institute organised five international conferences and workshops. The main ones included:\n\n* The Sixth Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy in January, under the title \"Leverage and Financial System Efficiency and Stability: Chinese and International Experiences\". 11 high quality research papers were presented at the conference, covering an extensive range of issues such as corporate leverage in China, China's credit boom and business cycle, banking competition and financial stability, as well as banking regulation and credit supply.\n* The HKIMR and the University of Hong Kong joint conference entitled \"HKIMR-HKU International Conference on Finance, Institutions and Economic Growth\" in May. The conference covered many different economic issues, including banking and monetary policy, international financing and cross border mergers and acquisitions, design of financial regulation, as well as macroeconomic environment and capital markets.\n* The HKIMR, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas joint conference in October on \"Diverging Monetary Policies, Global Capital Flows and Financial Stability\". The conference examined a wide range of issues including the relationship between monetary policies, international capital flows and exchange rates, divergent monetary policies and their implications for global financial stability, spillover of major central bank policies to other parts of the world, and the costs and benefits of global policy co-ordination.\n\nThe Institute also hosted its 13th HKIMR Summer Workshop in August, and the 13th HKIMR Conference on the Mainland Economy in September, addressing issues on fiscal reform and local government financing in Mainland China. The conferences and workshops were attended by participants from academia, the financial services industry and global central banks. In addition, the Institute held 24 public seminars during the year covering a broad range of economic, monetary and financial issues.\n\n# Notes and coins\n\nAt the end of 2015, the total value of banknotes in circulation was HK$360.2 billion, an increase of 5.3% from a year earlier (Charts 6, 7 and 8). The total value of government-issued notes and coins in circulation amounted to HK$11.2 billion, up 2.9% (Charts 9 and 10). The value of government-issued HK$10 notes in circulation was HK$4.0 billion, of which 85% were polymer notes.\n", "zh": "# 貨幣穩定\n\n儘管2015年全球金融市場動盪加劇，以及12月美國利率升息，本港美元兌匯率在整個年份中大致保持達穩定。貨幣市場亦繼續正常運作，銀行間流動資金充裕。作為過去數十年間本港貨幣及金融穩定的基石，聯繫匯率制度依然高度轉弱地應對外部衝擊，保持高度韌性。\n\n# 目標\n\n本港貨幣政策的首要目標是貨幣穩定。這被定義為港元在外匯市場中兌美元的匯率保持於7.75至7.85港元一美元的範圍內。在貨幣制度方面，採用貨幣局安排，要求貨幣基礎換取至少100%的美元儲備支持，並且貨幣基礎的變動必須由相應的美元儲備變化所匹配。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n* 負債證書，全面支持三家發鈔銀行的鈔票發行\n* 政府發行的流通鈔票和硬幣\n* 總結餘，即由港交所管理局（HKMA）持有的銀行清算帳戶餘額之和\n* 由港交所管理局代表政府發行的匯票和票據\n\n在維持港元兌匯率穩定方面，採用自動利率調整機制，以及港交所管理局對履行兌換承諾（CU）的堅定承諾。當港元需求超過供應，市場匯率升至強側CU：HK$7.75兌一美元，港交所管理局即準備售出港元換取美元。同期，總結餘會擴大，壓低港元利率，令貨幣條件從強側限制向兌換區（7.75至7.85港元）內調整。相反，若港元供過於求，市場匯率下跌至弱側CU：HK$7.85兌一美元，港交所管理局會買入港元，總結餘縮減，推高港元利率，將港元從弱側限制推離以保持在兌換區。\n\n負債證書及在流流通的政府貨幣鈔票和硬幣，均以港幣面值列示。這些項目在本年度報告的匯兌基金資產負債表中，按照當日匯率折算成港幣，以美元的金額進行贖回。此安排依照香港普遍接受的會計原則運作。\n\n此處所示的匯兌基金（EFBN）金額與年度報告中的匯兌基金資產負債表數字不同。根據香港普遍會計原則，港交所管理局代表匯兌基金持有的EFBN，以對沖其在二級市場的交易，並將淨額記錄在資產負債表中。\n\n# 貨幣穩定\n\n# 2015年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n2015年，儘管受到全球市場動盪的影響，本港美元兌匯率保持在7.7500至7.7657的狹窄範圍（圖1）。在年初，因市場擔憂美國升息，本港美元稍受轉弱壓力，但於第二季度，匯率全線轉強，並多次觸發強側CU（即HK$7.75兌一美元），主要由於股市活躍帶動的股票相關需求激增。進入下半年，儘管本港和內地股市出現明顯拋售，以及全球貨幣市場波動（包括人民幣）加大，港元兌美元匯率仍在7.75左右震盪。借由離岸人民幣兌港元的拆倉操作，強側CU在9月和10月再度被觸發。儘管12月中，美國聯邦公開市場委員會（FOMC）將聯邦基金利率目標範圍提高25個基點，港元兌美元仍穩於緊湊範圍內，無明顯資金外流壓力。整體而言，儘管全球金融市場動盪，2015年本港兌匯市場運作井然有序。\n\n圖1 2015年市場匯率\n\n由於4月、9月和10月多次觸發強側CU，港交所管理局被動向銀行出售合共29.3億美元，以換取2272億港元，符合貨幣局原則。此舉導致總結餘同步擴大，部分擴張則由應銀行強烈需求進行的匯兌資金協調（即發行匯票）所抵銷（圖2）。額外發行的匯兌票據，符合貨幣局原則，其代表貨幣基礎組成的變化，而貨幣基礎由外匯儲備全數支持。2015年底，總結餘與外匯基金發行票據的總額，已由前一年的9925億港元增加至12210億港元。\n\n圖2 2015年總結餘與外匯基金票據總額\n\n# 資金市場\n\n由於銀行系統流動資金充裕，2015年本港美元拆借利率全年保持低位。美聯儲於12月16日（美國時間）將聯邦基金利率區間從0–0.25%調整至0.25–0.5%，港交所管理局亦於12月17日根據預設公式，將基準利率由0.5%上調至0.75%。整個2015年，隔夜至三個月的銀行拆借利率始終低於基準利率（圖3），波動受季節性資金需求及8月市場流動性緊縮影響。跟蹤港元拆息（HIBOR）與倫敦拆息（LIBOR）之間的差價，8月，因市場流動性緊張，港元遠期點轉為顯著溢價，之後在年底由於美元利率整體上升而轉入貼水（圖4）。整體而言，貨幣市場正常運作，並未出現借款活動旺盛的狀況，2015年貼現窗口借款僅約2.8億港元。\n\n# 貨幣穩定\n\n圖3 2015年本港美元拆借利率\n\n圖4 2015年港元遠期點\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n自1983年成立以來，聯繫匯率制度（LERS）一直平穩運作，並在過去數十年中大大促進了香港的貨幣與金融穩定性。鑑於香港經濟規模較小且開放，且作為國際金融中心的角色，LERS依然是最適合香港的匯率制度。本港特區政府堅定致力於維持聯繫匯率制度。事實上，外匯及貨幣市場的穩定性進一步提升政策的可信性，亦令公眾對港元作為支付手段和價值儲存的信心鞏固。國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）在2015年對香港的第IV次評估中，持續支持LERS是香港最適合的貨幣安排，稱讚香港的制度架構健全、法制與政策具彈性、財政儲備豐富、市場靈活且金融系統穩健，支持LERS的順利運作。\n\n由於穩健的銀行體系對LERS的正常運作至關重要，港交所管理局持續密切監察銀行在信貸、流動性及利率風險管理方面的狀況及應力測試，並加強對銀行信貸，特別是企業及地產相關貸款的監管，以提升銀行業的韌性。鑑於美國升息帶來的壓力，港交所管理局提醒公眾做好風險管理準備，並指出觸發弱側CU和港幣外流是貨幣正常化過程中的自然且必要行為。\n\n為提高清楚匯率制度公信度，自1998年10月起，部分匯兌基金資產被撥用來支持貨幣基礎。其支持比率（Backing Ratio，即支持資產除以貨幣基礎）在2015年維持在106.3%至107.5%之間，未觸及上下破閾（圖5）。截至12月31日，該比率為106.3%。在LERS下，儘管特定匯兌基金資產被指定用於支持支持組合，所有資產仍可用以支持港幣匯率。基金巨額的財務資源能提供有力後盾，在面對突發震盪時保護本港貨幣和金融穩定。\n\n圖5 2015年每日支持比率變動\n\n# 其他活動\n\n匯兌基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）貨幣局分委會負責監察和審閱與本港貨幣及金融穩定相關的議題。2015年，分委會考慮了包括全球銀行提供的國際美元貸款供應、宏觀審慎措施的國際使用、美元升息對本港樓市的影響、基準利率的計算公式、香港美元實有效匯率上升的宏觀經濟影響，以及新興市場國家的主權風險等議題。分委會討論記錄和貨幣局提交的相關報告，已在港交所網址公布。\n\n# 貨幣穩定\n\n香港金融研究中心（HKIMR）繼續資助貨幣政策、銀行與金融領域的研究項目。2015年，中心共聘16名研究員，並出版了27篇研究報告。\n\n中心亦舉辦了五場國際會議和研討會，主要包括：\n* 1月的第六屆中國經濟國際年會，主題為「槓桿與金融系統效率與穩定：中外經驗」，共有11篇高質研究論文發表，涵蓋企業槓桿、中國信用熱潮與經濟循環、銀行競爭與金融穩定、以及金融監管和信貸供應等多方面議題。\n* 5月由HKIMR與香港大學聯合主辦的「HKIMR-香港大學金融、制度與經濟增長國際會議」，涵蓋銀行和貨幣政策、國際融資與跨境併購、金融監管設計、宏觀經濟與資本市場等主題。\n* 10月，由HKIMR、聯邦儲備系統理事會、歐洲央行及達拉斯聯邦儲備銀行共同舉辦的「分歧性貨幣政策、全球資金流動與金融穩定」研討會，討論貨幣政策、國際資金流與匯率間的關係，分歧性貨幣政策對全球金融穩定的影響，以及主要央行政策擴散的成本與效益。\n\n中心亦於8月舉辦第13屆HKIMR夏季研習班，9月舉行第13屆中國經濟研討會，討論財政改革與地方政府融資問題。多場會議與研討會由學界、金融業及國際央行代表參與。此外，中心在年內舉辦24場公開研討會，涵蓋經濟、貨幣及金融的各個範疇。\n\n# 钞票與硬幣\n\n至2015年底，流通鈔票總值為3602億港元，同比增加5.3%（圖6、7、8）。政府發行的流通鈔票和硬幣總值為112億港元，上升2.9%（圖9、10）。政府發行的10港元流通鈔票值為40億港元，其中85%為聚合物鈔票。"}
{"en": "# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA focused its supervisory efforts on authorized institutions risk governance, including credit and liquidity risk management systems, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing controls, and selling practices for investment and insurance products. With the build-up of systemic risks, the HKMA announced a 0.625% jurisdictional Countercyclical Capital Buffer for Hong Kong from 1 January 2016 (and 1.25% from 1 January 2017). Five authorized institutions were designated as Domestic Systemically Important Banks which will be subject to a Higher Loss Absorbency capital buffer. Significant progress was made on reforms for recovery and resolution with the introduction of the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Bill into the Legislative Council. The HKMA also stepped up its work with the banking industry on enhancing access to basic banking services, consumer education, and the skills and knowledge development of bank directors and financial practitioners.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2015\n\n# Overview\n\nAmid signs of a divergence in monetary policy stances among the major developed economies, emerging markets faced a higher risk of capital outflows and slower economic growth in 2015. In order to maintain the resilience of the banking sector against a possible abrupt deterioration in the macroeconomic environment, the HKMA continued to closely monitor the effectiveness of authorized institutions’ (AIs) risk governance and their systems for management of credit and liquidity risks.\n\n# Operational supervision\n\nIn 2015, the HKMA continued to adopt the supervisory approach where regular on-site examinations were supplemented by an increased number of thematic reviews. Thematic reviews are in-depth off-site reviews focusing on particular risk areas or specific activities of groups of selected AIs. This approach has allowed the HKMA to prioritise its supervisory resources to focus on emerging and more significant risks of AIs.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA performed a total of 193 on-site examinations. More in-depth thematic on-site examinations on credit risk management and asset quality were conducted, in view of the emerging signs of deterioration in the asset quality of AIs' loan portfolio. The HKMA increased the number of examinations on treasury related activities given market uncertainty amid the divergence of monetary policies in major advanced economies. On-site examinations were also conducted on Mainland-related business, stress testing and liquidity risk management, operational and technology risk management, capital planning, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML/CFT) controls and internal ratings-based (IRB) models of AIs. AIs' activities in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses were also subject to on-site examinations by specialist teams during the year.\n\nFurthermore, a total of 152 thematic off-site reviews were conducted covering similar areas as the thematic on-site examinations. Table 1 contains details of the operational supervision work.\n\nIn 2015, 196 off-site reviews were conducted to assess AIs’ corporate governance, financial position and business operations. Supervisory attention focused on risk governance, capital planning, corporate sector credit and monitoring of implementation of Basel III standards. The supervisory teams maintained frequent contact with the boards of directors and external auditors of selected AIs. 20 tripartite meetings were held with the senior management and external auditors of AIs, while 23 meetings were held with the full board or board-level committees of selected AIs.\n\nThe Banking Supervision Review Committee considered four cases, all concerning the authorization of AIs.\n\nTo better utilise its supervisory resources to deal with competing priorities, the HKMA continued to invoke powers under section 59(2) of the Banking Ordinance to require AIs to appoint external auditors to follow up on potentially material supervisory issues. The HKMA commissioned six reports under this provision in 2015. Two of the reports covered AML/CFT controls and another two of the reports covered private banking business, while the remaining were related to areas including securities related activities and loans classification system.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nNo AI breached the requirements of the Banking Ordinance relating to capital adequacy or liquidity ratio in 2015. There were 84 breaches under various sections of the Ordinance, but none affected the interests of depositors and they were rectified promptly by the AIs.\n\nTable 1 Operational supervision\n\n# Powers under section 52 of the Banking Ordinance\n\nMelli Bank Plc continues to be subject to the exercise of powers under section 52 of the Banking Ordinance. The directions imposed by the Monetary Authority on 25 June 2008 under section 52(1)(A) of the Banking Ordinance on the affairs, business and property of the Hong Kong Branch of Melli Bank Plc remained in force during the year. The HKMA will continue to communicate regularly with the relevant authorities to monitor developments related to the branch and its head office in the UK, and will keep in view the supervisory measures taken to protect the interests of the AI’s depositors.\n\n# CAMEL rating review\n\nThe CAMEL Approval Committee reviewed and determined the composite CAMEL ratings of AIs. The AIs were notified of the ratings and given the opportunity to request a review. There was no request for a review during the year.\n\n# Specialised supervisory work\n\n# Supervision of operational and technology risks\n\nThe HKMA continued to issue new or updated guidance on operational and technology risk management in the light of emerging risks and industry developments. In particular, the HKMA completed the revision of the Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module in relation to electronic banking (e-banking), which allows AIs more flexibility in offering new e-banking services. In addition, a circular was issued on cyber security, reiterating the importance for the boards and senior management of AIs to have oversight of effective cyber security risk management. The HKMA also published periodic issues of its “Operational Incidents Watch” highlighting the modus operandi of selected fraud cases or operational incidents and the control weaknesses identified.\n\nThe HKMA conducted risk-based thematic on-site and off-site supervisory reviews to evaluate selected AIs' operational and technology risk management at the enterprise level or in specific business lines. These covered selected areas in relation to AIs' operational risk management framework, cyber security risk management, controls for guarding against rogue trading activities, oversight of important outsourcing service providers, fraud risk management and technology controls for anti-money laundering. These supervisory reviews were supplemented by the annual independent compliance exercises covering operational risk management framework, technology risk management (including protection of customer data) and business continuity planning, where selected AIs were required to appoint independent and qualified assessors to examine the adequacy of their relevant controls and then rectify the weaknesses identified. The HKMA also identified and analysed the trend and key supervisory focus of AIs' operational and technology risks, with particular reference to the AIs that play an important role in the stability and effective functioning of Hong Kong's monetary and banking systems.\n\nThe HKMA monitored the final phase of the banking industry's implementation of the chip-based ATM technology through which AIs completed the card replacement process of pure credit cards by the end of 2015. The HKMA also required card issuing AIs to implement authentication controls to further improve the security over \"card-not-present\" credit card transactions. Separately, after receiving reports that the names of cardholders stored in some contactless credit cards could be accessed stealthily, the HKMA required the AIs concerned to take prompt action to notify and protect the affected cardholders. The HKMA devoted resources to publicise and explain the scale and implications of the incident to address public concern and to monitor AIs' remedial efforts, including the prompt replacement of affected cards.\n\nThe HKMA collaborated with the industry and other stakeholders on a number of initiatives, including public awareness programme on e-banking security precautions, establishing a platform for sharing cyber security intelligence, and providing support and advice to a crisis management exercise organised by the Hong Kong Financial Services Business Continuity Management Forum that involved AIs and other financial firms.\n\n# Supervision of wealth management and MPF-related businesses\n\nThe HKMA co-operated closely with other financial regulators in Hong Kong in providing guidance and supervising AIs’ selling of securities, investment products, insurance products and MPF schemes. Regular contact was maintained with the regulators through bilateral and multilateral meetings, as well as under the auspices of the Council of Financial Regulators. These meetings covered various issues involving financial groups or regulated entities with close business relationships across different sectors in the financial services industry to ensure more co-ordinated and effective supervisory action.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA conducted 25 on-site and offsite thematic examinations and 15 off-site surveillance of AIs. These covered the selling of investment products, handling the settlement of securities transactions and safe custody of client securities, and the selling of non-linked long term insurance (NLTI) products and MPF-related products involving retail, private banking and corporate banking customers.\n\nIn August, the HKMA issued a circular to AIs to provide guidance on suitability assessment and product information disclosure in the selling of NLTI products to customers. The guidance aimed to assist AIs in complying with regulatory standards, including relevant requirements issued in July by the Office of the Commissioner of Insurance and the Hong Kong Federation of Insurers.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA continued to work closely with the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB) in the legislative process for the Insurance Companies (Amendment) Bill 2014, to establish an independent Insurance Authority and a statutory licensing regime for insurance intermediaries. In July, the Insurance Companies (Amendment) ordinance 2015 was enacted by the Legislative Council, which provides, among other things, for the inspection and investigation powers, in respect of AIs’ insurance intermediary activities, of the Monetary Authority through delegation.\n\nThe HKMA processed six applications to become Registered Institutions (RIs) and one application from RIs to engage in additional regulated activities. It granted consent to 204 executive officers responsible for supervising the securities activities of RIs, and conducted background checks on 9,697 individuals whose information was submitted by RIs for inclusion in the register maintained by the HKMA.\n\n# Supervision of treasury activities\n\nAIs’ liquidity risk management remained one of the HKMA’s priority supervisory focuses, particularly in light of the anticipated normalisation of interest rates in the US and the potential subsequent reversal of fund flows that could have an impact on AIs’ liquidity positions. Throughout 2015, the HKMA continued to implement the enhanced Stable Funding Requirement for AIs to maintain sufficient stable funds to support their lending business. Since the implementation of the Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) from 1 January 2015, the HKMA has been monitoring the level and trend of LCRs of category 1 institutions, which generally maintained LCRs close to or over 100%, well above the statutory minimum of 60% for 2015 under the phase-in arrangement.\n\nSeparately, the HKMA conducted thematic on-site examinations on selected AIs’ control framework for managing the risks associated with the anticipated interest rate normalisation. Amid the market volatility, the HKMA also paid close attention to abrupt market changes and their impact on the banking sector as well as individual AIs, and undertook appropriate follow-up action.\n\n# Supervisor-driven stress testing programme\n\nThe HKMA continued to conduct the bottom-up supervisor-driven stress testing programme to better understand the resilience of locally incorporated retail banks under extreme and adverse economic conditions, and to encourage them to develop plans to address potential problems in times of stress. A number of improvements were introduced during the year to collect more granular information to gain a greater insight into the risk dynamics of selected areas.

For the year as a whole, the banking sector’s total lending increased by 3.5%, compared with 12.7% in 2014 (table 2).

{"en": "# International Financial Centre\n\nThe global economic and financial environment was fraught with challenges in 2015, calling for closer international collaboration and communication to maintain stability. During the year, the HKMA continued to actively participate in international and regional forums while sparing no effort in raising Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre, including enhancing our financial infrastructure, optimising the regulatory and tax regime, and capitalising on the internationalisation of the renminbi to further develop offshore renminbi business. Hong Kong’s strong economic fundamentals and robust fiscal performance continued to be recognised by credit rating agencies with Standard & Poor’s maintaining its top-rated AAA rating for Hong Kong.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nThe HKMA actively contributes to international discussions on issues of significance to global and regional financial stability. In July, it assumed co-chairmanship of the Financial Stability Board Regional Consultative Group for Asia (FSB RCG(A)) for a two-year period. The group’s aim is to promote interaction between FSB members and nonmembers on policy initiatives, encourage implementation of financial reforms and facilitate the exchange of views on financial stability issues. The HKMA continued to work closely with the ASEAN+3 authorities to strengthen the operations of the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO) — which has been upgraded to an international organisation — to monitor and analyse regional economies and support decision-making of the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralisation (CMIM).\n\nDuring the year, Hong Kong’s offshore renminbi pool and bond issuance experienced some contraction due to a number of market factors. However the market continued to function orderly, and renminbi trade settlement, bank lending and foreign exchange turnover maintained steady growth. In addition, the growing renminbi business conducted in and through Hong Kong contributed to the recognition of the renminbi by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as a freely usable currency. The iMF’s decision to include it in the Special Drawing Right (SDR) currency basket will add impetus to the internationalisation of the renminbi as well as the further development of the offshore market in Hong Kong.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong's financial infrastructure and its continued development play a significant role in reinforcing the competitive edge of Hong Kong as an international financial centre and the global offshore renminbi business hub. The turnover of the renminbi payment system in Hong Kong hit new highs in 2015, while the trade repository for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives continued to support entities to report their OTC derivatives transactions as required under the new OTC derivatives market regulatory regime, which was introduced in July.\n\nHong Kong's financial infrastructure was further enhanced by the HKMA in 2015 with new components and services, including the successful launch of the e-Cheque service in December, which means that over 150 banks are now capable of receiving and processing e-Cheques from their customers through the Internet and mobile channels. The electronic bill presentment and payment (EBPP) service, which was launched in 2013, continued to see growth in merchant participation in 2015. In July, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMu) launched a service under its Fund Order Routing Service to support the implementation of the Mainland - Hong Kong Mutual Recognition of Funds (MRF). And, the regulatory framework for retail payment products and services was improved with the commencement in November of the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO). Under the PSSVFO, the HKMA is empowered to implement a mandatory licensing regime for multi-purpose stored value facilities and perform relevant supervision and enforcement functions, as well as designating important retail payment systems to ensure their safe and efficient operation under prudential regulation.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\n# REVIEW OF 2015\n\n# International and regional co-operation\n\nWith increased connections among global financial markets, the HKMA proactively fosters co-operation with other jurisdictions in promoting sustainable economic growth and financial system stability through international and regional forums including the FSB, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC). The HKMA also continues to implement global financial regulatory reforms, including the recommendations of the G20, to help strengthen the resilience of the global financial system.\n\nThe HKMA became a co-chair of the FSB RCG(A) in July and hosted its ninth meeting in Hong Kong in October. The RCG(A) serves as an important platform for FSB members and non-FSB members to communicate and co-operate on financial stability issues. Senior representatives from finance ministries, central banks and financial regulators of 16 Asian jurisdictions attended the meeting to discuss risks facing the region, the implications of increasing asset management activities, misconduct risk and experience with deposit insurance schemes. The HKMA also co-chaired a workshop on macroprudential policies in Hong Kong in August. The workshop was organised by the Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS), and attended by representatives from 18 central banks from around the world. Participants shared their experiences in macroprudential policies, focusing on the calibration and evaluation of tools, their interaction with monetary policy, and possible spillover effects. The HKMA also co-hosted a conference with the Bank of England and the IMF, featuring discussions on the challenges that central banks and other policymakers face in choosing the optimal mix of monetary, macroprudential and microprudential policies. The conference was attended by over a hundred participants, including representatives from academia, central banks and international financial institutions.\n\n# Promoting monetary and financial stability in Asia\n\nThe HKMA maintained its commitment to regional cooperative initiatives to promote financial stability in Asia and to harness the region's collective voice in international financial affairs. As a co-ordinator of the macro-surveillance work for the Monetary and Financial Stability Committee established under the Executives' Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP), the HKMA continued to prepare the Committee’s half-yearly Macro-Monitoring Report to assess the region’s risks and vulnerabilities and the policy implications. As Chair of the EMEAP Working Group on Payment and Settlement Systems, the HKMA worked closely with the Deputy Chair to co-ordinate the Group’s effort in sharing experiences and exchanging information on risk management, oversight, standards and best practices, and developments in domestic and cross-border payment and settlement systems. It also led the Working Group’s sub-group on cross-border co-operation and development. The HKMA hosted meetings of the EMEAP/BIS Forum on Foreign Exchange Markets and the EMEAP Working Group on Financial Markets (WGFM) in Hong Kong in June. Attended by representatives from 17 authorities from the region and major economies, the meetings reviewed the latest developments in financial markets and financial regulatory reforms.\n\nFollowing the signing of the AMRO Agreement by Hong Kong and the ASEAN+3 authorities last year, AMRO was upgraded to an international organisation in February 2016 to support its pivotal role under the enhanced CMIM.\n\n# Hong Kong’s credit ratings\n\nThe HKMA continued to maintain close dialogue with international credit rating agencies to present a balanced assessment of Hong Kong's economic performance and fiscal strength. These efforts contributed to the affirmation of Hong Kong's credit ratings by all major credit rating agencies in 2015. Standard & Poor's affirmed its highest AAA rating for Hong Kong, reflecting the agency’s recognition of Hong Kong’s above-average growth prospects for a high-income economy, sizable fiscal reserves, consistently healthy fiscal performance and strong net external asset position. Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings also maintained Hong Kong’s ratings at Aa1 and AA+ respectively, just one notch below triple-A.\n\n# Development of Hong Kong as the offshore renminbi business centre\n\nIn 2015, market factors had an impact on Hong Kong's renminbi pool. At the end of the year, outstanding renminbi customer deposits and certificates of deposit stood at RMB 1,010 billion, as compared with RMB 1,158 billion a year ago (Chart 1). Offshore renminbi bond issuance moderated amid declining interest rates in the onshore market. As a result, issuance of renminbi bonds in Hong Kong dropped to RMB 75 billion. On the other hand, renminbi trade settlement transactions handled by banks in Hong Kong expanded by 9% to RMB 6,833 billion. The outstanding amount of renminbi bank loans also increased by 58% year-on-year to RMB 297 billion (Chart 2). Average daily turnover in the renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system increased to RMB 947 billion, up 29% from 2014. At the same time, the offshore renminbi foreign exchange market saw further growth in Hong Kong, with survey results indicating a daily turnover of some US$ 93 billion equivalent at the end of April 2015, an increase of 88% from April 2013 when the last BIS Triennial Survey was conducted. Hong Kong remained the largest offshore renminbi business hub with a market of considerable depth and breadth. Another significant development reinforcing this position was the implementation of the MRF initiative in July, which has expanded Hong Kong’s renminbi product offering.\n\nThe HKMA's policy initiative to expand channels for crossborder renminbi fund flows and its joint efforts with the industry to enhance Hong Kong's renminbi financial platform continued to bear fruit. In June, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) announced that offshore renminbi business clearing banks and participating banks would be allowed to conduct repo transactions in the onshore interbank bond market and remit proceeds offshore, to facilitate renminbi liquidity management by banks in the offshore market. In September, the PBoC relaxed the rules on cross-border renminbi cash pooling, enabling more multinational corporations to conduct intra-group cash transfers under streamlined arrangements. The Mainland authorities also granted foreign central banks, international financial institutions and sovereign wealth funds wider access to the onshore interbank bond market in July. They further opened up the Mainland’s foreign exchange market to these institutions in September.\n\nOn 30 november, the IMF announced its decision to include the renminbi in the SDR currency basket with effect from 1 October 2016. The decision affirms the renminbi’s status as a freely usable currency, and further promotes confidence in the use of the renminbi for global transactions. As an international financial centre and the global offshore renminbi business hub, Hong Kong will benefit from new business opportunities arising from the further internationalisation of the renminbi and the Mainland’s enhanced connection with the global economic and financial systems.\n\nHong Kong continued to reinforce its collaboration on renminbi business with other jurisdictions throughout the year. The HKMA co-hosted the third RMB Trade and Investment Dialogue with Australia and the fifth RMB Business Forum with London, and worked with Malaysia and Thailand for the second time in facilitating private sector discussions on renminbi business. Through these initiatives, banks in Hong Kong strengthened their renminbi business flows and linkages with other markets, which will bring more renminbi business to Hong Kong. The HKMA also stepped up its marketing efforts to promote the wider use of renminbi in trade, investment and financing among corporations and institutions through participation in industry events in Hong Kong and in overseas markets including Canada, Japan and Africa.\n\nDeputy Chief Executive of the HKMA, Mr Eddie Yue, speaks at a seminar during the fifth meeting of Hong Kong–London RMB Forum on 11 December 2015.\n\n# CEPA\n\nA new agreement to achieve basic liberalisation of trade in services between Mainland China and Hong Kong was signed in November under the framework of the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA). The agreement extends most of the pilot liberalisation measures introduced in Guangdong in 2014 nationwide. By according national treatment, in principle, to Hong Kong banks, the new agreement is expected to provide these banks with more policy certainty and greater flexibility when conducting business in Mainland China.\n\n# Training\n\nThe HKMA continued to provide training programmes for officials from the PBoC, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange and the China Banking Regulatory Commission. In addition to programmes dealing with central banking and general risk management, topics included consumer protection, credit reference, monetary and collateral management, financial soundness indicators analysis, and systemic risk monitoring. Ad hoc training sessions were also conducted for delegations from overseas banking and law enforcement agencies.\n\n# Government Bond Programme\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA arranged eight tenders of institutional government bonds amounting to HK$ 20.4 billion.

Amid such challenging and difficult investment environment, the Exchange Fund recorded an overall investment return of -0.6% in 2015, but its loss was relatively mild as compared with major market indices and comparable investment funds, thanks to a series of defensive moves deployed by the HKMA over the past years which have enhanced the resilience of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary and may be invested in any securities or other assets he considers appropriate, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC).\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nEFAC has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(a) to preserve capital;\n(b) to ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, will be fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(c) to ensure that sufficient liquidity will be available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) subject to (a) — (c), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund.\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios — the Backing Portfolio and the Investment Portfolio. The Backing Portfolio holds highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of the assets. The long-term target bond-to-equity mix for the two portfolios as a whole is 72:28. In terms of target currency mix, 81% of the assets are allocated to the US dollar and the Hong Kong dollar, and the remaining 19% to other currencies.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA has been diversifying part of the Exchange Fund’s investment, in a prudent and incremental manner, into a greater variety of asset classes, including emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity and overseas investment properties. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the Investment Portfolio while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The cap for the net asset value of the HKMA’s investments under the LTGP is maintained at one-third of the Accumulated Surplus of the Exchange Fund. At the end of 2015, the market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$142.1 billion, made up of HK$91.3 billion in private equity and HK$50.8 billion in real estate, with outstanding investment commitments amounted to HK$122.4 billion.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007 to hold shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that were acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes, is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of the unique nature of this Portfolio.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation — the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation. The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents the long-term optimal asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This often means the actual allocation is different from the benchmark, or strategic, allocation. The differences between the actual and the benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and the limits for tactical deviations are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with EFAC, tactical decisions are made by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the limits allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may take positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nHKMA staff in the Reserves Management Department directly manage the investment of about 76% of the Exchange Fund, which includes the entire Backing Portfolio and part of the Investment Portfolio. This part of the Investment Portfolio includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers based in a number of international financial centres to manage about 24% of the Exchange Fund's assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised assets. The purpose of appointing external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to capture a diverse mix of investment styles, and transfer knowledge and information from the market to in-house professionals.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is primarily determined by market factors, and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe high volatility of the financial markets in recent years has highlighted the importance of risk management. Stringent controls and investment guidelines have been established for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and compliance with guidelines and regulations is closely monitored. Risk-control tools are deployed to assess market risks under both normal and adverse market conditions. The HKMA also conducts detailed performance attribution analyses to make the best use of the investment skills of both internal and external managers.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2015\n\nThe global financial markets were highly volatile in 2015. The equity markets, in particular, encountered exceptional turbulence. Major equity markets reached new highs in the first half of the year. However, market sentiment worsened drastically in the third quarter, arising from Mainland China growth concerns, with major equity markets reversing their year-to-date gains and registering significant quarterly losses. Global equity markets recovered somewhat along with improving market sentiment thereafter, but they worsened again towards the end of the year. With their close linkage with the Mainland economy, Hong Kong equities underperformed other major equity markets in 2015.\n\nOn sovereign bond markets, longer-term US Treasury yields rose moderately in 2015 despite expectation of US interest rate normalisation and the start of the US interest rate up-cycle, as positive sentiment was checked by concerns over global economic growth, lingering global disinflationary pressures and intensified geopolitical tensions. On the other hand, short-term European government bond yields declined and some even slipped into negative territory on the back of the European Central Bank’s aggressive monetary easing policy.\n\nOn currency markets, the US dollar continued to strengthen in 2015 with the US dollar index surging by almost 10%, amid expectation of the commencement of the US policy rate normalisation. The euro weakened significantly in the first quarter, posting the biggest single-quarter fall in the history of the euro since 1999, as the European Central Bank announced quantitative easing measures in January. On the other hand, the yen stayed largely flat against the US dollar in 2015.\n\nThe performance of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2015 is shown in Table 1.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nAgainst the backdrop of exceptionally volatile financial markets and difficult investment environment, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment loss of HK$15.8 billion in 2015, comprising gains of HK$7.1 billion on overseas equities, losses of HK$5 billion on Hong Kong equities, gains of HK$15.9 billion on bonds, a negative currency translation effect of HK$44.9 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets and gains of HK$11.1 billion on other investments held by the investment holding subsidiaries of the Fund. The negative currency translation effect was unavoidable when translating the Exchange Fund’s non-US dollar investments into Hong Kong dollar amid the sharp strengthening of the US dollar last year. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$2.2 billion.\n\nThe total assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$3,422.9 billion at the end of 2015. The investment return of the Exchange Fund (excluding the Strategic Portfolio) in 2015 was -0.6%. That notwithstanding, the Exchange Fund’s loss could be considered mild when compared with the underperforming major market indices and the investment fund community in general. In anticipation of a worsening investment environment, the HKMA has deployed a series of defensive moves over the past years, which include shortening the duration of bond portfolios, increasing cash holdings, and significantly reducing non-US dollar assets. We have also quickened the pace of investment diversification, especially through investments under the LTGP. These moves have enhanced the resilience of the Exchange Fund and helped mitigate some potential losses.\n\nThe annual return of the Fund from 1994 to 2015 is set out in Chart 1. Table 2 shows the 2015 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over a number of different time horizons. The average return was 1.2% over the past three years, 1.8% over the past five years, 3.3% over the past 10 years and 5.0% since 1994. Table 3 shows the currency mix of the Fund's assets on 31 December 2015.\n\nChart 1 Investment return of the Exchange Fund (1994 – 2015) \n1 investment return calculation excludes the holdings in the Strategic Portfolio. \n2 Composite Consumer price index is calculated based on the 2009/2010-based series.\n", "zh": "儲備管理\n\n2015年是全球金融市場動盪不安的一年，投資基金面臨前所未有的挑戰。在如此艱難的投資環境下，金融管理局宣布，基金總體投資回報為-0.6%，但由於過去數年部署的一系列嚴格控制措施，以助發展，提升了基金的韌性，令其損失相對較輕，較主要市場指數和類似投資基金的表現更為穩健。\n\n交易基金\n\n交易基金的主要目標，根據《交易基金條例》，是以直接或間接方式影響本港貨幣的匯率。基金亦可用於維持香港貨幣和金融體系的穩定與完整，以協助維持香港作為一個國際金融中心。交易基金由金融司司長控制，可投資於其認為適合的任何證券或其他資產，並在諮詢交易基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）後決定。\n\n交易基金管理\n\n投資目標及資產組合結構\n\nEFAC已為交易基金訂立以下投資目標：\n(a) 以保護資本；\n(b) 確保整體貨幣基數，能在任何時候由高度流動性、以美元計價的資產全數支持；\n(c) 確保有足夠的流動性，以維持貨幣和金融體系的穩定；及\n(d) 在符合(a)至(c)的前提下，達致有助於長遠保持基金購買力的投資回報。\n\n這些目標充分考慮《交易基金條例》的法定目的，並融入基金的資產結構和目標資產比例。\n\n一般來說，交易基金有兩個主要的資產組合 — 支撐資產組合和投資資產組合。支撐資產組合持有高度流動的美元資產，以在貨幣局制度下提供對貨幣基數的全面支持。投資資產組合則主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織會員國的債券和股市，以維持資產價值和長期購買力。整體而言，兩個組合的長期目標債券與股票比例為72:28。在目標貨幣配置方面，81%的資產分別分配於美元和港元，其餘19%則用於其他貨幣。\n\n為更好管理風險及提升長短期回報，金融管理局已逐步多元化投資， prudently and incrementally，投資範疇擴展至新興市場及內地債券與股份，私募股權和海外房地產亦於投資範疇內。新興市場及內地債券和股份由投資資產組合持有，私募股權和房地產則由長遠增長組合（LTGP）持有。該組合的淨資產值限制為交易基金累積盈余的三分之一。截至2015年底，LTGP的市值合計142.1億港元，包括私募股權91.3億港元和房地產50.8億港元，未完成的投資承諾則為122.4億港元。\n\n由政府為策略性用途收購，成立於2007年的策略性資產組合持有香港交易及結算所有限公司股份，並非用於評估基金的投資表現，因其特殊性。\n\n儲備管理\n\n投資流程\n\n交易基金的投資流程建立在兩類資產配置決策—長期策略資產配置和短期策略資產配置之上。策略資產配置反映在投資基準，代表在投資目標下的長遠最佳資產配置。跟隨策略配置，資產會進行戰術性調整，試圖超越基準回報。這通常意味著實際持倉與戰略配置不同，差異稱為“戰術偏離”。基準和偏離限額由金融司司長在諮詢EFAC後確定，戰術決策則由HKMA在授權下進行。在偏離限額範圍內，資產管理人可為了利用短期市場變動而調整持倉。\n\n投資管理\n\n直接投資\n\nHKMA的儲備管理部門員工直接管理約76%的交易基金投資，包括整個支撐資產組合及部分投資資產組合。該部分投資包括投資於全球固定收益市場的組合及實施宏觀風險管理策略的各種衍生品覆蓋組合。\n\n外部經理的運用\n\n除了內部管理資產外，HKMA亦聘用駐於國際金融中心的外部基金經理，管理約24%的交易基金資產，包括所有上市股權和其他專門資產。委聘外部經理的目的是利用市場中最優的投資專才，多元化投資風格，並將市場知識與資訊傳授予內部專業人士。\n\n外聘經理的支出包括基金管理費、託管費、交易成本及代扣及其他稅務，該支出多依市場情況變動，年度或有不同。\n\n風險管理及合規\n\n近年金融市場的高波動性凸顯風險管理的重要性。制定嚴格的控制措施和投資指引，並嚴密監察遵守情況。運用風險控制工具評估正常及逆境市況下的市場風險。金融管理局亦進行詳細的績效歸因分析，以善用內外管理人的投資技術。\n\n交易基金表現\n\n2015年金融市場\n\n2015年全球金融市場動盪不安，尤其是股市經歷極端震盪。主要股市在上半年錄得新高，但第三季由於中國經濟增長憂慮，市場情緒急劇惡化，年內逐步倒退，出現顯著季度虧損。隨後市場情緒好轉，股票市況略為反彈，但年底又再次轉差。由於與內地經濟密切聯繫，2015年，香港股市表現遜於其他主要股市。\n\n在主權債券市場方面，儘管預期利率將正常化，美國長期國債收益率整體微升，但由於對全球經濟增長、持續的通縮壓力及地緣政治緊張局勢的擔憂，升幅有限甚至出現下降。同時，歐洲短期政府債券收益率下降，一些甚至轉為負利率，歸因於歐洲央行積極的貨幣寬鬆政策。\n\n在貨幣市場方面，美匯指數在2015年持續上升，接近10%的漲幅，反映預期美國政策利率正常化。歐元在第一季度大跌，創1999年以來的最大季度跌幅，主要由於歐洲央行於一月宣布量化寬鬆措施；日圓則在2015年基本持平。\n\n2015年主要貨幣、債券和股市的表現見表1。\n\n儲備管理\n\n交易基金的表現\n\n在金融市場極端波動和困難的投資環境背景下，2015年交易基金錄得HK$158億的投資虧損，包括海外股市的HK$71億收益、香港股市的HK$50億虧損、債券的HK$159億收益、非港元資產的HK$449億貨幣轉換負面影響，以及基金投資控股子公司持有的其他投資的HK$111億收益。由於去年美元大幅升值，將非美元投資兌換成人民幣時產生負面貨幣轉換效果屬於必然。另計，策略性資產組合錄得HK$22億的市值增益。\n\n至2015年底，交易基金的總資產達到HK$3,422.9億。2015年的投資回報（不包括策略組合）為-0.6%。儘管如此，與大部分市場指數和投資基金界的表現不佳相比，基金的虧損較輕微。為因應投資環境惡化，金融管理局多年前已部署一系列嚴格的防禦措施，包括縮短債券組合的久期、增加現金持倉，以及大幅降低非美元資產。同時，也加快了投資多元化進程，特別是在LTGP項目下的投資。這些措施增強了交易基金的韌性，並幫助緩解潛在損失。\n\n從1994年至2015年的年度回報率詳情載於圖1。表2展示2015年的投資回報及基金在不同時間範圍內的平均回報。過去三年平均回報為1.2%，五年為1.8%，十年為3.3%，自1994年以來則為5.0%。表3列出2015年12月31日基金資產的貨幣配置。\n\n圖1：交易基金投資回報（1994–2015）\n1 投資回報計算不包括策略性資產組合 holdings。\n2 綜合消費者價格指數以2009/2010年系列數據計算。"}

During the year, the Centre received more than 48,300 visitors and hosted over 630 quided tours for schools and other groups (Chart 3). Over 530,400 people have visited the Information Centre since it opened in December 2003.\n\nThe Library, situated next to the Exhibition Area, houses more than 23,000 books, journals and other publications for the detailed study of Hong Kong's monetary, banking and financial affairs and central banking topics. It also maintains an electronic register of AIs in Hong Kong as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nIn its ongoing programme to reach out to the community, the HKMA continued to organise public education seminars. In 2015, three seminars were held for some 2,300 secondary school students and teachers. Topics included the Linked Exchange Rate System, banknotes in Hong Kong, the smart use of credit cards and the Deposit Protection Scheme. More than 54,700 people have participated in the programme since its launch in 1998.\n\nChart 3 Types of group visits to the Information Centre\n\nYoung visitors learn about the development of money and banking in Hong Kong during a guided tour of the Information Centre.\n\nSecondary school students and teachers participate in a public education seminar.\n\n# HUMAN RESOURCES\n\nThe HKMA recruits, develops and maintains a highly professional workforce to support its policy objectives and respond flexibly to changing work priorities. While the HKMA is an integral part of the Government, it is able to employ staff on terms different from those of the civil service to attract personnel with the right experience and expertise. As a public organisation, the HKMA aims to maintain a lean and flexible structure and to redeploy staff resources to undertake new initiatives and meet increased workload.\n\n# Organisational changes\n\nFollowing the enactment of the payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, a new Retail Payment Oversight Division was formed under the Monetary Management Department (MMD) in December 2015 to carry out the HKMA’s new statutory duties in the licensing and day-to-day supervision of stored value facilities and other retail payment systems. To enhance synergy amongst departments and reprioritise staff resources in coping with the challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives as well as increasing workload and complexity of work, reshuffling of duties among a number of departments was planned in 2015 for implementation in early 2016. Details are as follows:\n\nThe Financial Infrastructure Department (FID) took over the administration of the Deposit Protection Scheme and the settlement function from the Enforcement Department (ENFD) and the Currency Division from MMD. It also took over from the Banking Departments certain banking-related work such as consumer education, directors’ development and enhanced competency framework for bank practitioners;\n\nThe External Department took over the market development function of MMD, while the latter will continue with its work relating to the Treasury Markets Association and financial benchmarks; and\n\nENFD took over the Anti-Money laundering (AML) and Financial Crime Risk Division from the Banking Supervision Department, and was retitled as Enforcement and AML Department.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\n# Staffing\n\nThe establishment of the HKMA in 2015 was 841. This is increased by 34 to 875 in 2016 (an increase of 4%) to ensure that sufficient resources are provided to cope with (i) the implementation of new legislation and initiatives, (ii) continuation of pilot projects proven necessary on an on-going basis, and (ii) the increasing complexity and volume of existing work. The new posts are deployed to the following functions:\n\nEnhancing banking and financial stability, which includes:\n\nstrengthening banking supervision work including on-site examination of banks' stress testing process, implementation of international banking standards and peer review exercises;\n\nstrengthening the supervision of banks' liquidity risk and cyber security risk management;\n\nimplementing the supervisory framework regarding over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives conducted through banks and approved money brokers under the newly effective OTC derivatives reporting and record-keeping rules;\n\nstrengthening supervisory and enforcement efforts in anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing;\n\ngearing up the planning and preparatory work for the implementation of the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Bill, which applies international standards to address the \"too big to fail\" problem of the financial industry;\n\npromoting capacity building in the banking sector through the development of a director empowerment programme for independent non-executive directors of banks to further improve the governance of banks and collaboration with the industry to promote enhanced competency frameworks for banking practitioners engaged in core areas of banking operations;\n\nstepping up the banking conduct policy and research capability in new banking, securities and insurance products;\n\nenhancing consumer protection and consumer education efforts; and\n\nstepping up the monitoring and analysis of developments in the onshore renminbi market and in the CNH market with a view to supporting the orderly operation of Hong Kong’s offshore renminbi market.\n\nStrengthening investment, risk management and legal support to the expanding investment activities associated with the establishment of the Future Fund and further diversification of the Exchange Fund’s investment products, and enhancing strategic asset allocation and investment processes in the light of an increasingly challenging investment environment.\n\nImplementing the new statutory regime which empowers the HKMA to regulate stored value facilities and retail payment systems under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance.\n\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nTemporary resources are deployed to meet other work demands. The HKMA transfers staff on secondment to other international or local organisations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Services Development Council to assist in activities or policy initiatives in which Hong Kong or the HKMA has an interest. Some staff members are deployed on a full-time or part-time basis to provide operational support to the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board and the Treasury Markets Association.\n\n# Remuneration policies and pay review mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary (FS) determines the pay and conditions of service for HKMA staff on the advice of the Governance Sub-Committee (GSC) through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC), taking into account the prevailing market rates and practices. Remuneration comprises a total cash package and a provident fund scheme, with minimal benefits in kind. The cash package consists of monthly fixed pay (or basic pay) and variable pay, which may be awarded to individual staff members as a lump sum once a year depending on performance.\n\nPay for HKMA staff is reviewed annually by the FS in the light of recommendations made to him by the GSC through EFAC, taking into account the GSC's assessment of the performance of the HKMA in the preceding year, the pay-survey findings of the financial sector conducted by independent human resources consultants and any other relevant factors. Special pay adjustments may be made from time to time for individual meritorious staff to maintain their pay competitiveness.\n\nAny approved annual adjustments to the fixed pay or any variable pay awards for the HKMA are distributed to individual staff based on their performance. Investment professionals in the HKMA are subject to a variable pay system that seeks to strengthen the linkage between their investment performance and remuneration award. The pay adjustments or awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Executive Director or above are approved by the FS on the advice of the GSC. The staff members concerned are not present at the meetings when their pay is discussed. The pay adjustments or awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Division Head and below are determined by the Chief Executive of the HKMA under delegated authority from the FS and within the approved overall pay awards.\n", "zh": "# 企業職能\n\n本港金融管理局（HKMA）通過媒體、公共教育計劃及各種渠道與社會和市場保持有效溝通，促進社會大眾理解其政策與工作。2015年，HKMA透過支持職員專業發展、提交嚴格的財務規範、優化資訊科技安全，以及重整高層管理的職責，以助發展，應對新方案與系統實施中出現的挑戰，以及隨著工作越來越繁重帶來的轉弱。\n\n# 與社區接軌企業發展\n\n# 媒體關係\n\nHKMA與媒體密切合作，以提升透明度和推動公眾理解其政策及工作。2015年，舉行了59次公開媒體活動，包括14場新聞發布會、14場現場訪談和31場其他公共活動。同年，安排了43次媒體訪問，發布了325份中英雙語新聞稿，並日常處理大量媒體查詢。\n\n此外，為深化公眾對HKMA主要職能的了解，組織了兩次媒體行程，分別前往香港鈔票印制有限公司及香港銀行間結算有限公司，展示香港的世界級鈔票印制技術與金融基礎設施。在媒體關於貨幣局系統、人民幣業務及掉期基金的重要議題的深入報導中，亦進行了教育工作坊。\n\nHKMA行長陳德霖先生（中），及貨幣管理執行董事李翊華先生（右）巡查銀行票據的安全特徵。\n\n在媒體巡禮期間，展示了自動支票分類機。畫面中從左至右依次為：HKMA行長陳德霖先生；金融基礎設施執行董事李翊華先生；HKICL行政總裁唐慧瑩女士。\n\n# 企業職能\n\n# 公眾查詢\n\n公眾查詢服務為市民提供便捷渠道，以獲取有關HKMA的資訊，增進對其職能的了解。2015年，服務處理了9,078宗查詢，約一半涉及銀行政策規管、鈔幣貨幣及消費者銀行業務。範例包括財政措施以促進房地產按揭貸款、銀行產品及服務、防止洗錢及恐怖融資、以及鈔幣收藏計劃。\n\n圖表1顯示自2012年以來收到的公眾查詢數量，圖表2則按性質分類列出2015年的查詢明細。\n\n# 發行刊物\n\n除了《HKMA年報》外，HKMA於去年發布了兩期《半年度貨幣及金融穩定報告》，四期《季刊》，並定期發布《月度統計月刊》的更新，以提供最新及有主題的貨幣、銀行及經濟資訊與分析。此外，高層管理人員亦發表了14篇涵蓋不同政策議題的Insight文章。\n\n2014年HKMA年報在香港管理專業協會2015年度最佳年報獎中，獲得「非營利及慈善組織」類別銅獎。\n\n# HKMA網站\n\nHKMA官方網站（www.hkma.gov.hk）提供超過50,000頁內容，涵蓋英語、繁體及簡體中文形式，是公眾查閱最新HKMA資訊的主要渠道。網站還包括《授權機構證券職員名冊》及《本港金融機構與本地代表辦事處名冊》，兩者均依據《銀行條例》第20條維持管理。隨著支付系統及存值設施條例的實施，網站亦將加入存值設施牌照持有人名錄。特設專頁及快捷連結，方便公眾查詢重要及時事資訊，例如提醒保持警覺的仿冒電話，以及硬幣收集計劃的硬幣車位置。\n\n# 企業職能\n\n# 公眾教育計劃\n\n位於國際金融中心二期55樓的HKMA資訊中心是推廣HKMA工作並提升公眾貨幣及銀行知識的重要平台。中心由展覽區和圖書館組成，並每週六天向公眾開放。展覽介紹HKMA的職能，以及香港貨幣與銀行業的發展，內設閱讀資料與展品，用以研究香港的貨幣、銀行和金融事務。\n\n設有導賞團，帶領訪客了解中心。2015年，中心接待逾48,300名訪客，舉辦超過630次學校及團體導賞（見圖表3）。自2003年12月開館以來，已有超過530,400人次參觀。\n\n圖書館位於展覽區旁，收藏超過23,000本書籍、期刊及其他出版物，供深入研究香港貨幣、銀行、金融及中央銀行議題。亦維持電子版AI名冊，符合《銀行條例》相關規定。\n\n為了保持社區聯繫，HKMA繼續舉辦公共教育講座，2015年進行了三場，約有2,300名中學生與教師參與，內容涵蓋聯匯制度、香港的鈔票、智能信用卡及存款保障計劃，自1998年推出以來，已有逾54,700人次參與。\n\n圖表3展示資訊中心團體參觀類型\n\n年輕參觀者在導賞中了解香港貨幣和銀行的發展。\n\n中學生和教師參加公共教育講座。\n\n# 人力資源\n\nHKMA招聘、培育並維持高水準的專業隊伍，以支持政策實施及彈性應對工作變化。作為政府的一部分，HKMA可依照不同於公務員的條款聘用人員，以吸引具備相應經驗與專長的人才。作為公開機構，HKMA致力於保持精簡彈性的組織結構，並重新調配人力資源，以推動新措施及應對工作負荷增加。\n\n# 組織調整\n\n隨著《支付系統及存值設施條例》生效，2015年12月成立了零售支付監管部門，隸屬貨幣管理處（MMD），負責執行 HKMA在牌照授予及日常監管存值設施和其他零售支付系統的法定職責。為促進部門協作與調整人力，2015年規劃了多個部門的職責重整，並於2016年初實施，主要內容如下：\n\n財務基礎設施處（FID）接管存款保障計劃及結算職能，從執法部（ENFD）接過，並取代貨幣管理處的貨幣部；同時，亦承接部分銀行相關工作，如消費者教育、董事發展及銀行從業員能力建設等。\n\n外部部門接管貨幣管理處的市場開拓職能；貨幣管理處則繼續處理財政市場協會及金融基準的相關工作。\n\n執法部則接管打擊洗錢（AML）及金融犯罪風險部門，並更名為執法及AML部。\n\n# 企業職能\n\n# 人事配置\n\n2015年，HKMA的編制為841人，至2016年增至875人（增幅約4%），以確保有足夠資源推行新立法、新措施、持續推行證明必要的試點及應付繁重與多樣的工作。新增職位主要用於以下職能：\n\n加強銀行與金融穩定，包括：\n\n鞏固銀行監管工作，例如銀行壓力測試、自律標準落實、國際銀行標準及同行審核；\n\n強化銀行流動性風險及網絡安全管理監管；\n\n推行由銀行及認可機構承辦的OTC衍生品的監理框架，包括藉由新生效的報告及記錄規則監管的衍生品交易；\n\n加強反洗錢及反恐融資的監管與執法；\n\n籌備金融機構（決議）條例的實施，符合國際標準，解決金融行業的“過大而不能倒問題”；\n\n推動銀行業的能力建設，包括為獨立非執行董事開展授權培訓計劃，促進銀行治理及推廣關鍵範疇專才框架；\n\n提升新型銀行、證券和保險產品的行為規範與研究能力；\n\n加強消費者保障與教育工作；及\n\n加強對在岸人民幣市場和離岸人民幣(CNH)市場的動態監控與分析，支持香港離岸人民幣市場的有序運作。\n\n加強投資、風險管理與法律支持，以配合成立未來基金及多元化匯理基金投資產品，並提升策略資產配置與投資流程，應對日益嚴峻的投資環境。\n\n推行依法規範存值設施及零售支付系統的新法規。\n\n# 企業職能\n\n# 暫時資源調配\n\n HKMA臨時調派人員應付其他工作需求。HKMA會將人員借調至國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）、金融服務發展局等國內外組織，協助推動有關活動或政策措施。亦有部分人員全職或兼職協助香港存款保障局及財資市場協會的運作。\n\n# 薪酬政策及薪酬調整機制\n\n財經司司長（FS）依據管治小組（GSC）透過匯豐基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）的建議，並參考市場行情及慣例，決定HKMA人員的薪酬及服務條件。薪酬由總現金薪酬和公積金計劃組成，除少量實物福利外，主要包括每月固定薪金（基本工資）及績效獎金，績效獎金每年一次，視表現而定。\n\n年薪調整由財經司司長每年審視，並依據GSC透過EFAC提出的建議，考慮去年HKMA的工作表現、金融界的薪酬調查結果（由獨立人力資源顧問提供）及其他相關因素。為保持優秀員工的薪酬競爭力，可不定期為表現突出的員工作特殊調整。\n\n任何經批准的年度固定工資及績效獎金調整，皆會根據個別員工的表現進行分配。HKMA的投資專才實施績效掛鈎的績效獎金制度，以加強投資業績與薪酬的聯繫。高級管理層（如行政總裁級及以上人員）的薪酬調整由財經司司長在管治小組建議下批准，相關員工在討論薪酬時並不出席會議。中層及以下職級由HKMA行政總裁根據授權，在已批准的整體薪酬框架內由其決定。"}

I conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards. Those standards require that I comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.\n\nAn audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the Monetary Authority, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.\n\nI believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit (continued)\n\n# Opinion\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2015, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance.\n\nDavid Sun \nDirector of Audit\n\n7 April 2016\n\nAudit Commission \n26th Floor \nImmigration Tower \n7 Gloucester Road \nWanchai, Hong Kong\n\n# Contents\n\nINCOME AND EXPENDITURE ACCOUNT\nSTATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nBALANCE SHEET\nATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY\nATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:\n\n1.

The principal activities of the Fund are safeguarding the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong and maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong's monetary and financial systems.\n\nThe assets of the Fund are managed as four portfolios: the Backing Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio and the Strategic Portolio. The assets of the Backing Portolio fully match the Monetary Base, under Hong Kong's Currency Board system. The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The Long-Term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments. The Strategic Portfolio holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited acquired by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) for the account of the Fund for strategic purposes. Operating segment information is set out in note 31.\n\n# 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n# 2.1 Statement of compliance\n\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with all applicable Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRSs), which is a collective term that includes all applicable individual Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, Hong Kong Accounting Standards (HKASs) and Interpretations issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), and accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong. A summary of the significant accounting policies adopted by the Fund and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) is set out below.\n\nThe HKICPA has issued certain new and revised HKFRSs that are first effective or available for early adoption for the current accounting period. Note 3 provides information on the changes, if any, in accounting policies resulting from initial adoption of these developments to the extent that they are relevant to the Group for the current and prior accounting periods reflected in these financial statements.\n\n# Exchange Fund – Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)\n\n(Amounts expressed in millions of Hong Kong dollars, unless otherwise stated.)\n\n# 2.2 Basis of preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe Group financial statements include the financial statements of the Group as well as the Group's interests in associates and joint ventures. The principal activities of the principal subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are shown in notes 16 and 17.\n\nThe measurement basis used in the preparation of the financial statements is historical cost except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair values as explained in the accounting policies set out below:\n\ntrading financial instruments (note 2.6.2.1);\nfinancial assets and financial liabilities designated at fair value (note 2.6.2.2); available-for-sale securities (note 2.6.2.5);\ngold (note 2.11); and\ninvestment properties (note 2.12).\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with HKFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nNote 18 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of investment properties. Note 37 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of financial instruments. There are no critical accounting judgements involved in the application of the Group's accounting policies except for the valuation of certain financial instruments as set out in note 2.5.\n\n# 2.3 Subsidiaries and non-controlling interests\n\nA subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. When assessing whether the Group has power, only substantive rights (held by the Group and other parties) are considered.\n\n# Exchange Fund – Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)\n\n(Amounts expressed in millions of Hong Kong dollars, unless otherwise stated.)\n\nAn investment in a subsidiary is consolidated into the Group financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.\n\nIntra-group balances, transactions and cash flows and any unrealised profits and losses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in full in preparing the Group financial statements.\n\nNon-controlling interests represent the equity in a subsidiary not attributable directly or indirectly to the Fund, and in respect of which the Group has not agreed any additional terms with the holders of those interests which would result in the Group as a whole having a contractual obligation in respect of those interests that meets the definition of a financial liability. Non-controlling interests are presented in the Group balance sheet within equity, separately from equity attributable to the owner of the Fund. Non-controlling interests in the results of the Group are presented on the face of the Group income and expenditure account and the Group statement of comprehensive income as an allocation of the surplus or deficit and total comprehensive income or loss for the year between non-controlling interests and the owner of the Fund.\n\nIn the balance sheet of the Fund, its investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less impairment losses, if any (note 2.14).\n\n# 2.4 Associates and joint ventures\n\nAn associate is an entity in which the Group has significant influence, but not control or joint control, over its management, through its power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions.\n", "zh": "# 匯豐基金\n\n審計司署報告\n匯豐基金財務報表\n\n# 審計司署報告\n\n# 審計委員會\n# 香港特別行政區政府\n\n# 獨立審計報告\n\n# 致財政司司長\n\n本人證明已審核列載於第134至222頁的匯豐基金及其附屬公司的財務報表（「本集團」），包括截至2015年12月31日的匯豐基金及本集團的資產負債表、當年的收支帳、全面收益表、權益變動表及現金流量表，以及重要會計政策摘要及其他說明性資料。\n\n# 貨幣監管局對財務報表的責任\n\n貨幣監管局負責編制遵循《匯豐基金條例》（第66章）第7條頒布指令及香港財務報告準則的真實、公正的財務報表，並為確保財務狀況的準確性所認為必要的內部控制，防止可能導致重大錯誤的欺詐或錯誤。\n\n# 審計師的責任\n\n我負責根據審計結果發表關於這些財務報表的意見。我以香港特別行政區《匯豐基金條例》第7條的主管署長指令及審計委員會制定的審計準則進行審核。該等準則要求我遵守道德規範，策劃並執行審計工作，以合理確信財務報表是否不存在由於欺詐或錯誤而引致的重大錯誤。\n\n審計涉及執行程序以獲取有關財務報表的金額和披露的審計證據。所選程序取決於審計人員的判斷，包括對財務報表中可能出現重大錯誤（包括欺詐或錯誤）的風險評估。在作出風險評估時，審計人員會考慮與公司編製財務報表相關的內部控制，以設計適合的審計程序，但不代表對公司內部控制的有效性作出意見。審計亦包括評估所用會計政策的適當性以及貨幣監管局所作會計估算的合理性，以及評估財務報表的整體呈示。\n\n我相信我取得的審計證據充足適當，可作為我發表審計意見的依據。\n\n# 審計司署報告（續）\n\n# 意見\n\n在我看來，該等財務報表在所有重大方面均以符合香港財務報告準則的方式，公正反映了截至2015年12月31日的匯豐基金及本集團的財務狀況，以及它們的經營成果和現金流量，並經過妥善編製，符合《匯豐基金條例》第7條的主管署長指令。\n\n孫道倫\n審計司署署長\n\n2016年4月7日\n\n審計司署\n第26層\n入境事務大樓\n告士打道7號\n灣仔，香港\n\n# 內容\n\n收支帳\n全面收益表\n資產負債表\n權益變動表\n現金流量表\n財務報表附註：\n\n1. 主要活動  \n2. 重要會計政策  \n3. 會計政策變動  \n4. 收入與支出  \n5. 所得稅  \n6. 財務資產和財務負債類別  \n7. 現金及即付貨幣資產  \n8. 與銀行及其他金融機構的存放  \n9. 按公允價值指定的金融資產  \n10. 可供出售證券  \n11. 衍生金融工具  \n12. 持期至到期證券  \n13. 放款組合  \n14. 黃金  \n15. 其他資產  \n16. 對附屬公司的權益  \n17. 聯營公司及合資企業的權益  \n18. 投資物業  \n19. 不動產、廠房及設備  \n20. 債務證書、由政府發行的貨幣票據及流通中的硬幣  \n21. 銀行體系餘額  \n22. 銀行及其他金融機構的存放  \n23. 財政儲備的存放  \n24. 香港特別行政區政府及法定機構的存放  \n25. 匯豐基金票據及有價證券發行  \n26. 銀行貸款  \n27. 其他債務證券發行  \n28. 其他負債  \n29. 股東權益  \n30. 現金流量表中現金及現金等價物分析  \n31. 營運分部資料  \n32. 抵押資產  \n33. 承諾事項  \n34. 或然負債  \n35. 重要關連方交易  \n36. 財務風險管理  \n37.金融工具的公允價值衡量  \n38. 非調整期後事件  \n39. 2015年12月31日止年度尚未生效的修訂、新準則和解釋的可能影響  \n40. 財務報表的批准\n\n# 匯豐基金 — 收支帳\n\n截至2015年12月31日止年度\n\n140至222頁的附註為該等財務報表之一部分。\n\n# 匯豐基金 — 全面收益表\n\n截至2015年12月31日止年度\n\n140至222頁的附註為該等財務報表之一部分。\n\n# 匯豐基金 — 資產負債表\n\n截至2015年12月31日\n\n譚義倫\n貨幣監管局\n2016年4月7日\n\n140至222頁的附註為該等財務報表之一部分。\n\n# 匯豐基金 — 權益變動表\n\n截至2015年12月31日止年度\n\n140至222頁的附註為該等財務報表之一部分。\n\n# 匯豐基金 — 現金流量表\n\n截至2015年12月31日\n\n# 匯豐基金 — 現金流量表（續）\n\n截至2015年12月31日\n\n140至222頁的附註為該等財務報表之一部分。\n\n# 匯豐基金 — 財務報表附註\n\n（金額以百萬港幣計，若未另有說明）\n\n# 1 主要活動\n\n貨幣監管局在財政司司長的授權下，根據《匯豐基金條例》（第66章）管理基金，主要任務是保護港幣的匯率及維持本港金融體系的穩定與完整。\n\n基金資產作為四個投資組合管理：備付組合、投資組合、長期增長組合及策略組合。備付組合的資產完全與貨幣基數相匹配，依照香港的貨幣局制度運作。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債券和股市。長期增長組合持有私募股權和房地產投資。策略組合持有由香港特區政府為策略性目的收購的香港交易所及結算有限公司的股份。營運分部資料載於第31註。\n\n# 2 重要會計政策\n\n# 2.1 符合準則\n\n本財務報表已按照所有適用的香港財務報告準則（HKFRSs）編制，該術語包括由香港會計師公會（HKICPA）頒布的所有適用的香港財務報告準則、香港會計準則（HKASs）和解釋，以及香港一般公認的會計原則。以下簡述基金及其附屬公司（合稱「本集團」）採用的主要會計政策。\n\nHKICPA已發布若干新修訂HKFRSs，該等準則於本期首次生效或提前採用。第3註提供有關會計政策變動的資料（如有），包括首次採用這些新準則對本集團及其財務狀況的影響。\n\n# 2.2 財務狀表的編製基準\n\n本集團財務狀表包括集團的財務狀況及其在聯營公司和合資企業中的利益。主要附屬公司、聯營公司和合資企業的主要活動見第16及17註。\n\n財務狀表的衡量基準為歷史成本，但以下資產及負債按公允價值列示（詳見下述會計政策）：\n- 交易性金融工具（2.6.2.1節）；\n- 按公允價值指定的金融資產及負債（2.6.2.2節）；\n- 可供出售證券（2.6.2.5節）；\n- 黃金（2.11節）；\n- 投資物業（2.12節）。\n\n編製符合HKFRSs的財務狀表需要管理層作出判斷、估計及假設，這些因素影響政策的應用以及資產、負債、收入和支出的報導金額。該等估計和假設基於經驗及其他合理因素，構成對資產及負債帳面值判斷的基礎，實際結果可能與估計有差異。\n\n這些估計和假設會定期重新檢討。估計的修訂在修訂時即刻入帳（如只影響當期）；若影響當期及未來期間，則在修訂期間和未來期間調整。\n\n第18註涉及投資物業的公允價值估算假設，第37註涉及金融工具的公允價值估算假設，除了第2.5節所列某些金融工具的估值外，未涉及重大會計判斷。\n\n# 2.3 附屬公司與非控股權益\n\n附屬公司是由本集團控制的實體。若本集團能透過其權力獲得或有權享有變動的回報，並能以其權力影響該等回報，即視為擁有控制權。\n\n在評估本集團是否擁有控制權時，僅考慮具有實質性權利（由本集團或其他方持有）的權利。\n\n附屬公司自控制開始之日起至控制終止之日止，合併入本集團財務報表。集團內部的存貨餘額、交易與現金流，以及由內部交易產生的未實現盈利和損失，均予以抵銷。\n\n非控股權益代表附屬公司中不由本基金直接或間接持有的權益，在未與該等權益持有人簽訂任何額外條款而導致本集團對該權益具有契約義務的情況下。非控股權益於集團資產負債表內列示於股東權益內，並與歸屬本基金的權益分別列示。非控股權益在集團的經營成果中作為盈餘或虧損的分配，以及全年全面收益或虧損的分配，在收入及支出帳和全面收益表中分別列示。\n\n在基金資產負債表中，本集團持有的附屬公司投資以成本減已計提減值損失（若有）列示（見第2.14註）。\n\n# 2.4 聯營公司與合資企業\n\n聯營公司為本集團具有重大影響力但不控制或共同控制的實體，可通過其在財務及營運政策決策中的權力參與管理。"}

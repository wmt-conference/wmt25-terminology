{"en": "# Highlights of 2015\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nEconomic growth in Hong Kong moderates, reflecting weaker domestic demand and subdued export performance. Local stock market sees large swings amid heightened volatility in global financial markets. The residential property market starts to soften after the announcement of the seventh round of prudential measures in February.\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector remains resilient. Locally incorporated authorized institutions (AIs) are well capitalised, and the liquidity positions of AIs continue to be sound. The asset quality of retail banks deteriorates slightly, but stays at healthy levels.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchang rate remains broadly stable against the US dollar, with the strong-side Convertibility Undertaking triggered repeatedly in April, September and October. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate market continues to operate in an orderly manner despite turbulent global financial market conditions, reflecting resilience of the Linked Exchange Rate System to external shocks.\n\nThe money market continues to function normally with ample interbank liquidity. Following the decision of the US Federal Reserve to raise the target range for the Federal Funds Rate, the Base Rate in Hong Kong is adjusted upwards by 25 basis points to 0.75% in December.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nSupervisory efforts on AIs’ risk governance, including credit and liquidity risk management systems, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing controls, and selling practices for investment and insurance products, have been stepped up.\n\nThe HKMA announces a countercyclical capital buffer for Hong Kong and designates five authorized institutions as domestic systemically important banks. Legislative proposals to establish a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong and enhance the Deposit Protection Scheme by achieving faster payouts are respectively introduced into the Legislative Council.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\nThe HKMA continues to actively participate in international and regional forums while sparing no effort in raising Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre. Legislative proposal to improve the tax environment for promoting Hong Kong as a hub for corporate treasury centres is introduced into the Legislative Council in December.\n\nHong Kong remains the global offshore renminbi business hub with a market of considerable depth and breadth. The Mainland-Hong Kong Mutual Recognition of Funds initiative is implemented in July, further expanding Hong Kong’s renminbi product offering.\n\nHong Kong’s financial infrastructure is further enhanced by the successful launch of the e-Cheque service in December, allowing customers to issue and deposit cheques online. A new regulatory regime which provides for licensing of multipurpose stored value facilities and designation of important retail payment systems commences operation in November.\n\n# Reserves Management\nAmid the challenging and difficult investment environment, the Exchange Fund records an overall investment return of -0.6%. Total assets of the Fund reach HK$3,422.9 billion at the end of 2015.\n\nthe HKMA quickens the pace of investment diversification, especially through investments under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). At the end of 2015, the market value of investments under the LTGP totals HK$142.1 billion, made up of HK$91.3 billion in private equity and HK$50.8 billion in real estate, with outstanding investment commitments amounting to HK$122.4 billion.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communications with the community and the market through the media, public education programmes, and various other channels to facilitate understanding of its policies and operations. Corporate governance is further improved by supporting professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline, enhancing it security, and realigning duties among senior management to help cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives and the increasing complexity of work.", "zh": "2015年亮點\n\n經濟與金融環境\n\n香港經濟增長放緩，反映本地需求疲弱及出口表現低迷。受全球金融市場波動加劇影響，香港股票市場出現較大波動。二月宣布第七輪審慎措施後，住宅物業市場開始回軟。\n\n香港銀行業保持韌性。本地設立的授權機構（AIs）資本充足，流動性狀況持續良好。零售銀行的資產質素略微惡化，但仍處於健康水平。\n\n貨幣穩定\n\n港元兌美元匯率大致保持穩定，四月、九月和十月多次觸發強方可兌付承諾。儘管全球金融市場動盪，港元匯率市場仍正常運作，彰顯聯繫匯率制度抗外部 shocks 的韌性。\n\n資金市場持續正常運作，銀行間流動性充裕。在美國聯邦儲備局提高聯邦基金利率目標區間後，香港基準利率在十二月上調25個基點至0.75%。\n\n銀行穩定\n\n加強對授權機構的風險管理，包括信貸及流動性風險管理系統、反洗錢及反恐融資措施，以及投資及保險產品的銷售實踐等監管力度。\n\n香港金融管理局宣布對香港實施逆周期資本緩衝，並指派五家授權機構為本地系統重要銀行。立法會提出建立金融機構救援制度及加強存款保障計劃（包括更快支付）的立法建議。\n\n國際金融中心\n\n香港金融管理局積極參與國際及區域論壇，並不遺餘力提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。十二月向立法會提出改善稅制的立法建議，以促進香港作為企業財資中心的發展。\n\n香港仍然是全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐，市場規模可觀。七月實施內地與香港的資金共同認可計劃，進一步擴展人民幣產品資源。\n\n香港金融基礎建設進一步完善，包括十二月成功推出電子支票服務，客戶可在線開立和存款支票。十一月開始運行的新監管制度，授權多功能預付費設施牌照及重要零售支付系統。\n\n儲備管理\n\n在投資環境挑戰重重的情況下，結算基金錄得整體投資回報-0.6%。2015年底，基金總資產達到3兆4229億港元。\n\n香港金融管理局加快投資多元化步伐，特別是通過長期增長投資組合（LTGP）。截至2015年底，LTGP的市值合計達到總值1421億港元，其中私募股權91.3億港元，房地產50.8億港元，未來投資承諾則達1224億港元。\n\n企業職能\n\n香港金融管理局通過媒體、公眾教育計劃及其他渠道，與社會及市場保持有效溝通，促進公眾了解其政策及運作。通過支持員工專業發展、實行嚴格的財務紀律、加強資訊安全，以及調整高級管理層職責，進一步改善公司治理，以應對新措施實施及工作日益複雜帶來的挑戰。"}
{"en": "# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nThe Hong Kong economy experienced slower growth in 2015 reflecting weaker domestic demand and poor export performance. Economic growth for 2016 is expected to remain soft amid stiff external headwinds and fragile financial market conditions.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Overview\n\nEconomic growth in Hong Kong moderated during the year, with real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth slowing to 2.4% from 2.6% in 2014 (Table 1). This reflected milder expansion in domestic demand, although net exports reverted to a positive contributor to GDP growth as total imports declined faster than total exports (Chart 1). Despite the modest economic performance, the labour market held broadly stable, with the unemployment rate staying low at about 3.3%. Inflation eased further due to subsiding pressures on domestic costs and import prices. Local stock prices saw large swings amid heightened volatility in global financial markets. The residential property market started to soften after the announcement of the seventh round of prudential measures in February, with housing prices showing further signs of consolidation towards the end of the year.\n\nChart 1 Real GDP growth by contribution\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\nTable 1 Real GDP growth by expenditure component (period-over-period)\n\nNote: The seasonally-adjusted quarter-on-quarter rates of change in the gross domestic fixed capital formation are not available.\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nOn the monetary front, exchange-rate stability was maintained in 2015, with the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate hovering near 7.75 against the US dollar. The strong-side Convertibility Undertaking was triggered in April due to equity-related inflows, and again in September and October reflecting conversions of the offshore renminbi into Hong Kong dollars and some commercial demand for Hong Kong dollars. With the enlarged Aggregate Balance, local interest rates continued to stay low, while the HKMA Base Rate was adjusted upwards from 0.5% to 0.75% following the US interest rate lift-off in mid-December. Because of softer credit demand, total loan growth in the banking sector slowed further to 3.5% in 2015 from 12.7% in 2014. The banking industry's overall loan quality weakened slightly, but the classified loan ratios remained at low levels.\n\n# Domestic demand\n\nDomestic demand grew at a slower pace in 2015. While broadly stable job and income conditions continued to provide support, weak consumer confidence and corrections in asset prices weighed on private consumption growth in the second half of the year. However, due to the relatively strong growth momentum in the first half, the full-year growth in private consumption increased to 4.8% from 3.3% in 2014. Government consumption increased slightly faster by 3.4%. In fact, the slower growth in domestic demand was mainly due to the 2.2% decline in gross domestic fixed capital formation (Chart 2). Private-sector machinery and equipment acquisition contracted for the second consecutive year amid deteriorating business sentiment, and building and construction activities also showed weaker growth momentum alongside slower progress in public projects.\n\n# External demand\n\nHong Kong’s export performance deteriorated in 2015 (Chart 3). Exports of goods recorded a broad-based 1.7% decline, the first time since 2009. Exports to Japan and the European Union declined, while those to the US recorded little growth. The feeble final demand from these advanced markets also weighed on regional industrial activities and intra-regional trade. As a result, Hong Kong’s exports to Mainland China, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan also decreased amid weak intermediate and final demand from these economies. Hong Kong’s exports of services continued to moderate from a high growth path in earlier years, which culminated in a 0.6% decline in 2015, mainly due to the slowdown in inbound tourism. Imports of goods also fell back alongside weaker domestic and export-induced demand. In contrast, growth in imports of services accelerated due to strong travel interest among local residents. On a net basis, the overall trade surplus improved slightly in 2015, leading to a modest positive contribution to GDP growth.\n\nChart 2 Domestic demand\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Inflation\n\nUnderlying inflation eased further in 2015 amid moderated domestic cost pressures and reduced import price inflation. After netting out the effects of the Government's one-off relief measures, the underlying inflation rate dropped to 2.5% from 3.5% in 2014 (Chart 4). With subdued economic activity, labour cost pressures remained steady, while commercial and industrial rental cost pressures eased, particularly in the second half. Thanks to softened global commodity prices and the strong Hong Kong dollar, import price pressures abated, while food inflation also stayed low. As the feed-through of fresh-letting housing rentals in earlier quarters had been moderate, the rental component of inflation remained contained.\n\nChart 3 Exports of goods and services\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\nChart 4 Underlying consumer price inflation\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\n# Labour market\n\nLabour market conditions remained stable in 2015. Labour demand held up, with the decline in employment in trade and tourism-related sectors being largely offset by the steady pace of hiring in other business sectors, resulting in an increase in total employment of 1.3% from a year earlier. With labour supply also picking up by 1.3%, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate stayed at around 3.3% throughout the year (Chart 5). Given the still-tight labour market, labour earnings in nominal terms rose by 4.7% in the first three quarters of the year, compared with 4.3% in 2014. With inflationary pressures easing, real labour earnings increased by 1.3% in the first three quarters, compared with a decline of 0.1% in 2014.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe Hong Kong stock market experienced a volatile year due to drastic changes in the external environment. After a flat first quarter, the local stock market was buoyant in the second quarter amid the bullish sentiment in the Mainland A-share market and capital inflows. The Hang Seng Index surged to a seven-year high in April, with the Southbound Daily Quota under the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect being exhausted for the first time since its inception in November 2014 (Chart 6). However, the local market reversed course starting from late June, with the Hang Seng Index plunging 28% to a year-low in September amid the sell-offs in the Mainland A-share market and global stock markets, the heightened volatility in the global foreign exchange market, and weaknesses in international commodity prices. The Hong Kong stock market recovered some ground in the last quarter as global and Mainland financial markets stabilised. For 2015 as a whole, the Hang Seng index recorded a decline of 7.2%, the worst performance since 2011, while the average daily turnover rose to HK$105.6 billion from HK$69.5 billion in 2014. Although fund-raising activities moderated in the second half, the overall equity funds raised from the local stock market increased to HK$1,115.6 billion from HK$942.7 billion a year earlier.\n\n# Property market\n\nSigns of consolidation emerged in the residential property market. After experiencing a buoyant period in early 2015, the residential property market softened following the announcement of the seventh round of prudential measures in February. With housing prices picking up at a slower pace before declining in the last quarter, the cumulative increase in housing prices in 2015 was 2.5%, smaller than the 13.5% increase in 2014 (Chart 6). Meanwhile, the transaction volume decreased by 12.3% from a year ago to 55,982 units as trading activities in the secondary market fell noticeably in the second half. Speculative transactions, including confirmor transactions and short-term flipping trades, continued to stay low. Despite this, household affordability remained stretched, with the price-to-income ratio reaching 15.7 and the income-gearing ratio remaining far above its long-term average. The commercial and industrial property markets were buoyant in the first half, but trading activities then softened, with both prices and rents registering declines in the last quarter. Rental yields remained broadly the same from a year earlier and stayed near their historical lows.\n\nChart 6 Asset prices\nSources: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nHong Kong’s economic growth for 2016 is expected to remain soft. Private-sector analysts project the economy to expand at a slower average rate of 1.7% while the Government forecasts growth in the range of 1–2%. More specifically, the lacklustre global growth prospects, sustained weakness in inbound tourism, and the negative spillovers from turbulent global financial market conditions will continue to restrain the performance of Hong Kong’s exports. Domestically, private consumption is anticipated to grow moderately, as labour market conditions will likely face some pressures amid weaker economic momentum, and local asset price adjustments may dent consumer confidence and induce negative wealth effects. Building and construction activities may hold up, but weak business sentiment and interest rate rises will weigh on private capital investment.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nInflationary pressures are expected to remain contained in 2016. Import price pressures will likely stay soft, while domestic cost pressures are expected to be modest amid moderate economic growth momentum. The rental component of inflation may also ease due to diminishing pressures in fresh-letting housing rentals towards the end of 2015. Market consensus predicts the headline inflation rate at 2.5% in 2016, while the Government projects the underlying inflation rate at 2.0%. The labour market may also soften somewhat due to the slowdown in inbound tourism and continued sluggishness in the export sector. Private-sector analysts now expect the unemployment rate to increase to 3.5% in 2016.\n\n# Uncertainties and risks\n\nThe economic outlook for 2016 is subject to a number of uncertainties and risks. In particular, the pace of further US interest rate rises, the global growth prospects and commodity price movements will continue to be the major sources of uncertainty. Any significant adverse developments could heighten volatilities in global financial markets and international capital flows, thereby tightening domestic monetary and financial conditions and casting a shadow over Hong Kong's growth prospects. The resulting impact of these external factors on the domestic economy will depend crucially on their impact on the property market through the wealth and balance-sheet effects. While the property market is facing increasing downside risks stemming from weakening sentiment in the global and domestic financial markets, the normalisation of US interest rates, and a narrowing housing demand-supply gap, more time is needed to establish whether the property market has entered a down-cycle. Although an abrupt adjustment in the property market could pose significant headwinds to the broader economy, the introduction of counter-cyclical macroprudential measures and other supervisory measures over the past few years has significantly enhanced the resilience of Hong Kong's banking system.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector remained resilient during the year, notwithstanding a further divergence in the monetary policies of advanced economies and the build-up of vulnerabilities in emerging market economies. The liquidity positions of authorized institutions (AIs) continued to be sound, and locally incorporated AIs were well capitalised. The asset quality of retail banks deteriorated slightly, but stayed at a healthy level.\n\n# Interest rate trends\n\nIn line with the US dollar interest rates, Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates were low throughout the year. The Hong Kong dollar funding cost of retail banks declined in the first half of the year as indicated by a downward trend in the composite interest rate, and remained stable in the second half (Chart 7).\n\nChart 7 HIBOR fixings, composite rate and best lending rate (BLR)\nNotes:\n1. HiBoR fixings refer to the Hong Kong Dollar interest Settlement Rates released by the Hong Kong Association of Banks and are monthly averages.\n\n2. BlR refers to the best lending rate quoted by the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (monthly averages).\n\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe profitability of the banking sector moderated in 2015. The aggregate pre-tax operating profits of retail banks' Hong Kong offices declined by 2.8%, as growth in fee and commission income (up 9.7%), foreign exchange and derivatives operation income (up 22.4%), and net interest income (up 1.3%) was offset by an 8.8% increase in operating expenses and a 76% increase in loan impairment charges. However, the post-tax profit of retail banks increased by 14.7%, mainly due to gains from disposals of strategic investments. The post-tax return on average assets of retail banks improved to 1.05% from 0.99% in 2014 (Chart 8).\n", "zh": "# 經濟與金融環境\n\n香港經濟在2015年經歷了較慢的增長，反映內需疲軟及出口表現不佳。預計2016年的經濟增長仍將保持溫和，受到外部嚴峻逆風及金融市場脆弱的影響。\n\n# 回顧經濟\n\n# 概觀\n\n香港經濟在今年放緩，實際國內生產總值（GDP）增長由2014年的2.6%放緩至2.4%（表1）。這反映內需擴展較為溫和，儘管淨出口恢復為GDP增長的正向貢獻，因為總進口速度快於出口（圖1）。儘管經濟表現不佳，勞動市場尚算穩定，失業率約維持在3.3%左右。由於國內成本和進口價格壓力減退，通脹進一步緩和。由於全球金融市場波動加劇，本地股價大幅波動。二月宣布第七輪審慎措施後，住宅市場開始轉弱，房價進一步顯示出巩固跡象，並在年底趨於平穩。\n\n圖1：按貢獻度分的實質GDP增長\n資料來源：統計處。\n\n表1：按支出成分的實質GDP增長（期比較）\n備註：季調後的國內固定資本形成的季度環比變化率暫無資料。\n資料來源：統計處。\n\n# 經濟與金融環境\n\n在貨幣方面，2015年維持匯率穩定，港元兌美元匯率徘徊在7.75附近。由於股市資金流入，4月觸發強方兌付安排（Convertibility Undertaking），而9月和10月則反映離岸人民幣兌港元的兌換，以及部分商業需求。隨著總體資金餘額擴大，當地利率持續處於低位，12月中美聯儲加息後，香港金融管理局基准利率由0.5%調升至0.75%。由於信貸需求較弱，2015年銀行業的貸款總增長進一步放緩至3.5%，低於2014年的12.7%。整體貸款品質略為下降，但不良貸款比率仍維持在較低水平。\n\n# 內需\n\n2015年內需增長放緩。就業和收入情況基本穩定，為經濟提供支持，但由於消費者信心疲軟及資產價格調整，私人消費在下半年遭受壓力。然而，得益於上半年較強的增長動能，全年度私人消費增長由2014年的3.3%升至4.8%。政府消費則稍微加快，增長3.4%。實際上，內需放緩主要由國內固定資本形成下降2.2%所致（圖2）。私營部門的機械及設備購置連續第二年收縮，部分原因是商業信心惡化。建築及工程活動亦顯示較弱的增長動能，伴隨公共項目進展放緩。\n\n# 外部需求\n\n香港出口表現於2015年惡化（圖3）。商品出口出現全面1.7%的下滑，為2009年以來首次。對日本及歐盟的出口下降，美國的出口則幾乎持平。這些先進市場需求疲軟，也拖累區域產業活動及區域內貿易。因此，香港對大陸、新加坡、韓國及台灣的出口也因這些經濟體的中間及最終需求疲弱而下滑。香港的服務出口從早年的高增長中繼續放緩，2015年下降0.6%，主要原因是入境旅遊放緩。商品進口也因國內及出口帶動需求減弱而回落。相反，由於本地居民的旅遊興趣強烈，服務進口的增長有所加快。淨貿易方面，貿易順差稍有改善，對GDP增長略為正面貢獻。\n\n圖2：內需\n資料來源：統計處。\n\n# 通脹\n\n2015年，基礎通脹進一步緩和，主要受國內成本壓力減輕及進口價格上升放緩影響。在剔除政府一次性補助措施的影響後，基礎通脹率由2014年的3.5%降至2.5%（圖4）。由於經濟活動疲軟，勞動成本壓力保持穩定，商業及工業租金成本壓力亦有所緩和，特別是在下半年。由於全球商品價格的下跌及港幣走強，進口價格壓力減退，食品通脹亦保持低位。早前季度新出租住房租金的滲透效應較為溫和，房租變動對通脹的影響掌控較好。\n\n圖3：商品及服務出口\n資料來源：統計處。\n\n圖4：基本消費者物價通脹\n資料來源：統計處。\n\n# 經濟與金融環境\n\n# 勞動市場\n\n2015年，勞動市場狀況保持穩定。就業需求持續，貿易及旅遊相關行業的就業下降大致被其他行業的招聘所抵消，年度就業總數較去年增加1.3%。同時，勞動供給亦增加1.3%，使季調後的失業率全年保持在約3.3%（圖5）。由於勞動市場仍較緊張，名義勞動收入前三季度比去年增加4.7%，高於2014年的4.3%。隨著通脹壓力緩和，實質勞動收入在前三季度增加1.3%，而2014年則微降0.1%。\n\n# 股市\n\n由於外部環境劇變，香港股市波動劇烈。第一季度表現平平，第二季度則在大陸A股市場看好、資金流入的支持下，股市升勢強勁。恒生指數於4月升至七年新高，並首次在2014年11月推出的滬港通南向每日配額用盡（圖6）。然而，自6月末起，股市急轉直下，恒指在9月下挫28%，達到年度低點，受大陸A股抛售、全球股市下跌、外匯市場波動以及國際商品價格疲弱的影響。隨著全球與內地金融市場的穩定，恒指在第四季度略有回升。整體來看，2015年恒指下跌7.2%，是自2011年以來最差的表現，日均成交額由2014年的695億港元升至1,056億港元。雖然融資活動在下半年減少，但來自本地股市的資金募集總額由942.7億港元增至1,115.6億港元。\n\n# 房地產市場\n\n住宅市場出現凝聚跡象。2015年初曾較為熱絡，但二月宣布第七輪審慎措施後，市場轉趨疲軟。房價上漲速度放緩，年底前更開始回落，整年房價累計升幅為2.5%，低於2014年的13.5%（圖6）。同期，成交量較去年下降12.3%，至55,982宗，第二季度的交易活動明顯減少。投機性交易，如轉讓人交易及短期倒賣，仍較低迷。儘管如此，家庭負擔能力仍緊張，房價對收入比率升至15.7，收入負擔比率遠高於長期平均水平。商業及工業物業在上半年較為活躍，但交易活動稍持放緩，年底房價及租金皆出現下跌。租金收益率較去年保持大致不變，仍接近歷史最低點。\n\n圖6：資產價格\n資料來源：評值及估價署及香港交易所。\n\n# 經濟與金融環境\n\n# 經濟前景展望\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n預計2016年香港經濟增長仍將偏溫。私人部門分析員預測經濟將以平均約1.7%的速度緩慢擴張，政府則預計增長在1%至2%之間。更具體而言，全球經濟增長前景黯淡，入境旅遊持續疲軟，以及動盪的全球金融市場所帶來的負面溢出效應，將持續限制香港出口的表現。在國內，私人消費預計將適度增長，因為勞動市場或將面臨壓力，經濟動能疲弱及資產價格調整可能降低消費者信心，並產生負的財富效應。建築及施工活動可能持穩，但商業信心不足與利率上升亦將影響私營企業投資。\n\n# 通脹與勞動市場\n\n預料2016年通脹壓力將保持受控。進口價格壓力可能依然疲軟，國內成本壓力則會因經濟增長放緩而較為溫和。由於2015年底新出租住房租金的壓力逐漸減退，房租對通脹的貢獻料亦會放緩。市場普遍預計2016年整體通脹率為2.5%，而政府則預測基本通脹率為2.0%。由於入境旅遊放緩及出口行業持續疲弱，勞動市場或將略為緊張，失業率可能上升至3.5%。\n\n# 不確定性與風險\n\n2016年的經濟前景存在多方面不確定性與風險。尤其是，美國利率進一步上升的速度、全球經濟增長前景以及商品價格變動，將是主要的不確定源。任何重大不利發展都可能加劇全球金融市場及國際資本流動的波動性，從而收緊國內貨幣與金融條件，並影響香港的經濟增長前景。這些外部因素對內需的影響，將在很大程度上取決於其對房地產市場的財富和資產負債表效應。雖然由於全球及國內金融市場信心疲軟、美元利率正常化以及房市需求供應差距縮小，房市正面臨越來越多的下行風險，但仍需時間來確認房市是否已進入下行周期。若房市突然出現調整，可能會對整體經濟構成巨大阻力，但過去幾年引入的逆周期宏觀審慎措施及其他監管措施，大大增強了香港銀行體系的韌性。\n\n# 銀行業績況\n\n儘管發達經濟體貨幣政策進一步分歧，加上新興市場經濟的脆弱性積聚，香港銀行業在今年仍保持韌性。授權機構的流動性持續健康，本地組成的銀行資本充足。零售銀行的資產質素略為惡化，但仍保持良好水平。\n\n# 利率趨勢\n\n與美元利率同步，港元拆息整年保持低位。年上半年，反映整體利率下降，零售銀行的港元資金成本下降，之後則保持穩定（圖7）。\n\n圖7：港元拆息、綜合利率及最佳貸款利率（BLR）\n備註：\n1. 港元拆息指由香港銀行協會公布的香港元結算利率，為月平均值。\n\n2.

{"en": "# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained broadly stable throughout 2015 despite turbulent financial market conditions and the US interest rate lift-off in December. The money market also continued to function normally with ample interbank liquidity. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability over the past few decades, the Linked Exchange Rate System continued to be hiqhly resilient to external shocks.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong's monetary policy is currency stability. This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong's currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75 - 7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises\n\n* Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks\n* Government-issued notes and coins in circulation \n* the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of clearing account balances of banks kept with the HKMA \n* Exchange Fund Bills and Notes issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs). When the demand for Hong Kong dollars is greater than the supply and the market exchange rate strengthens to the strong-side CU of HK$7.75 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to sell Hong Kong dollars to banks for US dollars. The Aggregate Balance will then expand to push down Hong Kong dollar interest rates, creating monetary conditions that move the Hong Kong dollar away from the strong-side limit to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if the supply of Hong Kong dollars is greater than demand and the market exchange rate weakens to the weak-side CU of HK$7.85 to one US dollar, the HKMA will buy Hong Kong dollars from banks. The Aggregate Balance will then contract to drive Hong Kong dollar interest rates up, pushing the Hong Kong dollar away from the weak-side limit to stay within the Convertibility Zone.\n\nThe Certificates of Indebtedness and the government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation shown here are stated at Hong Kong dollar face values. The corresponding items shown in the balance sheet of the Exchange Fund in this Annual Report are in Hong Kong dollars equivalent to the US dollar amounts required for their redemption at the prevailing exchange rates on the balance sheet date. This arrangement is in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong.\n\nThe amount of EFBN shown here is different from that in the balance sheet of the Exchange Fund in this Annual Report. In accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong, the EFBN held by the HKMA on behalf of the Exchange Fund in relation to its trading of the EFBN in the secondary market are offset against the EFBN issued, and the net amount is recorded in the balance sheet.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\n# REVIEW OF 2015\n\n# Exchange-rate stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained broadly stable in 2015, trading within a narrow range of 7.7500 to 7.7657 against the US dollar (Chart 1). In the early part of 2015, the Hong Kong dollar was under slight weakening pressures amid market concerns about the US interest rate lift-off. However, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate strengthened close to 7.75 during the second quarter, with the strong-side CU being triggered repeatedly in April mainly due to a surge in equity-related demand for the Hong Kong dollar amid buoyant stock market activities. Moving into the second half of the year, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate continued to hover close to 7.75 against the US dollar in August, despite the notable sell-off in Hong Kong and Mainland’s equity markets, and increased volatilities in the global currency markets (including the renminbi). Driven by conversions of the offshore renminbi into the Hong Kong dollar, the strong-side CU was triggered again in September and October. While the US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) raised the target range for the Federal Funds Rate by 25 basis points in mid-December, the Hong Kong dollar continued to move within a tight range against the US dollar without notable outflow pressures. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market operated in an orderly manner throughout 2015, despite the turbulent global financial market conditions.\n\nChart 1 Market exchange rate in 2015\n\nAs the strong-side CU was repeatedly triggered in April, September and October, the HKMA passively purchased a total of US$29.3 billion from banks in exchange for HK$227.2 billion, in accordance with the Currency Board principles. This led to a corresponding expansion in the Aggregate Balance, with part of the expansion being offset by additional issuance of Exchange Fund Bills in response to banks’ strong demand for liquidity management (Chart 2). The additional issuance of Exchange Fund paper is consistent with Currency Board principles, as it represents a change in the composition of the Monetary Base with the Monetary Base fully backed by foreign exchange reserves. The total of Aggregate Balance and outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and notes increased to HK$1,221.0 billion at the end of 2015 from HK$992.5 billion a year earlier.\n\nChart 2 Aggregate Balance and outstanding Exchange Fund paper in 2015\n\n# Money market\n\nWith ample liquidity in the banking system, Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained low throughout 2015. As the target range for the US Federal Funds Rate was adjusted upwards from 0–0.25% to 0.25–0.5% on 16 December (US time), the Base Rate was also adjusted upwards from 0.5% to 0.75% on 17 December according to the pre-set formula. For 2015 as a whole, interbank interest rates for tenors from overnight to three months stayed below the Base Rate (Chart 3), with moderate fluctuations driven by banks’ seasonal liquidity needs and tightened liquidity amid volatile financial market conditions in August. Broadly tracking the spreads between the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) and the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), the Hong Kong dollar forward points turned to notable premiums in August amid tightened market liquidity, and then subsequently dipped into discounts towards the end of the year due to the broad-based increases in the US dollar interest rates (Chart 4). Overall, the money market continued to function normally. Discount Window borrowing was not active, amounting to only HK$2.8 billion in 2015.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nChart 3 Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates in 2015\n\nChart 4 Hong Kong dollar forward points in 2015\n\n# Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nSince its establishment in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has continued to function smoothly and contributed significantly to Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability over the past few decades. Given Hong Kong's small and open economy and its role as an international financial hub, the LERS remains the most suitable exchange rate regime for Hong Kong. The Hong Kong SAR Government is firmly committed to maintaining the LERS. Indeed, stability in the foreign exchange and money markets further reinforces the credibility of the Government's commitment, and the public continues to have strong confidence in the Hong Kong dollar as a means of payment and storage of value. In its 2015 Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) continued to endorse the LERS as the best monetary arrangement for Hong Kong, citing Hong Kong's robust institutional, legal and policy framework, ample fiscal reserves, flexible markets, and sound financial system as key factors supporting the smooth functioning of the LERS.\n\nGiven that a robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS, the HKMA continued to closely monitor banks' management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and stepped up its supervisory efforts on banks' corporate and property-related lending to enhance the resilience of the banking sector. In view of the rise in US interest rates, the HKMA reminded the public to make necessary preparations in managing risks, noting that any triggering of the weak-side CU and outflow of Hong Kong dollars are a natural and necessary step in the process of the normalisation of the Hong Kong dollar interest rates.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) moved within a narrow range of 106.3-107.5% during 2015, without touching the Upper or Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 106.3% on 31 December (Chart 5). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. The large amount of financial resources of the Fund provides a powerful backstop to protect Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability in the event of abrupt shocks.\n\nChart 5 Daily movement of the Backing Ratio in 2015\n\n# Other activities\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) Currency Board Sub-Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong. In 2015, the Sub-Committee considered issues including the supply of international US dollar loans by global banks, the international use of macro-prudential measures, the implications of US interest rate hikes for Hong Kong's property market, the formula for the determination of the Base Rate, macroeconomic implications of the Hong Kong dollar real effective exchange rate rise, and the sovereign risk of emerging market economies. Records of the Sub-Committee’s discussions and the reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the Sub-Committee are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research (HKIMR) continued to sponsor research in the fields of monetary policy, banking and finance. In 2015, the Institute hosted 16 research fellows and published 27 working papers.\n\nThe Institute organised five international conferences and workshops. The main ones included:\n\n* The Sixth Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy in January, under the title \"Leverage and Financial System Efficiency and Stability: Chinese and International Experiences\". 11 high quality research papers were presented at the conference, covering an extensive range of issues such as corporate leverage in China, China's credit boom and business cycle, banking competition and financial stability, as well as banking regulation and credit supply.\n* The HKIMR and the University of Hong Kong joint conference entitled \"HKIMR-HKU International Conference on Finance, Institutions and Economic Growth\" in May. The conference covered many different economic issues, including banking and monetary policy, international financing and cross border mergers and acquisitions, design of financial regulation, as well as macroeconomic environment and capital markets.\n* The HKIMR, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas joint conference in October on \"Diverging Monetary Policies, Global Capital Flows and Financial Stability\". The conference examined a wide range of issues including the relationship between monetary policies, international capital flows and exchange rates, divergent monetary policies and their implications for global financial stability, spillover of major central bank policies to other parts of the world, and the costs and benefits of global policy co-ordination.\n\nThe Institute also hosted its 13th HKIMR Summer Workshop in August, and the 13th HKIMR Conference on the Mainland Economy in September, addressing issues on fiscal reform and local government financing in Mainland China. The conferences and workshops were attended by participants from academia, the financial services industry and global central banks. In addition, the Institute held 24 public seminars during the year covering a broad range of economic, monetary and financial issues.\n\n# Notes and coins\n\nAt the end of 2015, the total value of banknotes in circulation was HK$360.2 billion, an increase of 5.3% from a year earlier (Charts 6, 7 and 8). The total value of government-issued notes and coins in circulation amounted to HK$11.2 billion, up 2.9% (Charts 9 and 10). The value of government-issued HK$10 notes in circulation was HK$4.0 billion, of which 85% were polymer notes.\n", "zh": "貨幣穩定\n\n儘管2015年金融市場波動激烈，以及12月美國加息，香港美元兌換率整體保持相當穩定。貨幣市場亦繼續正常運行，銀行間流動性充裕。作為過去數十年香港貨幣與金融穩定的基石，聯繫匯率制度繼續展現出高度的韌性，能有效抵禦外部衝擊。\n\n目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的首要目標是貨幣穩定。這裡所指的穩定是指香港貨幣在外匯市場上對美元的兌換率保持穩定，波動範圍在港幣7.75至7.85兌1美元之間。貨幣系統的結構特徵為貨幣櫃檯制度，要求貨幣基礎至少由外匯儲備（存放於匯豐基金）全面支持，且貨幣基礎的變動須由等量的美元儲備變動所對應。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n\n* 債券憑證，為三家發鈔行發行的鈔票提供全額支持\n* 政府發行的紙幣和硬幣\n* 總結餘，即香港金融管理局（HKMA）所持銀行結算戶的餘額\n* 由HKMA代表政府發行的匯豐基金票據及本票\n\n透過自動調整利率機制與HKMA兌現本票承諾（CUs）的堅定承諾，維持港幣兌美元匯率的穩定。當對港幣需求大於供應，使市場兌換率升至強側CU（港幣7.75對1美元），HKMA準備向銀行出售港幣換取美元。此時，總結餘擴張，壓低港幣利率，促使匯率由強端限制向7.75到7.85的兌換區間內移動。相反，若港幣供應大於需求，兌換率下降至弱端CU（港幣7.85對1美元），HKMA會從銀行買入港幣，令總結餘收縮，推高港幣利率，並將匯率維持在兌換區間內。\n\n在此披露的債券憑證以及政府發行的流通貨幣以港幣面值列示。匯豐基金的資產負債表中所示的相關項目則以應按平衡表日期匯率計算的美元等值換算，以符合香港普遍採用的會計原則。\n\n此處顯示的匯豐基金票據（EFBN）數額與年度財報中的數字不同。根據香港普遍採用的會計原則，HKMA持有的EFBN在次級市場的交易數額會與已發行的EFBN相抵銷，並在資產負債表中錄得淨額。\n\n貨幣穩定性\n\n2015年回顧\n\n匯率穩定\n\n2015年，港幣對美元的匯率保持大體穩定，在7.7500至7.7657的狹窄範圍內波動（圖1）。年初，市場擔憂美國加息可能會造成港幣略微貶值，但在第二季度，港幣兌美元升至接近7.75的水平，主要由於4月股市活動熱烈，增加了港幣的需求，觸發多次強端CU。進入下半年，儘管香港及內地股市大幅抛售、全球貨幣市場波動加劇，包括人民幣，港幣兌美元仍接近7.75水平（8月）。隨著離岸人民幣兌港幣的轉換增加，9月和10月再次觸發強端CU。即使美國聯邦公開市場委員會（FOMC）在12月中旬將聯邦基金利率目標區間上調25個基點，港幣兌美元仍在狹窄範圍內波動，無明顯資金外流壓力。整體而言，2015年香港外匯市場秩序井然，運作良好。\n\n圖1 2015年市場匯率\n\n由於4月、9月及10月多次觸發強端CU，HKMA按貨幣櫃檯原則，將總共29.3億美元從銀行被動購得，換取2272億港幣，導致總結餘擴張，其中部分擴張由應對銀行對流動性需求的匯豐基金票據額外發行所抵銷（圖2）。額外發行的匯豐基金票據符合貨幣櫃檯原則，代表貨幣基礎的結構性調整，且貨幣基礎由外匯儲備完全支持。年末，總結餘和未償付的匯豐基金票據及本票合計達到1221億港幣，較一年前的992.5億港幣有顯著增加。\n\n圖2 2015年總結餘及未償匯豐基金票據\n\n貨幣市場\n\n由於銀行系統流動性充裕，2015年間港幣銀行間利率保持低位。美國聯邦基金利率範圍由0–0.25%調整至0.25–0.5%（美國時間12月16日），相應的基準利率（Base Rate）亦於12月17日由0.5%升至0.75%，根據預設公式調整。2015年，隔夜至三個月的銀行間拆借利率普遍低於基准利率（圖3），受到季節性需要和8月金融市場波動因素影響，利率曾有所波動。追蹤香港銀行間拆息（HIBOR）與倫敦銀行間拆息（LIBOR）之差，8月份由於市場流動性緊縮，港幣遠期點數轉為顯著溢價，年尾由於美元利率普遍上升，則轉為折扣（圖4）。整體而言，貨幣市場正常運作，折扣窗口借款活動有限，2015年僅為2.8億港幣。\n\n貨幣穩定性\n\n圖3 2015年港幣銀行間利率\n\n圖4 2015年港幣遠期點數\n\n聯繫匯率制度\n\n自1983年建立以來，聯繫匯率制度（LERS）一直平穩運作，並在過去數十年大大增強了香港的貨幣和金融穩定性。由於香港經濟規模小、開放程度高，同時是國際金融中心，LERS仍是最適合香港的匯率制度。香港特區政府堅定致力於維護LERS，穩定的外匯和貨幣市場進一步增強了政府的信譽，公眾對港幣用作支付手段和價值存儲的信心亦持續穩固。2015年，國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）在香港第IV次磋商中，繼續推崇LERS為香港最合適的貨幣制度，稱讚香港的制度框架、法律和政策具有韌性，財政儲備充足，市場靈活，金融系統穩健，是支持LERS順暢運行的關鍵因素。\n\n由於強健的銀行體系對LERS的正常運作至關重要，HKMA持續密切監控銀行的信貸、流動性和利率風險管理及壓力測試，並加強對銀行企業和房地產貸款的監管，以增強銀行業的韌性。鑑於美國利率上升，HKMA提醒公眾做好風險管理準備，指出觸發弱端CU和資金流出是一個正常且必要的過程，以促進港幣利率的正常化。\n\n為提升貨幣櫃檯帳目的透明度，自1998年10月起，一部分匯豐基金資產被指定用於支持貨幣基礎。2015年，Backing Ratio（定義為支持資產與貨幣基礎之比）在106.3%至107.5%的範圍內波動，未觸及上或下組觸發水平。年末，該比率為106.3%（圖5）。在LERS下，雖然有指定位於Backing Portfolio的特定匯豐基金資產，但所有基金資產均可用於支援港幣兌換率。豐厚的基金資源為在突發衝擊時，提供強有力的後盾以保護香港的貨幣與金融穩定。\n\n圖5 2015年每日Backing Ratio變動\n\n其他活動\n\n匯豐基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）貨幣櫃檯子委員會負責監察及檢討與香港貨幣和金融穩定相關的事宜。2015年，子委員會考慮了包括全球銀行提供的美元國際貸款供應、宏觀審慎措施的國際使用、美國加息對香港房地產市場的影響、基準利率的計算公式、香港美元實質有效匯率升值的宏觀經濟影響以及新興市場經濟的主權風險等議題。子委員會討論內容和有關貨幣櫃檯運作的報告均已在HKMA網站公布。\n\n貨幣研究所（HKIMR）持續贊助貨幣政策、銀行和金融領域的研究。2015年，研究所共有16名研究員，發表27份工作論文。\n\n研究所舉辦了五場國際會議和工作坊，其中主要包括：\n\n* 1月舉行的第六屆中國經濟國際會議，題為“杠杆率與金融體系效率及穩定性：中外經驗”。會議展示11篇高質量論文，涵蓋中國企業槓杆、信貸繁榮與經濟循環、銀行競爭與金融穩定、銀行監管及信貸供應等多個議題。\n* 5月由HKIMR與香港大學合辦的“HKIMR-港大國際金融、制度與經濟增長會議”。討論範圍包括銀行與貨幣政策、國際融資與跨境併購、金融監管設計、宏觀經濟環境及資本市場所面臨的挑戰。\n* 10月，HKIMR聯合農心銀行（Federal Reserve）、歐洲央行（ECB）及達拉斯聯邦儲備銀行召開“貨幣政策分歧、全球資本流動與金融穩定”研討會。內容涵蓋貨幣政策與國際資本流動、匯率關係、多元貨幣政策的全球影響、主要央行政策的外溢效應，以及全球政策協調的利與弊。\n\n此外，研究所於8月舉辦第13屆HKIMR夏季研習班，9月則舉行第13屆大陸經濟會議，討論財政改革和地方政府融資問題。這些會議吸引來自學術界、金融業及全球央行的參與。年內，研究所舉辦了24場公共研討會，內容涵蓋廣泛的經濟、貨幣和金融議題。\n\n鈔票與硬幣\n\n截至2015年底，流通中的鈔票總值達3602億港幣，同比增加5.3%（圖6、7和8）。政府發行的流通貨幣總值為112億港幣，較去年同期上升2.9%（圖9和10）。政府發行的10港幣紙幣總值為40億港幣，其中85%為聚合物鈔票。"}
{"en": "# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA focused its supervisory efforts on authorized institutions risk governance, including credit and liquidity risk management systems, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing controls, and selling practices for investment and insurance products. With the build-up of systemic risks, the HKMA announced a 0.625% jurisdictional Countercyclical Capital Buffer for Hong Kong from 1 January 2016 (and 1.25% from 1 January 2017). Five authorized institutions were designated as Domestic Systemically Important Banks which will be subject to a Higher Loss Absorbency capital buffer. Significant progress was made on reforms for recovery and resolution with the introduction of the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Bill into the Legislative Council. The HKMA also stepped up its work with the banking industry on enhancing access to basic banking services, consumer education, and the skills and knowledge development of bank directors and financial practitioners.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2015\n\n# Overview\n\nAmid signs of a divergence in monetary policy stances among the major developed economies, emerging markets faced a higher risk of capital outflows and slower economic growth in 2015. In order to maintain the resilience of the banking sector against a possible abrupt deterioration in the macroeconomic environment, the HKMA continued to closely monitor the effectiveness of authorized institutions’ (AIs) risk governance and their systems for management of credit and liquidity risks.\n\n# Operational supervision\n\nIn 2015, the HKMA continued to adopt the supervisory approach where regular on-site examinations were supplemented by an increased number of thematic reviews. Thematic reviews are in-depth off-site reviews focusing on particular risk areas or specific activities of groups of selected AIs. This approach has allowed the HKMA to prioritise its supervisory resources to focus on emerging and more significant risks of AIs.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA performed a total of 193 on-site examinations. More in-depth thematic on-site examinations on credit risk management and asset quality were conducted, in view of the emerging signs of deterioration in the asset quality of AIs' loan portfolio. The HKMA increased the number of examinations on treasury related activities given market uncertainty amid the divergence of monetary policies in major advanced economies. On-site examinations were also conducted on Mainland-related business, stress testing and liquidity risk management, operational and technology risk management, capital planning, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML/CFT) controls and internal ratings-based (IRB) models of AIs. AIs' activities in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses were also subject to on-site examinations by specialist teams during the year.\n\nFurthermore, a total of 152 thematic off-site reviews were conducted covering similar areas as the thematic on-site examinations. Table 1 contains details of the operational supervision work.\n\nIn 2015, 196 off-site reviews were conducted to assess AIs’ corporate governance, financial position and business operations. Supervisory attention focused on risk governance, capital planning, corporate sector credit and monitoring of implementation of Basel III standards. The supervisory teams maintained frequent contact with the boards of directors and external auditors of selected AIs. 20 tripartite meetings were held with the senior management and external auditors of AIs, while 23 meetings were held with the full board or board-level committees of selected AIs.\n\nThe Banking Supervision Review Committee considered four cases, all concerning the authorization of AIs.\n\nTo better utilise its supervisory resources to deal with competing priorities, the HKMA continued to invoke powers under section 59(2) of the Banking Ordinance to require AIs to appoint external auditors to follow up on potentially material supervisory issues. The HKMA commissioned six reports under this provision in 2015. Two of the reports covered AML/CFT controls and another two of the reports covered private banking business, while the remaining were related to areas including securities related activities and loans classification system.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nNo AI breached the requirements of the Banking Ordinance relating to capital adequacy or liquidity ratio in 2015. There were 84 breaches under various sections of the Ordinance, but none affected the interests of depositors and they were rectified promptly by the AIs.\n\nTable 1 Operational supervision\n\n# Powers under section 52 of the Banking Ordinance\n\nMelli Bank Plc continues to be subject to the exercise of powers under section 52 of the Banking Ordinance. The directions imposed by the Monetary Authority on 25 June 2008 under section 52(1)(A) of the Banking Ordinance on the affairs, business and property of the Hong Kong Branch of Melli Bank Plc remained in force during the year. The HKMA will continue to communicate regularly with the relevant authorities to monitor developments related to the branch and its head office in the UK, and will keep in view the supervisory measures taken to protect the interests of the AI’s depositors.\n\n# CAMEL rating review\n\nThe CAMEL Approval Committee reviewed and determined the composite CAMEL ratings of AIs. The AIs were notified of the ratings and given the opportunity to request a review. There was no request for a review during the year.\n\n# Specialised supervisory work\n\n# Supervision of operational and technology risks\n\nThe HKMA continued to issue new or updated guidance on operational and technology risk management in the light of emerging risks and industry developments. In particular, the HKMA completed the revision of the Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module in relation to electronic banking (e-banking), which allows AIs more flexibility in offering new e-banking services. In addition, a circular was issued on cyber security, reiterating the importance for the boards and senior management of AIs to have oversight of effective cyber security risk management. The HKMA also published periodic issues of its “Operational Incidents Watch” highlighting the modus operandi of selected fraud cases or operational incidents and the control weaknesses identified.\n\nThe HKMA conducted risk-based thematic on-site and off-site supervisory reviews to evaluate selected AIs' operational and technology risk management at the enterprise level or in specific business lines. These covered selected areas in relation to AIs' operational risk management framework, cyber security risk management, controls for guarding against rogue trading activities, oversight of important outsourcing service providers, fraud risk management and technology controls for anti-money laundering. These supervisory reviews were supplemented by the annual independent compliance exercises covering operational risk management framework, technology risk management (including protection of customer data) and business continuity planning, where selected AIs were required to appoint independent and qualified assessors to examine the adequacy of their relevant controls and then rectify the weaknesses identified. The HKMA also identified and analysed the trend and key supervisory focus of AIs' operational and technology risks, with particular reference to the AIs that play an important role in the stability and effective functioning of Hong Kong's monetary and banking systems.\n\nThe HKMA monitored the final phase of the banking industry's implementation of the chip-based ATM technology through which AIs completed the card replacement process of pure credit cards by the end of 2015. The HKMA also required card issuing AIs to implement authentication controls to further improve the security over \"card-not-present\" credit card transactions. Separately, after receiving reports that the names of cardholders stored in some contactless credit cards could be accessed stealthily, the HKMA required the AIs concerned to take prompt action to notify and protect the affected cardholders. The HKMA devoted resources to publicise and explain the scale and implications of the incident to address public concern and to monitor AIs' remedial efforts, including the prompt replacement of affected cards.\n\nThe HKMA collaborated with the industry and other stakeholders on a number of initiatives, including public awareness programme on e-banking security precautions, establishing a platform for sharing cyber security intelligence, and providing support and advice to a crisis management exercise organised by the Hong Kong Financial Services Business Continuity Management Forum that involved AIs and other financial firms.\n\n# Supervision of wealth management and MPF-related businesses\n\nThe HKMA co-operated closely with other financial regulators in Hong Kong in providing guidance and supervising AIs’ selling of securities, investment products, insurance products and MPF schemes. Regular contact was maintained with the regulators through bilateral and multilateral meetings, as well as under the auspices of the Council of Financial Regulators. These meetings covered various issues involving financial groups or regulated entities with close business relationships across different sectors in the financial services industry to ensure more co-ordinated and effective supervisory action.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA conducted 25 on-site and offsite thematic examinations and 15 off-site surveillance of AIs. These covered the selling of investment products, handling the settlement of securities transactions and safe custody of client securities, and the selling of non-linked long term insurance (NLTI) products and MPF-related products involving retail, private banking and corporate banking customers.\n\nIn August, the HKMA issued a circular to AIs to provide guidance on suitability assessment and product information disclosure in the selling of NLTI products to customers. The guidance aimed to assist AIs in complying with regulatory standards, including relevant requirements issued in July by the Office of the Commissioner of Insurance and the Hong Kong Federation of Insurers.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA continued to work closely with the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB) in the legislative process for the Insurance Companies (Amendment) Bill 2014, to establish an independent Insurance Authority and a statutory licensing regime for insurance intermediaries. In July, the Insurance Companies (Amendment) ordinance 2015 was enacted by the Legislative Council, which provides, among other things, for the inspection and investigation powers, in respect of AIs’ insurance intermediary activities, of the Monetary Authority through delegation.\n\nThe HKMA processed six applications to become Registered Institutions (RIs) and one application from RIs to engage in additional regulated activities. It granted consent to 204 executive officers responsible for supervising the securities activities of RIs, and conducted background checks on 9,697 individuals whose information was submitted by RIs for inclusion in the register maintained by the HKMA.\n\n# Supervision of treasury activities\n\nAIs’ liquidity risk management remained one of the HKMA’s priority supervisory focuses, particularly in light of the anticipated normalisation of interest rates in the US and the potential subsequent reversal of fund flows that could have an impact on AIs’ liquidity positions. Throughout 2015, the HKMA continued to implement the enhanced Stable Funding Requirement for AIs to maintain sufficient stable funds to support their lending business. Since the implementation of the Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) from 1 January 2015, the HKMA has been monitoring the level and trend of LCRs of category 1 institutions, which generally maintained LCRs close to or over 100%, well above the statutory minimum of 60% for 2015 under the phase-in arrangement.\n\nSeparately, the HKMA conducted thematic on-site examinations on selected AIs’ control framework for managing the risks associated with the anticipated interest rate normalisation. Amid the market volatility, the HKMA also paid close attention to abrupt market changes and their impact on the banking sector as well as individual AIs, and undertook appropriate follow-up action.\n\n# Supervisor-driven stress testing programme\n\nThe HKMA continued to conduct the bottom-up supervisor-driven stress testing programme to better understand the resilience of locally incorporated retail banks under extreme and adverse economic conditions, and to encourage them to develop plans to address potential problems in times of stress. A number of improvements were introduced during the year to collect more granular information to gain a greater insight into the risk dynamics of selected areas.

{"en": "# International Financial Centre\n\nThe global economic and financial environment was fraught with challenges in 2015, calling for closer international collaboration and communication to maintain stability. During the year, the HKMA continued to actively participate in international and regional forums while sparing no effort in raising Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre, including enhancing our financial infrastructure, optimising the regulatory and tax regime, and capitalising on the internationalisation of the renminbi to further develop offshore renminbi business. Hong Kong’s strong economic fundamentals and robust fiscal performance continued to be recognised by credit rating agencies with Standard & Poor’s maintaining its top-rated AAA rating for Hong Kong.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nThe HKMA actively contributes to international discussions on issues of significance to global and regional financial stability. In July, it assumed co-chairmanship of the Financial Stability Board Regional Consultative Group for Asia (FSB RCG(A)) for a two-year period. The group’s aim is to promote interaction between FSB members and nonmembers on policy initiatives, encourage implementation of financial reforms and facilitate the exchange of views on financial stability issues. The HKMA continued to work closely with the ASEAN+3 authorities to strengthen the operations of the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO) — which has been upgraded to an international organisation — to monitor and analyse regional economies and support decision-making of the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralisation (CMIM).\n\nDuring the year, Hong Kong’s offshore renminbi pool and bond issuance experienced some contraction due to a number of market factors. However the market continued to function orderly, and renminbi trade settlement, bank lending and foreign exchange turnover maintained steady growth. In addition, the growing renminbi business conducted in and through Hong Kong contributed to the recognition of the renminbi by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as a freely usable currency. The iMF’s decision to include it in the Special Drawing Right (SDR) currency basket will add impetus to the internationalisation of the renminbi as well as the further development of the offshore market in Hong Kong.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong's financial infrastructure and its continued development play a significant role in reinforcing the competitive edge of Hong Kong as an international financial centre and the global offshore renminbi business hub. The turnover of the renminbi payment system in Hong Kong hit new highs in 2015, while the trade repository for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives continued to support entities to report their OTC derivatives transactions as required under the new OTC derivatives market regulatory regime, which was introduced in July.\n\nHong Kong's financial infrastructure was further enhanced by the HKMA in 2015 with new components and services, including the successful launch of the e-Cheque service in December, which means that over 150 banks are now capable of receiving and processing e-Cheques from their customers through the Internet and mobile channels. The electronic bill presentment and payment (EBPP) service, which was launched in 2013, continued to see growth in merchant participation in 2015. In July, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMu) launched a service under its Fund Order Routing Service to support the implementation of the Mainland - Hong Kong Mutual Recognition of Funds (MRF). And, the regulatory framework for retail payment products and services was improved with the commencement in November of the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO). Under the PSSVFO, the HKMA is empowered to implement a mandatory licensing regime for multi-purpose stored value facilities and perform relevant supervision and enforcement functions, as well as designating important retail payment systems to ensure their safe and efficient operation under prudential regulation.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\n# REVIEW OF 2015\n\n# International and regional co-operation\n\nWith increased connections among global financial markets, the HKMA proactively fosters co-operation with other jurisdictions in promoting sustainable economic growth and financial system stability through international and regional forums including the FSB, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC). The HKMA also continues to implement global financial regulatory reforms, including the recommendations of the G20, to help strengthen the resilience of the global financial system.\n\nThe HKMA became a co-chair of the FSB RCG(A) in July and hosted its ninth meeting in Hong Kong in October. The RCG(A) serves as an important platform for FSB members and non-FSB members to communicate and co-operate on financial stability issues. Senior representatives from finance ministries, central banks and financial regulators of 16 Asian jurisdictions attended the meeting to discuss risks facing the region, the implications of increasing asset management activities, misconduct risk and experience with deposit insurance schemes. The HKMA also co-chaired a workshop on macroprudential policies in Hong Kong in August. The workshop was organised by the Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS), and attended by representatives from 18 central banks from around the world. Participants shared their experiences in macroprudential policies, focusing on the calibration and evaluation of tools, their interaction with monetary policy, and possible spillover effects. The HKMA also co-hosted a conference with the Bank of England and the IMF, featuring discussions on the challenges that central banks and other policymakers face in choosing the optimal mix of monetary, macroprudential and microprudential policies. The conference was attended by over a hundred participants, including representatives from academia, central banks and international financial institutions.\n\n# Promoting monetary and financial stability in Asia\n\nThe HKMA maintained its commitment to regional cooperative initiatives to promote financial stability in Asia and to harness the region's collective voice in international financial affairs. As a co-ordinator of the macro-surveillance work for the Monetary and Financial Stability Committee established under the Executives' Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP), the HKMA continued to prepare the Committee’s half-yearly Macro-Monitoring Report to assess the region’s risks and vulnerabilities and the policy implications. As Chair of the EMEAP Working Group on Payment and Settlement Systems, the HKMA worked closely with the Deputy Chair to co-ordinate the Group’s effort in sharing experiences and exchanging information on risk management, oversight, standards and best practices, and developments in domestic and cross-border payment and settlement systems. It also led the Working Group’s sub-group on cross-border co-operation and development. The HKMA hosted meetings of the EMEAP/BIS Forum on Foreign Exchange Markets and the EMEAP Working Group on Financial Markets (WGFM) in Hong Kong in June. Attended by representatives from 17 authorities from the region and major economies, the meetings reviewed the latest developments in financial markets and financial regulatory reforms.\n\nFollowing the signing of the AMRO Agreement by Hong Kong and the ASEAN+3 authorities last year, AMRO was upgraded to an international organisation in February 2016 to support its pivotal role under the enhanced CMIM.\n\n# Hong Kong’s credit ratings\n\nThe HKMA continued to maintain close dialogue with international credit rating agencies to present a balanced assessment of Hong Kong's economic performance and fiscal strength. These efforts contributed to the affirmation of Hong Kong's credit ratings by all major credit rating agencies in 2015. Standard & Poor's affirmed its highest AAA rating for Hong Kong, reflecting the agency’s recognition of Hong Kong’s above-average growth prospects for a high-income economy, sizable fiscal reserves, consistently healthy fiscal performance and strong net external asset position. Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings also maintained Hong Kong’s ratings at Aa1 and AA+ respectively, just one notch below triple-A.\n\n# Development of Hong Kong as the offshore renminbi business centre\n\nIn 2015, market factors had an impact on Hong Kong's renminbi pool. At the end of the year, outstanding renminbi customer deposits and certificates of deposit stood at RMB 1,010 billion, as compared with RMB 1,158 billion a year ago (Chart 1). Offshore renminbi bond issuance moderated amid declining interest rates in the onshore market. As a result, issuance of renminbi bonds in Hong Kong dropped to RMB 75 billion. On the other hand, renminbi trade settlement transactions handled by banks in Hong Kong expanded by 9% to RMB 6,833 billion. The outstanding amount of renminbi bank loans also increased by 58% year-on-year to RMB 297 billion (Chart 2). Average daily turnover in the renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system increased to RMB 947 billion, up 29% from 2014. At the same time, the offshore renminbi foreign exchange market saw further growth in Hong Kong, with survey results indicating a daily turnover of some US$ 93 billion equivalent at the end of April 2015, an increase of 88% from April 2013 when the last BIS Triennial Survey was conducted. Hong Kong remained the largest offshore renminbi business hub with a market of considerable depth and breadth. Another significant development reinforcing this position was the implementation of the MRF initiative in July, which has expanded Hong Kong’s renminbi product offering.\n\nThe HKMA's policy initiative to expand channels for crossborder renminbi fund flows and its joint efforts with the industry to enhance Hong Kong's renminbi financial platform continued to bear fruit. In June, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) announced that offshore renminbi business clearing banks and participating banks would be allowed to conduct repo transactions in the onshore interbank bond market and remit proceeds offshore, to facilitate renminbi liquidity management by banks in the offshore market. In September, the PBoC relaxed the rules on cross-border renminbi cash pooling, enabling more multinational corporations to conduct intra-group cash transfers under streamlined arrangements. The Mainland authorities also granted foreign central banks, international financial institutions and sovereign wealth funds wider access to the onshore interbank bond market in July. They further opened up the Mainland’s foreign exchange market to these institutions in September.\n\nOn 30 november, the IMF announced its decision to include the renminbi in the SDR currency basket with effect from 1 October 2016. The decision affirms the renminbi’s status as a freely usable currency, and further promotes confidence in the use of the renminbi for global transactions. As an international financial centre and the global offshore renminbi business hub, Hong Kong will benefit from new business opportunities arising from the further internationalisation of the renminbi and the Mainland’s enhanced connection with the global economic and financial systems.\n\nHong Kong continued to reinforce its collaboration on renminbi business with other jurisdictions throughout the year. The HKMA co-hosted the third RMB Trade and Investment Dialogue with Australia and the fifth RMB Business Forum with London, and worked with Malaysia and Thailand for the second time in facilitating private sector discussions on renminbi business. Through these initiatives, banks in Hong Kong strengthened their renminbi business flows and linkages with other markets, which will bring more renminbi business to Hong Kong. The HKMA also stepped up its marketing efforts to promote the wider use of renminbi in trade, investment and financing among corporations and institutions through participation in industry events in Hong Kong and in overseas markets including Canada, Japan and Africa.\n\nDeputy Chief Executive of the HKMA, Mr Eddie Yue, speaks at a seminar during the fifth meeting of Hong Kong–London RMB Forum on 11 December 2015.\n\n# CEPA\n\nA new agreement to achieve basic liberalisation of trade in services between Mainland China and Hong Kong was signed in November under the framework of the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA). The agreement extends most of the pilot liberalisation measures introduced in Guangdong in 2014 nationwide. By according national treatment, in principle, to Hong Kong banks, the new agreement is expected to provide these banks with more policy certainty and greater flexibility when conducting business in Mainland China.\n\n# Training\n\nThe HKMA continued to provide training programmes for officials from the PBoC, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange and the China Banking Regulatory Commission. In addition to programmes dealing with central banking and general risk management, topics included consumer protection, credit reference, monetary and collateral management, financial soundness indicators analysis, and systemic risk monitoring. Ad hoc training sessions were also conducted for delegations from overseas banking and law enforcement agencies.\n\n# Government Bond Programme\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA arranged eight tenders of institutional government bonds amounting to HK$ 20.4 billion. By the end of 2015, the total amount of outstanding institutional bonds was HK$ 68.9 billion.\n", "zh": "國際金融中心\n\n2015年，全球經濟與金融環境充滿挑戰，促使國際合作與溝通更加緊密，以維持穩定。在此期間，香港金融管理局（HKMA）持續積極參與國際及地區論壇，並不遺餘力提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力，包括加強金融基礎建設、優化監管與稅制，以及利用人民幣國際化來進一步發展離岸人民幣業務。香港堅實的經濟基礎和穩健的財政表現持續獲得信用評等機構的肯定，標準普爾持續維持對香港的最高AAA評級。\n\n概觀\n\n香港金融管理局積極參與全球重要金融穩定性議題的國際討論。7月，該局接任亞洲金融穩定委員會區域諮詢小組（FSB RCG（A））的聯席主席，任期兩年。該小組旨在促進FSP成員與非成員之間的政策交流，鼓勵金融改革的落實，並促進對金融穩定問題的意見交流。HKMA也持續與東協+3國家金融主管部門緊密合作，強化東協+3宏觀經濟研究辦公室（AMRO）——已升格為國際組織——的運作，以監測分析區域經濟並支援清邁會議倡議（CMIM）的決策。\n\n年內，香港的離岸人民幣池及債券發行因多重市場因素而有所收縮。然而，市場仍有序運作，人民幣貿易結算、銀行放貸與外匯交易量則持續穩定成長。此外，香港境內外的人民幣業務日益擴展，並促使國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）將人民幣列入特別提款權（SDR）貨幣籃子，認可其為可自由使用的貨幣。IMF的決定將有助推動人民幣國際化，並進一步推動香港離岸市場的發展。\n\n香港金融基礎設施的安全與高效運作，及其持續的發展，對於鞏固香港作為國際金融中心和全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的競爭優勢具有重要作用。2015年，人民幣支付系統交易額創新高，而場外衍生品交易監理台帳繼續支援實體如實申報新交易規則（自7月起實施）的遵循。此外，2015年香港的金融基礎建設進一步強化，包括12月成功推出電子支票服務，使超過150家銀行獲得通過網路與行動渠道接收及處理電子支票的能力。2013年推出的電子帳單呈示與支付（EBPP）服務亦持續成長，參與商戶不斷增加。7月，中央結算單位（CMU）啟動基金訂單路由服務，以支援內地與香港基金的相互認可（MRF）措施。同時，零售支付產品與服務的監管架構亦在11月推出支付系統與存款帳戶設施條例（PSSVFO）中得到完善。根據PSSVFO，HKMA獲授權實施強制許可制度，監督和執行多用途存款設施，並指定重要的零售支付系統，以確保其在審慎監管下的安全與高效運作。\n\n國際金融中心\n\n2015年回顧\n\n國際與地區合作\n\n隨著全球金融市場的聯繫日益增密，HKMA積極促進與其他司法管轄區在國際與地區論壇中的合作，包括金融穩定委員會（FSB）、國際清算銀行（BIS）與亞太經濟合作組織（APEC）。HKMA亦持續推行全球金融監管改革，響應G20的建議，以增強全球金融體系的韌性。\n\nHKMA於7月成為FSB RCG（A）的聯席主席，並於10月在香港舉辦第九次會議。該小組為FSP成員與非成員間交流促進金融穩定性議題提供重要平台。來自東亞16個司法管轄區的財政部、中央銀行與金融監管機構的高級代表出席會議，討論區域面臨的風險、資產管理活動的升高、失信風險以及存款保險制度的經驗等議題。8月，HKMA亦與英格蘭銀行及IMF合辦有關宏觀審慎政策的研討會，邀請全球18個中央銀行代表分享政策經驗，內容聚焦工具的校準與評估、與貨幣政策的互動以及可能的溢出效應。HKMA還與英格蘭銀行及IMF共同主持一場會議，討論央行及其他政策制定者在選擇最佳貨幣政策、宏觀與微觀審慎政策組合中的挑戰。會議吸引百餘名來賓，包括學界、中央銀行及國際金融機構代表。\n\n推動亞洲的貨幣與金融穩定\n\nHKMA堅持推動區域合作，促進亞洲金融穩定，並利用該區在國際金融事務中的集體聲音。作為東亞及太平洋中央銀行理事會（EMEAP）成立之貨幣及金融穩定委員會宏觀監測工作的協調者，HKMA持續準備半年度宏觀監控報告，以評估區域風險與脆弱性及政策意涵。作為支付與結算系統工作組的主席，HKMA與副主席密切合作，協調經驗分享、風險管理、監督、標準與最佳實踐，以及國內外支付與結算系統的發展，並領導跨境合作與發展的子小組。2015年6月，HKMA亦在香港主持了東亞及國際清算銀行外匯市場研討會及EMEAP金融市場工作組（WGFM）的會議。來自17個區域及主要經濟體的代表出席，討論金融市場最新發展及監管改革。\n\n繼去年香港與東協+3國簽署AMRO協議後，AMRO於2016年2月升格為國際組織，以支持強化的CMIM中的關鍵角色。\n\n香港的信評\n\nHKMA持續與國際信用評等機構密切對話，呈現香港經濟和財政實力的平衡評估。這些努力促成2015年香港獲得所有主要評等機構的確認。標準普爾維持香港的最高AAA評級，彰顯其對於高收入經濟的優良成長前景、龐大的財政儲備、持續健康的財政表現及強勁的淨外部資產的肯定。穆迪與惠譽亦分別維持香港的Aa1與AA+評級，僅比三A略低一級。\n\n香港作為離岸人民幣業務中心的發展\n\n2015年，市場因素對香港的人民幣池產生影響。截至年末，人民幣客戶存款及定存額為人民幣1010億元，較一年前的人民幣1158億元減少（圖表1）。離岸人民幣債券發行在岸內地利率下降背景下有所調整，香港人民幣債券發行額降至人民幣750億元。同時，香港銀行處理的人民幣貿易結算交易擴大9%，達人民幣6833億元。人民幣銀行貸款額亦同比增加58%，達人民幣2970億元（圖表2）。人民幣即時結算系統（RTGS）的平均日交易額增至人民幣9470億元，比2014年成長29%。同時，香港的離岸人民幣外匯市場進一步擴大，4月底調查顯示日均交易約93億美元，較2013年最後一次BIS三年調查的數據增長88%。香港仍是最大的離岸人民幣業務樞紐，市場深度與廣度均具規模。另一項重要推進是7月實施的人民幣回歸基金（MRF）計畫，擴展了香港的人民幣產品範疇。\n\nHKMA的政策措施，促進跨境人民幣資金流動渠道，並與產業界合作，持續增加香港人民幣金融平台的多元功能。6月，中國人民銀行（PBoC）宣布，離岸人民幣結算行與參與行可在境內銀行間債券市場進行回購交易，並將所得結匯至境外，以促進離岸市場的人民幣流動性管理。9月，PBoC放寬跨境人民幣現金池規定，允許更多跨國企業在簡化安排下進行集團內資金轉移。同月，大陸當局亦擴大外資央行、國際金融機構及主權財富基金進入內地銀行間債券市場的渠道，並於9月進一步開放外匯市場。\n\n2016年10月1日，IMF宣布將人民幣加入SDR貨幣籃子，此決定肯定人民幣為自由使用貨幣，並進一步提升其在全球交易中的信心。作為國際金融中心及全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐，香港將受益於人民幣國際化步伐的推進與內地與全球經濟金融體系連結的加強所帶來的新商機。\n\n香港持續與其他司法管轄區加強人民幣業務合作。HKMA合辦澳洲第三屆人民幣貿易與投資對話以及倫敦第五屆人民幣商務論壇，並與馬來西亞與泰國再次合作促進私營部門討論人民幣業務。通過這些活動，香港銀行的人民幣流動與聯繫其他市場所加強，有望吸引更多人民幣業務來港。HKMA亦加大市場推廣力度，在香港及海外市場（如加拿大、日本與非洲）推廣人民幣的貿易、投資與融資用途。\n\n在2015年12月11日的香港–倫敦人民幣論壇第五次會議上，HKMA副行政長官余偉文出席演講。\n\nCEPA\n\n去年11月，內地與香港簽署一項新協議，實現貿易擴散基本自由化，該協議在經貿合作安排（CEPA）框架下制定。此協議擴展了2014年在廣東推行的多數先行自由化措施，理論上對香港銀行提供國民待遇，有望為其在內地經營提供更多政策確定性和更高彈性。\n\n培訓\n\nHKMA持續為中國人民銀行、國家外匯管理局和中國銀行監管委員會的官方人員提供培訓課程，內容涵蓋中央銀行議題與風險管理，亦涵蓋消費者保護、信用評核、貨幣與擔保品管理、金融穩健指標分析及系統性風險監測。亦為海外銀行與執法機關代表團提供臨時專項培訓。\n\n政府債券計畫\n\n全年，HKMA安排了八次政府機構持有人招標，規模合共204億港元。至2015年底，機構持有人公債總額為689億港元。"}
{"en": "# Reserves Management\n\n2015 was a turbulent year for the global financial markets, presenting unprecedented challenges to investment funds. Amid such challenging and difficult investment environment, the Exchange Fund recorded an overall investment return of -0.6% in 2015, but its loss was relatively mild as compared with major market indices and comparable investment funds, thanks to a series of defensive moves deployed by the HKMA over the past years which have enhanced the resilience of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary and may be invested in any securities or other assets he considers appropriate, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC).\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nEFAC has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(a) to preserve capital;\n(b) to ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, will be fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(c) to ensure that sufficient liquidity will be available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) subject to (a) — (c), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund.\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios — the Backing Portfolio and the Investment Portfolio. The Backing Portfolio holds highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of the assets. The long-term target bond-to-equity mix for the two portfolios as a whole is 72:28. In terms of target currency mix, 81% of the assets are allocated to the US dollar and the Hong Kong dollar, and the remaining 19% to other currencies.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA has been diversifying part of the Exchange Fund’s investment, in a prudent and incremental manner, into a greater variety of asset classes, including emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity and overseas investment properties. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the Investment Portfolio while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The cap for the net asset value of the HKMA’s investments under the LTGP is maintained at one-third of the Accumulated Surplus of the Exchange Fund. At the end of 2015, the market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$142.1 billion, made up of HK$91.3 billion in private equity and HK$50.8 billion in real estate, with outstanding investment commitments amounted to HK$122.4 billion.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007 to hold shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that were acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes, is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of the unique nature of this Portfolio.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation — the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation. The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents the long-term optimal asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This often means the actual allocation is different from the benchmark, or strategic, allocation. The differences between the actual and the benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and the limits for tactical deviations are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with EFAC, tactical decisions are made by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the limits allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may take positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nHKMA staff in the Reserves Management Department directly manage the investment of about 76% of the Exchange Fund, which includes the entire Backing Portfolio and part of the Investment Portfolio. This part of the Investment Portfolio includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers based in a number of international financial centres to manage about 24% of the Exchange Fund's assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised assets. The purpose of appointing external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to capture a diverse mix of investment styles, and transfer knowledge and information from the market to in-house professionals.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is primarily determined by market factors, and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe high volatility of the financial markets in recent years has highlighted the importance of risk management. Stringent controls and investment guidelines have been established for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and compliance with guidelines and regulations is closely monitored. Risk-control tools are deployed to assess market risks under both normal and adverse market conditions. The HKMA also conducts detailed performance attribution analyses to make the best use of the investment skills of both internal and external managers.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2015\n\nThe global financial markets were highly volatile in 2015. The equity markets, in particular, encountered exceptional turbulence. Major equity markets reached new highs in the first half of the year. However, market sentiment worsened drastically in the third quarter, arising from Mainland China growth concerns, with major equity markets reversing their year-to-date gains and registering significant quarterly losses. Global equity markets recovered somewhat along with improving market sentiment thereafter, but they worsened again towards the end of the year. With their close linkage with the Mainland economy, Hong Kong equities underperformed other major equity markets in 2015.\n\nOn sovereign bond markets, longer-term US Treasury yields rose moderately in 2015 despite expectation of US interest rate normalisation and the start of the US interest rate up-cycle, as positive sentiment was checked by concerns over global economic growth, lingering global disinflationary pressures and intensified geopolitical tensions. On the other hand, short-term European government bond yields declined and some even slipped into negative territory on the back of the European Central Bank’s aggressive monetary easing policy.\n\nOn currency markets, the US dollar continued to strengthen in 2015 with the US dollar index surging by almost 10%, amid expectation of the commencement of the US policy rate normalisation. The euro weakened significantly in the first quarter, posting the biggest single-quarter fall in the history of the euro since 1999, as the European Central Bank announced quantitative easing measures in January. On the other hand, the yen stayed largely flat against the US dollar in 2015.\n\nThe performance of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2015 is shown in Table 1.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nAgainst the backdrop of exceptionally volatile financial markets and difficult investment environment, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment loss of HK$15.8 billion in 2015, comprising gains of HK$7.1 billion on overseas equities, losses of HK$5 billion on Hong Kong equities, gains of HK$15.9 billion on bonds, a negative currency translation effect of HK$44.9 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets and gains of HK$11.1 billion on other investments held by the investment holding subsidiaries of the Fund. The negative currency translation effect was unavoidable when translating the Exchange Fund’s non-US dollar investments into Hong Kong dollar amid the sharp strengthening of the US dollar last year. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$2.2 billion.\n\nThe total assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$3,422.9 billion at the end of 2015. The investment return of the Exchange Fund (excluding the Strategic Portfolio) in 2015 was -0.6%. That notwithstanding, the Exchange Fund’s loss could be considered mild when compared with the underperforming major market indices and the investment fund community in general. In anticipation of a worsening investment environment, the HKMA has deployed a series of defensive moves over the past years, which include shortening the duration of bond portfolios, increasing cash holdings, and significantly reducing non-US dollar assets. We have also quickened the pace of investment diversification, especially through investments under the LTGP. These moves have enhanced the resilience of the Exchange Fund and helped mitigate some potential losses.\n\nThe annual return of the Fund from 1994 to 2015 is set out in Chart 1. Table 2 shows the 2015 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over a number of different time horizons. The average return was 1.2% over the past three years, 1.8% over the past five years, 3.3% over the past 10 years and 5.0% since 1994. Table 3 shows the currency mix of the Fund's assets on 31 December 2015.\n\nChart 1 Investment return of the Exchange Fund (1994 – 2015) \n1 investment return calculation excludes the holdings in the Strategic Portfolio. \n2 Composite Consumer price index is calculated based on the 2009/2010-based series.\n", "zh": "儲備管理\n\n2015年對全球金融市場而言是一個動盪不安的年份，為投資基金帶來前所未有的挑戰。在如此困難的投資環境中，投資基金會錄得-0.6%的整體投資回報，但由於香港金融管理局（HKMA）過去幾年所部署的一系列防禦措施，增強了外匯基金的韌性，使其損失相對較輕，這一損失較主要市場指數和類似投資基金來得溫和。\n\n外匯基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》的規定，外匯基金的主要宗旨是影響甚至間接影響香港貨幣的匯率。基金亦可用於維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定與完整，以幫助維持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。外匯基金由財經司司長控制，並可在諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）後，投資於他認為適當的證券或其他資產。\n\n外匯基金管理\n\n投資目標與投資組合結構\n\nEFAC已為外匯基金設定以下投資目標：\n(a) 保存資本；\n(b) 確保整個貨幣基礎始終由高度流動的美元計價資產完全支持；\n(c) 確保有足夠的流動性用於維持貨幣和金融穩定；\n(d) 在滿足(a) — (c)的前提下，實現投資回報，有助於長遠維持基金的購買力。\n\n這些目標充分考慮了外匯基金的法定宗旨，並融入基金的投資組合結構及目標資產比例中。\n\n一般而言，外匯基金有兩個主要投資組合——後備組合（Backing Portfolio）和投資組合（Investment Portfolio）。後備組合持有高度流動的美元計價資產，以符合貨幣局制度下對貨幣基礎的完整支持。投資組合則主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織（OECD）成員國的債券與股票市場，以保存資產價值及長期購買力。整體來說，兩個組合的長期目標債券與股票的比例為72:28。在目標貨幣配置方面，81%的資產配置於美元和港元，其餘19%則配置於其他貨幣。\n\n為了更好管理風險並提升中長期回報，HKMA一直審慎且逐步地將外匯基金部分投資多元化，涉獵更多資產類別，包括新興市場及內地債券與股票、私募股權及海外投資房地產。新興市場及內地債券與股票持於投資組合中，而私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合（LTGP）持有。HKMA在LTGP下的投資資產淨值上限維持在外匯基金累計盈餘的三分之一。2015年底，LTGP下的投資市值總計1421億港元，其中私募股權91.3億港元，房地產50.8億港元，尚有投資承諾額1224億港元。\n\n於2007年成立的策略組合，持有為外匯基金策略性目的由政府收購的香港交易及結算所有限公司（HKEX）股份，因其特殊性並未納入基金投資績效評估。\n\n儲備管理\n\n投資流程\n\n外匯基金的投資流程建立在兩種資產配置決策之上——策略性資產配置與戰術性資產配置。策略性資產配置，反映在投資基準上，代表考量外匯基金投資目標的長期最佳資產配置。在策略性配置指引下，會進行戰術性配置以期超越基準，這通常意味着實際配置與基準配置不同。實際與基準之間的差異稱為「戰術偏差」。策略基準與戰術偏差限額由財經司司長在與EFAC協商後制定，戰術性決策由HKMA在授權下自主做出。在戰術偏差範圍內，投資組合經理可以根據短期市場動向調整頭寸。\n\n投資管理\n\n直接投資\n\nHKMA儲備管理處的員工直接管理約76%的外匯基金投資，包括整個後備組合和部分投資組合。投資組合包括投資於全球固定收益市場的資產，以及實施宏觀風險管理策略的衍生品套組Overlay。\n\n使用外部管理人\n\n除了自主管理資產外，HKMA亦在多個國際金融中心聘用外部基金經理，管理約24%的外匯基金資產，包括所有上市股票投資及其他專項資產。聘用外部管理人旨在利用市場上最頂尖的投資專業知識，捕捉多樣化的投資風格，並將市場資訊及知識轉移給內部專業人員。\n\n使用外部管理人的支出包括基金管理費和保管費、交易成本，以及扣繳稅與其他稅項。這些支出主要由市場因素決定，年度可能有所波動。\n\n風險管理與合規\n\n近年來金融市場的高度波動凸顯了風險管理的重要性。我們為內部與外部管理的投資組合制定了嚴格的控制及投資指引，並嚴密監督合規情況。運用風險控制工具評估正常及逆境市場條件下的市場風險。HKMA亦進行詳細的績效歸因分析，以充分發揮內外部管理人的投資技術。\n\n外匯基金績效\n\n2015年的金融市場\n\n2015年，全球金融市場波動劇烈。尤其股票市場經歷了異常的動盪。主要股票市場在上半年創出新高，但第三季度市場情緒因對中國大陸經濟增長的擔憂惡化，主要股市年內漲幅逆轉，錄得顯著的季度虧損。之後，隨著市場情緒改善，全球股票市場略有回升，但年底又再度惡化。由於與內地經濟緊密相關，2015年香港股市的表現不及其他主要股市。\n\n在國債市場方面，期待美國利率正常化與美國升息周期開始，長期美國國債收益率在2015年適度上升，但由於對全球經濟增長的擔憂、持續的全球通縮壓力以及地緣政治緊張局勢，市場情緒受到抑制。另一方面，歐洲短期政府債券收益率下降，甚至進入負利率區域，受歐洲央行積極寬鬆政策推動。\n\n在貨幣市場方面，美元在2015年持續走強，美元指數上漲約10%，預期美元政策正常化開始。歐元在第一季大幅貶值，創下1999年以來最大單季跌幅，原因是歐洲央行在一月份宣布量化寬鬆措施。另一方面，日圓在2015年基本持平於美元。\n\n2015年主要貨幣、債券與股票市場的表現見表格1。\n\n儲備管理\n\n外匯基金績效\n\n在金融市場劇烈波動和投資環境艱難的背景下，外匯基金2015年錄得儲備虧損158億港元，包括海外股票盈利71億港元；香港股票虧損50億港元；債券盈利159億港元；非港元資產的貨幣匯率負向折算效應449億港元；以及基金投資控股子公司的其他投資盈利111億港元。由於去年美元大幅升值，將外匯基金的非美元資產換算成港元時，貨幣折算匯兌負向效果難以避免。此外，策略組合亦錄得估值盈利22億港元。\n\n2015年底，外匯基金總資產達到3.4229兆港元。2015年的投資回報（不含策略組合）為-0.6%。雖然如此，與表現不佳的主要市場指數及整體投資基金界相比，外匯基金的虧損相對溫和。為應對惡化的投資環境，HKMA多年來採取了一系列防禦性措施，包括縮短債券組合的久期、增加現金持有量，並大幅削減非美元資產。我們亦加快投資多元化的步伐，尤其是經由LTGP的投資。這些措施增強了外匯基金的韌性，幫助減輕了部分潛在損失。\n\n基金從1994年到2015年的年度回報率見圖表1。表2展示了2015年的投資回報及基金於不同時間範圍的平均投資回報。過去三年的平均回報為1.2%，過去五年為1.8%，過去十年為3.3%，自1994年至今為5.0%。表3則顯示2015年12月31日基金資產的貨幣構成。\n\n圖表1 外匯基金投資回報（1994—2015）  \n1 投資回報的計算不包括策略組合的持倉。  \n2 綜合消費者物價指數的計算基於2009/2010年度系列。"}
{"en": "# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communications with the community and the market through the media, public education programmes, and various other channels to facilitate understanding of its policies and operations. In 2015, the HKMA improved corporate governance by supporting professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline, enhancing IT security, and realigning duties among senior management to help cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new programmes and systems and the increasing complexity of work.\n\n# ENGAGING THE COMMUNITY CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT\n\n# Media relations\n\nThe HKMA works closely with the media to improve transparency and promote public understanding of its policies and work. In 2015, 59 open media events were held, comprising 14 news conferences, 14 stand-up interviews and 31 other public functions. A further 43 media interviews were arranged, 325 bilingual press releases were issued and a substantial number of media enquiries were handled daily.\n\nIn addition, to enhance public understanding of the HKMA's key functions, two media tours were organised to the Hong Kong Note Printing Limited and Hong Kong Interbank Clearing Limited (HKICL) respectively to showcase Hong Kong's world-class note printing technologies and financial infrastructure. Educational workshops were conducted on the Currency Board system, renminbi business and the Exchange Fund for a more in-depth briefing for the media on these important subjects.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan (centre), and Executive Director (Monetary Management), Mr Howard Lee (right), inspect security features on banknotes during a media visit to the Hong Kong Note Printing Limited.\n\nAn automated cheque sorting demonstration during a media tour to HKICL.

The Service handled 9,078 enquiries in 2015. About half of these related to banking policies and regulations, notes and coins, and consumer banking issues. Notable examples included prudential measures for property mortgage loans, banking products and services, prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing, and the coin collection programme.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received since 2012 and Chart 2 provides a breakdown by nature of the enquiries in 2015.\n\nChart 1 Total number of public enquiries\n\n# Publications\n\nApart from the HKMA Annual Report, the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report, 4 issues of the Quarterly Bulletin, and released regular updates of the Monthly Statistical Bulletin over the past year to provide up-to-date and thematic information and analyses on monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. In addition, senior management of the HKMA published 14 inSight articles covering various topical and timely policy issues.\n\nThe HKMA Annual Report 2014 received a Bronze award in the “non-profit Making and Charitable Organisations” category in the Hong Kong Management Association’s 2015 Best Annual Reports Awards.\n\n# The HKMA website\n\nThe HKMA corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk), with over 50,000 pages in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, is the public access gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It also contains the Register of Securities Staff of Authorized Institutions (AIs) and the Register of AIs and Local Representative Offices, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance. With the implementation of the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, the website will also contain the register of stored value facility licensees under the Ordinance. Dedicated webpage and eye-catching short-cut links have been provided to draw the public's attention to important and timely information on issues such as reminders on the need to remain vigilant against bogus phone calls and the location of the coin carts in the coin collection programme.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\n# Public education programme\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre on the 55th Floor of Two International Finance Centre is an important resource for introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters. The Centre consists of the Exhibition Area and the Library, and is open to the public six days a week. The Exhibition Area introduces the work of the HKMA and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong. It includes reading materials and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong's monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nGuided tours of the Information Centre are organised for visitors. During the year, the Centre received more than 48,300 visitors and hosted over 630 quided tours for schools and other groups (Chart 3). Over 530,400 people have visited the Information Centre since it opened in December 2003.\n\nThe Library, situated next to the Exhibition Area, houses more than 23,000 books, journals and other publications for the detailed study of Hong Kong's monetary, banking and financial affairs and central banking topics. It also maintains an electronic register of AIs in Hong Kong as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nIn its ongoing programme to reach out to the community, the HKMA continued to organise public education seminars. In 2015, three seminars were held for some 2,300 secondary school students and teachers. Topics included the Linked Exchange Rate System, banknotes in Hong Kong, the smart use of credit cards and the Deposit Protection Scheme. More than 54,700 people have participated in the programme since its launch in 1998.\n\nChart 3 Types of group visits to the Information Centre\n\nYoung visitors learn about the development of money and banking in Hong Kong during a guided tour of the Information Centre.\n\nSecondary school students and teachers participate in a public education seminar.\n\n# HUMAN RESOURCES\n\nThe HKMA recruits, develops and maintains a highly professional workforce to support its policy objectives and respond flexibly to changing work priorities. While the HKMA is an integral part of the Government, it is able to employ staff on terms different from those of the civil service to attract personnel with the right experience and expertise. As a public organisation, the HKMA aims to maintain a lean and flexible structure and to redeploy staff resources to undertake new initiatives and meet increased workload.\n\n# Organisational changes\n\nFollowing the enactment of the payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, a new Retail Payment Oversight Division was formed under the Monetary Management Department (MMD) in December 2015 to carry out the HKMA’s new statutory duties in the licensing and day-to-day supervision of stored value facilities and other retail payment systems. To enhance synergy amongst departments and reprioritise staff resources in coping with the challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives as well as increasing workload and complexity of work, reshuffling of duties among a number of departments was planned in 2015 for implementation in early 2016. Details are as follows:\n\nThe Financial Infrastructure Department (FID) took over the administration of the Deposit Protection Scheme and the settlement function from the Enforcement Department (ENFD) and the Currency Division from MMD. It also took over from the Banking Departments certain banking-related work such as consumer education, directors’ development and enhanced competency framework for bank practitioners;\n\nThe External Department took over the market development function of MMD, while the latter will continue with its work relating to the Treasury Markets Association and financial benchmarks; and\n\nENFD took over the Anti-Money laundering (AML) and Financial Crime Risk Division from the Banking Supervision Department, and was retitled as Enforcement and AML Department.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\n# Staffing\n\nThe establishment of the HKMA in 2015 was 841. This is increased by 34 to 875 in 2016 (an increase of 4%) to ensure that sufficient resources are provided to cope with (i) the implementation of new legislation and initiatives, (ii) continuation of pilot projects proven necessary on an on-going basis, and (ii) the increasing complexity and volume of existing work. The new posts are deployed to the following functions:\n\nEnhancing banking and financial stability, which includes:\n\nstrengthening banking supervision work including on-site examination of banks' stress testing process, implementation of international banking standards and peer review exercises;\n\nstrengthening the supervision of banks' liquidity risk and cyber security risk management;\n\nimplementing the supervisory framework regarding over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives conducted through banks and approved money brokers under the newly effective OTC derivatives reporting and record-keeping rules;\n\nstrengthening supervisory and enforcement efforts in anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing;\n\ngearing up the planning and preparatory work for the implementation of the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Bill, which applies international standards to address the \"too big to fail\" problem of the financial industry;\n\npromoting capacity building in the banking sector through the development of a director empowerment programme for independent non-executive directors of banks to further improve the governance of banks and collaboration with the industry to promote enhanced competency frameworks for banking practitioners engaged in core areas of banking operations;\n\nstepping up the banking conduct policy and research capability in new banking, securities and insurance products;\n\nenhancing consumer protection and consumer education efforts; and\n\nstepping up the monitoring and analysis of developments in the onshore renminbi market and in the CNH market with a view to supporting the orderly operation of Hong Kong’s offshore renminbi market.\n\nStrengthening investment, risk management and legal support to the expanding investment activities associated with the establishment of the Future Fund and further diversification of the Exchange Fund’s investment products, and enhancing strategic asset allocation and investment processes in the light of an increasingly challenging investment environment.\n\nImplementing the new statutory regime which empowers the HKMA to regulate stored value facilities and retail payment systems under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance.\n\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nTemporary resources are deployed to meet other work demands. The HKMA transfers staff on secondment to other international or local organisations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Services Development Council to assist in activities or policy initiatives in which Hong Kong or the HKMA has an interest. Some staff members are deployed on a full-time or part-time basis to provide operational support to the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board and the Treasury Markets Association.\n\n# Remuneration policies and pay review mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary (FS) determines the pay and conditions of service for HKMA staff on the advice of the Governance Sub-Committee (GSC) through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC), taking into account the prevailing market rates and practices. Remuneration comprises a total cash package and a provident fund scheme, with minimal benefits in kind. The cash package consists of monthly fixed pay (or basic pay) and variable pay, which may be awarded to individual staff members as a lump sum once a year depending on performance.\n\nPay for HKMA staff is reviewed annually by the FS in the light of recommendations made to him by the GSC through EFAC, taking into account the GSC's assessment of the performance of the HKMA in the preceding year, the pay-survey findings of the financial sector conducted by independent human resources consultants and any other relevant factors. Special pay adjustments may be made from time to time for individual meritorious staff to maintain their pay competitiveness.\n\nAny approved annual adjustments to the fixed pay or any variable pay awards for the HKMA are distributed to individual staff based on their performance. Investment professionals in the HKMA are subject to a variable pay system that seeks to strengthen the linkage between their investment performance and remuneration award.

I conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards. Those standards require that I comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.\n\nAn audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the Monetary Authority, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.\n\nI believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit (continued)\n\n# Opinion\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2015, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance.\n\nDavid Sun \nDirector of Audit\n\n7 April 2016\n\nAudit Commission \n26th Floor \nImmigration Tower \n7 Gloucester Road \nWanchai, Hong Kong\n\n# Contents\n\nINCOME AND EXPENDITURE ACCOUNT\nSTATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nBALANCE SHEET\nATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY\nATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:\n\n1.

The principal activities of the Fund are safeguarding the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong and maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong's monetary and financial systems.\n\nThe assets of the Fund are managed as four portfolios: the Backing Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio and the Strategic Portolio. The assets of the Backing Portolio fully match the Monetary Base, under Hong Kong's Currency Board system. The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The Long-Term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments. The Strategic Portfolio holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited acquired by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) for the account of the Fund for strategic purposes. Operating segment information is set out in note 31.\n\n# 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n# 2.1 Statement of compliance\n\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with all applicable Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRSs), which is a collective term that includes all applicable individual Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, Hong Kong Accounting Standards (HKASs) and Interpretations issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), and accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong. A summary of the significant accounting policies adopted by the Fund and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) is set out below.\n\nThe HKICPA has issued certain new and revised HKFRSs that are first effective or available for early adoption for the current accounting period. Note 3 provides information on the changes, if any, in accounting policies resulting from initial adoption of these developments to the extent that they are relevant to the Group for the current and prior accounting periods reflected in these financial statements.\n\n# Exchange Fund – Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)\n\n(Amounts expressed in millions of Hong Kong dollars, unless otherwise stated.)\n\n# 2.2 Basis of preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe Group financial statements include the financial statements of the Group as well as the Group's interests in associates and joint ventures. The principal activities of the principal subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are shown in notes 16 and 17.\n\nThe measurement basis used in the preparation of the financial statements is historical cost except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair values as explained in the accounting policies set out below:\n\ntrading financial instruments (note 2.6.2.1);\nfinancial assets and financial liabilities designated at fair value (note 2.6.2.2); available-for-sale securities (note 2.6.2.5);\ngold (note 2.11); and\ninvestment properties (note 2.12).\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with HKFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nNote 18 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of investment properties. Note 37 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of financial instruments. There are no critical accounting judgements involved in the application of the Group's accounting policies except for the valuation of certain financial instruments as set out in note 2.5.\n\n# 2.3 Subsidiaries and non-controlling interests\n\nA subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. When assessing whether the Group has power, only substantive rights (held by the Group and other parties) are considered.\n\n# Exchange Fund – Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)\n\n(Amounts expressed in millions of Hong Kong dollars, unless otherwise stated.)\n\nAn investment in a subsidiary is consolidated into the Group financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.\n\nIntra-group balances, transactions and cash flows and any unrealised profits and losses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in full in preparing the Group financial statements.\n\nNon-controlling interests represent the equity in a subsidiary not attributable directly or indirectly to the Fund, and in respect of which the Group has not agreed any additional terms with the holders of those interests which would result in the Group as a whole having a contractual obligation in respect of those interests that meets the definition of a financial liability. Non-controlling interests are presented in the Group balance sheet within equity, separately from equity attributable to the owner of the Fund. Non-controlling interests in the results of the Group are presented on the face of the Group income and expenditure account and the Group statement of comprehensive income as an allocation of the surplus or deficit and total comprehensive income or loss for the year between non-controlling interests and the owner of the Fund.\n\nIn the balance sheet of the Fund, its investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less impairment losses, if any (note 2.14).\n\n# 2.4 Associates and joint ventures\n\nAn associate is an entity in which the Group has significant influence, but not control or joint control, over its management, through its power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions.\n", "zh": "交易基金\n\n審計司署長報告\n交易基金財務報表\n\n審計司署長報告\n\n審計委員會\n香港特別行政區政府\n\n獨立審計報告\n\n致財政司司長\n\n本人證明已審核2015年12月31日止年度的交易基金及其附屬公司（「集團」）財務報表，這些財務報表列於第134至222頁，包括交易基金及集團截至2015年12月31日的資產負債表、收入及支出帳、全面收益表、權益變動表及現金流量表，以及重要會計政策概要和其他說明資料。\n\n貨幣監管局就財務報表的責任\n\n貨幣監管局負責按照《交易基金條例》（第66章）第7條下首席行政官發布的指令及香港財務報告準則，編製公允反映財務狀況的財務報表，並建立必要的內部控制，使財務報表能免於重大錯誤陳述（無論是由欺詐或錯誤引起）。\n\n審計人的責任\n\n我的責任是根據審計工作對這些財務報表表達意見。我按照根據《交易基金條例》第7條由首席行政官發布的指令及審計委員會的審計準則進行審計。該等準則要求我遵循道德規範，規劃並執行審計工作，以取得合理的保證，確保財務報表是否在所有重大方面公允反映。\n\n審計包括執行程序以獲取關於財務報表中的金額及披露資料的審計證據。所選程序取決於審計判斷，包括評估重大錯報（由欺詐或錯誤引起）的風險。在進行該些風險評估時，審計員會考慮與編制公允反映財務狀況的財務報表相關的內部控制，以設計符合情況的審計程序，但並非為了對該等內部控制的有效性表達意見。審計亦包括評估所用會計政策的適當性及貨幣監管局所作會計估算的合理性，以及評估財務報表的整體呈現。\n\n我相信，我所取得的審計證據充足而適當，可作為我發表審計意見的基礎。\n\n審計司署長報告（續）\n\n意見\n\n我認為，這些財務報表在所有重大方面公允反映交易基金及集團截至2015年12月31日的財務狀況，以及其截至該日的財務績效和現金流，並已根據香港財務報告準則妥善編制，亦已依照《交易基金條例》第7條下首席行政官發布的指令正確編製。\n\n孫大衛\n審計司署長\n\n2016年4月7日\n\n審計委員會\n九龍尖沙咀金巴利道7號\n入境事務大樓26樓\n\n目錄\n\n收入及支出帳\n全面收益表\n資產負債表\n權益變動表\n現金流量表\n財務報表附註：\n\n1. 主要業務  \n2. 重要會計政策  \n3. 會計政策的變動  \n4. 收入及支出  \n5. 所得稅  \n6. 金融資產及金融負債分類  \n7. 現金及可用於即時支付的款項  \n8. 與銀行及其他金融機構的存款  \n9. 按公允價值定向的金融資產  \n10. 可出售金融證券  \n11. 衍生金融工具  \n12. 持有至到期證券  \n13. 放款組合  \n14. 黃金  \n15. 其他資產  \n16. 附屬公司权益  \n17. 準備及合資企業权益  \n18. 投資物業  \n19. 物業、廠房及設備  \n20. 债券證書、政府發行的貨幣券及流通的硬幣  \n21. 銀行體系結存  \n22. 銀行及其他金融機構的存款  \n23. 財政儲備存款  \n24. 香港特區政府資金及法定機構的存款  \n25. 交易基金票據及票據發行  \n26. 銀行貸款  \n27. 其他債務證券發行  \n28. 其他負債  \n29. 權益  \n30. 現金及現金等價物分析（於現金流量表中）  \n31. 營運分部資料  \n32. 抵押資產  \n33. 承諾事項  \n34. 或有負債  \n35. 重大關聯方交易  \n36. 財務風險管理  \n37. 金融工具的公平值衡量  \n38. 非調整性結算後事件  \n39. 2015年12月31日結束年度已發佈但尚未生效的修訂、新標準及解釋對潛在影響  \n40. 財務報表批准\n\n交易基金 — 收入及支出帳\n\n截至2015年12月31日止年度\n\n第140至222頁的附註構成本財務報表的一部分。\n\n交易基金 — 全面收益表  \n\n截至2015年12月31日止年度\n\n第140至222頁的附註構成本財務報表的一部分。\n\n交易基金 — 資產負債表\n\n截至2015年12月31日\n\n陳國強\n貨幣監管局長\n2016年4月7日\n\n第140至222頁的附註構成本財務報表的一部分。\n\n交易基金 — 權益變動表\n\n截至2015年12月31日止年度\n\n第140至222頁的附註構成本財務報表的一部分。\n\n交易基金 — 現金流量表\n\n截至2015年12月31日止年度\n\n交易基金 — 現金流量表（續）\n\n截至2015年12月31日止年度\n\n第140至222頁的附註構成本財務報表的一部分。\n\n交易基金 — 財務報表附註\n\n（除非另有說明，金額以百萬港元為單位。）\n\n1. 主要業務\n\n貨幣監管局根據由財政司司長委任的授權，作為交易基金（基金）的控制人，根據《交易基金條例》（第66章）管理基金。基金的主要業務是保障香港貨幣的匯率價值及維持香港貨幣金融系統的穩定與完整。\n\n基金資產以四個投資組合進行管理：支持組合、投資組合、長期增長組合及策略性組合。支持組合的資產完全符合貨幣基數，根據香港的貨幣局制度。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作暨發展組織（OECD）成員國的債券及股票市場。長期增長組合持有私募股權與房地產投資。策略性組合持有由香港特區政府代表基金取得的香港交易所及結算有限公司股份，出於策略目的。營運分部資料載於第31號附註。\n\n2. 重要會計政策\n\n2.1 遵守標準\n\n這些財務報表乃根據所有適用的香港財務報告準則（HKFRSs）編製，該術語包括由香港會計師公會（HKICPA）頒布的所有個別的香港財務報告準則（HKFRSs）、香港會計準則（HKASs）及詮釋。如有關的財務政策細節，見以下摘要。\n\nHKICPA 已發布某些新修訂的 HKFRS，這些準則在本期首次生效或可供提前採用。第3號附註提供有關首次採用這些準則產生會計政策變動的資訊（若該等變動與本期及前期的反映相關）。\n\n2.2 財務報表的編製基礎\n\n集團的財務報表包括集團及其在合資企業和聯營企業中的權益。主要子公司、合資及聯營企業的主要業務見第16和17號附註。\n\n財務報表的衡量基礎為歷史成本，但以下資產及負債按公允價值列示，詳情請參考下述會計政策：\n\n- 交易金融工具（見2.6.2.1）；\n- 按公允價值定向的金融資產及金融負債（見2.6.2.2）；  \n- 可供出售金融證券（見2.6.2.5）；\n- 黃金（見2.11）；\n- 投資物業（見2.12）。\n\n根據 HKFRSs 編製財務報表需要管理層作出判斷、估計及假設，這些會影響政策的應用及資產、負債、收入與支出的金額。該等估計及假設基於經驗及其他各種情況下被認為合理的因素，構成本司採用判斷估值的基礎，特別是那些未能由其他來源直接得出的資料。實際結果或會與預估數不同。\n\n這些估計及相關假設會持續被審查。修訂會計估計時若只影響當期，將在當期反映；如果同時影響本期及未來期，則在修訂當期及未來期反映。\n\n第18號附註闡述有關投資物業的公允價值估算假設；第37號附註則涉及金融工具的公允價值估算。除第2.5號附註所述金融工具估值外，沒有涉及關鍵的會計判斷。\n\n2.3 子公司與非控股權益\n\n子公司是由集團控制的實體。集團控制一個實體，意味着它有權利取得變動的回報或有義務承擔義務，並能通過其對該實體的控制權影響這些回報。在判斷集團是否擁有控制權時，只考慮具有實質性權利的部分（由集團及其他方持有）。\n\n子公司在取得控制權之日起，直至控制權終止，會被合併入集團財務報表。\n\n集團內的餘額、交易及現金流，以及由內部交易產生的未實現利得或虧損，在編製合併財務報表時予以全部抵銷。\n\n非控股權益代表在子公司內不直接或間接歸屬於基金的權益，亦未與持有人訂有會導致集團整體對該等權益承擔合同義務的額外條款。非控股權益在集團資產負債表內作為權益的一部分獨立呈示，與歸屬基金所有者的權益分開。在集團的損益及全面收益表中，非控股權益的結果表現為盈餘或虧損的分配。\n\n在基金的資產負債表中，子公司投資以成本扣除減值損失（如有）列示（見2.14）。\n\n2.4 合資企業及聯營企業\n\n合資企業是指集團具有重大影響，卻非控制或共同控制的實體，經由其參與財務及營運決策的權力實現。"}

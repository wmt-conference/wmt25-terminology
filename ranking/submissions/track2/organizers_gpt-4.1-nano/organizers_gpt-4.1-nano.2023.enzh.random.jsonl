{"en": "# Resilience in the face of adversity\n\nReverberations from slowing global economic growth amid a “high for longer” interest rate environment and intensifying geopolitical tensions — not just stemming from the RussiaUkraine war and China-US tensions but also the outbreak of conflict in the Middle East — were the key themes for the financial markets in 2023. The March banking turmoil in the US and Europe, the most significant system-wide banking stress since the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, weighed further on market sentiment. Major economies grappled with the harsh realities of tightened monetary conditions and greater uncertainty over the inflationary path and interest rate outlook. Adding to the uncertainty was the pace of Mainland China’s economic recovery, which was slower than general market expectations.\n\nWith volatility and unpredictability becoming the “new normal” in financial markets, Hong Kong has again demonstrated its well-known ability to adapt, showing remarkable resilience. Since the city’s full-fledged post-COVID reopening last year, much work has been done to attract people back to our dynamic city and reconnect them with Hong Kong. The HKMA has contributed by hosting a series of large-scale international events such as the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit and conferences with the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), which showcased our vibrant city and helped send the message worldwide that Hong Kong, as a major international financial centre (IFC), is open for business and remains the centre of action and innovation. There are clear signs of gradual recovery, driven by an encouraging revival of inbound tourism and improved private consumption, also supported by a resilient labour market and the various support measures rolled out by the Government. For 2023 as a whole, Hong Kong’s gross domestic product growth bounced back to 3.2% from negative territory in 2022.\n\nThe HKMA entered its fourth decade in 2023. The past 30 years have seen the dynamics of the economy and the financial markets change drastically, with technology driving advances beyond anyone’s wildest imagination. The invaluable experience and wisdom gained over the past three decades have enabled us to face the future with confidence. Despite macroeconomic headwinds and an uncertain external environment, the HKMA will continue to uphold its mandate of safeguarding monetary and banking stability in Hong Kong, and will actively pursue developmental opportunities to anchor that stability and cement the city’s status as a leading IFC.\n\nFormer and current Financial Secretaries of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Chief Executives of HKMA at a gathering to celebrate the HKMA’s 30th anniversary: (from left) Mr Joseph Yam, Mr Henry Tang, Mr Donald Tsang, Mr Paul Chan, Mr Eddie Yue, Mr Antony Leung, Mr John Tsang, and Mr Norman Chan\n\n# LERS — Weathering the storms\n\nLast year marked the 40th anniversary of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), a staunch pillar supporting Hong Kong’s strong and stable monetary and financial systems. Four decades of transparent and effective operation have nurtured confidence in the LERS and its credibility in the market. Throughout the year, the Hong Kong dollar stayed within the Convertibility Zone and the Hong Kong dollar market operated smoothly, reflecting the strong market confidence in the LERS, a confidence also shared and expressed by the International Monetary Fund and global market players.\n\nBehind this confidence lie the HKMA’s proactive efforts in public and market engagements, along with effective surveillance. We spared no effort during the year in communicating with key stakeholders to foster a clear understanding of the functioning of the LERS, which is all the more important in times of volatility, be it stemming from economic stress or political uncertainties. We also strengthened surveillance of our monetary system, leveraging the use of datasets from the trade repository and expanded granular data from banks, as well as advanced data analytics and artificial intelligence, to enhance our capability, enabling more timely and comprehensive analysis of financial stability and macro-prudential surveillance.\n\n# Banking system — A major source of stability\n\nDespite a multitude of challenges including the high-interestrate environment, persistent geopolitical tensions and a challenging credit landscape, Hong Kong’s banking system remained stable throughout the year, underpinned by strong capital and liquidity buffers.\n\nAs at the end of 2023, the consolidated total capital ratio of local banks stood at 21.1%, well above the international minimum requirement of 8%. The Liquidity Coverage Ratio of large banks edged up to 178.6% as of the fourth quarter of 2023, likewise well above the statutory minimum requirement of 100%. While the classified loan ratio increased slightly from 1.40% at the end of 2022 to 1.56% at the end of 2023, it remained below the long-term historical average of 2.0%. The increase was mainly driven by exposures to Mainland privately-owned enterprise (POE) property developers; but such exposure levels were generally well-contained as a result of banks’ prudent credit risk management over the years, and the overall asset quality of the banking sector remained sound.\n\nWhat caught most market players by surprise in 2023 was unquestionably the banking turmoil in the US spilling over to Europe, which created a level of system-wide banking stress unseen since the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. The HKMA remained on high alert as the situation unfolded and took a number of precautionary actions to limit any potential adverse spillover effects on confidence in the local banking and financial systems. This, coupled with the strong capital and liquidity buffers maintained by banks in Hong Kong, meant that our banking sector was largely unaffected by the turmoil, remaining resilient even as the global financial markets were roiled. In the aftermath of this episode, the HKMA conducted a comprehensive internal review with a view to drawing out lessons for the local banking sector and strengthening the HKMA’s supervisory effectiveness and agility to handle a banking crisis should one occur.\n\nWhile prudent credit risk management is important, we have always reiterated our supervisory expectation for banks to be mindful of the need to support the real economy. As the orderly exit from the banking sector’s Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme commenced in July 2023 with the economic effects of COVID-19 receding, the HKMA worked closely with banks to ensure a gradual and smooth transition to normal loan repayment with flexibility for those borrowers who continued to be under pressure. Earlier this year, recognising that some small and medium-sized enterprises are still facing challenges in their operations despite the end of the pandemic, nine new measures were rolled out to further assist them in obtaining financing from banks.\n\nHaving reviewed the risks associated with the local property market in the context of banks’ property lending, the HKMA announced in July 2023 the first relaxation of the countercyclical macroprudential measures for residential properties since their introduction in 2009. This relaxation increased the loan-to-value ratio cap for most residential mortgage loans as well as for financing for property development and investment. It was later followed by suspension of the interest rate stress testing requirement in early 2024.\n\nThe HKMA’s supervision of financial institutions has been moving with the times. With recent years having seen a sharp global increase in fraud cases, we have considerably stepped up our efforts to counter new fraud tactics by introducing a holistic set of measures to protect bank customers. These include enhancing information sharing between banks and with law enforcement agencies; strengthening the monitoring of suspicious transactions (including implementation of real-time fraud monitoring and tightened payment card authentication); empowering customers to have more controls on their payment cards; and educating customers and raising public awareness of frauds with the launch of the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter, as well as a pre-transaction alert mechanism which warns users if a higher-risk Faster Payment System (FPS) transaction is spotted.\n\nIn light of a proliferation of innovative and digital banking products and services, the HKMA has worked with the banking industry to step up consumer and investor protection more broadly and enhance the banks’ operational and cyber resilience, as well as their collective defences against systemic cyber events. At the same time, all major banks have considerably strengthened their capabilities to respond to, and recover from, destructive ransomware attacks. The HKMA together with the industry has also pursued various consumer data infrastructure projects, such as the “Credit Data Smart” pilot programme to enhance consumer credit reference services, and taken forward a cross-boundary credit reference initiative to facilitate crossboundary financing activities by corporates.\n\nFintech and digitalisation can bring about enormous opportunities when the risk is properly managed. Leveraging earlier success in facilitating the uptake of Regtech, the HKMA, with the support of the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Insurance Authority, published a new Fintech Promotion Roadmap in August 2023 to promote further development of fintech by financial institutions in five focus areas — Wealthtech, Insurtech, Greentech, artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology. We anticipate local regulators continuing to collaborate and work closely together with their industry sectors in the coming years in order for the Hong Kong financial industry as a whole to keep abreast and reap the benefits of dynamic fintech development.\n\n# Hong Kong as an IFC — The centre of action and innovation\n\nIn 2023, we fully emerged from the pandemic. Hong Kong was not only back in business but its position as one of the world’s leading IFCs was further underscored by the return of global investors and our strengthened global network. Domestically, we took the opportunity of the 30th anniversary of the HKMA’s establishment to host a series of large-scale, international events with top-level participation from the global financial and banking community to demonstrate Hong Kong’s vibrancy and to send a clear message that Hong Kong as an IFC remained relevant and indispensable to global investors and financial institutions seeking growth and innovation. Of particular note was the return of the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit, held in November, which attracted to our city more than 350 international and regional leaders from some 160 global financial institutions. Other high-powered events hosted in Hong Kong included a meeting of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) and two HKMA-BIS Conferences which were among the largest gatherings of central bank governors and banking supervisors of the year. These events attest to the global financial sector’s commitment to and confidence in Hong Kong.\n\nExternally, 2023 was also a year in which Hong Kong proactively reached out to strengthen its connections with traditional markets including the US and Europe, as well as new destinations such as those in the Middle East. We met with peer regulators and top management of global financial institutions in these markets to both apprise and update them on the opportunities in Hong Kong and the Mainland, while seeking out new collaboration opportunities for Hong Kong.\n\nTo complement these engagement efforts, we actively contributed to the work of international and regional forums by taking up certain leadership roles. During the year, I accepted invitations to chair the BIS Meeting of Governors from Major Emerging Market Economies and to co-chair the Financial Stability Board (FSB)’s Regional Consultative Group for Asia. My colleagues are also chairing or co-chairing a number of other important groupings under the Basel Committee, the Financial Action Task Force, and the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks, to name a few. The HKMA’s leadership at many regional and international forums is a recognition of Hong Kong’s expertise and contribution to international central banking and regulatory efforts in the pursuit of global monetary and financial stability, as well as Hong Kong’s importance as an IFC.\n\nTo build on the above accomplishments, we must position ourselves as a forward-looking IFC, staying ahead of the curve to ensure our ongoing competitiveness. We have identified three long-term trends in the coming years that will shape our future: namely the continued opening-up of the Mainland, the development of green and sustainable finance and the deployment of fintech. We will continue to support the development of our financial markets to capture the opportunities from these long-term trends while positioning our financial platform to provide leading services to attract more businesses to Hong Kong.

{"en": "# Highlights of 2023\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nDespite a challenging external environment, the Hong Kong economy stages a positive growth in 2023, driven by revivals in inbound tourism and domestic demand. The labour market continues to improve alongside the economic recovery, while inflation remains moderate. Economic activities for 2024 are expected to recover further at a moderate pace, although the outlook is clouded by multiple external uncertainties.\n\nThe banking sector in Hong Kong remains sound in 2023, supported by strong capital and liquidity buffers. Asset quality remains at a healthy level.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nAmid market expectations of a “high for longer” US policy rate, the Hong Kong dollar mostly trades on the weak side of the Convertibility Zone in 2023, with the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking being triggered eight times between mid-February and early May. The Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets remain stable, and continue to trade in a smooth and orderly manner.\n\n2023 marks the 40th anniversary of the Linked Exchange Rate System. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, the Linked Exchange Rate System has helped Hong Kong weather a succession of shocks and crises in the past four decades, demonstrating the system’s resilience and robustness.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA responds swiftly to the March banking turmoil in the US and Europe — from managing the ripple effects to completing an internal review drawing lessons for the local banking sector, while maintaining its focus on the credit, liquidity and market risk management of banks. In light of escalating cyber threats and increasing use of technology services provided by third parties, the HKMA also works closely with banks to enhance their operational and cyber resilience.\n\nThe HKMA enhances consumer protection on payment cards, and through further revision of the Code of Banking Practice as well as the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter. The HKMA works with fellow regulators on a balanced regulatory regime for virtual asset-related activities, streamlines the selling process for sophisticated professional investors, introduces enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Pilot Scheme, and commences supervision of trust business. A pilot programme on consumer credit reference services under “Credit Data Smart” is also launched.\n\nThe HKMA’s efforts in anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism reflect a commitment to targeting the highest threats under a risk-based approach. To address increasing digital fraud, the HKMA has strengthened ecosystem collaboration through the launch of real-time fraud monitoring, enhanced information sharing between banks and with law enforcement agencies, intensified public education, and launched a new pre-transaction alert mechanism when using the Faster Payment System. In parallel, supervisory technology capabilities have been advanced through the Macro Analytics pilot scheme.\n\nThe HKMA makes good progress on implementing international supervisory standards locally, including those on capital adequacy and disclosure, and makes notable efforts in enhancing capacity building in the banking sector.\n\nThe HKMA also advances its work to ensure a credible resolution regime, including developing a new resolution standard on accessing critical financial market infrastructures, and completing a review on the implementation of loss-absorbing capacity policy standards.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\nThe successful conclusion of the second Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit and the HKMA-BIS High-Level Conference demonstrates the global financial sector’s commitment to and confidence in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA works closely with its Mainland and Hong Kong counterparts to deepen and widen the mutual access between the Hong Kong and Mainland financial markets. This includes enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Scheme, designation of additional market makers for Southbound Trading under Bond Connect, the successful launch of Northbound Trading of Swap Connect, and the roll-out of the HKD-RMB Dual Counter Model and the Dual Counter Market Making Programme, all of which are effective in solidifying Hong Kong’s status as a global hub for offshore renminbi business.\n\nOn strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, notable progress is made in areas including bond issuance, asset and wealth management, green and sustainable finance, and corporate treasury centres.\n\nThe HKMA continues to make significant progress on various fronts of the “Fintech 2025” strategy. Project mBridge enters the Minimum Viable Product development phase, Phase 1 of the e-HKD Pilot Programme is completed, and Commercial Data Interchange sees increasing usage and the successful linkage with Government data source. Moreover, a new Fintech Promotion Roadmap is announced to further develop Wealthtech, Insurtech, Greentech, artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology in the banking sector. Meanwhile, the Faster Payment System marks its fifth anniversary and continues to see expanded adoption and enhancements including new functionalities like the linkage with Thailand’s PromptPay for cross-border QR payment. Significant progress is also made in relation to developing a regulatory regime for stablecoin issuers, with a public consultation paper published for gathering views on the legislative proposal.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\nDespite a volatile and challenging investment environment, the Exchange Fund manages to achieve a decent investment income of HK$226.0 billion, representing an investment return of 5.5%.\n\nThe HKMA continues its efforts on asset diversification and responsible investing.

{"en": "# Priorities for 2024 and Beyond\n\nEntering 2024, the Hong Kong economy is expected to continue to recover at a moderate pace, riding on the ongoing revival of inbound tourism, public infrastructure projects and stable private consumption. However, the external environment is fraught with risks and uncertainties, especially those relating to the future US policy rate path, the global growth prospects, and the evolving geopolitical tensions. That said, Hong Kong’s financial system remains well-positioned to weather adverse shocks given its resilience and ample buffers built up over the years.\n\nThe HKMA attaches great importance to safeguarding Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. Looking ahead, we will stay vigilant in the face of the uncertain macroeconomic environment, seeking to promptly identify emerging risks and respond to them in an agile manner. At the same time, we will seek opportunities and create policy headroom to help further enhance Hong Kong’s status as a leading international financial centre. In managing the Exchange Fund in this challenging investment environment, we will continue to invest prudently, while remaining flexible, taking defensive measures as appropriate, and maintaining a high degree of liquidity.\n\n# Stability and integrity of the financial system\n\nThe global economic uncertainties of recent years look set to continue in 2024. The HKMA will keep abreast of latest developments and stay vigilant against potential risks, with the aim of upholding the resilience and stability of the financial system, which are essential for the ongoing provision of critical financial services that support the functioning of the Hong Kong economy.\n\n# Staying vigilant against potential risks\n\nLooking into 2024, global financial markets could experience volatility as a result of uncertainties surrounding the US monetary policy outlook, evolving geopolitical risks, and an uneven global economic recovery. 2024 is also a key election year as many major elections are scheduled to be held across the world. The outcome of these elections could further increase market uncertainties. Nevertheless, Hong Kong’s financial system is well-positioned to withstand adverse shocks given its resilience and buffers built up over the years. The HKMA also has the capability, the resources and the commitment to safeguard Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nThe HKMA will continue its efforts to closely monitor any risks and vulnerabilities arising in the domestic and external environments, and will deploy appropriate measures where necessary to maintain Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. We will also conduct research into issues affecting the Hong Kong economy, assessing and addressing any potential risks associated with these issues.\n\n# Maintaining banking stability\n\nIn 2023, new geopolitical tensions across the world broke out while others remained unresolved, contributing to political uncertainty and instability that looks set to continue into 2024. Economic pressures in the form of high interest rates were a feature of the global landscape, and rates remain high entering 2024. Within the banking sector, the continued drive towards digitalisation and the implementation of new technology, including artificial intelligence, have brought many advantages but are also posing new operational and cyber security risks as well as supervisory challenges. In such a volatile political, economic and technological landscape, the HKMA strives to ensure banks’ ability to withstand shocks through its ongoing supervisory efforts. At the same time, we will continue to enhance and refine our banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account technological developments, changes in customer expectations, as well as international standards and best practices.\n\n# A risk-based supervisory focus\n\n# Credit, liquidity and market risks\n\nIn light of the increasingly challenging macroeconomic landscape, a special focus of the HKMA will be on monitoring the asset quality of authorized institutions (AIs) and assessing the effectiveness of their credit risk management and controls, particularly with respect to loan classification and provisioning practices and problem loans management. We will also maintain close dialogue with the banking and commercial sectors with a view to ensuring that AIs are striking an appropriate balance between undertaking prudent credit risk management and fulfilling their financial intermediation function throughout economic cycles. In particular, we will follow up with banks through the Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism on the nine new measures rolled out in March 2024 to assist small and medium-sized enterprises in obtaining financing from banks.\n\nUncertainties in the global economic outlook as well as elevated geopolitical tensions may increase the volatility of both asset prices and cross-border fund flows. The HKMA will make vigilance a priority, and will continue to effectively supervise the liquidity and market risk management of AIs.\n\n# Follow-up actions on lessons drawn from the 2023 banking turmoil\n\nThe HKMA will implement the follow-up actions identified in the internal review that it undertook in response to the 2023 banking turmoil in the US and Europe. These are actions that will further strengthen supervisory effectiveness and enhance its ability to handle a banking crisis should one arise. They include enhancing the risk capture of AIs’ interest rate risk in the banking book in the context of the HKMA’s supervisory review process, improving the preparedness of AIs for dealing with liquidity stresses given the continuing digitalisation of banking services, streamlining the HKMA’s crisis management processes, and further enhancing interagency and cross-border supervisory co-ordination.\n\n# Operational and technology risk\n\nThe HKMA will continue to monitor AIs’ progress towards achieving full compliance with the HKMA Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module OR-2 on “Operational Resilience”, and assess and benchmark banks’ tolerance limits for plausible disruptions, with a view to enhancing the overall resilience of the banking system. With respect to cyber risk, we will oversee a new round of self-assessments by AIs under the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 and monitor AIs’ implementation of a secure tertiary data backup to enhance their data recovery capabilities if faced with destructive cyber attacks.\n\nGiven the accelerating pace of digitalisation in banking operations, the HKMA will keep a close watch on emerging risks arising from the use of advanced technologies such as generative artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology. We will also collaborate with banks and other relevant stakeholders in operating an agile and pre-emptive mechanism to counter the growing trend of digital fraud.\n\n# Combatting money laundering and terrorist financing\n\nIn 2024, to uphold the integrity of the banking system and build customer confidence, the HKMA will target high-risk areas and prioritise risk-based regulatory updates, including issuing guidance to support an effective, risk-based implementation of changes to requirements for politically exposed persons, and supporting the implementation of the regulatory regime for stablecoin issuers. We will also issue guidance to help AIs optimise their transaction monitoring systems and to promote the responsible use of artificial intelligence, and focus on controls targeting high-end money laundering through our thematic work. To strengthen the ecosystem response to digital fraud and reduce losses to victims, we will further consult the public and the industry on a proposal to expand the scope of bank-to-bank information sharing from corporate accounts to personal accounts and, based on the feedback received, pursue necessary legislative amendments. We will move to a full build of Macro Analytics 3.0 by pooling data relevant to anti-money laundering across multiple banks and interfacing this with existing ecosystem fraud analysis. This will deliver more rapid cross-bank responses and further enhance our datadriven anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism supervision, enabling us to take quicker, more decisive action against systemic money laundering and terrorist financing risks.\n\n# Wealth management and Mandatory Provident Fundrelated businesses\n\nIn 2024, the HKMA will step up both its on-site examinations and off-site surveillance of AIs’ conduct in relation to wealth management and the selling of securities, investment products, and insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses. More specifically, we will focus on Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) business, digital distribution and advisory platforms, virtual asset (VA)-related products, long term insurance products and premium financing activities, taking into account the latest market developments as well as evolving international standards.\n\nThe HKMA will communicate closely with fellow regulators and the banking industry to provide guidance on regulatory standards in relation to the sale of investment, insurance and MPF products as appropriate. In particular, to support the sustainable and responsible development of the VA sector, we will continue to work with the Government and fellow regulators to ensure that the regulatory regime in place for the VA sector is robust, comprehensive and well-balanced.\n\nThe HKMA will facilitate and monitor the industry’s implementation of enhancements to Cross-boundary WMC, and continue to engage with the industry and relevant regulatory authorities in order to further enhance the scheme. We will also continue to work with fellow regulators and the industry to streamline the selling process for investment products, and will consolidate and clarify guidance, as appropriate, to facilitate industry compliance. In addition to trust business, we will also commence the supervision of new Type 13 regulated activity under the Securities and Futures Ordinance for AIs providing depositary services for collective investment schemes authorised by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), which will come into operation on 2 October 2024.\n\n# Oversight of financial market infrastructures\n\nThe HKMA aims to promote the safety and efficiency of the financial market infrastructures (FMIs) under its oversight in accordance with the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO), the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMI) and the various guidance issued by the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI). We will continue to participate in the CPMI-IOSCO1 PFMI implementation monitoring and assessment exercise, and in other international working groups to discuss the implementation of new and innovative FMI-related initiatives. We will also participate in the work of international standard-setting bodies, and will review and strengthen our oversight requirements as appropriate to reflect the latest international practices as well as market and technology developments.\n\n# Policy development\n\nThe HKMA will continue to strengthen and refine its banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account international standards and best practices.\n\n# Implementation of Basel standards in Hong Kong\n\nThe proposed amendments to the Banking (Capital) Rules (BCR) and the Banking (Disclosure) Rules (BDR) for implementing the Basel III final reform package (Final Package) are expected to take effect on 1 January 2025 following the passage of the amended Rules in the Legislative Council. In 2024, the HKMA will continue to prepare the supporting guidance, banking returns and standard disclosure templates and tables needed to facilitate the application of the Rules. In particular, we plan to:\n- consult the industry in the second quarter of 2024 on the revisions to the SPM module CA-B-3 on “Countercyclical Capital Buffer (CCyB)–Geographic Allocation of Private Sector Credit Exposures” and Return MA(BS)25 “Quarterly reporting on the Countercyclical Capital Buffer”, reflecting the consequential changes arising from the implementation of the Final Package and the revised Return of International Banking Statistics; and\n- finalise the package for effecting the reporting-only requirement for the new standards on market and credit valuation adjustment risks, which starts on 1 July 2024.\n\nThose parts of the proposed amendments to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules (BELR) and the Banking (Liquidity) Rules (BLR) that are largely consequential to the implementation of the Final Package under the amended BCR are also targeted to take effect on 1 January 2025. The HKMA plans to finalise the proposed consequential amendments to the related regulatory returns in 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, with a new standard on the prudential treatment of banks’ crypto-asset exposures and subsequent targeted revisions to the standard having been issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December 2022 and December 2023 respectively, local implementation of the standard is planned for 2025. The HKMA will examine the need for potential legislative amendments to various sets of rules, including the BCR, the BDR, the BELR and the BLR, and conduct the statutory consultation on the necessary rule amendments in the first half of 2025.\n\n# Other supervisory policies and risk management guidelines\n\nThe HKMA plans to update a number of SPM modules in response to lessons learned from the banking turmoil in the US and Europe of March 2023, as well as developments in regulatory requirements and international standards. These modules include:\n", "zh": "# 2024年及其後的工作重點\n\n進入2024年，香港經濟預計將在適度的步伐中持續復甦，得益於入境旅遊、公共基建項目和私營消費的復甦。然而，外部環境充滿風險與不確定性，尤其是與未來美國政策利率走向、全球經濟增長前景及變化中的地緣政治緊張局勢有關。儘管如此，香港的金融系統仍處於良好位置，能夠抵禦不利沖擊，這得益於其韌性及多年累積的充足儲備。\n\n香港金融管理局重視維持香港的貨幣及金融穩定。展望未來，我們將保持警惕，密切關注宏觀經濟環境的變化，及時識別新興風險並靈活應對。同時，我們將尋找機遇並創造政策空間，進一步鞏固香港作為國際金融中心的地位。在管理外匯基金方面，面對挑戰重重的投資環境，我們將繼續謹慎投資，並保持彈性，採取必要的防禦措施，並維持高水平的流動性。\n\n# 金融系統的穩定與誠信\n\n近年來的全球經濟不確定性預計將在2024年持續。香港金融管理局將密切追蹤最新動態，保持警惕潛在風險，並致力於維護金融系統的韌性和穩定，這對於支持香港經濟正常運作的重要金融服務的持續提供至關重要。\n\n# 密切留意潛在風險\n\n展望2024年，全球金融市場可能因美國貨幣政策前景的不確定性、地緣政治風險的演變及全球經濟復甦的曲折而波動。2024年也是重要的選舉年份，全球多個國家都將舉行重要選舉，選舉結果或將進一步增加市場不確定性。儘管如此，香港的金融系統憑藉其韌性及多年的積累，同樣能夠抵禦不利沖擊。香港金融管理局亦具備能力、資源及承諾，以保障香港的貨幣及金融穩定。\n\n我們將繼續密切監控國內外環境中出現的風險及潛在脆弱性，並在必要時採取適當措施，以維持香港的貨幣與金融穩定。同時，我們亦將就影響香港經濟的議題展開研究，評估並應對與之相關的潛在風險。\n\n# 保障銀行穩定\n\n2023年，全球新地緣政治緊張局勢爆發，另一些則未得到解決，帶來政治上的不確定與動盪，預計這種狀況將持續到2024年。全球經濟的通脹壓力以高利率表現出來，且高利率狀況將延續到2024年。在銀行業方面，數位化的持續推進及新技術的應用（包括人工智能）帶來許多優勢，但同時也帶來新的運營與網絡安全風險以及監管挑戰。在如此波動的政治、經濟與科技局勢下，香港金融管理局致力於確保銀行具備抵禦沖擊的能力，並將持續強化監管措施。我們亦會根據科技發展、客戶期望的變化，以及國際標準與最佳實踐，持續優化並完善我們的銀行監管框架與政策。\n\n# 以風險為本的監管重點\n\n# 信貸、流動性和市場風險\n\n面對日益挑戰的宏觀經濟環境，香港金融管理局將重點監控批准機構（AIs）的資產質量，以及評估其信貸風險管理與控制的有效性，特別關注貸款分類、撥備計算及壞賬管理。同時，我們將與銀行及商業界保持密切對話，以確保AIs在經濟周期中在審慎的信貸風險管理與履行其金融中介職能之間保持適當的平衡。特別是，我們將通過銀行業中小企業貸款協調機制，跟進2024年3月推出的九項新措施，以協助中小企獲取融資。\n\n由於全球經濟前景不確定性增加及地緣政治緊張的升高，資產價格及跨境資金流動的波動性或會擴大。香港金融管理局將持續保持警惕，並有效監督AIs的流動性與市場風險管理。\n\n# 對2023年銀行動盪經驗的後續行動\n\n香港金融管理局將執行其內部檢討中確定的後續行動，以進一步鞏固監管效能，並提升其處理銀行危機的能力，包括強化對銀行賬面利率風險的監管、改善銀行面對數位化背景下的流動性壓力的應對準備、簡化危機管理流程，以及進一步強化跨機構及跨境監管協調。\n\n# 運營與科技風險\n\n香港金融管理局將持續監察AIs在完整落實《監管政策手冊》關於“運營韌性”（OR-2）模組的進展，評估並設定銀行面對合理中斷的容忍限度，以增強整體銀行體系的韌性。關於網絡風險，我們將監督AIs進行新一輪的自我評估（Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0），並追蹤其實施安全第三方數據備份，以提升其在遭受破壞性網絡攻擊時的數據恢復能力。\n\n鑑於銀行業務數位化的加速，我們要密切關注由生成性人工智能及分布式賬本技術等先進技術引發的新風險。我們亦將與銀行及其他相關方合作，建立靈活及先發制人的機制，以應對日益嚴重的數位詐騙趨勢。\n\n# 打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集\n\n在2024年，為維護銀行系統的誠信及建立客戶信心，香港金融管理局將針對高風險領域，優先進行風險為本的監管更新，包括發布指引支援對政治暴露人士相關規定的風險基礎實施，以及支持穩定幣發行人監管制度的落實。我們亦將發布指引，協助AIs優化交易監測系統，並推動負責任使用人工智能，專注於高端洗錢控制的專題工作。為加強數位詐騙的生態系統應對，並減少受害者損失，我們將進一步徵求公眾與行業的意見，擬擴大銀行間資訊共享範圍至個人帳戶，並根據反饋推動相關立法修改。同時，我們將建立宏觀分析平台（Macro Analytics 3.0），整合多家銀行的反洗錢資料，與現有的詐騙分析系統結合，實現更快的跨行反應，進一步提升反洗錢及反恐怖融資的數據驅動監督能力，迅速行動應對系統性風險。\n\n# 财富管理及強制性公積金業務\n\n2024年，香港金融管理局將加強對財富管理、證券、投資產品、保險及強積金（MPF）業務的場內檢查與場外監測。我們將特別關注跨境財富管理通（Cross-boundary WMC）業務、數碼分銷與顧問平台、虛擬資產（VA）相關產品、長期保險產品及保費融資活動，並將根據最新市場動向及國際標準的演變調整策略。\n\n我們將與其他監管機構及業界密切合作，發布相關監管標準指引，尤其是對投資、保險及MPF產品的銷售。為支持虛擬資產行業的可持續及負責任發展，我們將繼續與政府及其他監管機構協作，確保虛擬資產的監管制度健全、全面且平衡。\n\n我們將協助並監督行業落實跨境WMC的改進措施，並與相關監管部門合作，進一步優化計劃。我們亦將與業界及其他監管機構合作，簡化投資產品的銷售流程，並適度整合及明確指引，以促進行業合規。此外，除了信託業務，我們將於2024年10月2日開始監管根據證券及期貨條例的第13類新規範，為由證監會（SFC）授權的集體投資計劃提供存管服務的AIs。\n\n# 監管金融市場基礎設施\n\n香港金融管理局致力於促進其監管下的金融市場基礎設施的安全與效率，並依據《支付系統及貯值設施條例》（PSSVFO）、《金融市場基礎設施原則》（PFMI）以及《支付和市場基礎設施委員會》（CPMI）發布的指引。 我們將繼續參與CPMI和IOSCO的PFMI實施監督與評估，以及國際工作組，討論新穎金融基礎設施相關的創新措施。我們亦將參與國際標準制定機構的工作，並根據最新國際實踐及市場、技術發展，審查並加強監管要求。\n\n# 政策制定\n\n香港金融管理局將持續優化其銀行監管與政策框架，並參照國際標準與最佳實踐，不斷完善。\n\n# 落實巴塞爾標準在香港的推行\n\n預計在2024年第1季度，經立法會通過修訂後，銀行（資本）規則（BCR）及銀行（披露）規則（BDR）以實施巴塞爾III最終改革方案（Final Package）。在2024年，香港金融管理局將持續準備相關指引、銀行申報表及標準披露範本，協助規則的落實。具體計劃包括：\n- 在2024年第2季度，諮詢行業，修訂關於“反周期資本緩衝（CCyB）——私營部門信貸曝險的地理配置”以及“反周期資本緩衝季度申報（Return MA(BS)25）”等模組，反映Final Package及國際銀行統計申報表修訂的相關變動；\n- 完成市場及信用評估調整的標準報告規定，並自2024年7月1日起生效。\n\n那些與巴塞爾資本充足率及流動性規則緊密相關的修訂，也預計於2025年1月1日生效。香港金融管理局將在2024年完成相關的法規修訂。\n\n此外，基於2022年12月和2023年12月由巴塞爾銀行監管委員會發布的新標準，涉及銀行對加密資產的審慎處理，相關國內落實工作預定2025年推行。我們將評估可能需要的立法修訂方案，包括BCR、BDR、BELR和BLR，並在2025年上半年完成必要的法規諮詢。\n\n# 其他監管政策及風險管理指引\n\n香港金融管理局將根據2023年3月美國及歐洲銀行業動盪的經驗，以及監管要求和國際標準的發展，更新多個《監管政策手冊》模組，包括："}
{"en": "# About the HKMA\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is Hong Kong’s central banking institution. The HKMA has four main functions:\n- maintaining currency stability within the framework of the Linked Exchange Rate System;\n- promoting the stability and integrity of the financial system, including the banking system;\n- helping to maintain Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre, including the maintenance and development of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure; and\n- managing the Exchange Fund.\n\n# HKMA’s legal mandate\n\nThe HKMA was established on 1 April 1993 after the Legislative Council passed amendments to the Exchange Fund Ordinance in 1992 empowering the Financial Secretary to appoint a Monetary Authority.\n\nThe powers, functions and responsibilities of the Monetary Authority are set out in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the Banking Ordinance, the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance, the Deposit Protection Scheme Ordinance, the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, and other relevant Ordinances. The division of functions and responsibilities in monetary and financial affairs between the Financial Secretary and the Monetary Authority is set out in an exchange of letters dated 25 June 2003. The exchange of letters discloses delegations made by the Financial Secretary to the Monetary Authority. The letters are public documents and can be found on the HKMA website.\n\nThe Exchange Fund Ordinance establishes the Exchange Fund under the control of the Financial Secretary. According to the Ordinance, the Fund shall be used primarily for affecting the exchange value of the Hong Kong dollar. It may also be used (whilst having regard to its primary purpose) for maintaining the stability and integrity of the monetary and financial systems of Hong Kong, with a view to maintaining Hong Kong as an international financial centre.\n\nThe Monetary Authority is appointed under the Exchange Fund Ordinance to assist the Financial Secretary in performing his functions under the Exchange Fund Ordinance and to perform such other functions as are assigned by other Ordinances or by the Financial Secretary. The office of the Monetary Authority is known as the HKMA, and the Monetary Authority is the Chief Executive of the HKMA.\n\nThe Banking Ordinance provides the Monetary Authority with the responsibility and powers for regulating and supervising banking business and the business of taking deposits. Under the Ordinance, the Monetary Authority is responsible for the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong.\n\nThe Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance provides that the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for banking sector entities. The Monetary Authority is vested with a range of powers to effect the orderly resolution of a non-viable banking sector entity (the failure of which could pose systemic risk). The purpose is to maintain financial stability, while seeking to protect public funds.\n\nThe Securities and Futures Ordinance and the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Ordinance provide certain powers to the Monetary Authority regarding the securities and mandatory provident fund businesses of banks.\n\nThe Monetary Authority has been delegated with powers of inspection and investigation by the Insurance Authority under the Insurance Ordinance in relation to the insurance related businesses of banks.\n\nThe Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance empowers the Monetary Authority to supervise banks’ compliance with the customer due diligence and record-keeping requirements under the Ordinance.\n\nThe Deposit Protection Scheme Ordinance confers responsibility on the Monetary Authority to assist in the operation of the Deposit Protection Scheme and to trigger payment of compensation from the Deposit Protection Scheme Fund to depositors of a failed licensed bank.\n\nThe Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance provides a statutory regime for the Monetary Authority to designate and oversee certain significant clearing and settlement systems and retail payment systems operating in Hong Kong. It also empowers the Monetary Authority to administer a licensing regime for electronic and physical “facilities”, which are used to store monetary value and which meet the criteria specified in the Ordinance.", "zh": "# 關於香港金融管理局\n\n香港金融管理局是香港的中央銀行機構。 HKMA 具有四個主要職能：\n- 在聯繫匯率制度框架內維持貨幣穩定；\n- 促進金融體系的穩定和完整性，包括銀行體系；\n- 協助維持香港作為國際金融中心的地位，包括維護和發展香港的金融基礎設施；\n- 管理匯豐基金。\n\n# HKMA的法定授權\n\n香港金融管理局於1993年4月1日成立，此前立法會於1992年通過了《外匯基金條例》的修訂，授權財經司司長任命貨幣當局。\n\n貨幣當局的權力、職能和責任列於《外匯基金條例》、《銀行條例》、《金融機構（償付）條例》、《存款保障計劃條例》、《支付系統及整存憑證條例》及其他相關法例。財經司司長與貨幣當局之間在貨幣及金融事務方面的功能分工，於2003年6月25日發出的一份信件交流中列明。該信件披露了由財經司司長授權予貨幣當局的委任內容。這些信件屬於公共文件，可在香港金融管理局網站查閱。\n\n《外匯基金條例》建立了由財經司司長控制的外匯基金。根據該條例，該基金的主要用途是影響港幣的匯率。基金亦可（在考慮其主要用途的前提下）用於維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定和完整，以維持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。\n\n貨幣當局根據《外匯基金條例》被委任協助財經司司長履行其職責，並執行由其他法例或財經司司長指派的其他職能。貨幣當局的辦公室稱為 HKMA，而貨幣當局為 HKMA 的行政長官。\n\n《銀行條例》賦予貨幣當局規管及監督銀行業務及吸收存款業務的責任和權力。在該條例下，貨幣當局負責授權在港的持牌銀行、限制牌照銀行及吸存公司。\n\n《金融機構（償付）條例》規定貨幣當局為銀行業的清算機構。貨幣當局擁有範圍廣泛的權力，以有序解決破產的非可行銀行機構（其倒閉可能引發系統性風險）。其目的是維持金融穩定，同時力求保障公眾資金。\n\n《證券及期貨條例》和《強制性公積金計劃條例》為貨幣當局在銀行的證券業務和強制性公積金業務方面提供特定權力。\n\n貨幣當局獲得保險業監管局根據《保險條例》授予的檢查及調查權力，以涉及銀行保險相關業務。\n\n《打擊洗錢及反恐怖融資條例》授權貨幣當局監督銀行遵守客戶盡職調查及記錄保存的規定。\n\n《存款保障計劃條例》賦予貨幣當局協助運作存款保障計劃的責任，並在存款機構倒閉時動用存款保障基金向存款人支付賠償。\n\n《支付系統及整存憑證條例》為貨幣當局制定官方制度以指定和監管在香港運作的某些重要清算和結算系統及零售支付系統。同時，該條例亦授權貨幣當局管理電子和實體“設施”的牌照制度，這些設施用於存儲貨幣價值並符合條例中規定的標準。"}
{"en": "# Corporate Governance\n\nAs Hong Kong’s central banking institution, the HKMA is committed to high standards of corporate governance, as good governance is crucial in maintaining and safeguarding the trust and confidence of the public in the HKMA to fulfil its statutory mandate.\n\nTo achieve its commitment to good corporate governance, the HKMA:\n- puts in place a well-defined governance structure with a high degree of accountability;\n- exercises robust controls to manage risks and ensure that staff behaviours at all levels and its day-to-day operations are consistent with specified standards; and\n- pursues a policy of high transparency and accessibility, and keeps close contacts with stakeholders.\n\n# The HKMA and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government\n\nThe HKMA is an integral part of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government, but is able to employ staff on terms different from those of the civil service in order to attract personnel of the right experience and expertise. The Chief Executive of the HKMA and his staff are public officers. In its day-to-day work, the HKMA operates with a high degree of autonomy within the relevant statutory powers conferred upon, or delegated to, the Monetary Authority.\n\nThe Financial Secretary is responsible for determining the monetary policy objective and the structure of the monetary system of Hong Kong: a letter from the Financial Secretary to the Monetary Authority dated 25 June 2003 specifies that these should be currency stability defined as a stable exchange value at around HK$7.80 to one US dollar maintained by Currency Board arrangements. The Monetary Authority is on his own responsible for achieving the monetary policy objective, including determining the strategy, instruments and operational means for doing so. The Monetary Authority also has responsibilities in relation to the maintenance of the stability and integrity of the monetary system of Hong Kong.\n\nThe Financial Secretary, assisted by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, has responsibility for policies for maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s financial system and the status of Hong Kong as an international financial centre. In support of these policies, the Monetary Authority’s responsibilities include:\n- promoting the general stability and effective working of the banking system;\n- promoting the development of the debt market, in co-operation with other relevant bodies;\n- matters relating to the issuance and circulation of legal tender notes and coins;\n- promoting the safety and efficiency of the financial infrastructure through the development of payment, clearing and settlement systems and, where appropriate, the operation of these systems; and\n- seeking to promote, in co-operation with other relevant bodies, confidence in Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems, and market development initiatives to help strengthen the international competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial services.\n\nThe Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary. The Monetary Authority, under delegation from the Financial Secretary, is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the use of the Exchange Fund, and for the investment management of the Fund.\n\n# Accountability and transparency\n\nThe autonomy given to the HKMA in its day-to-day operations, and in the methods it uses to pursue policy objectives determined by the Government, is complemented by a high degree of accountability and transparency.\n\nThe HKMA serves Hong Kong by promoting monetary and banking stability, by managing the official reserves effectively, and by developing and overseeing a robust and diverse financial infrastructure. These processes help to strengthen Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre and to foster Hong Kong’s economic well-being.\n\nThe HKMA must have the confidence of the community if it is to perform its duties well. The HKMA therefore takes seriously the duty of explaining its policies and work to the general public and makes every effort to address any concerns within the community relevant to the HKMA’s responsibilities. In particular, the HKMA makes timely clarifications on misinformation and rumours about the HKMA’s policies via traditional and social media.\n\nThe HKMA is accountable to the people of Hong Kong through the Financial Secretary, who appoints the Monetary Authority, and through the laws passed by the Legislative Council that set out the Monetary Authority’s powers and responsibilities. The HKMA also recognises a broader responsibility to promote a better understanding of its roles and objectives and to keep itself informed of community concerns. In its day-to-day operations and in its wider contacts with the community, the HKMA pursues a policy of transparency and accessibility. This policy has two main objectives:\n- to keep the financial industry and the public as fully informed about the work of the HKMA as possible, subject to considerations of market sensitivity, commercial confidentiality and statutory restrictions on disclosure of confidential information; and\n- to ensure that the HKMA is in touch with, and responsive to, the community it serves.\n\nThe HKMA seeks to follow international best practices in its transparency arrangements. It maintains extensive relations with the mass media and produces a range of regular and special publications in both English and Chinese. The HKMA’s bilingual website (www.hkma.gov.hk) carries a large number of HKMA publications, press releases, speeches and presentations, in addition to dedicated sections on research, statistics, regulatory resources, consumer information and other topics. Social media platforms are also used to communicate with the public more efficiently in the digital era. The HKMA maintains an Information Centre at its offices, consisting of a library and an exhibition area, which is open to the public six days a week. Further information on the HKMA’s work on public communications and engagement is contained in the Corporate Functions chapter on pages 185 to 193.\n\nOver the years, the HKMA has progressively increased the detail and frequency of its disclosure of information on the Exchange Fund and Currency Board Accounts. Since 1999, the HKMA has participated in the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard project for central banks. The HKMA publishes records of meetings of the Currency Board Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee and the reports on Currency Board operations. The supervisory policies and guidelines on banking have been published on the HKMA website since 1996.\n\nThe relations between the HKMA and the Legislative Council play an important part in promoting accountability and transparency. There is a formal commitment from the Chief Executive of the HKMA to appear before the Panel on Financial Affairs of the Legislative Council three times a year to brief Members and to answer questions on the HKMA’s work. Representatives from the HKMA attend Legislative Council panel and committee meetings from time to time to explain and discuss particular issues and to assist Members in their scrutiny of draft legislation.\n\n# Controls\n\nThe HKMA adopts robust internal and external control mechanisms to ensure that it upholds a high standard of staff conduct, prudent risk management as well as appropriate checks and balances. Internal and external audit functions provide independent assessment on the adequacy and effectiveness of the control mechanisms.\n\n# Code of Conduct\n\nA Code of Conduct, which provides guidance to staff on their ethical and legal responsibilities, is in place to ensure that staff behaviours are consistent with specified standards at all levels.\n\n# Internal controls\n\n# Operational controls\n\nAll departments and divisions have ownership and responsibility to identify and assess risks of their operational processes and put in place appropriate controls for ensuring proper day-to-day operations of the HKMA.

{"en": "# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nDespite a challenging external environment, the Hong Kong economy staged a positive growth in 2023, thanks to the revivals in inbound tourism and domestic demand. The labour market continued to improve alongside the economic recovery, while inflation remained moderate. Asset markets remained soft amid tightened financial conditions and weak market sentiment. Economic activities for 2024 are expected to recover further at a moderate pace, although the outlook is clouded by multiple external uncertainties.\n\n# The economy in review\n\n# Real activities\n\nHaving navigated through the severe challenges posed by the pandemic in the previous year, the Hong Kong economy grew steadily by 3.2% in 2023 (Table 1 and Chart 1). Domestically, private consumption recovered notably on the back of improved labour market conditions and various support initiatives introduced by the Government, such as the Consumption Voucher Scheme and a series of promotional campaigns. Despite tightened financial conditions, overall investment expenditure registered significant growth against a low base of comparison from the previous year. Externally, Hong Kong’s exports of services rebounded, due mainly to the robust revival of inbound tourism. However, their positive impact on growth was more than offset by the strong recovery in outbound tourism, which was measured as imports of services. On the other hand, exports of goods remained lacklustre amid weak external demand, and put a drag on Hong Kong’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth.\n\nChart 1 Real GDP growth by contribution\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\nTable 1 Real GDP growth by expenditure component (period-over-period)\nNote: The seasonally-adjusted quarter-on-quarter rates of change in the gross domestic fixed capital formation are not available.\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\n# Inflation\n\nLocal inflation remained moderate in 2023 as external price pressures gradually eased, while domestic cost pressures remained broadly in check despite rising slightly as the economy recovered (Chart 2)1. For 2023 as a whole, the underlying and headline inflation rates were 1.7% and 2.1% respectively.\n\n# Labour market\n\nLabour market conditions improved further in 2023, with the unemployment rate falling to a decade-low level of 2.8% in July and hovering at a low level for the remaining months of the year2 (Chart 3). Both labour demand and labour supply increased, as reflected respectively by the pick-up in total employment (Chart 3) and in the labour force. In view of Hong Kong’s manpower shortages, the Government rolled out various labour importation schemes3 and talent attraction initiatives4 in 2023. Meanwhile, with tight labour market conditions, the year-on-year growth rates of nominal wages and of labour earnings increased gradually towards their pre-pandemic levels.\n\nChart 2 Underlying consumer price inflation\n\nChart 3 Labour market conditions\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\n# Stock market\n\nAfter stabilising in early 2023, the local stock market turned sluggish in the second half. Extending its rebound in late 2022, the Hang Seng Index rose to a year-high daily close of 22,689 on 27 January 2023. It then retreated and dropped further to low levels by December (Chart 4), reflecting weak market sentiment due to the banking sector problems in the US and Switzerland in March, as well as weaker global economic prospects and tightened financial conditions in the second half. The Hang Seng Index closed the year at 17,047, down notably by 13.8% from the end of 2022, and marking the fourth consecutive year of decline.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market experienced a rebound in the first four months of 2023 on the back of the resumption of normalcy in the Mainland and Hong Kong, but softened subsequently alongside rising mortgage rates5 and weak market sentiment. Overall, housing prices dropped by 6.9% year on year in 2023, while housing transactions further declined by 4.5% to a record-low of 43,002 units. Housing affordability remained stretched despite improving slightly along with the downward adjustment of housing prices. Similarly, the non-residential property markets continued to face headwinds, with prices of offices, retail premises and flatted factories softened further. The rentals for offices remained under pressure due to high vacancy rates amid the increasing prevalence of work-from-home arrangements and large supply. On the other hand, the rentals for retail premises increased in 2023 with the revival of inbound tourism and the improvement in private consumption.\n\nChart 4 Asset prices\nSources: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited\n\n# Outlook for the economy\n\n# Economic environment\n\nIn 2024, the Hong Kong economy is expected to continue its recovery at a moderate pace. Inbound tourism is set to expand further alongside the continuous improvement in handling capacity and the Government’s effort to promote mega events, while local consumption activities should be supported by a steady labour market. The various infrastructure projects to be taken forward by the Government will also lend support to the economy. Meanwhile, Hong Kong’s exports of goods will likely stabilise alongside the expected upturn in the global technology cycle. The Government forecasts real GDP to grow steadily by 2.5% –3.5% in 20246. However, the outlook is clouded by multiple risks and uncertainties, including those stemming from the US policy rate path, the pace of technology cycle recovery, the prospects for global economic growth, and evolving geopolitical tensions.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nLocal inflation is expected to remain mild in 2024, with softened external price pressures helping to offset the upward pressures on domestic costs amid further economic recovery and rising housing rentals. Market consensus forecasts a headline inflation rate of 2.1% in 2024, while the Government projects the headline and underlying inflation rates to be 2.4% and 1.7% respectively. On the other hand, the labour market is expected to be supported by the ongoing economic recovery, while the various labour importation and talent attraction schemes will continue to help alleviate manpower shortages across different industries.\n\n# Performance of the banking sector\n\nIn 2023, the Hong Kong banking sector faced a number of challenges including a high interest rate environment, heightened volatility in global financial markets caused by the March banking turmoil in the US and Europe, and a slowerthan-expected economic recovery in the Mainland and Hong Kong. Despite these multiple headwinds, the Hong Kong banking sector remained sound and continued to be supported by strong capital and liquidity buffers. The asset quality of the banking sector remained healthy despite an increase in the classified loan ratio. The profitability of banks improved notably, driven by higher net interest income.\n\n# Asset quality\n\nThe classified loan ratio of the banking sector rose to 1.56% at the end of 2023 from 1.40% at the end of 2022, with the overdue and rescheduled loan ratio increasing to 1.24% from 0.85% during the same period (Chart 5). The classified loan ratio for Mainland-related lending also rose to 2.58% at the end of 2023 from 2.26% a year before. The increase in the classified loan ratio was mainly due to downgrades of exposures to Mainland property developers. Nevertheless, the provisions set aside by banks remained sufficient. The provision coverage ratio (i.e.  total provisions to classified loans) stood at 75% at the end of 2023. If the market value of collateral held against the classified loans is taken into account, the adjusted provision coverage ratio would reach around 145%. Meanwhile, the delinquency ratios of residential mortgage lending and credit card lending remained low, at 0.08% and 0.30% respectively, at the end of 2023 (Chart 6).\n\nChart 5 Asset quality of the banking sector\nNote: Figures cover Hong Kong offices, overseas branches and major overseas subsidiaries.\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 6 Delinquency ratios of residential mortgage lending and credit card lending\nSource: HKMA\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe banking sector recorded notable profit growth in 2023. The aggregate pre-tax operating profit of retail banks increased by 62.1% in the year, while the post-tax return on average assets rose to 0.89% from 0.57% during the same period (Chart 7). The improvement in profit was predominantly the result of an increase in net interest income (+30%), coupled with a significant gain in investments held for trading in 2023 as compared to a mild loss in the previous year. This was partly offset by an increase in loan impairment charges (+28%), as specific provisions were set aside for new classified loans. Against the backdrop of rising interest rates, the net interest margin of retail banks widened to 1.68% in 2023 from 1.31% a year before (Chart 8). Meanwhile, retail banks’ cost-to-income ratio fell to 38.8% in 2023 from 48.0% in 2022 (Chart 9).\n\nChart 7 Retail banks’ performance\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 8 Retail banks’ net interest margin\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 9 Retail banks’ cost-to-income ratio\nSource: HKMA\n\n# Balance sheet trends\n\nThe banking sector’s balance sheet grew by 0.9% in 2023, as growths in negotiable debt instruments held (+8.6%) and interbank lending (+4.4%) were mostly offset by a decline in total loans. Given the subdued loan demand amid higher borrowing costs and a weakened global economic outlook, total loans decreased by 3.6% in 2023. Of the total loans, loans for use in Hong Kong remained broadly stable (-0.4%), while loans for use outside Hong Kong and trade finance decreased by 10.4% and 13.1% respectively. Mainlandrelated lending fell by 6.6% in 2023.\n\nOn the liability side, total deposits rose by 5.1% in 2023, compared with a growth of 1.7% in 2022. As total loans declined while total deposits grew, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio decreased to 62.8% at the end of 2023 from 68.5% a year before (Chart 10).\n\n# Capital adequacy\n\nThe banking sector remained well capitalised in 2023. The consolidated total capital ratio of locally incorporated authorized institutions (AIs) stood at 21.1% at the end of 2023, compared with 20.1% a year before. The Tier 1 capital ratio was 18.9% (Chart 11). Both ratios were well above their respective international minimum requirements. The Basel III leverage ratio was 7.9% at the end of 2023 (Chart 12).\n\nChart 10 Loans and deposits of the banking sector\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 11 Consolidated capital ratios of locally incorporated AIs\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 12 Consolidated leverage ratio of locally incorporated AIs\nSource: HKMA\n\n# Liquidity conditions\n\nThe banking sector continued to maintain a strong liquidity position. The quarterly average Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) of category 1 institutions was 178.6% in the fourth quarter of 2023, and the quarterly average Liquidity Maintenance Ratio (LMR) of category 2 institutions was 65.7% (Chart 13). The main source of funding for the banking sector continued to be customer deposits. The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) of category 1 institutions and the Core Funding Ratio (CFR) of category 2A institutions were 144.4% and 169.4% respectively at the end of 2023 (Chart 14). All four ratios were well above the statutory minimum requirements.\n\nChart 13 Liquidity ratios of designated AIs\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 14 Funding ratios of designated AIs\nSource: HKMA\n", "zh": "# 經濟及金融環境\n\n儘管外部環境充滿挑戰，香港經濟在2023年仍展現正面增長，主要得益於入境旅遊和內需的復甦。勞動市場與經濟復甦同步持續改善，而通脹保持溫和。資產市場在金融條件收緊及市場情緒疲弱的影響下仍然疲軟。預計2024年的經濟活動將以適度速度進一步復甦，儘管多重外部不確定因素仍然籠罩前景。\n\n# 概覽經濟\n\n# 實體活動\n\n經歷去年疫情帶來的嚴峻挑戰後，香港經濟在2023年穩步增長3.2%（表1及圖1）。內部方面，因勞動市場狀況改善及政府推出多項支持措施，例如消費券計劃及一系列推廣活動，私人成品消費顯著復甦。儘管金融條件緊縮，整體投資支出較去年低基數仍錄得可觀增長。外部方面，香港服務出口反彈，主要由於入境旅遊的強勁復甦。然而，其對增長的正面影響被出境旅遊的強勁反彈所抵銷，後者以服務進口計算。另一方面，由於外部需求疲弱，貨物出口仍然黯淡，拖累香港的國內生產總值（GDP）增長。\n\n圖1 按貢獻度分列的實質GDP增長\n資料來源：統計暨普查資料處\n\n表1 按支出組取得的實質GDP增長（期比期）\n註：未提供經季節調整的季度變動率。\n資料來源：統計暨普查資料處\n\n# 通脹\n\n2023年本地通脹保持溫和，外部_PRICE壓力逐漸緩解，國內成本壓力儘管略微上升，仍大致受控（圖2）。整體而言，2023年基本和總體通脹率分別為1.7%及2.1%。\n\n# 勞動市場\n\n2023年勞動市場條件進一步改善，失業率於7月降至十年最低的2.8%，其後幾個月保持在低水平（圖3）。勞動需求與供應同步增加，分別反映於就業人數的增加（圖3）及勞動力的擴展。為解決香港人手短缺問題，政府於2023年推出多個勞工輸入計劃及人才引進措施。同時，受緊張的勞動市場條件影響，名義工資和勞動收入的年增長率逐步回升至疫情前水平。\n\n圖2 消費者價格指數基礎通脹率\n\n圖3 勞動市場狀況\n資料來源：統計暨普查資料處\n\n# 股票市場\n\n2023年初穩定後，香港股市在下半年轉趨疲軟。延續2022年底的反彈，恆生指數於2023年1月27日升至年內高點22,689點。此後回落，至12月進一步下降（圖4），反映由於美國與瑞士銀行業問題，以及全球經濟前景疲弱及金融條件收緊，市場情緒偏弱。恆生指數全年收報17,047點，比2022年底下降13.8%，連續第四年錄得跌市。\n\n# 房地產市場\n\n住宅物業在2023年頭四個月因內地及香港正常化而出現反彈，但隨著按揭利率上升和市場情緒轉弱，隨後又逐步轉弱。整體來看，2023年房價較去年下跌6.9%，房地產成交量進一步下跌4.5%，至43,002宗的歷史最低水平。儘管房價略為下調，住房負擔仍然偏緊。非住宅物業市場亦持續面對壓力，辦公室、零售商鋪及閣樓工廠的價格進一步下滑。由於空置率高企，加上居家工作普及，使辦公室租金持續承壓；反之，零售商鋪租金則因入境旅遊復甦及私人成品消費提升而上升。\n\n圖4 資產價格\n資料來源：評稅署及香港交易及結算所有限公司\n\n# 經濟前景展望\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n預計2024年，香港經濟將維持適度復甦。隨著持續改善的處理能力及政府推動大型活動的努力，入境旅遊有望進一步擴大，而本地消費活動則將受到勞動市場穩定的支撐。政府推進的多項基建工程亦將為經濟提供支持。同時，隨著全球科技週期有望復甦，香港貨物出口亦將趨於穩定。政府預測2024年實質GDP將穩定增長2.5% – 3.5%。然而，前景充滿多重風險和不確定性，包括美國政策利率路徑、科技週期復甦速度、全球經濟增長前景及地緣政治緊張局勢的演變所帶來的挑戰。\n\n# 通脹及勞動市場所\n\n預計2024年的本地通脹將保持溫和，外部價格壓力的緩解將有助於抵銷國內成本的上升，配合經濟進一步復甦及房租上漲。市場普遍預期2024年總體通脹率為2.1%，而政府則預計總體及基本通脹率分別為2.4%和1.7%。勞動市場則會因經濟持續復甦而獲得支撐，加之各項勞工輸入及人才引進計劃將持續幫助緩解不同行業的人手短缺問題。\n\n# 銀行業表現\n\n2023年，香港銀行業面對多重挑戰，包括高利率環境、由美國和歐洲銀行業動盪引發的市場波動，以及內地及香港經濟復甦步伐慢於預期。儘管如此，香港銀行業仍保持穩健，資本和流動性緩衝充足，資產質素保持健康，違約貸款比率略有上升，但盈利顯著改善，主要由於淨利息收入提升。\n\n# 資產質素\n\n2023年底，銀行業違約貸款比率升至1.56%，較2022年底的1.40%有所上升，同期間逾期及重組貸款比率由0.85%增至1.24%（圖5）。與此同時，內地相關貸款的違約比率亦由2.26%升至2.58%。違約比率的上升主要由於對內地房地產開發商的敞口降級所致，但銀行仍維持充分的撥備金。撥備覆蓋率（即總撥備金與違約貸款比例）截止2023年末為75%，若考慮抵押品市值，則調整後的撥備覆蓋率約達145%。此外，住宅按揭貸款及信用卡貸款的逾期率仍較低，分別為0.08%及0.30%（圖6）。\n\n圖5 銀行業資產質素\n註：數據涵蓋香港本地辦事處、海外分行及主要海外子公司。\n資料來源：香港金融管理局\n\n圖6 住宅按揭及信用卡貸款逾期率\n資料來源：香港金融管理局\n\n# 盈利趨勢\n\n2023年，銀行業錄得顯著盈利增長。零售銀行的總體稅前營運利潤全年增長62.1%，稅後平均資產回報率升至0.89%，較去年同期的0.57%大幅提升（圖7）。盈利改善主要由於淨利息收入增加（+30%）及交易性投資的顯著收益，而去年錄得輕微虧損。此增長部分被貸款減值準備的上升（+28%）所抵銷，因應新確定的違約貸款設置了專項撥備。隨著利率上升，零售銀行的淨利息差由前一年的1.31%擴大至2023年的1.68%（圖8）。此外，零售銀行的成本收入比由2022年的48.0%降至2023年的38.8%（圖9）。\n\n圖7 零售銀行表現\n資料來源：香港金融管理局\n\n圖8 零售銀行淨利息差\n資料來源：香港金融管理局\n\n圖9 零售銀行成本收入比\n資料來源：香港金融管理局\n\n# 財務狀況趨勢\n\n2023年，銀行業資產負債表持續擴大0.9%，其中可交易債務工具增加8.6%，銀行間拆借增加4.4%，但總貸款下降，使整體貸款比率由68.5%跌至62.8%。由於借貸成本上升及全球經濟展望疲弱，貸款需求低迷，2023年總貸款減少3.6%。在貸款中，用於香港的貸款較為穩定（-0.4%），而境外用途貸款及貿易融資則分別下降10.4%及13.1%。內地相關貸款亦下降6.6%。\n\n在負債方面，總存款於2023年升幅5.1%，較2022年的1.7%顯著增加。由於貸款縮減但存款增加，整體貸存比由去年同期的68.5%降至62.8%。  \n\n# 資本充足度\n\n2023年，銀行業保持良好的資本水平。由本地批准機構（AIs）組成的合併總資本比率於年末達21.1%，較去年20.1%有所提升。第一級資本比率為18.9%（圖11），均高於國際最低標準。巴塞爾協議Ⅲ的槓桿率於年末為7.9%（圖12）。\n\n圖10 銀行業貸款及存款\n資料來源：香港金融管理局\n\n圖11 本地批准機構的合併資本比率\n資料來源：香港金融管理局\n\n圖12 本地批准機構的合併槓桿率\n資料來源：香港金融管理局\n\n# 流動性情況\n\n銀行業保持強健的流動性。2023年第4季，第一類機構的季度平均流動性覆蓋比率（LCR）為178.6%，第二類機構的季度平均流動性維持比率（LMR）為65.7%（圖13）。主要融資來源仍為客戶存款。第一類機構的淨穩定資金比率（NSFR）及第二類A機構的核心資金比率（CFR）分別為144.4%及169.4%，均高於法定最低標準（圖14）。\n\n圖13 指定AIs的流動性比率\n資料來源：香港金融管理局\n\n圖14 指定AIs的資金比率\n資料來源：香港金融管理局"}
{"en": "# Monetary Stability\n\nIn 2023, amid market expectations of a “high for longer” US policy rate, the Hong Kong dollar mostly traded on the weak side of the Convertibility Zone, with the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking being triggered eight times between mid-February and early May.  The Hong Kong dollar had regained some momentum since May and traded around the central parity rate of 7.8 at year end.  Under the Linked Exchange Rate System, which marked its 40th anniversary in 2023, the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates generally track their US dollar counterparts, while also being affected by local supply and demand.  Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets remained stable and traded in a smooth and orderly manner.  As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, the Linked Exchange Rate System has shown its strength and resilience to various external shocks time after time.\n\n# Objectives\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability.  This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1.  The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n- Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks;\n- Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation;\n- The Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of clearing account balances kept with the HKMA; and\n- Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs).  With the HKMA standing ready to sell (or buy) Hong Kong dollars to (or from) banks in exchange for US dollars upon request at HK$7.75 (or HK$7.85) per US dollar when the strong-side (or weak-side) CU is triggered, the Aggregate Balance will expand (or contract) to push down (or up) Hong Kong dollar interest rates, helping move the Hong Kong dollar back to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85.\n\n# Review of 2023\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nAmid the market expectation of a “high for longer” US policy rate, the Hong Kong dollar remained soft and mostly traded on the weak side of the Convertibility Zone throughout 2023.  The weak-side CU was triggered eight times from mid-February to early May.  The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate regained some strength during early May to July, partly driven by dividend payment-related demand from listed companies and half-year-end funding needs by corporates. Thereafter, the Hong Kong dollar was mainly driven by the changes in local funding demands, such as buying flows through the Southbound Stock Connect, and traded around the central parity rate of 7.8 at year end (Chart 1).  Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market continued to function normally throughout 2023.\n\nChart 1 Market exchange rate in 2023\n\nFrom February to May, the HKMA purchased a total of HK$51.5 billion at the weak-side CU at the request of banks in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS).  Reflecting the triggering of the weak-side CU, the Aggregate Balance decreased from HK$96.3 billion at the end of 2022 to HK$45.0 billion at the end of 2023. Meanwhile, the outstanding EFBNs increased slightly from HK$1,200.4 billion to HK$1,245.5 billion during the year. The total of the Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs therefore declined from HK$1,296.7 billion at the end of 2022 to HK$1,290.4 billion at the end of 2023 (Chart 2). The Monetary Base as a whole remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\nChart 2 Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding Exchange Fund papers in 2023\n\n# Money market\n\nUnder the LERS, the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs) generally track their US dollar counterparts.  As the US continued to raise interest rates in the first seven months of 2023, the HIBORs generally rose (Chart 3).  For the year as a whole, the overnight, 1-month and 3-month HIBORs increased respectively by 286, 92 and 16 basis points to 6.09%, 5.27% and 5.15% at year end.\n\nFollowing the increases in the target range for the US federal funds rate, the Base Rate was adjusted upwards four times by a total of one percentage point (i.e. 100 basis points) from 4.75% to 5.75%.1 On the retail front, following the US policy rate hikes, many banks raised their Best Lending Rates by 12.5 basis points in early May and another 12.5 basis points in late July.  Some banks also increased the cap on HIBOR-based mortgage rates of newly approved mortgage loans during the year, and the average interest rate of new mortgage loans rose from 3.35% in 2022 to 4.13% in December 2023.  Overall, Hong Kong’s money markets continued to function normally.  Discount Window borrowing increased to HK$38.8 billion in 2023 from HK$8.4 billion in 2022 and no abnormality was noted in the relevant usage.\n\nChart 3 Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates in 2023\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nThe LERS has been a strong anchor of Hong Kong’s financial system for four decades and has shown its strength and resilience to challenges.  Despite lingering uncertainties surrounding the US interest rate path and global economic recovery, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to function in an orderly manner, reflecting the robustness of the LERS.  The Government is firmly committed to the LERS.  In its 2023 External Sector Report, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) once again reiterated that the credibility of the LERS has been ensured by a transparent set of rules, large fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nA robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS.  Hong Kong’s banking sector continued to operate smoothly with liquidity positions and capitalisation faring very well by international standards.  To ensure the resilience of the banking sector, the HKMA has been closely monitoring banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress testing results, and has maintained its supervisory efforts on bank lending.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of the Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) rose from 110.12% at the end of 2022 to a high of 112.71% on 4 May 2023, surpassing the Upper Trigger Level of 112.5% (Chart 4).  This largely reflected the contraction in the Aggregate Balance as a result of the triggering of the weak-side CU in the first half of the year2. In accordance with the arrangement approved by the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee and as a result of the redemption of Certificates of Indebtedness, assets were transferred out of the Backing Portfolio to the Investment Portfolio to reduce the Backing Ratio to around 109.97% on 8 May.  Thereafter, the Backing Ratio rose steadily to close at 110.73% on 31 December.  Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate.  The ample financial resources of the Exchange Fund, together with the sound banking system, provide a powerful backstop to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nChart 4 Daily movement of the Backing Ratio in 2023\n\n# Currency Board Sub-Committee\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong.  In 2023, the CBC considered issues including the May 2022 stablecoin market crash, the transmission of Federal Reserve’s dollar liquidity backstop measures to banks in Hong Kong, and the recent movements in the Hong Kong dollar interest rates.  Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Notes and coins\n\nThe below table summarises the value of the notes and coins in circulation at the end of 2023:\n\nChart 5 Banknotes in circulation by note-issuing banks at the end of 2023\n\nChart 6 Distribution of banknotes in circulation at the end of 2023\n\nChart 7 Banknotes in circulation at the end of 2023\n\nChart 8 Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation at the end of 2023\n\nChart 9 Breakdown of Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation at the end of 2023\n\n# Hong Kong banknotes\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA continued to organise seminars on the design and security features of Hong Kong banknotes for bank tellers, cashiers from retail establishments and students to help enhance their knowledge and skills in authenticating banknotes.  During 2023, 15 seminars were arranged for around 3,000 participants.\n\n# Coin Collection Programme\n\nThe Coin Collection Programme continued to be well received by the public.  More information about the Programme can be found in the Sustainable HKMA chapter of the Sustainability Report 2023.\n\n# Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\n\nThe EFBN Programme operated smoothly.  At the end of 2023, the nominal amount of outstanding Exchange Fund papers stood at around HK$1,255.4 billion (Table 2).\n\nTable 2 Outstanding issues of EFBNs\n\n# Monetary research\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMR)3, the research arm of the Hong Kong Academy of Finance, published 20 working papers and held 17 seminars/ webinars on monetary and financial research topics that are of strategic importance to Hong Kong and the region. The HKIMR also published six eJournals on the Social Science Research Network (SSRN) to disseminate research outputs to SSRN’s global research community.  Moreover, to provide the public with a high-level, non-technical summary of the recently published working papers, the HKIMR published two issues of Insights from Monetary Research.\n\nApart from its research activities, the HKIMR organised four international events, one roundtable and four seminars/ webinars with academia, global central banks and international financial institutions to promote dialogue and exchange on economic and financial issues:\n\n# 9 Mar\n\nA seminar on China’s Rebound: Recent Developments and Outlook by Dr Steven Alan Barnett, Senior Resident Representative in China of the IMF, and Dr Phakawa Jeasakul, Resident Representative for People’s Republic of China – Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) of the IMF, was held. Dr Barnett shared his views on the latest developments in the Chinese economy, as well as short- and medium-term issues that need to be addressed. More than 100 participants attended the seminar.\n\n# 17 Apr\n\nA seminar on Navigating Through a Challenging World was held. Four experts from the IMF shared their views on the analytical chapters of the most recent issues of World Economic Outlook and Global Financial Stability Report by the IMF. Over 50 participants attended the seminar.\n\n# 25 Apr\n\nA seminar with the presentation of the IMF’s April 2023 Global Financial Stability Report titled Safeguarding Global Financial Stability amid High Inflation and Interest Rates by Dr Jason Wu, Assistant Director, and Mr Thomas Pointek, Senior Financial Sector Expert, of the IMF’s Monetary and Capital Markets Department was held. More than 80 participants attended the seminar.\n\n# 2 May\n\nA fireside chat on Asia in a Challenging World was hosted between Mr Krishna Srinivasan, Director of the Asia and Pacific Department of the IMF, and Mr Eddie Yue, Chief Executive of the HKMA. Mr Srinivasan outlined the key messages of the recent IMF Regional Economic Outlook report for Asia and shared his views on the key drivers and risks of the global and regional economy. In addition, the dialogue covered many important issues concerning the regional economy and the evolution of the international monetary system. Around 120 participants attended the event.\n", "zh": "# 貨幣穩定性\n\n在2023年，儘管市場普遍預期美國政策利率將「長期居高不下」，香港美元大多在可兌換區的弱側進行交易，並在2月中旬至5月初間，觸發了8次弱側跡象支持。自5月以來，港幣逐步恢復了一些動能，年尾則在中間匯率7.8左右進行交易。在標誌著其成立40週年的聯繫匯率制度下，港幣拆帳市場利率通常跟隨美元走勢，並受到本地供求情況的影響。整體而言，港幣匯率和貨幣市場保持穩定，交易運作平穩有序。作為香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石，聯繫匯率制度多次展現其韌性與穩健。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的首要目標是貨幣穩定，定義為港幣在外匯市場對美元的匯率，維持在HK$7.75至7.85之間的範圍內，並保持穩定的外部匯率價值。貨幣體系的架構以貨幣局安排為主，要求貨幣基礎至少由在匯豐局持有的美元儲備全額支持，其變動必須由等量的美元儲備變動來對應。\n\n貨幣基礎（表格一）包括：\n- 償債證明書，全額支持由三家單張鈔發行銀行發行的鈔票；\n- 政府發行的貨幣紙鈔與硬幣；\n- 總結餘，即在香港金融管理局（HKMA）持有的結算帳戶餘額總和；\n- 由港府代表香港金融管理局發行的匯豐局票據（EFBNs）。\n\n港幣匯率的穩定由自動利率調整機制以及港交所誓守跡象支持承諾共同維繫。當強側（或弱側）支持跡象被觸發時，港交所準備按HK$7.75（或HK$7.85）對美元的價格向銀行出售（或購買）港幣，以調節總結餘，從而壓低（或抬高）港幣的利率，幫助港幣重新落在7.75至7.85的可兌換區範圍內。\n\n# 2023年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n2023年，儘管市場普遍預期美國政策利率將長期高企，港幣保持疲軟，並大多在可兌換區的弱側交易。弱側跡象支持在2月中旬至5月初被觸發八次。5月初至7月，港幣匯率略為回升，部分由上市企業的股息發放需求及中期融資需求推動。之後，港幣主要由本地融資需求變動所驅動，例如南向通買入資金，年底時匯率在7.8左右（見圖一），整體匯市運作正常。\n\n圖一 2023年市場匯率\n\n從2月至5月，港交所按照聯繫匯率制度（LERS）設計，應銀行要求在弱側跡象支持下購買了總共HK$515億元。弱側跡象支持的觸發導致總結餘由2022年底的HK$963億元降至2023年底的HK$450億元。同時，未償還匯豐局票據（EFBNs）在年內略增，從HK$1,2004億元升至HK$1,245.5億元。因此，總結餘與未償EFBNs之和由2022年底的HK$1,2967億元微降至HK$1,2904億元（見圖二）。整體貨幣基礎依然由外匯儲備充分支持。\n\n圖二 2023年總結餘（折算窗口前）與未償匯豐局票據\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n在LERS下，港元拆帳市場利率（HIBOR）通常跟隨美元走勢。由於2023年前七個月美國持續升息，HIBOR普遍上升（見圖三）。全年來看，隔夜、1個月、3個月HIBOR分別上升286、92及16個基點，年底分別達到6.09%、5.27%、5.15%。\n\n在美聯儲基準利率範圍調整後，香港基本利率（Base Rate）共升了四次，總升幅達1個百分點（即100個基點），由4.75%升至5.75%。在零售端，隨著美國政策利率升高，許多銀行在5月初提高了其最佳貸款利率12.5個基點，7月下旬再次調整同樣幅度。部分銀行亦提高了新批准房貸的HIBOR封頂利率，新房貸平均利率由2022年的3.35%升至2023年12月的4.13%。整體而言，香港貨幣市場依然正常運作。折扣窗口借款在2023年增加至HK$388億元，較2022年的HK$84億元為高，相關用途未出現異常。\n\n圖三 2023年香港拆帳市場利率\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n聯繫匯率制度已經是香港金融系統的堅實支柱，維持了四十年，展現其韌性。即便美國利率路徑及全球經濟復甦仍存不確定性，港幣匯率及貨幣市場依然有序運作，證明LERS的穩健。政府堅定支持LERS。在2023年對外經濟報告中，國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）再次強調，LERS的可信度由一套透明的規則、大量的財政及外匯儲備、強健的金融監管及監督、靈活的經濟及審慎的財政框架共同確保。\n\n堅實的銀行系統是LERS順利運作的關鍵。香港金融機構依然平穩運營，流動性狀況和資本充足度根據國際標準表現良好。為確保銀行業韌性，HKMA密切監控銀行的信貸、流動性、利率風險管理及壓力測試結果，並持續加強對銀行貸款的監管力度。\n\n為提升貨幣局帳戶透明度，自1998年10月起，已將部分匯豐局資產用作支持貨幣基礎。支撐比率（即支持資產除以貨幣基礎）由2022年底的110.12%上升至2023年5月4日高點的112.71%，超過112.5%的上限（見圖四）。這主要反映年初因弱側跡象支持觸發而導致的總結餘收縮。根據匯豐局諮詢委員會批准的安排，並通過贖回償債證明書，資產從支持組合轉入投資組合，使支持比率在5月8日降至約109.97%。此後，支持比率平穩上升，至12月31日達到110.73%。在LERS下，雖然部分匯豐局資產被指定用於支持組合，但所有匯豐局資產皆可用來支持港幣匯率。充裕的資金資源與健全的銀行系統，共同為香港的貨幣與金融穩定提供強大的支撐。\n\n圖四 2023年每日支持比率變動\n\n# 貨幣局委員會\n\n貨幣局委員會的貨幣局委員會子委員會（CBC）負責監察與審查相關香港貨幣與金融穩定的事宜。2023年，CBC考慮了包括2022年5月穩幣市場崩盤、聯儲局美元流動性支持措施傳導到香港銀行，以及近期港幣利率變動等議題。這些討論記錄與貨幣局運作報告都已在港交所網站公佈。\n\n# 紀念幣與紙幣\n\n以下表格匯總2023年底流通中鈔票與硬幣的價值：\n\n圖五 2023年由鈔票發行銀行發行的鈔票數量\n\n圖六 2023年流通鈔票的分佈\n\n圖七 2023年流通中的鈔票總量\n\n圖八 政府發行的貨幣紙鈔及硬幣\n\n圖九 政府發行貨幣紙鈔及硬幣的詳細分類\n\n# 香港鈔票\n\n全年，港交所持續舉辦有關港幣鈔票設計及安全特徵的講座，以提升銀行出納員、零售店收銀員及學生的識鈔能力。2023年，已安排15場講座，約3000人參加。\n\n# 硬幣收藏計劃\n\n硬幣收藏計劃仍深受公眾歡迎。更多資訊請參閱2023年可持續發展報告中的《可持續的港交所》章節。\n\n# 匯豐局票據\n\n匯豐局票據計劃運作順暢。截至2023年底，未償還的匯豐局票據規模約為HK$1,2554億元（見表二）。\n\n表二 未償還EFBNs的發行數量\n\n# 貨幣研究\n\n香港金融管理局貨幣與金融研究所（HKIMR），作為香港金融學院的研究部門，發表了20篇工作論文，並舉辦了17場與香港及區域的戰略性貨幣金融議題相關的研討會或網路研討會。HKIMR亦在社會科學研究網絡（SSRN）上發佈了六期電子期刊，分享研究成果。為方便公眾了解最新研究工作，HKIMR還發布了兩期《貨幣研究洞察》簡報。\n\n除研究工作外，HKIMR還組織了四場國際活動、一場圓桌會議和四場與學術界、全球中央銀行及國際金融機構的研討會或網路研討會，以促進經濟金融議題的對話與交流：\n\n# 3月9日\n\n一場由IMF在中國的高級駐華代表史蒂文·艾倫·巴尼特博士及IMF中國-香港特別行政區駐代表耶沙庫爾博士主持的中國經濟復甦：近期進展與前景研討會舉行。巴尼特博士就中國經濟的最新發展以及需解決的短中期議題分享了看法。超過100名與會者參加。\n\n# 4月17日\n\n舉行了一場主題為「穿梭於充滿挑戰的世界」的研討會。IMF的四位專家分享了其對IMF最新一期《世界經濟展望》和《全球金融穩定報告》分析章節的見解。超過50人參加。\n\n# 4月25日\n\nIMF貨幣與資本市場司助理局長吳宗偉博士及高級金融部專家龔托馬斯主持了題為“高通脹和高利率背景下的全球金融穩定保障”之2023年4月IMF《全球金融穩定報告》呈現的研討會。有超過80人參與。\n\n# 5月2日\n\nIMF亞太部主任克里希纳·斯里尼瓦桑與港交所行政長官余偉文共同主持一場關於亞太區域挑戰的對話。斯里尼瓦桑分享了IMF區域經濟展望最新報告的關鍵信息及全球與區域經濟的主要驅動因素和風險，討論涵蓋多個重要議題及國際貨幣體系的演變。約有120人參與此次活動。"}
{"en": "# Banking Stability\n\nThe banking sector in Hong Kong remained strong and resilient in 2023 despite multiple headwinds, including the March banking turmoil in the US and Europe, a high interest rate environment and geopolitical tensions. The HKMA responded swiftly to the March banking turmoil — from managing the ripple effects to completing an internal review (covering such areas as the supervisory processes and resolution framework) drawing lessons for the local banking sector, while maintaining its focus on the credit, liquidity and market risk management of authorized institutions. In light of escalating cyber threats and the increasing use of technology services provided by third parties, the HKMA also worked closely with authorized institutions to enhance their operational and cyber resilience.\n\nThe HKMA enhanced consumer protection in respect of payment cards, and through further revision of the Code of Banking Practice as well as the launch of the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter. The HKMA worked with fellow regulators on a balanced regulatory regime for virtual asset-related activities, streamlined the selling process for sophisticated professional investors, introduced enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Pilot Scheme, and commenced supervision of trust business. A pilot programme was launched to prepare for provision of consumer credit reference services under “Credit Data Smart”.\n\nThe HKMA’s efforts in anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) reflect a commitment to targeting the highest threats under a risk-based approach. To address increasing digital fraud, the HKMA has strengthened ecosystem collaboration through the launch of real-time fraud monitoring and expanding the scope of public-private information-sharing partnerships, including the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce. The launch of a ground-breaking platform to facilitate bank-to-bank information sharing will help address the risk of mule account networks, while the HKMA also worked closely with the industry to take concerted action to handle increasing fraud-related banking complaints and raise public awareness about different scams, including a pre-transaction alert mechanism when using the Faster Payment System. In parallel, supervisory technology capabilities were also advanced through the Macro Analytics pilot scheme.\n\nGood progress was made on implementing international supervisory standards locally, including those on capital adequacy and disclosure. Notable efforts were also made in enhancing capacity building in the banking sector, attracting and nurturing future talents and upskilling existing practitioners. In addition, the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board completed a public consultation on proposed enhancements to the Deposit Protection Scheme.\n\nThe HKMA continued to advance its work to ensure a credible resolution regime. A new resolution standard related to accessing critical financial market infrastructures was developed and a review on experiences of implementing loss-absorbing capacity policy standards was completed. Significant progress was made in resolution planning with banks to address early termination risk and operational continuity in resolution. The HKMA also continued to be active in international policy initiatives and regional co-operation on resolution.\n\n# Objectives\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this objective is contingent upon a highly resilient financial system that is capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their businesses and, in extreme cases, by failing in a disorderly manner. The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring that banks are resilient to shocks and able to recover their positions in response to crises, ultimately helping to prevent failures. The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks and is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs).\n\nThe Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework is not designed to ensure a zero-risk financial system. Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that, in the event of an AI becoming non-viable, its failure can be managed in an orderly manner. To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong has been established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs, among other types of institutions. To operationalise the resolution regime in Hong Kong, it is important to lay down resolution rules and policy standards, undertake resolution planning to remove impediments to AIs’ resolvability and develop the HKMA’s operational capability to resolve a failing AI. In order to carry out these tasks effectively, the HKMA adopts an internationally harmonised and co-ordinated approach.\n\nThe Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs). In overseeing FMIs, the HKMA aims to promote their general safety and efficiency, limit systemic risk and foster transparency. Making FMIs more resilient to financial crises protects the monetary and financial systems in Hong Kong from possible destabilising effects arising from disruption to the FMIs.\n\n# Review of 2023\n\n# Licensing\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA granted one banking licence and one restricted bank licence to two banks incorporated outside Hong Kong. The HKMA also granted money broker approval to four foreign trading platform operators and revoked another approval granted to one money broker. The HKMA revoked authorizations of five licensed banks during the year.\n\nMore information about the AIs and local representative offices in Hong Kong can be found in the Annex and Tables D to F on pages 313 to 316 and 322 to 325 respectively.\n\n# Review of three-tier banking system\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA conducted a comprehensive review on the three-tier banking system in order to simplify the structure of Hong Kong’s banking system. The review found that the three-tier system has become more complex than necessary to achieve the original aim to strike a balance between flexibility of entry into the banking system and protection of small depositors. Subsequently, the HKMA commenced a three-month consultation in June on a proposal to simplify the three-tier banking system into two tiers by merging deposit-taking companies into the restricted licence bank sector, thereby forming a new second tier of Hong Kong’s banking system. Respondents were generally supportive of the proposal.\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA conducted 177 off-site reviews covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL rating assessment1, corporate governance and risk management. As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance, 38 meetings were held with the boards of directors, independent non-executive directors or board-level committees of AIs. Furthermore, 38 tripartite meetings were held among the HKMA, AIs and their external auditors.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA conducted regular on-site examinations on a wide range of AIs’ activities. Credit risk management was a key focus given the challenging credit risk landscape amid a high interest rate environment and debt defaults by some Mainland property developers. The management of operational risk and technology risk was another major focus as the adoption of technology by AIs gathered further momentum. The HKMA also stepped up its supervisory work on climate risk management and rolled out a new round of thematic examinations focused on climaterelated risk governance, and a series of consultative sessions to provide supervisory guidance to AIs.\n\nThe banking turmoil in the US and Europe that started in March 2023 was the most significant system-wide banking stress since the Great Financial Crisis of 2008 in terms of scale and scope. The HKMA stayed on high alert as the turmoil unfolded and took a number of precautionary actions to ensure that any potential fallout would not undermine confidence in the local banking and financial system. After the episode, the HKMA conducted an internal review exercise having regard to the observations and experience gained from the turmoil. Based on this exercise, the HKMA developed a detailed action plan to incorporate lessons learnt with a view to strengthening its supervisory effectiveness and augmenting its ability to handle a banking crisis if one did occur. See Liquidity and market risks on page 95 for more details on the HKMA’s work in this respect.\n\nOn conduct supervision, the HKMA carried out on-site examinations in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses as well as consumer protection matters, supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk or new initiatives.\n\nTable 1 contains a summary of the HKMA’s supervisory activities in 2023.\n\nTable 1 Summary of supervisory activities\n\n# Credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nTotal loans decreased by 3.6% in 2023, compared with a decline of 3.0% in 2022. Table 2 shows the breakdown of growth in loans and advances. Mainland-related lending decreased by 6.6% to HK$4,226 billion in 2023 (Table 3).\n\nTable 2 Growth in loans and advances\n\nTable 3 Growth in Mainland-related lending\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA intensified supervisory efforts in monitoring AIs’ asset quality and assessing their credit risk management practices given the high interest rate environment and continued weakness in the Mainland property market. The asset quality of the banking sector deteriorated during the year but remained manageable. The classified loan ratio of the banking sector was 1.56% at the end of 2023, up from 1.40% at the end of 2022. The classified loan ratio for Mainland-related lending increased to 2.58% from 2.26% at the end of 2022.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA conducted targeted and thematic examinations to evaluate AIs’ credit risk management focusing on exposures to vulnerable sectors, premium financing, oversight of credit risks at operations outside Hong Kong and exposures to non-bank financial institutions.\n\n# Alleviating cash flow pressure faced by bank customers\n\nThe HKMA and the Banking Sector Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) Lending Coordination Mechanism announced in July the commencement of an orderly exit from the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme. The Scheme was introduced in May 2020 to tide eligible corporates over the pandemic. Taking into account the views of the commercial sectors, the partial principal repayment options were enhanced to assist corporates’ gradual return to normal repayment. Where sectors or individual borrowers were still facing challenges despite the end of the pandemic, banks continued to offer principal moratorium or other suitable credit relief measures on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe HKMA also encouraged banks to be sympathetic in handling the funding needs of corporates which had not participated in the Scheme but were facing cash flow pressures due to individual circumstances. The HKMA reminded banks to follow the “Hong Kong Approach to Corporate Difficulties” guidelines in dealing with corporates encountering repayment problems, so that individual banks would act collaboratively in the common interest of the lenders involved.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nThe successive rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures introduced by the HKMA since 2009 have strengthened banks’ risk management of their property mortgage lending business and the banking sector’s capacity to cope with challenges arising from a sharp correction in property prices. The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of new residential mortgage loans approved in 2023 stood at 57%, compared with 64% in September 2009 before the countercyclical measures were first introduced (Chart 1). The average debt servicing ratio (DSR) of new mortgages stayed low at 40% in 2023, compared with 41% in August 2010 when a cap on DSR was first applied.\n\nOn 7 July, the HKMA adjusted the countercyclical macroprudential measures after taking into account factors such as property prices, transaction volumes and the local and external economic environment. This was the first time the countercyclical macroprudential measures for residential properties were relaxed since their introduction in 2009. The adjustments included increasing the maximum LTV ratios for residential properties and commercial properties, as well as for mortgage loans assessed based on the net worth of mortgage applicants. In addition, the requirements to lower the applicable maximum LTV ratio and DSR limit by ten percentage points for mortgage applicants with incomes derived mainly from places outside of Hong Kong were lifted. The HKMA also removed the requirement to apply a five-percentage-point reduction on applicable DSR limits when mortgage applicants’ total mortgage finance exceeded the HKMA’s normal permissible LTV ceilings by 20 percentage points.\n\nChart 1 Average LTV ratio and DSR of new residential mortgage loans approved\n", "zh": "# 銀行穩定性\n\n儘管面臨多重阻力，包括美國和歐洲三月的銀行動盪、高利率環境以及地緣政治緊張局勢，香港銀行業在2023年仍保持強健和具韌性。香港金融管理局（HKMA）迅速回應三月的銀行動盪——從管理連鎖反應到完成內部評估（涵蓋監管流程和解決框架等範疇），汲取經驗教訓，以促進本地銀行業的發展，同時持續關注授權機構的信貸、流動性與市場風險管理。在網絡威脅不斷升級及第三方科技服務使用日益增加的背景下，HKMA亦與授權機構緊密合作，以增強其運營及網絡韌性。\n\nHKMA在支付卡消費者保護方面亦有所提升，通過進一步修訂銀行守則及推出反詐騙消費者保護章程。HKMA與其他監管機構合作，建立平衡的虛擬資產相關活動監管制度，簡化專業投資者的銷售流程，推行跨境財富管理通聯試點方案並展開信託業務監管計劃。亦啟動「信用數據智能」項目，準備提供消費者信貸參考服務。\n\nHKMA在反洗錢及打擊資助恐怖主義（AML/CFT）方面的努力體現出其以風險為本的最高威脅導向。為應對日益增多的數字詐騙，HKMA推行實時詐騙監控，擴展公私合作共享資訊範圍，包括詐騙與洗錢情報特別工作組。推出一個創新平台，促進銀行間資訊共享，以應對兜售帳戶網絡的風險，加上與行業的合作，積極應對日益增加的詐騙投訴，並提升公眾對各類詐騙的認識，例如推出快速支付系統的交易前預警機制。同時，宏觀分析（Macro Analytics）試點方案亦推進超前監管技術能力。\n\n在本地推行國際監管標準方面取得良好進展，包括資本充足率和披露要求。亦積極培訓人才、提升行業能力，吸引並培育未來專才。香港存款保障委員會亦完成有關強化存款保障計劃的公眾諮詢。\n\nHKMA繼續推進其確保有信譽的解決制度的工作，制定了一項相關關於進入重點金融市場基礎設施的解決標準，並完成有關吸收虧損能力政策標準實施經驗的檢視。在危機預警和運營持續性方面，與銀行合作制定應對早期終止風險的解決籌劃取得重大進展。HKMA亦持續參與國際政策倡議及區域合作。\n\n# 目標\n\nHKMA的總體目標是促進銀行系統的安全與穩定。實現此目標依賴於一個高度韌性的金融體系，能為香港經濟提供關鍵的金融服務。\n\n銀行可以通過其業務運作影響系統穩定性，極端情況下甚至可能因失序而失敗。作為監管機構，HKMA在保障金融穩定方面扮演關鍵角色，確保銀行抵抗衝擊且能在危機中恢復，最終有助於防止銀行倒閉。HKMA負責銀行的審慎監管，並負責授權在香港設牌的持牌銀行、有限牌照銀行及存款接受機構，合稱授權機構（AIs）。\n\n香港的審慎監管框架並非旨在建立零風險的金融系統，而是作為解決機制的監管機構，確保在AIs變得不可行的情況下，能有序地控制失敗。為此，香港已建立金融機構解決制度，HKMA為AIs等多類機構的解決機構。為落實解決制度，需制定解決規則和政策標準、進行解決規劃以排除解決障礙，以及提升HKMA的解決能力。HKMA通過採用國際協調與合作的治理方式，以確保任務有效推行。\n\nHKMA亦負責部分金融市場基礎設施（FMIs）的指定與監督，旨在促進其安全與效率、限制系統性風險並提升透明度，保障香港貨幣與金融系統的穩定。\n\n# 2023年回顧\n\n# 發牌情況\n\n年內，HKMA為兩家在港外設立的銀行授予一張銀行牌照及一張有限牌照，並批准四家外國交易平台經營者獲得貨幣經紀商資格，另撤銷一項貨幣經紀商資格。年內，HKMA也撤銷了五家持牌銀行的授權。\n\n有關AIs及本地代表辦事處的詳細資料，請參閱附件及第313至316頁和第322至325頁的表格D至F。\n\n# 三階段銀行系統全面評估\n\n2023年，HKMA進行了徹底檢討，以簡化香港銀行系統的結構。發現三階段制度變得比預期更複雜，偏離了原先在靈活性與保護微型存戶之間取得平衡的設計初衷。基於此，HKMA於6月展開為期三個月的諮詢，建議將存款公司併入有限牌照銀行行列，形成新的第二階段，從而將香港銀行體系簡化為兩個階段。大多數受訪者支持該方案。\n\n# 監管活動總覽\n\n2023年，HKMA進行了177次非現場審查，涵蓋CAMEL評級、公司治理和風險管理等多個範授。為推動更強的風險治理，舉行了38場與AIs董事會、獨立非執行董事或委員會的會議，以及38場HKMA與AIs及其外部審計師的三方會議。\n\n除非應活動外，HKMA亦進行定期的現場審查，重點關注信用風險管理，尤其在高利率及部分內地地產開發商債務違約的背景下。監管操作風險與科技風險亦成為重點，隨著AIs更積極應用科技。HKMA亦加強氣候風險管理監察，推出新一輪專題審查，聚焦氣候相關的風險治理，並舉辦多場交流會提供監管指引。\n\n自2023年3月起，美國及歐洲的銀行動盪成為自2008年金融危機以來最嚴重的系統性壓力。HKMA保持高度警戒，採取多項預防措施，確保潛在影響不會削弱本地金融體系信心。事後，HKMA進行內部評估，根據經驗制定詳細行動計劃，以提高監管效能和危機處理能力。詳情請參見第95頁有關流動性和市場風險的內容。\n\n在行為監管方面，HKMA對證券、投資產品、保險和強積金業務展開現場檢查，並加強對高風險或新推出措施的專題審查。\n\n表1總結了2023年HKMA的監管活動情況。\n\n# 信用風險\n\n# 信貸增長與資產質素\n\n2023年，整體貸款較2022年下降3.6%，而2022年則下跌3.0%。表2展示了貸款與信貸的增長詳情。內地相關貸款減少6.6%，至HK$4,2260億（表3）。\n\n表2 貸款與信貸增長\n\n表3 內地相關貸款增長\n\n在2023年，HKMA加強監管力度，密切監察AIs的資產質素與信贷風險管理，特別在高利率及內地房地產市場疲弱的情況下。銀行業資產質素有所惡化，但仍在可控範圍內。2023年末，銀行業不良貸款比率為1.56%，較2022年末的1.40%略有升幅；內地相關貸款的不良貸款比率由2.26%升至2.58%。\n\n年內，HKMA針對脆弱行業、保險和外匯風險等展開針對性及專題監管檢查，評估AIs的信貸風險管理。\n\n# 緩解銀行客戶的現金流壓力\n\nHKMA及銀行業中小企業貸款協調機制於7月宣布有序退出「預先核准的本金還款假期計劃」。該計劃於2020年5月推出，幫助疫情期間合資格企業渡過難關。考慮到商界意見，方案中部分本金償還選項得以優化，協助企業逐步恢復正常償還。即使疫情結束，仍有部分行業或個別借款人在經歷挑戰時，銀行亦會根據個案提供本金展延或其他適當的信貸緩解措施。\n\nHKMA亦鼓勵銀行在處理未參與計劃但面臨現金流壓力的企業時，保持同情，並提醒銀行遵循「香港企業困難處理指南」，共同合作維護放款人利益。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n自2009年以來，HKMA多輪逆周期宏觀審慎措施鞏固了銀行對物業按揭貸款的風險管理，並增強行業應對房價急劇調整的能力。2023年批准的新住宅按揭貸款平均貸款成價比（LTV）為57%，較2009年9月首次實施逆周期措施前的64%顯著降低（圖表1）。新按揭貸款的平均債務還款比（DSR）保持在40%的低位，較2010年8月首次實施DSR上限時的41%略有降低。\n\n7月7日，HKMA在考慮房價、交易量以及經濟環境變化後，調整了逆周期宏觀審慎措施。這是自2009年措施推出以來的首次放寬。調整內容包括提高住宅和商業用途物業的最大LTV比率，以及基於申請人資產淨值評估的按揭貸款的LTV比率。此外，對於來自香港以外地區收入的申請人，降低最大LTV和DSR上限的規定亦被取消。HKMA亦放寬在申請人貸款總額超出正常LTV上限20個百分點時，減少相應LTV和DSR要求的限制。"}
{"en": "# International Financial Centre\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA utilised a multi-pronged approach to achieve notable progress in consolidating Hong Kong’s status as a globally competitive international financial centre.\n\nThe success of two major events, namely the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit and the HKMA-BIS High-Level Conference, had reinforced Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre and created positive ripple effects.\n\nThe HKMA, together with its Mainland and Hong Kong counterparts, made concerted efforts to deepen and widen the mutual access between the financial markets of Hong Kong and the Mainland. This included enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Scheme in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, the designation of additional market makers for Southbound Trading under Bond Connect, the successful launch of Northbound Trading of Swap Connect, and the roll-out of the HKD-RMB Dual Counter Model and the Dual Counter Market Making Programme. These initiatives were effective in strengthening Hong Kong’s gateway position and reinforcing the city’s status as a global hub for offshore renminbi business.\n\nThe HKMA also made good progress in strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, in areas including bond issuance, asset and wealth management, green and sustainable finance, and corporate treasury centres. To promote Hong Kong’s financial services, the HKMA stepped up its market outreach activities to overseas and Mainland stakeholders to keep them well informed about the opportunities in Hong Kong’s financial market and its resilience.\n\nSignificant progress has been made on all fronts of the HKMA’s “Fintech 2025” strategy, including in areas such as promoting fintech adoption, Central Bank Digital Currency, data infrastructure, talent development, and policies and funding support.\n\nThe Faster Payment System (FPS) marked its fifth anniversary in September. The number of registrations has grown steadily, and had reached 13.6 million at the end of 2023. The average daily turnover for the year rose to 1.25 million real-time transactions. FPS x PromptPay link for cross-border QR payment between Hong Kong and Thailand was jointly launched with the Bank of Thailand in December, providing a fast, secure and easily accessible cross-border retail payment service for people travelling between the two places.\n\nAs an active member of many international and regional central banking and regulatory forums, the HKMA continued to contribute to global efforts to maintain financial stability and promote financial market developments.\n\n# Overview\n\nThroughout the year, the HKMA continued making proactive efforts to strengthen Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre. In November, it organised the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit for the second year. This three-day event brought together prominent financial leaders from around the world to share their unique perspectives under the theme of “Living with Complexity”. With over 350 participants from 160 international financial institutions attending, the summit clearly showed the global financial sector’s commitment to and confidence in Hong Kong. In the same month, the HKMA and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) co-hosted the HKMA-BIS High Level Conference, which attracted more than 300 participants, including over 20 current and former central bank governors. The conference highlighted the HKMA’s close collaboration with the BIS as well as with the international central banking community.\n\nThe expansion of and enhancements made to the MainlandHong Kong Connect schemes have reinforced Hong Kong’s role as the bridge between the Mainland and international financial markets. A series of enhancements to the Crossboundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) scheme were introduced to facilitate cross-boundary retail investment in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA). Riding on the smooth operations of Southbound Bond Connect, the HKMA designated nine additional market makers to improve secondary liquidity and meet investor demand. Northbound Trading of Swap Connect was successfully launched in the year, enabling global investors to better manage the interest rate risks associated with their Mainland fixed income portfolio via Hong Kong.\n\nHong Kong’s offshore renminbi businesses saw robust growth during the year. The HKMA collaborated with the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) to launch the HKD-RMB Dual Counter Model and the Dual Counter Market Making Programme in June. This helped develop a more diverse range of renminbi-denominated products in Hong Kong by facilitating the issuance and trading of renminbidenominated stocks in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA continued to work on strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. In particular, to enhance Hong Kong’s appeal as a preferred fund management centre, the HKMA worked closely with the Government and the financial industry to provide a more facilitative tax and regulatory environment. Significant progress was also made in promoting innovation in Hong Kong’s bond market, and consolidating Hong Kong’s position as a regional green and sustainable finance hub. At the same time, the HKMA stepped up its market outreach activities to promote Hong Kong’s financial services to overseas and Mainland stakeholders.\n\nBoth the Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO) and the banking departments of the HKMA continued to implement the “Fintech 2025” strategy1 to promote wide adoption of financial technology (fintech) and strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia. Key initiatives implemented during the year included:\n- promoting further adoption in the tech focus areas of Wealthtech, Insurtech, Greentech, artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology (DLT);\n- advancing the work on wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) to improve cross-border payments;\n- progressing further in the study on the prospect of introducing a retail CBDC in Hong Kong, i.e. an e-HKD;\n- stepping up efforts to develop Commercial Data Interchange (CDI);\n- enhancing talent development;\n- nurturing the fintech ecosystem through funding and policies;\n- strengthening cross-border collaboration in fintech; and\n- expanding the adoption of the FPS.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure is vital for maintaining the city’s position as a leading international financial centre. In 2023, the four interbank Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) and the Hong Kong Trade Repository (HKTR) achieved 100%2 system availability, outperforming the target of 99.95%. The debt securities settlement service, including the Northbound and Southbound Bond Connect linkage service, continued to operate smoothly.\n\nAdoption of the FPS continued to increase in 2023, marking the significant milestone of the FPS reaching its fifth anniversary. The number of registrations for the FPS and the FPS turnover have grown steadily over the past five years, with the number of registrations growing to 13.6 million at the end of 2023 and the average daily turnover for the year rising by 33% from 2022. The increased use of the FPS for settling Government bills, making merchant payments, and topping up Stored Value Facility (SVF) e-wallets or bank accounts, were key drivers for the continued rise in the transaction volume, on top of steady growth in person-toperson and business payments.\n\nTo ensure the safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA oversees six designated retail payment systems (RPSs) and supervises 17 licensed SVFs (four of which are SVFs issued by licensed banks) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO). During the year, the HKMA also continued to facilitate the smooth implementation of the Government’s Consumption Voucher Scheme, helping to co-ordinate the relevant Government parties and the SVF licensees appointed for the scheme, and facilitate dialogue and co-operation between them.\n\nOn 27 December, the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau and the HKMA jointly issued a public consultation paper on regulation for stablecoin issuers. The HKMA subsequently introduced a sandbox arrangement on 12 March 2024 for institutions planning to issue fiat-referenced stablecoins in Hong Kong. At the same time, the HKMA has been actively participating in the work of international bodies in relation to crypto-asset activities, and monitoring the development of the market closely.\n\nInternationally, the HKMA has remained an active member of the central banking community and continued to play a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees. Currently, the HKMA co-chairs the Policy and Standards Group of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), as well as the Regional Consultative Group for Asia, the Non-Bank Monitoring Experts Group (until June) and the Financial Innovation Network of the Financial Stability Board (FSB). The HKMA also chairs the BIS’ Meeting of Governors from Major Emerging Market Economies (EMEs). Between 2018 and 2023, the HKMA served consecutive terms as the chair of the Working Group on Financial Markets established under the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP)3.\n\nThe HKMA also held bilateral meetings with the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates and the Saudi Central Bank in May and July respectively to promote investment and financial market connectivity between the Middle East and Asia. The sixth Hong Kong-Switzerland Financial Dialogue was held in Bern, Switzerland on 25 September, and the discussion covered topics on regional and domestic outlook and policy challenges, latest development, and potential collaboration in the areas of sustainable finance, fintech, and market connectivity.\n\n# A glance at the HKMA’s initiatives in 2023 in strengthening Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre\n\n# Strengthen connections with the world\n\n- Hosted series of international events: Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit, HKMA-BIS High-Level Conference and HKMA-BIS Joint Conference and Basel Committee meeting\n- Active participation in international central banking and regulatory forums\n- Stepped up market outreach to overseas and Mainland stakeholders to promote Hong Kong’s financial services and laid solid foundation for collaboration with Middle East\n\n# Enhance financial platform competitiveness\n\n- Promoted bond market innovation by assisting the Government to issue the world’s first tokenised government green bond\n- Supported dim sum bond issuances by Shenzhen and Hainan governments in Hong Kong\n- Signed Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the National Development and Reform Commission to support cross-border financing by Chinese enterprises in Hong Kong\n- Enhanced tax concession regimes for family offices and asset and wealth management industries\n- Continued raising Hong Kong’s value proposition as a Corporate Treasury Centre (CTC) hub and financing hub for infrastructure investments\n- Continued the development of Hong Kong’s treasury market and over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market\n- Consolidation of Hong Kong’s position as a regional green and sustainable finance hub\n\n# Ensure the reliability and efficiency of Hong Kong’s critical financial infrastructure\n\n- Continued to ensure the safe and efficient operation of the RTGS systems, CMU and the HKTR\n- Progressed with the upgrade of the CMU’s operational capacity and product offerings to develop the system into a major international central securities depository\n\n# Nurture future finance leaders and strengthen applied research capabilities\n\n- Continued the leadership development and research efforts by the Hong Kong Academy of Finance (AoF)\n\n# Deepen connectivity between the financial markets of Hong Kong and the Mainland and enhance Hong Kong’s role as an offshore renminbi business hub\n\n- Successful launch of Northbound Trading of Swap Connect\n- Enhancements to Cross-Boundary WMC\n- Designation of additional market makers for Southbound Trading under Bond Connect\n- Rollout of HKD-RMB Dual Counter Model and Dual Counter Market Making Programme\n- Good progress on initiatives to support corporates’ business operations and the livelihoods of residents in the GBA, e.g. enhanced cross-boundary fund flow management for GBA corporates, facilitative measures for Hong Kong residents on property purchases in GBA’s Mainland cities\n- Deepened exchanges between Mainland agencies and financial industry in Hong Kong to identify business opportunities\n\n# Reinforce Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia\n\n- Continued implementation of the “Fintech 2025” Strategy:\n    -

{"en": "# Reserves Management\n\nThe investment environment in 2023 was volatile and challenging. Although some banks in the US and Europe experienced liquidity issues at the beginning of the year, the associated risks did not spread across the financial markets. While levels of inflation in major developed economies have declined from their peak in 2023, they have remained above the targets set by major central banks. Following an aggressive rate hike cycle, the US Federal Reserve has paused hiking rate since the third quarter, and indicated that the policy rate was likely at or near its peak. This, coupled with a resilient US economy, has made investor sentiment more optimistic. However, ongoing geopolitical tensions, such as the Russia-Ukraine war and the outbreak of conflict in the Middle East during the year, added turbulence and uncertainties to the investment market. In this complicated and dynamic investment environment, the investment performance of the Exchange Fund experienced some ups and downs. Despite this, the Exchange Fund managed to achieve a decent investment return. In 2023, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$226.0 billion, representing an investment return of 5.5%.\n\n# The Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems in order to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The HKMA, under the delegated authority of the Financial Secretary and within the terms of the delegation, is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# Management of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(i) To preserve capital;\n(ii) To ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(iii) To ensure that sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(iv) Subject to (i)–(iii), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Exchange Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 Portfolio segregation of the Exchange Fund\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP). The BP holds highly liquid US dollardenominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base, as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The IP invests primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member economies of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, with a view to preserving the value and long-term purchasing power of its assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA diversifies part of the Exchange Fund’s investments in a prudent and incremental manner into a wider variety of asset classes. These include emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The target asset allocation of the LTGP is determined concurrently with that of other asset classes, subject to prudent risk management principles and portfolio diversification strategy.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007, holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that have been acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes. Due to its unique nature, the Strategic Portfolio is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by the Fiscal Reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP1. A major exception is the Future Fund2, which links its interest rate to the return of both the IP and the LTGP in accordance with the portfolio mix. The portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 35:65 in 2023.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: strategic asset allocation and tactical asset allocation. Strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents long-term asset allocation based on the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark (or strategic) allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and tracking error3 limit are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with the EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may assume positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nThe HKMA’s Exchange Fund Investment Office houses the Exchange Fund’s investment and related risk management functions. Exchange Fund Investment Office staff members directly manage about 71% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, comprising the entire BP and part of the IP. The part of the IP managed internally includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 29% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes. The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to realise sustainable returns, while also drawing on diverse and complementary investment styles and taking advantage of external market insights and technical expertise in investment.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is determined primarily by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nAs the investment environment becomes more complex, good risk management is increasingly important. The HKMA sets stringent controls and investment guidelines for both its internally and externally managed portfolios, and ensures that a proper risk monitoring and compliance system is in place. Three lines of defence are in place to implement effective risk management and governance of investment-related activities. Key risk categories (including credit, market, liquidity and operational risks) are regularly monitored. The risk management process provides a robust framework that supports the HKMA’s strategic planning and investment diversification efforts.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nThe HKMA believes that an appropriate emphasis on responsible investment and sustainable long-term economic performance can help better achieve the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund, as well as reduce risks associated with environmental, social and governance (ESG)-related matters of its underlying investments. To embrace responsible investment practices, the HKMA has integrated ESG factors into the investment processes of the Exchange Fund, with the guiding principle that priority will generally be given to ESG investments if their long-term risk-adjusted returns are comparable with other investments. For more details about the HKMA’s responsible investment work, see the Responsible Investment chapter of the Sustainability Report 2023.\n\n# Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\n# The financial markets in 2023\n\nThe investment environment in 2023 was volatile and challenging.\n\nGlobal equities were generally on an upward trend in 2023. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose by 24% during the year, especially in the fourth quarter as markets began to anticipate sooner-than-expected rate cuts.\n\nIn the bond markets, yields remained high, with the 10-year US Treasury yield surging above 5% at one point to reach its highest level since 2007. However, as market expectations of central banks’ monetary policies shifted, bond yields retreated towards the end of the year alongside a gradual increase in bond prices.\n\nIn the currency markets, the US dollar recorded a mixed performance against major currencies. Among these, the pound sterling and the euro appreciated against the US dollar, while the yen and the renminbi depreciated.\n\nThe performance of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2023 is shown in Table 1.\n\nTable 1 2023 market returns\n\n# Reserves Management\n\n# Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$226.0 billion in 2023. This comprised gains on bonds of HK$144.7 billion, gains on equities of HK$58.1 billion (with gains of HK$73.6 billion from foreign equities, and losses of HK$15.5 billion from Hong Kong equities), a negative currency translation effect of HK$0.5 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets, and gains of HK$23.7 billion on other investments held by the investment-holding subsidiaries of the Fund. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation loss of HK$4.8 billion.\n\nTotal assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,016.5 billion at the end of the year. The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$517.3 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$411.9 billion and real estate HK$105.4 billion. Outstanding investment commitments of the LTGP amounted to HK$291.1 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund in 2023, excluding the Strategic Portfolio, was 5.5%. The returns of the IP and the BP were 6.4% and 5.0% respectively. The LTGP has recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 11.8% since its inception in 2009.\n\nThe annual returns of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2023 are set out in Chart 1. Table 2 shows the 2023 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over several different time horizons. The average return was 1.6% during 2021–2023, 3.3% during 2019–2023, 2.7% during 2014–2023 and 4.5% since 1994.

The Annual Report 2022 received a Gold Award in the “Non-profit Making and Charitable Organizations” category, the highest ranking within the category, at the Hong Kong Management Association’s 2023 Best Annual Reports Awards. Meanwhile, the Sustainability Report 2022 won the ESG Award in the Public Sector/Not-for-profit (Large) Category of the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants’ Best Corporate Governance and ESG Awards 2023.\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA published two issues of its Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report and four issues of its Quarterly Bulletin, and regularly updated its Monthly Statistical Bulletin to provide up-to-date and thematic information on and analyses of monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. The HKMA also published 14 inSight1 articles in which it introduced major new policies and initiatives and discussed topical issues.\n\n# Corporate website\n\nThe corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk), with nearly 60,000 pages of content in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, is the public gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It contains the register of authorized institutions (AIs) and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance (BO), as well as the register of stored value facility licensees under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance.\n\nThe HKMA has been releasing financial data and important information on its website via an Open Application Programming Interface (Open API) in phases since 2018. By the end of 2023, the HKMA had opened up 175 sets of Open APIs on its website, in line with its target schedule.\n\nThe HKMA’s Open API portal:\n\n# Information Centre\n\nLocated on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre, the HKMA Information Centre consists of an exhibition area and a library designed to introduce the work of the HKMA to the community and enhance public awareness of monetary and banking matters. The interactive exhibition area presents an overview of the HKMA’s work, and of the development of money and banking in Hong Kong, along with information and exhibits useful for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nDuring the year, the Information Centre welcomed more than 31,000 visitors and hosted over 480 guided tours for schools and other groups.\n\nThe library, next to the exhibition area, houses over 26,000 books, journals and other publications on Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs as well as central banking topics.

To date, more than 66,000 people have participated in the public education programme. In 2023, a webinar was organised for over 1,200 students and teachers from 58 secondary schools. The webinar topics included an overview of the HKMA’s work, the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, protection of personal digital keys, the Deposit Protection Scheme, green finance, and career opportunities in the banking industry.\n\nThe HKMA educates and engages the public on how to be smart and responsible financial consumers. In light of the rise in phishing scams and credit card fraud, the HKMA continued its efforts across different media to remind the public to stay vigilant. A brand new awareness campaign was rolled out following the launch of the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter, emphasising that banks and major merchants have committed not to send hyperlinks via instant electronic messages soliciting personal and credit card information. The HKMA also passed on smart tips on credit cards, personal loans, online shopping, banking services and different payment options (including “Buy Now, Pay Later” products) via radio and social media channels.\n\nA new video and animations with cannibal plant and animal trap are produced with the theme “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!”\n\nCross-media publicity is produced reminding members of the public not to click on suspicious links\n\nAnimated video to promote e-laisees\n\nIn support of the environment, and drawing on technological advances in financial services, the HKMA encouraged members of the public to give out electronic lai sees (e-laisees) and to consider using good-as-new banknotes for physical lai sees over the Chinese New Year through social media and radio promotions.\n\nThe HKMA also seeks to enhance public understanding of the financial industry and raise young people’s interest in pursuing a career in the industry, thus enlarging Hong Kong’s talent pool for the financial industry. Following positive feedback for its earlier video series “Four Faces of Talents in Central”, the HKMA launched a new video series titled “Financial Special Forces: Unleashing New Horizons” that featured four growth areas in the financial industry: data science, fintech, green and sustainable finance, and wealth management. The video series utilised computer graphics and animation to show seasoned market practitioners supervising young talents as they managed daily work challenges, providing a light-touch introduction to career opportunities and prospects within the industry.\n\nA video series “Financial Special Forces: Unleashing New Horizons” is produced to keep the younger generation abreast of career opportunities in finance\n\nMentors from different areas sharing their expertise and experience with students\n\nTo enhance financial literacy among secondary school students, the HKMA worked with other stakeholders to co-organise the “Hong Kong Financial Literacy Championship” for the ninth consecutive year. Under the theme of digital and sustainable economy, the event helped students learn more about money management, green and sustainability, the current state of the financial market and career opportunities. It also included an online quiz that received around 20,000 submissions, mentoring by experienced practitioners from diverse areas, and design thinking challenge.\n\n# $mart Money Management 321\n\nThe HKMA launched its first financial education board game called “$mart Money Management 321”, which is jointly designed and developed with a social enterprise specialising in board game production. The board game was designed to help primary school students learn about different payment methods, money management concepts, fintech and cybersecurity in a simulated setting.\n\nThe HKMA took a booth at the Hong Kong Book Fair 2023 to promote the board game, which was one of the best-selling items at the Fair. In addition, the HKMA organised a series of free promotional activities, which included workshops in community centres, trials for students in primary schools, and train-the-trainer workshops for primary school teachers and social workers at non-governmental organisations, as well as running a “$mart Money Management Experiential Centre” at PMQ during the festive season.\n\nThe HKMA’s first financial education board game, “$mart Money Management 321”, and the “$mart Money Management Experiential Centre” receive several international design awards\n\nFollowing its launch at the Hong Kong Book Fair, the board game is promoted through train-the-trainer workshops, student trial sessions and an experiential centre at PMQ\n\nThe HKMA also collaborated with different stakeholders in a number of community engagement programmes. One of these was the second phase of a cross-generation outreach educational programme, organised jointly with an educational institution. It included a bank simulation game along with talks targeting kindergarten students, their parents and teachers, and young adults.\n\nThe HKMA continued to support the work of the Investor and Financial Education Council in promoting financial literacy and financial capacity in Hong Kong. It will explore further collaboration with different stakeholders to maximise the impact of its community engagement work.\n\n# Financial disclosure\n\nTo maintain a high level of transparency, the HKMA adopts international standards in financial disclosure insofar as they are applicable to central banking operations. These include the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and other applicable reporting requirements, such as the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard. The Finance Division works with external auditors and other accounting professionals to prepare and present the Exchange Fund’s financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards. The HKMA also provides detailed disclosures and thorough analyses of a wide range of expense items and budgetary information in its Annual Report.\n\n# Accountability and controls\n\n# Risk management\n\nOne of the HKMA’s most important tasks is to manage risks to the monetary and banking systems.

{"en": "# The Exchange Fund\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 211 to 311, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2023, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including material accounting policy information.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2023, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards. My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report. I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises all the information included in the 2023 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. I also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and\n- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nProf. LAM Chi Yuen Nelson\nDirector of Audit\n\n# 1 PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES\n\nThe Monetary Authority, under delegated authority from the Financial Secretary as Controller of the Exchange Fund (the Fund), manages the Fund in accordance with the provisions of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66). The principal activities of the Fund are safeguarding the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong and maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems.\n\nThe assets of the Fund are managed as four portfolios: the Backing Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio and the Strategic Portfolio. The assets of the Backing Portfolio fully match the Monetary Base, under Hong Kong’s Currency Board system. The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The Long-Term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments. The Strategic Portfolio holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited acquired by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government for the account of the Fund for strategic purposes. Operating segment information is set out in note 31.\n\n# 2 MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n# 2.1 Statement of compliance\n\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRSs), which is a collective term that includes all applicable individual HKFRSs, Hong Kong Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), and accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong. Material accounting policies adopted by the Fund and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) is set out below.\n\nThe HKICPA has issued certain new or revised HKFRSs that are first effective or available for early adoption for the current accounting period of the Group. Note 3 provides information on the changes, if any, in accounting policies resulting from initial application of these developments to the extent that they are relevant to the Group for the current and prior accounting periods reflected in these financial statements.\n\n# 2.2 Basis of preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe Group financial statements include the financial statements of the Group as well as the Group’s interests in associates and joint ventures. The principal activities of the principal subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are shown in notes 16 and 17.\n\nThe measurement basis used in the preparation of the financial statements is historical cost except for the following assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value:\n- derivative financial instruments (note 2.6);\n- financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value through income and expenditure account (note 2.6);\n- financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (note 2.6);\n- gold (note 2.10); and\n- investment properties (note 2.11).\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with HKFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nJudgements made by management in the application of HKFRSs that have significant effect on the financial statements and major sources of estimation uncertainty are disclosed in note 2.18.\n\nCertain comparative figures have been restated to conform to the current year presentation of the Group financial statements.\n\n# 2.3 Subsidiaries and non-controlling interests\n\nA subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. When assessing whether the Group has power, only substantive rights (held by the Group and other parties) are considered.\n", "zh": "# 頭攜基金\n\n# 主管審核報告\n\n# 獨立審核員致財政司司長的報告\n\n# 意見\n\n我證明，我已審核本集團（\"集團\"）所列於第211至311頁的財務報表，內容包括締結於2023年12月31日的頭攜基金及其附屬公司之資產負債表，以及其當年的收支帳目、全面收益表、權益變動表、現金流量表及財務報表附註，包括重大會計政策資料。\n\n依據我之意見，該等財務報表真實陳述了頭攜基金及集團於2023年12月31日的財務狀況，並反映其於該年之財務表現及現金流量，並符合由香港會計師公會（\"HKICPA\"）發出的香港財務報告準則（\"HKFRSs\"），亦已根據行政長官在《頭攜基金條例》（第66章）第7節下作出的指令於適當方式妥為編制。\n\n# 意見基礎\n\n我依照由行政長官根據《頭攜基金條例》（第66章）第7節所作的指令及審計署的審計標準進行審核。對這些標準下的責任詳述於我報告中「審計財務報表之審計責任」部分。我遵守這些標準並保持獨立，亦已履行我其他的道德義務。我相信我所取得的審計證據足以構成我意見的基礎。\n\n# 主要審計事項\n\n主要審計事項是指在我專業判斷中，在我審核2023年12月31日止年度財務報表的過程中最具重要性之事項。這些事項是在整體財務報表審核的背景下處理，並在形成我意見時已納入考量，且我不對這些事項發表獨立意見。\n\n# 其他資料\n\n貨幣管理局負責其他資料。其他資料包括2023年香港貨幣管理局年度報告中的所有資料，但不包括財務報表及我所作之審核員報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見不涵蓋該等其他資料，我亦不對其作出任何形式的保證結論。\n\n在審核財務報表過程中，我的責任是閱讀其他資料，並在此過程中考慮該等資料是否在實質上與財務報表或我獲得的審計認識不一致，或似乎存在重大錯誤。如根據我所執行的工作，認為該等資料有重大錯誤聲明，我有責報告該情況。本次我沒有此類報告。\n\n# 貨幣管理局及頭攜基金諮詢委員會審核小組對財務報表的責任\n\n貨幣管理局負責根據HKFRSs和由香港會計師公會（HKICPA）發出的指令，負責編製真實公正表述財務狀況的財務報表，並負責內部控制，以確保該等財務報表不含由於欺詐或錯誤而造成的重大錯誤。\n\n在編製財務報表時，貨幣管理局負責評估集團持續經營能力，披露與持續經營有關的事項（如適用），並採用持續經營基準進行會計。\n\n頭攜基金諮詢委員會的審核小組負責監督集團的財務報告流程。\n\n# 審核員對財務報表審核的責任\n\n我的目標是合理保證整體財務報表不存在由欺詐或錯誤引致的重要錯誤，我因此出具含有我意見的審核員報告。合理保證是一個較高的水平，但並非保證依照審計署審計標準進行的審核一定能發現存在的重大錯誤。錯誤可能由欺詐或錯誤產生，若單獨或合計影響用戶在依賴該等財務報表作出經濟決策時，則屬重大。\n\n作為審計署審計標準下的審核一部分，我在整個審核中行使專業判斷並保持專業懷疑態度。我亦：\n\n- 識別並評估由欺詐或錯誤引起的重大錯誤風險，設計並執行響應該等風險的審計程序，獲取足夠且適當的審計證據作為我意見的基礎。由欺詐引起的重大錯誤未被發現的風險高於由錯誤引起者，因為欺詐可能涉及串謀、偽造、故意遺漏、虛假陳述或內部控制的濫用；\n- 獲取對相關內部控制的理解，以設計適合情況的審計程序，但並非為了對集團內部控制的有效性發表意見；\n- 評估貨幣管理局所採用會計政策的適當性與合理性，並評價其會計估算與相關披露的合理性；\n- 根據審計證據，對貨幣管理局的持續經營基準使用的合理性作出結論，並判斷是否存在可能對集團持續經營能力構成重大疑慮的重大不確定性。如我認為存在重大不確定性，我必須在審核員報告中提請注意財務報表中的相關披露，或如披露不足則修正意見。我的結論基於已取得的審計證據，但未來的事件或條件可能導致集團停止持續經營；\n- 評價財務報表的整體呈現、結構和內容，包括披露內容，是否公允呈現了交易和事件的本質；\n- 獲取充足且適當的審計證據，以對集團內各實體或業務活動的財務資訊發表意見。本人負責指導、監督和執行集團審計，並且對我的審計意見負完全責任。\n\n我將有關審計範圍、時程以及重要審計結果，包括我在審核中發現的任何內部控制重大缺陷，與頭攜基金諮詢委員會的審核小組進行溝通。\n\n我亦向該委員會提供聲明，證明我已遵守相關獨立性道德規範，並會向其披露所有可能合理地影響我獨立性的關係及其他事項，必要時亦會披露相關保障措施。\n\n在與審核小組的溝通中，我確定本年度財務報表審核過程中最重要之事，即為主要審計事項。如法律或法規規定不得披露，或在特殊情況下，因披露會帶來較大不良後果，則我不會在報告中披露。\n\nProf. 林志遠 先生\n審計署署長"}

{"zh": "# 總裁報告\n\n2018年是全球金融危機發生十周年，十年間國際政經形勢經歷巨大轉變，當中不乏一幕幕超乎最佳編劇所能想像的場景。我在去年的年報指出，2017年金融市場表現是「喜出望外」，同時提到前景「潛藏隱憂」。回顧2018年，或許可形容為「先喜後悲」。環球多個股票指數在1月創出歷史新高後不久，熾熱的投資情緒旋即遇上中美貿易摩擦的冷鋒，加上英國脫歐談判一直拉鋸、地緣政治惡化、美聯儲四次加息等因素，市場樂觀氣氛急劇逆轉，資產價格在年內大幅下跌。MSCI全球指數從高點至低點曾下跌20.3%，全年累跌約一成，是2008年環球金融危機以來表現最差的一年。恒生指數從高點最多曾下跌26.7%，全年下挫13.6%，錄得七年來最大年度跌幅。\n\n# 聯匯穩健 信心所繫\n\n儘管外圍形勢波動難測，香港金融體系仍然保持穩健，貨幣市場運作暢順無阻。實施三十五年的聯繫匯率制度成功應對了資金流出港元的考驗。自環球金融危機爆發以來，累積約10,000億港元等值的資金流入港元。去年，隨着美國息率上升，港美息差持續擴闊，「沽港元、買美元」套息活動增加，港元兌美元匯率在年初轉弱，2005年制訂的「弱方兌換保證」，自4月首度觸發後，年內再觸發26次。金管局按照既定機制，履行「買港元、沽美元」的弱方兌換保證，有序、透明地在市場承接1,035億港元的港元沽盤。隨着資金流走，一個月香港銀行同業拆息在2018年內累升了105基點，而銀行亦在去年9月美國加息後，上調了最優惠利率。金管局多次和適時通過不同渠道向公眾闡釋「弱方兌換保證」的運作機制，令公眾了解資金流出港元是香港利率正常化的必經過程，也是聯匯制度的正常運作。國際貨幣基金組織在去年年底重申支持香港聯匯制度的立場，特區政府也強調聯匯是香港貨幣穩定的基石。這都有助於穩定香港市民對聯繫匯率的信心。\n\n# 銀行體系 穩中有進\n\n2008年環球金融危機暴露了全球金融系統潛藏的種種弊端及隱患，促使國際間在過去十年協調推出一系列針對金融市場、金融機構的改革，包括在銀行業監管方面，提升企業管治和風險管理。金管局的銀行監管工作重點針對兩方面：一是着眼於銀行資產負債風險的審慎監管，二是銀行的行為操守，二者不可偏廢。資產負債風險監管方面，金管局作為巴塞爾銀行監管委員會(Basel Committee on Banking Supervision)及二十國集團轄下金融穩定理事會(FinancialStability Board)成員，有責任全面落實國際監管標準，確保香港銀行業穩健審慎地經營業務。去年底香港銀行資本充足率達20.3%，不但遠高於國際最低標準要求的8%，也較環球金融危機時的14.7%水平顯著提升。大型銀行去年第四季平均流動覆蓋比率達167.6%，同樣遠高於法定最低要求的90%。與此同時，為避免重蹈環球金融危機時需動用公帑拯救「大得不能倒」金融機構的覆轍，金融穩定理事會制訂了關於金融機構處置機制的國際標準。香港是亞洲區內少數已經全面落實符合機制要求的地區之一，金管局下設的處置機制辦公室正落實該機制的操作細則，要求銀行推行結構性變動令處置預案在需要時能有效實施，去年亦推出了《吸收虧損能力規則》，未來還會陸續推出更多相關規則。\n\n鑑於樓價持續上升，金管局未雨綢繆，在2009至2017年間共推出八輪逆周期措施，確保一旦地產市況逆轉，本港銀行體系有足夠的抗震能力應對衝擊。這些措施成效顯著：新造住宅平均按揭成數由2009年的64%降至2018年底的46%；平均供款與入息比率亦由2010年的41%下調至2018年底的34%。年內銀行信貸錄得4.4%的溫和增長，整體資產質素維持良好，零售銀行不良貸款比率進一步降至0.5%，遠低於國際及本港歷史平均水平。去年銀行業盈利持續增長，整體股東權益回報率連升兩年至13%；多家國際性銀行集團在本港的業務交出了不俗的成績表，成為集團盈利的重要支柱。\n\n# 穩善文化 上行下效\n\n在監管銀行的行為操守方面，金管局在2010年增設銀行操守部，促進銀行公平待客，並加強保障消費者權益。要做到標本兼治，除了訂出各種針對銀行營運基本操守的監管要求外，我們近年來大力推動改革銀行文化，鼓勵銀行循管治、獎勵制度、評估與回饋機制三方面推動穩善文化，務求銀行內部做到上行下效，在根本上恢復、提升客戶對銀行的信任和尊重。繼2017年金管局向全港銀行提供具體的指引，金管局在2018年底進一步推出銀行文化的監管措施，包括要求銀行就企業文化和落實有關措施作出自我評估等，令穩善銀行文化的三大支柱能有效執行。\n\n雖然互聯網和移動金融是全球趨勢，金管局去年仍繼續促進普及金融，照顧未能應用新科技的社群。例如我們連同香港銀行公會推動便利店推出長者透過「易辦事」免購物提款服務，有關便利店網絡已增至逾300家；我們並聯絡香港郵政在7家主要位於離島和新界的郵政局推出長者提款易服務。銀行業界響應金管局的建議，年內積極增加無障礙設施，提供傷健共融的銀行服務，例子之一是設有聲音導航的自動櫃員機數目一年內增加逾十倍至超過700部。另外，在金管局積極推動下，我們預期將會陸續有銀行在偏遠地區開設更多實體分行和增設流動銀行服務，便利市民。\n\n# 智慧銀行 嶄新體驗\n\n金管局與銀行和科技業界緊密合作，在2017年9月啟動「智慧銀行新紀元」，推動香港金融科技發展和創新，為市民帶來嶄新的支付和銀行服務體驗。2018年的亮點，無疑是在9月正式開通的「轉數快」。它是全球獨一無二的零售快速支付系統，打破香港各種電子支付工具和銀行帳戶之間的屏障，讓市民享受全年無休的港元和人民幣即時轉帳服務。金管局還同步推出全球首個「共用二維碼」標準和應用程式，商戶可憑單個二維碼接通多個電子支付系統。「轉數快」推出以來深受市民歡迎，短短半年，登記紀錄已逾258萬個，日均交易量達6萬宗，平均每宗金額分別20,700港元和38,000元人民幣。\n\n去年5月，金管局發出虛擬銀行的認可指引，隨即有33家機構提交虛擬銀行牌照的申請。截至今年四月中，四個牌照已經發出，預期它們將於年內正式投入營運。虛擬銀行有助推動香港金融科技發展和創新，為個人和中小企提供嶄新服務和體驗，並促進普及金融。\n\n此外，金管局在7月發布開放應用程式介面(OpenAPI)框架，銀行將分四階段開放產品和服務的對外接口，開創更靈活、更開放的金融科技環境，讓銀行客戶更便捷地整合帳戶資料、獲取資訊，選取貼合自己需要的服務。年內，共有42項新科技產品使用金管局的金融科技監管沙盒進行測試，當中28項完成試行，有關產品和服務已順利推出市場。\n\n金管局聯同多家銀行研發的「貿易聯動」去年10月正式啟用，這個採用「分布式分類帳技術」的貿易融資平台，將提升銀行審批貿易融資的效率。「貿易聯動」目前正在測試連接其他地區相關平台，以促進跨境貿易融資活動。\n\n金融科技不但廣泛應用於日常生活，近年更走進合規和監管領域。金管局鼓勵銀行運用合規科技(Regtech)協助處理日常營運如監察涉嫌洗錢和恐怖分子資金籌集的可疑活動。與此同時金管局正研究使用監管科技(Suptech)，進一步提升監管工作的效率和成效。\n\n# 金融實力 鞏固提升\n\n國際金融中心之間是軟實力的較量，我們要不斷順應經濟社會和科技發展的變化，把握機遇，不斷為香港金融業開拓新的發展空間。綠色金融就是香港開拓債券和項目融資市場的一個重大機遇。金管局支持和配合特區政府發展綠色金融，除了配合特區政府籌備1,000億港元的政府綠色債券發行計劃，我們去年還舉辦多場綠色金融研討會，包括兩場國際大型會議，以提升市場對綠色金融的認識、了解和參與，並鼓勵發行機構參與政府去年推出的綠色債券資助計劃和香港的綠色金融認證服務。去年在港發行綠色債券規模逾110億美元，相等於2017年的三倍多。\n\n近年來投資界對基建和相關項目興趣日濃。金管局於2016年成立基建融資促進辦公室(IFFO)，合作夥伴至今已倍增至95家機構，成為區內基建融資的重要交流平台。去年金管局與國務院國有資產監督管理委員會（國資委）首次合辦高層圓桌會議，討論香港為中央國有企業「走出去」的獨特優勢和作用，為央企與香港金融、專業服務界日後共拓發展機遇奠下良好基礎。\n", "en": "# President's Report\n\n2018 marked the tenth anniversary of the global financial crisis. Over the past decade, the international political and economic landscape has undergone tremendous changes, with many scenes beyond the imagination of the best scriptwriters. In last year’s annual report, I noted that the performance of financial markets in 2017 was \"beyond expectations,\" while also mentioning that the outlook \"concealed underlying concerns.\" Looking back at 2018, perhaps it can be described as \"initial joy followed by subsequent sadness.\" Shortly after multiple global stock indices reached historic highs in January, the overheated investment sentiment was met with the cooling effect of Sino-US trade frictions. Coupled with ongoing Brexit negotiations, escalating geopolitical tensions, and four Federal Reserve rate hikes, market optimism rapidly reversed, leading to significant asset price declines during the year. The MSCI worldwide index dropped 20.3% from its peak to its trough and recorded an overall decline of about 10% for the year, marking the worst performance since the global financial crisis in 2008. The Hang Seng Index at its peak fell by as much as 26.7%, ending the year down 13.6%, and posted the largest annual decline in seven years.\n\n# Linked Exchange Rate System Steady; Confidence Anchored\n\nDespite unpredictable external fluctuations, Hong Kong’s financial system remained stable, with smooth operation of the currency market. The thirty-five-year-old Linked Exchange Rate System successfully responded to the challenge of outflows of funds from Hong Kong dollars. Since the outbreak of the global financial crisis, approximately HKD 1 trillion equivalent has been inflowed into the Hong Kong dollar. Last year, as U.S. interest rates rose, the Hong Kong-U.S. interest rate differential continued to widen, increasing the carry trade activities of selling HK dollars and buying U.S. dollars. The HK dollar depreciated against the USD at the beginning of the year, and since the first trigger of the \"Weak-side Exchange Guarantee\" established in 2005 in April, this mechanism was triggered 26 more times during the year. The HKMA, following established protocols, fulfilled the \"buy HK dollars, sell USD\" obligation under the Guarantee, orderly and transparently absorbing HKD 103.5 billion in sell orders. As capital flowed out, the average Hong Kong interbank offer rate rose by 105 basis points within the year. Following the U.S. rate hike last September, banks also increased their best lending rates. The HKMA frequently and appropriately explained the operation of the \"Weak-side Exchange Guarantee\" to the public through various channels, helping the public understand that capital outflows are a normal part of interest rate normalization and the functioning of the linked exchange rate system. The International Monetary Fund reaffirmed its support for Hong Kong’s Linked Exchange Rate System at the end of last year, and the HKSAR Government emphasized that the system is the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary stability. These efforts have contributed to maintaining public confidence in the linked exchange rate policy.\n\n# Banking Sector: Stable Progress\n\nThe 2008 global financial crisis exposed the underlying deficiencies and risks within the international financial system. Over the past decade, international efforts coordinated the implementation of reforms targeting financial markets and institutions, including strengthening corporate governance and risk management in banking regulation. The HKMA’s banking supervision focuses on two aspects: prudential supervision of asset and liability risks, and the conduct of banks. Both are equally important. On prudential standards, as a member of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the Financial Stability Board under the G20, the HKMA has the responsibility to fully implement international regulatory standards to ensure the sound and prudent operation of Hong Kong banks. By the end of last year, Hong Kong’s total capital adequacy ratio reached 20.3%, far exceeding the minimum international standard of 8% and significantly higher than the 14.7% level during the global financial crisis. Large banks' average liquidity coverage ratio in the fourth quarter was 167.6%, well above the statutory minimum of 90%. Meanwhile, to prevent a recurrence of the “too big to fail” rescue scenario in the crisis, the Financial Stability Board established international standards for resolution mechanisms for financial institutions. Hong Kong is among the few regions in Asia to have fully implemented such mechanisms. The HKMA’s Resolution Office is now operational, implementing detailed procedures to ensure banks can effectively carry out structural changes and resolution plans when needed. In 2018, the HKMA also introduced the \"Loss Absorption Capacity Regulations,\" with more related rules to follow in the future.\n\nGiven the persistent rise in property prices, the HKMA proactively implemented eight countercyclical measures between 2009 and 2017, ensuring that the banking sector in Hong Kong has sufficient resilience to weather market reversals. The results are notable: the average mortgage loan-to-value ratio for new residential properties decreased from 64% in 2009 to 46% at the end of 2018; the average debt service-to-income ratio also fell from 41% in 2010 to 34% at year-end 2018. During the year, bank credit grew moderately by 4.4%, and overall asset quality remained good, with retail banking non-performing loan ratio further dropping to 0.5%, well below international and Hong Kong historical averages. Last year, the banking industry’s profitability continued to grow, with the overall return on shareholders’ equity increasing for two consecutive years to 13%. Several international banking groups posted strong results in Hong Kong, becoming a significant profit pillar for their groups.\n\n# Culture of Stability and Goodness: Leading by Example\n\nOn the conduct of banks’ behavior, the HKMA established the Banking Conduct Department in 2010 to promote fair treatment of customers and strengthen protection of consumer rights. To achieve both diagnosis and cure, besides setting various regulatory requirements on basic operational conduct, we have actively promoted a culture of stability and goodness in banks, encouraging adherence through governance, reward systems, and assessment and feedback mechanisms. The aim is to foster a top-down effect within banks, restoring and enhancing customer trust and respect. Following specific guidelines issued to all banks in 2017, the HKMA further launched supervisory measures at the end of 2018, including requiring banks to carry out self-assessments on corporate culture and related measures, ensuring the three pillars of a stable and good banking culture are effectively implemented.\n\nAlthough the internet and mobile finance are global trends, the HKMA continued to promote financial inclusion last year, taking care of communities unable to adopt new technologies. For example, together with the Hong Kong Association of Banks, we promoted the \"Easy Cash\" withdrawal service at convenience stores for the elderly. The network of participating convenience stores has expanded to more than 300 locations. We also coordinated with Hongkong Post to introduce Elderly Cash Withdrawal service at seven major post offices in outlying islands and the New Territories. In response to the HKMA’s recommendations, banks actively increased barrier-free facilities during the year, providing inclusive banking services. One example is the more than tenfold increase in ATMs with voice navigation, now exceeding 700 units. Additionally, under the HKMA’s proactive promotion, more banks are expected to open additional branches and mobile banking services in remote areas, making it easier for citizens to access banking.\n\n# Smart Banking: A Brand-New Experience\n\nThe HKMA, in close collaboration with banks and the tech industry, launched the \"Smart Banking Era\" in September 2017 to promote the development and innovation of financial technology in Hong Kong, providing citizens with a new and innovative payment and banking experience. A major highlight in 2018 was the official launch of Faster Payment System (\"FPS\") in September. It is a unique retail real-time payment system worldwide, breaking down barriers between various electronic payment tools and bank accounts in Hong Kong, allowing citizens to enjoy 24/7 real-time transfer services in Hong Kong dollars and Renminbi. The HKMA also introduced the world's first “Shared QR Code” standard and application, enabling merchants to connect to multiple electronic payment systems via a single QR code. Since its launch, FPS has been very well received by the public, with over 2.58 million registrations in just six months, daily transaction volume reaching 60,000, with average transaction amounts of HKD 20,700 and Renminbi 38,000 respectively.\n\nLast May, the HKMA issued guidelines on the recognition of virtual banks, and 33 institutions submitted applications for virtual banking licenses. As of mid-April this year, four licenses have been granted, and they are expected to officially commence operations within the year. Virtual banks will facilitate the development and innovation of Hong Kong’s financial technology, offering fresh services and experiences to individuals and SMEs, and promoting financial inclusion.\n\nMoreover, in July, the HKMA announced an Open API framework, initiating a four-phase process to open up external interfaces of banking products and services, creating a more flexible and open financial technology environment. This will enable bank customers to more easily integrate account information, access information, and select services tailored to their needs. Within the year, 42 new technological products used the HKMA’s FinTech supervisory sandbox for testing, among which 28 completed testing and were successfully launched to the market.\n\nThe HKMA, together with several banks, launched the \"Trade Connect\" in October last year. This trade finance platform, based on Distributed Ledger Technology, will enhance the efficiency of approval processes for trade financing by banks. The platform is currently testing connections with related platforms in other regions to promote cross-border trade financing activities.\n\nFinancial technology is not only widely applied in daily life but has increasingly entered compliance and regulatory areas in recent years. The HKMA encourages banks to utilize RegTech to assist in daily operations such as monitoring suspicious activities related to money laundering and terrorist financing. At the same time, the HKMA is investigating the use of SupTech to further improve the efficiency and effectiveness of supervision.\n\n# Strengthening Financial Power\n\nAmong international financial centers, soft power competition is fierce. We must continuously adapt to economic, social, and technological changes, seize opportunities, and constantly open new development spaces for Hong Kong’s financial industry. Green finance presents a major opportunity for Hong Kong to expand its bond and project financing markets. The HKMA supports and cooperates with the SAR Government in developing green finance. Besides preparing for the Government’s HKD 100 billion Green Bond issuance program, we also hosted multiple green finance seminars last year, including two major international conferences, to raise awareness and participation in green finance. We also encouraged issuers to participate in the Government’s Green Bond Funding Scheme and Hong Kong Green Finance Certification services launched last year. Last year, Hong Kong issued over USD 11 billion in green bonds, more than tripling the volume in 2017.\n\nIn recent years, investor interest in infrastructure and related projects has grown significantly. In 2016, the HKMA established the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO), whose partners have now increased to 95 institutions, becoming an important platform for infrastructure financing exchanges in the region.

The HKMA was subsequently established on April 1, 1993.\n\nThe powers, functions, and responsibilities of the supervisor of banking are explicitly specified in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the Banking Ordinance, the Financial Institutions (Dispute Resolution Mechanism) Ordinance, the Deposit Protection Scheme Ordinance, the Payments Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, and other relevant ordinances. The exchange of correspondence between the Financial Secretary and the supervisor of banking on June 25, 2003, sets out the allocation of responsibilities and functions in monetary and financial affairs, also disclosing the transfer of certain powers to the supervisor. This correspondence is a public document and can be viewed on the HKMA website.\n\nThe Exchange Fund is established under the Exchange Fund Ordinance and is controlled by the Financial Secretary. The Ordinance stipulates that the main use of the Exchange Fund is to influence the pegged exchange rate of the HK dollar. The Financial Secretary may also deploy the Exchange Fund to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong's monetary and financial system, thereby supporting Hong Kong's position as an international financial centre.\n\nUnder the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the supervisor of banking is appointed to assist the Financial Secretary in implementing his functions conferred by the Ordinance, as well as executing other ordinances and responsibilities assigned by the Financial Secretary. The office of the supervisor of banking is known as the HKMA, and the supervisor is the HKMA Chief Executive.\n\nThe supervisor of banking, in accordance with the powers and responsibilities granted under the Banking Ordinance, regulates and supervises banking activities and deposit-taking activities. Under the Ordinance, the supervisor is responsible for approval of licenses and recognition status for licensed banks, restricted licence banks, and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong.\n\nThe Financial Institutions (Dispute Resolution Mechanism) Ordinance designates the supervisor of banking as the resolution authority for banking entities. It grants the supervisor a series of powers to orderly resolve relevant entities to reduce risks posed to the stability and effective operation of Hong Kong’s financial system arising from the unsustainable operation of such entities.\n\nThe Securities and Futures Ordinance and the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Ordinance provide the supervisor of banking with certain powers concerning securities and MPF business.\n\nThe Insurance Ordinance grants the supervisor of banking the authority to investigate and examine banks’ insurance business.\n\nThe Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) Ordinance empowers the supervisor of banking to oversee banks’ compliance with the regulations.\n\nThe Deposit Protection Scheme Ordinance assigns the supervisor of banking the responsibility to assist in the operation of the Deposit Protection Scheme, and to disburse compensations to depositors of insolvent banks from the Scheme’s fund.\n\nUnder the statutory framework of the Payments Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, the supervisor of banking may designate and supervise gross settlement and clearing systems critical to Hong Kong currency or financial stability or that perform essential functions for Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre. The Ordinance also authorizes the supervisor to regulate the licensing of stored value facilities and designate retail payment systems, monitoring their operation for safety and efficiency.\n\n# HKMA and the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region\n\nThe HKMA is part of the Hong Kong SAR government framework but may employ staff under terms different from civil servants to attract individuals with appropriate experience and expertise. The Chief Executive of the HKMA and its staff are civil servants. The daily operation of the HKMA is highly autonomous within the legal powers conferred or delegated to the supervisor of banking.\n\nThe Financial Secretary is responsible for defining Hong Kong’s monetary policy goals and monetary regime. In a letter to the supervisor of banking dated June 25, 2003, the Financial Secretary specified that monetary stability should be maintained through the issue of currency, keeping the Hong Kong dollar's exchange rate around 7.80 HKD to 1 USD. The supervisor of banking must independently achieve monetary policy objectives, including determining related strategies, tools, and implementation methods, and is responsible for maintaining the stability and soundness of Hong Kong’s monetary system.\n\nAssisted by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, the Financial Secretary is responsible for policies to maintain the stability and soundness of Hong Kong’s financial system and for keeping Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre. To implement these policies, the supervisor of banking’s duties include:\n- Promoting the overall stability and effective operation of the banking system\n- Collaborating with relevant institutions and organizations to develop the debt market\n- Handling issuance and circulation of legal tender notes and coins\n- Developing payment, settlement, and clearing systems, and operating these systems when appropriate to ensure the safety and efficiency of financial infrastructure\n- Working with other relevant institutions to promote confidence in Hong Kong’s currency and financial system, and to implement appropriate market development measures to enhance Hong Kong’s international financial competitiveness.\n\nThe Exchange Fund remains controlled by the Financial Secretary. The supervisor of banking is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund, based on delegated authority.\n\n# Accountability and Transparency\n\nThe HKMA has consistently maintained high levels of autonomy in its daily operations and policy implementation, complemented by high accountability and transparency.\n\nIt is committed to promoting stability in the monetary and banking systems, effectively managing official reserves, developing and overseeing robust and diversified financial infrastructure, thereby consolidating Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre, and supporting economic development.\n\nEffective performance of its duties depends on gaining public confidence. Therefore, the HKMA diligently explains its policies and operations to the public, and actively addresses social issues within its responsibilities.\n\nAppointed by the Financial Secretary, the supervisor of banking reports to the public through the Financial Secretary; as its powers are established by legislation enacted by the Legislative Council, the HKMA also reports to the public through the Legislative Council. Furthermore, the HKMA recognizes its broader responsibility to foster public understanding of its role and objectives and to closely monitor issues of social concern. In its daily work and in maintaining broad social engagement, the HKMA upholds policies to enhance transparency and openness. These policies aim to:\n- Maximize public and financial sector understanding of the HKMA’s work within statutory limits concerning market sensitivity, commercial secrets, and confidential information disclosures;\n- Ensure the HKMA remains attuned to societal sentiments and responds appropriately to public opinions.\n\nIn terms of transparency, the HKMA strives to meet the highest international standards. It maintains extensive contact with the media, publishes various bilingual journals and special publications. Its bilingual website (www.hkma.gov.hk), features dedicated sections on economic research, statistical data, consumer information, and other topics, as well as publications, press releases, speeches, and briefing materials issued by the HKMA. Additionally, the HKMA utilizes social media platforms for more effective communication with the public in the digital age. The HKMA’s offices feature a information centre, comprising a library and an exhibition area, open six days a week to the public. It also hosts public education activities, including seminars and guided tours at the information centre, to explain the HKMA’s work, especially to students, and to enhance financial literacy among citizens. Details on HKMA’s media relations, publications, and public education activities can be found in the chapter \"Institutional Functions.\"\n\nThe HKMA’s frequency of disclosing information about the Exchange Fund and the note-issuing account has gradually increased and the disclosures have become more detailed. Since 1999, the HKMA has participated in the International Monetary Fund's Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) for central banks. It also publishes minutes of meetings of the Currency Board Sub-Committee within the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, and reports on the operation of the currency issuance system. Since 1996, the HKMA’s website has also included banking supervision policies and guidelines.\n\nThe relationship between the HKMA and the Legislative Council is crucial for enhancing accountability and transparency. The HKMA’s chief executive commits to briefing the Financial Services and Treasury Committee of the Legislative Council three times a year on HKMA’s work and policies, and responding to inquiries. HKMA representatives also regularly attend meetings of the Financial Services and Treasury Committee and the Bills Committee, clarifying and discussing special issues, and assisting legislators in reviewing legislative proposals.\n\n# Advisory and Other Committees\n\n# Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\n\nWhen the Financial Secretary exercises control over the Exchange Fund, he consults the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee. The committee was established under section 3(1) of the Exchange Fund Ordinance. This section stipulates that the Financial Secretary must consult the committee when exercising control over the Exchange Fund. The Financial Secretary is the ex officio chair of the committee, with other members (including the supervisor of banking) appointed in their personal capacity by the Financial Secretary under the authority delegated by the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong SAR. Members are appointed for their professional expertise and experience, including in currency, finance, economics, investment, accounting, management, business, and law, making the committee highly beneficial.\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee has five dedicated sub-committees responsible for overseeing specific aspects of the HKMA’s work, reporting to and advising the Financial Secretary through the main committee. In 2018, the committee held five meetings, discussing various matters related to the HKMA’s work, most of which had been reviewed beforehand by the relevant sub-committees.\n\nThe Governance Committee oversees the performance of the HKMA and makes recommendations to the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee on its remuneration, staff policies, budget, administration, and governance issues. It also held five meetings in 2018, covering the HKMA’s expenditure budget, performance evaluations, annual salary reviews, and strategic planning. The committee also reviews the HKMA’s periodic work reports.\n\nThe Audit Committee reviews the HKMA’s financial reporting procedures and assesses whether its internal control systems are adequate and effective, as well as preparing reports. The committee reviews the HKMA’s financial statements, the components of those statements, and the accounting principles applied, conducting audits in conjunction with external and internal auditors. Members of the Audit Committee have no executive functions at the HKMA. In 2018, the committee held two meetings, reviewing work reports from the Risk Management Committee and the Internal Audit Department.\n\nThe Currency Issuance Committee monitors the operation of the currency issuance system and reports on its status as a pillar of the linked exchange rate system. The committee ensures that the currency issuance system functions according to policy, proposes improvements, and maintains high transparency. The HKMA regularly publishes minutes of meetings of the Currency Issuance Committee and reports on the operation of the currency issuance system. In 2018, the committee held four meetings."}

As the global economy growth slows down, Hong Kong’s economic growth in 2019 is also expected to slow.\n\n# Economic Review\n\n# Real Economic Activities\n\nIn 2018, Hong Kong’s economy further expanded, but the annual growth rate gradually slowed from 4.6% in the first quarter to 1.3% in the fourth quarter (Table 1), dragging the full-year growth rate down from 3.8% in 2017 to 3.0%. The economic expansion weakened, reflecting slowing local demand growth and continued drag from net exports (Figure 1). Domestically, private consumption grew strongly in the first quarter, but thereafter the growth momentum diminished, partly due to increased uncertainties from rising trade protectionism and asset price adjustments leading to a wealth reduction effect. Due to fragile business confidence, overall investment growth also slowed. In external trade, merchandise exports remained roughly stable in the first three quarters but declined significantly in the fourth quarter amid heightening US-China trade tensions. Merchandise imports also slowed as demand driven by exports weakened. Conversely, service exports registered a faster annual growth, partly benefited from a booming inbound tourism industry, while service imports remained roughly steady amid growth in transportation, business, and other services. On a net basis, the trade surplus turned into a small deficit in 2018 from a surplus in 2017, thereby exerting a drag on the local economy.\n\nTable 1 Real GDP growth by expenditure item (compared with previous period)\n\nNote: The seasonally adjusted quarterly change of gross fixed capital formation is not specified.\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\nFigure 1 Contribution of components to real GDP growth\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Monetary Condition\n\nMainly impacted by the carry trade activities driven by negative interest rate differentials between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar, the HKD/USD exchange rate generally depreciated in 2018. Notably, the weak-side exchange guarantee was triggered in April, May, and August, prompting the HKMA to buy HKD and sell USD at the linked exchange rate of 7.85 HKD per USD as stipulated under the Linked Exchange Rate System. Under this system’s design, the Hong Kong dollar monetary base contracted, indicating a reduction in interbank liquidity, while market expectations of US rate hikes caused overall Hong Kong dollar interbank lending rates to rise. As the cost of funds for banks increased, after the federal funds rate target range was raised in late September, banks also increased their best lending rates by 12.5 to 25 basis points. Regarding credit growth, due to the slowing of the local economy and weaker external trade performance, the overall increase in bank loans significantly decelerated from 16.1% in 2017 to 4.4% in 2018.\n\n# Inflation\n\nInflationary pressures increased slightly in 2018. After excluding the impact of one-off government relief measures, the core inflation rate rose from 1.7% in 2017 to 2.6% in 2018, remaining at a mild level. Among the components, housing rental prices increased more rapidly, reflecting the earlier rise in new private residential rents (Figure 2). Broader analysis indicated that growth in nominal labor costs and commercial property rents also accelerated slightly, making local cost pressures more apparent. As inflation rose in key source countries of imports, import price inflation also increased accordingly.\n\nFigure 2 Core Consumer Price Inflation\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Labour Market\n\nThe labour market remained resilient in 2018 (Figure 3). The unemployment rate declined from 3.1% for the whole of 2017 to 2.8% in 2018, the lowest since 1997. Unemployment in most major service industries also fell, especially in accommodation and food services. As total employment and vacancies in private sector increased further, overall labour demand continued to strengthen, while the labour force participation rate slightly rose. With tightening labour market conditions, real wages and incomes further increased.\n\nFigure 3 Labour Market Conditions\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Stock Market\n\nHong Kong’s stock market saw a sharp reversal in 2018. Driven by a strong upward momentum in the Hang Seng Index in 2017, it reached a historical high of 33,484 points in January 2018 (Figure 4). However, concerns among investors increased due to tightening monetary policies by major central banks, escalating US-China trade tensions, and slowing domestic growth, resulting in a rapid deterioration of market sentiment. The Hang Seng Index fell to a low of 24,586 in October, and ended the year at 25,846, down 13.6% from a year earlier. Nonetheless, the average daily trading volume increased from HKD 88.2 billion in 2017 to HKD 107.4 billion, and the total proceeds from the initial public offerings in Hong Kong surged significantly due to listings of companies engaged in emerging and innovative industries.\n\nFigure 4 Property Prices\nSource: Ratings and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\n\n# Property Market\n\nThe residential property market remained buoyant in the first half of 2018 but cooled in the second half amid escalating US-China trade tensions, adjustments in global equities, and rising prime lending rates. Overall housing prices fell by 9% from the peak between July and December; however, they still recorded an overall increase of 2% for the year (Figure 4). Due to a significant decline in transactions in both primary and secondary markets in the second half, property transaction volume dropped by 7% to 57,247 cases compared with the previous year. Furthermore, housing affordability remained tight, with the price-to-income ratio and mortgage-to-income ratio at 17.0 and 75.7 respectively, both well above long-term averages. Meanwhile, prices of non-residential properties generally increased in 2018 but showed some decline towards the end of the year. Overall, prices and rents rose further, with rental yields remaining at low levels.\n\n# Economic Outlook\n\n# Economic Environment\n\nGiven the global slowdown, Hong Kong’s economic growth in 2019 is expected to slow down. External challenges such as trade tensions and uncertainties regarding US monetary policy are expected to continue weighing on Hong Kong’s exports. Domestically, despite low unemployment and rising household incomes supporting private consumption, weaker consumer confidence and wealth diminishment caused by earlier asset price adjustments may slow private consumption growth. While increased housing supply is expected to support steady growth in construction and property activities, heightened economic uncertainties could lead firms to adopt a more cautious stance on capital investment. The government projects real GDP growth for 2019 to be between 2% and 3%, with private sector analysts’ latest forecasts averaging around 2.3%.\n\n# Inflation and Labour Market\n\nDue to the global slowdown, including that of Hong Kong, external price pressures and domestic cost pressures are expected to be kept in check, maintaining moderate inflation in 2019. Recent declines in new private rental prices will also help suppress inflation. Consensus among market participants forecasts a 2019 overall inflation rate of 2.2%, while the government’s estimate for core inflation is 2.5%. With continued economic growth and sustained inbound tourism, the labour market is expected to remain tight. Private sector analysts forecast the unemployment rate to stay around 3% in 2019.\n\n# Uncertainties and Risks\n\nThe outlook for the Hong Kong economy in 2019 remains subject to various uncertainties and risks, including trade tensions, the future direction of US monetary policy, Mainland China’s economic performance, Brexit developments, and other geopolitical tensions. Furthermore, if these uncertainties persist long-term, market sentiment and business confidence could be severely affected, exerting downward pressure on the local asset market and real economy activities.\n\nAdditionally, the outlook for the residential property sector is uncertain due to multiple external and local factors. External influences such as US-China trade tensions could impact market sentiment, economic prospects, and financial conditions, casting a shadow over Hong Kong’s property outlook. Locally, despite the economic slowdown, employment and income levels remain relatively stable, potentially supporting housing demand. Hong Kong interest rates are partly dependent on future US policy rate adjustments, which are uncertain. In the long term, increased housing completion volume in recent years and ongoing government efforts to increase land and housing supply may narrow the housing supply-demand gap.\n\n# Banking System Performance\n\nDespite increasing external challenges such as trade tensions, Brexit, and normalization of interest rates causing volatility in financial markets, Hong Kong’s banking system remained resilient in 2018. The capital and liquidity positions remained sound, and asset quality stayed good. Rising interest rates widened the interest margins, significantly boosting banks’ profitability.\n\n# Asset and Liability Trends\n\nIn 2018, the banking sector continued to grow steadily, with a 5.9% expansion of the balance sheet. Facing ongoing uncertainties such as trade conflicts and rate hikes among major economies, firms became more cautious about obtaining new loans. The total loan volume growth slowed markedly from 16.1% in 2017 to 4.4% in 2018. The expansion was mainly driven by loans used within Hong Kong (+6.5%) and those used outside Hong Kong (+2%). Conversely, trade finance declined by 7.6%, amid uncertain global trade environment. Growth in loans related to Mainland China also slowed from 17.5% in 2017 to 1.4% in 2018.\n\nThe total amount of debt securities held by the banking sector continued to account for 22% of total assets at the end of 2018, unchanged from 2017. Since most of these debt securities are investment-grade bonds issued by governments and banks, the associated credit risk remains low.\n\nOn the liabilities side, total deposits increased by 5% in 2018, slower than the 8.7% expansion in 2017. Anticipating continued US rate hikes, some banks raised fixed deposit rates, attracting depositors to shift current and savings accounts into fixed deposits to lock in funds. The proportion of demand and savings deposits as a share of total deposits decreased from 57.4% in the previous year to 51.4% at the end of 2018, leading to higher funding costs. As the growth rate of total deposits outpaced that of total loans, the loan-to-deposit ratio slightly declined from 73% at the end of 2017 to 72.6% at year-end (Figure 5).\n\nFigure 5 Loans and Deposits in the Banking System\n\n# Capital Adequacy Level\n\nThe banking sector’s capital remained ample, indicating strong buffers against potential shocks. Capital ratios reached historic highs since the implementation of Basel III; the comprehensive capital adequacy ratio of locally registered authorized institutions increased from 19.1% at the end of 2017 to 20.3% at the end of 2018 (Figure 6).\n\nFigure 6 Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of Locally Registered Authorized Institutions\n\nThe Basel III leverage ratio became effective on January 1, 2018; this ratio is a non-risk-based regulation designed to limit excessive leverage within the banking system. At the end of 2018, the leverage ratio stood at 8.0%, well above the statutory minimum requirement of 3% (Figure 7).\n\nFigure 7 Leverage Ratio of Locally Registered Authorized Institutions\n\n# Liquidity Condition\n\nThe liquidity position of the banking sector remained stable, reflecting its strong capacity to withstand potential shocks from financial and economic pressures. For short-term liquidity (covering one-month funding), the average liquidity coverage ratio of Category 1 institutions was 167.6% in the fourth quarter, well above the 90% statutory minimum. The average liquidity coverage ratio of Category 2 institutions was 54.3%, also significantly higher than the 25% minimum requirement (Figure 8)."}
{"zh": "# 貨幣穩定\n\n2018年港元利率普遍上升，而港元現貨匯率則回軟，並貼近弱方兌換保證匯率的水平。儘管如此，港元外匯及貨幣市場運作仍然暢順有序。聯繫匯率制度是香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石，並繼續展現其承受強大衝擊的能力。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的主要目標是維持貨幣穩定，即確保港元匯價穩定，使港元在外匯市場兌美元的匯率保持在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的區間內。該貨幣體制主要採用貨幣發行局制度，規定由外匯基金所持的美元儲備向貨幣基礎提供最少百分之百的支持；貨幣基礎若有變動，美元儲備亦必須作出相應增減，與貨幣基礎的變動百分之百配合。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n- 負債證明書（為3間發鈔銀行發行的銀行紙幣提供十足支持）\n- 政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣\n- 銀行在金管局所持結算戶口的結餘總額（即總結餘）\n- 金管局代表政府發行的外匯基金票據及債券。\n\n金管局透過自動利率調節機制及履行兌換保證的堅決承諾來維持港元匯率的穩定。若市場對港元的需求大過供應，令市場匯率轉強至7.75港元兌1美元的強方兌換保證匯率，金管局會向銀行沽出港元、買入美元，使總結餘增加及港元利率下跌，從而令港元匯率從強方兌換保證匯率水平回復至7.75到7.85的兌換範圍內。相反，若港元供過於求，令市場匯率轉弱至7.85港元兌1美元的弱方兌換保證匯率，金管局會向銀行買入港元，使總結餘減少及推高港元利率，港元匯率隨之由弱方兌換保證匯率水平回復至兌換範圍內。\n\n# 2018年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n在港元與美元負息差擴闊帶動套息活動的背景下，港元匯率自年初以來逐步轉弱。於4月12日，弱方兌換保證在2005年訂於7.85水平以來首度被觸發。全年計，弱方兌換保證在2018年合共被觸發27次，分別在4月被觸發13次，5月6次，以及8月8次。儘管如此，港元交易仍然暢順有序，港元匯率於4月中至9月中在弱方兌換保證匯率7.85附近徘徊（圖1）。其後港元匯率略為轉強，部分反映假期、季結及年結臨近，銀行同業流動性收緊，帶動部分套息交易平倉。同時，某程度上港元亦受到11月初股市氣氛好轉支持。整體而言，港元外匯市場在2018年全年正常運作。\n\n圖1 2018年市場匯率\n\n由於弱方兌換保證被觸發，總結餘與未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額由2017年底的12,268億港元，下降至2018年底的11,362億港元（圖2）。年內，金管局按照聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）的設計，應銀行要求於弱方兌換保證匯率7.85的水平，購入合共1,035億港元，總結餘因而由2017年底的1,798億港元下降至2018年底的764億港元。年內未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額沒有明顯變動。貨幣基礎仍然由外匯儲備提供十足支持。\n\n於2018年底，總結餘與未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額為11,362億港元。\n\n圖2 2018年總結餘及未償還外匯基金票據及債券\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n由於觸發弱方兌換保證後銀行同業流動性減少，以及市場預期美國加息，香港銀行同業拆息在2018年內普遍上升。受新股集資活動相關的資金需求增加及季節性流動資金需求帶動，短期銀行同業拆息更出現較大波幅（圖3）。整體而言，短期銀行同業拆息在2018年大致維持在低於基本利率的水平。鑑於銀行體系資金成本上升，在9月下旬美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍上調後，銀行調高最優惠貸款利率12.5至25基點。\n\n因應年內美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍4次合共上調100基點，由1.25至1.50厘上調至2.25至2.50厘，基本利率於3月22日、6月14日、9月27日及12月20日合共上調100基點，由1.75厘上調至2.75厘。基本利率的調整是按照2009年3月26日宣布的經修訂計算公式作出。按照該公式，基本利率定於美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍下限加50基點的水平，或隔夜與1個月香港銀行同業拆息的5天移動平均數的平均值水平，以兩者中較高者為準。\n\n圖3 2018年香港銀行同業拆息\n\n港元遠期匯率折讓在首4個月擴大，大致跟隨港元與美元息差的走勢，其中12個月港元遠期匯率點子在4月中達到負620點子（圖4）。其後隨着港元與美元的負息差收窄，港元遠期匯率折讓略為縮小，然後在第4季再度擴大。整體而言，香港貨幣市場繼續正常運作。貼現窗借貸由2017年的103億港元增至2018年的402億港元。\n\n圖4 2018年美元兌港元遠期匯率點子\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n聯匯制度自1983年實施以來，直是維持香港貨幣及金融穩定的重要基石；並在多次區內以至全球金融危機考驗下，展現其承受強大衝擊的能力。由於港元轉弱，作為聯匯制度設計一部分的弱方兌換保證於4月、5月及8月被多次觸發。資金流出港元，是香港利率正常化的必經過程，亦是聯匯制度下的正常運作。為增進各界對有關操作及聯匯制度機制的了解，金管局致力向公眾闡釋聯匯制度的技術細節，並展示香港金融體系應對衝擊的能力。政府亦堅決維持聯匯制度。外匯及貨幣市場保持穩定，進一步鞏固公眾對政府的承擔，以及港元作為支付及保值貨幣的信心。國際貨幣基金組織在與香港進行2018年第四條磋商時，重申對聯匯制度的支持，並指出聯匯制度仍然是最適合香港的貨幣制度，是維持穩定的支柱，有助確保經濟持續增長、維持競爭力及促進龐大的金融服務業暢順運作。\n\n鑑於穩健的銀行體系對聯匯制度的正常運作具關鍵作用，金管局繼續密切監察銀行的信用、流動性及利率風險管理，以及壓力測試結果，並維持對銀行的企業、物業相關及內地相關貸款的監管，以確保銀行體系具備承受衝擊的能力。銀行持有大量外匯基金票據及債券，可經貼現窗用作換取港元流動資金，為利率大幅波動的情況提供有效緩衝。金管局隨時準備透過調整外匯基金票據及債券的發行量以提供額外流動性，以應對資金可能急劇流出港元的情況。金管局亦提醒市民審慎管理市場及利率風險，並為可能出現的市場波動作好準備。\n\n為提高貨幣發行局帳目的透明度，自1998年10月起，外匯基金已有部分資產被指定用作支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（即支持資產相對貨幣基礎的比率）於2018年在107.8至109.9%之間上落，並無觸及上限或下限。該比率於12月31日為109.9%（圖5）。在聯匯制度下，雖然已指定某些外匯基金資產作為支持組合，但外匯基金的全部資產均可用作支持港元匯率。外匯基金的龐大財政資源，能在面對突如其來的衝擊時為保障香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供強力後盾。\n\n圖5 2018年支持比率每日變動\n\n# 貨幣發行委員會\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的貨幣發行委員會（貨幣發行委員會）負責監察和探討與香港貨幣及金融穩定有關的課題。在2018年，貨幣發行委員會探討的課題包括多國央行聯合退出非常規貨幣政策對在香港的境外銀行美元貸款供應造成的潛在影響、港元貨幣需求的利率敏感度，以及聯匯制度自3項優化措施以來的運作機制及理論。貨幣發行委員會會議紀錄及金管局向其呈交的貨幣發行局制度運作報告，均載於金管局網站。\n\n# 研究\n\n香港金融研究中心（研究中心）繼續支持貨幣政策、銀行業及金融範疇的研究工作。過去4年，研究中心更着重政策方面的研究，從所舉辦的研討會及訪問學者計劃尤其可見一斑。一方面，研究中心與主要中央銀行及政策研究機構合作，聯合舉辦更多政策相關的研討會。另一方面，在2016年推出專題研究學者計劃，支持更多與金管局政策制定相關的研究項目。\n\n在2018年，研究中心合共邀請16位研究學者到訪，並發表了25份研究論文。年內研究中心亦舉辦了4場國際研討會：\n- 於1月舉行的「第9屆中國經濟年度國際研討會」，主題為「中國房地產市場及其對經濟與金融穩定的影響」。研討會由研究中心、國務院發展研究中心市場經濟研究所及中國人民銀行金融研究所合辦，集中討論內地房地產市場相關的課題及風險。\n- 於10月舉行由金管局及國際結算銀行合辦的「匯率與貨幣政策框架」研討會。研討會為國際結算銀行於香港的亞太區辦事處成立20周年的慶祝活動之一，旨在探討匯率在貨幣政策框架中的角色。\n- 於11月舉行的「2018年中央銀行金融市場微結構的年度研討會」。研討會討論金融市場微結構理論研究、實證研究結果及近期發展相關的政策影響。\n- 於11月舉行由金管局、歐洲中央銀行及美國聯邦儲備委員會合辦的「中國經濟的新時代」中國專家網絡研討會。研討會討論內地經濟正面對的迫切問題及其對全球經濟的影響，並特別着重與中央銀行決策者相關的政策議題。這是中國專家網絡研討會首次在歐洲以外地區舉行。\n", "en": "# Currency Stability\n\nIn 2018, interest rates on Hong Kong dollars generally increased, while the HKD spot exchange rate softened, approaching the level of the weak-side exchange guarantee rate. Nevertheless, the operation of the Hong Kong dollar foreign exchange and currency market remained smooth and orderly. The Linked Exchange Rate System is the cornerstone of Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability, and continues to demonstrate its resilience under strong shocks.\n\n# Objectives\n\nHong Kong’s main monetary policy objective is to maintain monetary stability by ensuring the stability of the HKD exchange rate, so that the Hong Kong dollar’s exchange rate against the US dollar remains within the range of 7.75 to 7.85 HKD per USD in the foreign exchange market. The currency system mainly adopts a Currency Board system, which stipulates that US dollar reserves held by the Exchange Fund must provide at least 100% support for the monetary base; when the monetary base changes, the US dollar reserves must also increase or decrease correspondingly, maintaining a 100% match with the change in the monetary base.\n\nThe monetary base (Table 1) includes:\n- Notes of deposit certificates (which fully support banknotes issued by three note-issuing banks)\n- Circulating banknotes and coins issued by the government\n- The total balance of the banking sector’s settlement accounts held at the Monetary Authority (i.e., the aggregate balance)\n- Foreign exchange fund bills and bonds issued by the Monetary Authority on behalf of the government.\n\nThe Monetary Authority maintains the stability of the HKD exchange rate through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and a firm commitment to mantener the exchange guarantee. If market demand for HKD exceeds supply, causing the exchange rate to strengthen to the strong-side exchange guarantee rate of 7.75 HKD per USD, the Monetary Authority will sell HKD and buy USD from banks, increasing the aggregate balance and reducing HKD interest rates, thereby restoring the HKD exchange rate within the 7.75 to 7.85 range. Conversely, if HKD supply exceeds demand, causing the exchange rate to weaken to the weak-side exchange guarantee rate of 7.85 HKD per USD, the Authority will buy HKD, reducing the aggregate balance and pushing up HKD interest rates, restoring the exchange rate within the exchange rate range.\n\n# 2018 Review\n\n# Exchange Rate Stability\n\nAgainst the background of a widening interest differential between HKD and USD, which drove carry trade activities, the HKD exchange rate gradually weakened from the start of the year. On April 12, the weak-side exchange guarantee was triggered for the first time since being set at 7.85 in 2005. Throughout the year, the weak-side exchange guarantee was triggered 27 times in total: 13 times in April, 6 times in May, and 8 times in August. Despite this, HKD trading remained smooth and orderly, with the HKD exchange rate hovering around the weak-side guarantee level of 7.85 from mid-April to mid-September (Figure 1). Subsequently, the HKD exchange rate slightly strengthened, partly reflecting the approaching holiday, quarter-end, and year-end, as well as tightened banking liquidity, which led to some carry trade unwinding. Meanwhile, the HKD was also supported to some extent by improved stock market sentiment in early November. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar foreign exchange market operated normally throughout 2018.\n\nFigure 1 2018 Market Exchange Rate\n\nDue to the triggering of the weak-side exchange guarantee, the aggregate balance and the total amount of outstanding foreign exchange fund bills and bonds decreased from HKD 1,226.8 billion at the end of 2017 to HKD 1,136.2 billion at the end of 2018 (Figure 2). During the year, under the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System, the Monetary Authority purchased a total of HKD 103.5 billion at the weak-side exchange guarantee rate of 7.85 upon banks’ requests, causing the aggregate balance to fall from HKD 1,798 billion at the end of 2017 to HKD 764 billion at the end of 2018. The total outstanding foreign exchange fund bills and bonds remained relatively unchanged during the year. The monetary base continued to be fully supported by foreign exchange reserves.\n\nAt the end of 2018, the aggregate balance and the total of outstanding foreign exchange fund bills and bonds stood at HKD 1,136.2 billion.\n\nFigure 2 2018 Aggregate Balance and Outstanding Foreign Exchange Fund Bills and Bonds\n\n# Money Market\n\nFollowing the triggering of the weak-side exchange guarantee and the reduction in bank liquidity, as well as market expectations of US rate hikes, interbank interest rates in Hong Kong generally increased in 2018. Increased demand for funds related to new share issuances and seasonal liquidity needs caused significant fluctuations in short-term interbank rates (Figure 3). Overall, short-term interbank interest rates remained below the base rate for most of 2018. In response to rising funding costs in the banking system, after the Federal Reserve raised its target federal funds rate range in late September, banks also increased their best lending rates by 12.5 to 25 basis points.\n\nIn line with the four hikes of the US federal funds rate target range totaling 100 basis points to 2.25-2.50% from 1.25-1.50%, the base rate was adjusted upwards four times on March 22, June 14, September 27, and December 20, a total increase of 100 basis points from 1.75% to 2.75%. These adjustments are made according to a revised formula announced on March 26, 2009, whereby the base rate is set at the lower end of the US federal funds rate target range plus 50 basis points, or the five-day moving average of the 1-month and overnight HKD interbank rates, whichever is higher.\n\nFigure 3 2018 Hong Kong Interbank Rates\n\nThe HKD forward rate discount widened during the first four months, largely following the trend of the HKD/USD interest rate differential, with the 12-month forward points reaching -620 points in mid-April (Figure 4). Subsequently, as the interest differential narrowed, the forward discount slightly reduced, before widening again in the fourth quarter. Overall, the Hong Kong monetary market continued to operate normally. Discount window lending increased from HKD 10.3 billion in 2017 to HKD 40.2 billion in 2018.\n\nFigure 4 2018 HKD Forward Rate Points\n\n# Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nSince the implementation of the Linked Exchange Rate System in 1983, it has been an important cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability; it has repeatedly demonstrated resilience during regional and global financial crises. As the HKD weakened, the part of the system that includes the weak-side exchange guarantee was triggered multiple times in April, May, and August. Capital outflows from HKD are a natural part of the normalization process of Hong Kong interest rates and an expected operation within the framework of the Linked Exchange Rate System. To enhance public understanding of the operational mechanisms of the system, the Monetary Authority actively explains the technical details of the system and demonstrates Hong Kong’s capacity to cope with shocks. The government remains committed to maintaining the system. The foreign exchange and monetary markets remained stable, further reinforcing public confidence in the government’s commitment and the HKD’s role as a means of payment and store of value. During the 2018 Article IV consultation, the International Monetary Fund reaffirmed its support for the Linked Exchange Rate System, stating that it remains the most suitable currency arrangement for Hong Kong, serving as the backbone of stability, supporting ongoing economic growth, maintaining competitiveness, and facilitating the smooth operation of the vast financial sector.\n\nGiven the crucial role of a sound banking system for the normal operation of the Linked Exchange Rate System, the Monetary Authority continues to closely monitor banks’ credit, liquidity, and interest rate risk management, as well as stress test results, while maintaining supervision of banks’ corporate, property-related, and Mainland-related lending to ensure the banking system’s resilience. Banks hold large amounts of foreign exchange fund bills and bonds, which can be used through the discount window to obtain HKD liquidity, providing an effective buffer against significant interest rate volatility. The Monetary Authority is prepared to adjust the issuance of foreign exchange fund bills and bonds to supply additional liquidity as needed to address potential rapid outflows of funds in HKD. Moreover, the Authority reminds the public to prudently manage market and interest rate risks and to prepare for potential market fluctuations.\n\nTo increase the transparency of the Currency Board account, since October 1998, part of the foreign exchange reserves have been designated to support the monetary base. The support ratio (the proportion of supporting assets relative to the monetary base) fluctuated between 107.8% and 109.9% in 2018, without reaching either upper or lower limits. On December 31, 2018, the ratio was 109.9% (Figure 5). Under the Linked Exchange Rate System, although some foreign exchange reserves have been designated as part of the support portfolio, all assets of the Fund are available to back the HKD exchange rate. The vast financial resources of the foreign exchange reserves form a strong backing in the face of sudden shocks, helping to safeguard Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nFigure 5 2018 Daily Support Ratio Fluctuations\n\n# Monetary Authority Currency Board\n\nThe Currency Board under the Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and discusses issues related to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. In 2018, topics included the potential impact of multilateral central bank exit strategies from unconventional monetary policies on offshore USD loans in Hong Kong, the interest rate sensitivity of HKD currency demand, and operational and theoretical aspects of the system since the implementation of the three optimizations. Minutes of meetings and the reports on the operation of the Currency Board system submitted by the Monetary Authority are available on the Authority’s website.\n\n# Research\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (Research Center) continues to support research on monetary policy, banking, and finance. Over the past four years, the Research Center has increasingly focused on policy-related studies, evident in its seminars and visiting scholar programs. It collaborates with major central banks and policy research institutions to co-host more policy-related seminars. Additionally, since launching the Focused Scholar Program in 2016, the Center supports more research projects linked to the Policy Formulation of the Monetary Authority.\n\nIn 2018, the Research Center hosted 16 visiting scholars, who published 25 research papers. During the year, four international conferences were held:\n- The 9th Annual China Economic Conference in January, themed “China’s Real Estate Market and Its Impact on Economic and Financial Stability.” Co-organized with the Development Research Center of the State Council and the Financial Research Institute of the People’s Bank of China, focusing on real estate-related issues and risks in mainland China.\n- In October, a conference on \"Exchange Rate and Monetary Policy Framework,\" co-organized with the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), celebrating the 20th anniversary of the BIS’s Asia-Pacific Office in Hong Kong.

{"zh": "# 銀行體系穩定\n\n儘管環球經濟及金融市場的不確定性增加，2018年香港銀行體系維持穩健。認可機構的流動性及信用風險管理制度的成效繼續是金管局年內的監管重點。鑑於網絡威脅持續增加，以及銀行業更廣泛使用金融科技，金管局加強對認可機構科技風險管理及業務操作恢復能力的監管。金管局亦於5月發出《虛擬銀行的認可》指引修訂本，並開始處理虛擬銀行認可申請。在操守監管方面，金管局採取進一步措施，加強監管認可機構銷售投資及保險產品的手法、促進為殘疾人士提供無障礙銀行服務，以及推動以客為本的企業文化。\n\n隨着金融罪行越趨複雜及全球化，金管局繼續借助新科技及風險為本方法，加強香港打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度的應對能力。金管局在香港落實國際監管標準方面進展理想，其中包括資本充足標準、披露標準、流動性標準及大額風險承擔限額。此外，金管局亦加強與銀行業的溝通接觸，確保在監管成效與市場發展兩者間取得適當平衡。\n\n與此同時，金管局繼續致力確保香港備有具公信力的認可機構處置機制，其中包括推出最低吸收虧損能力規定的規則，以解決認可機構處置可行性面對的一大障礙。\n\n# 目標\n\n金管局的整體目標之一是促進銀行體系的安全及穩定。要達致這個目標，實有賴建立及維持具高度應對能力且能為香港經濟提供所需關鍵金融服務的金融體系。\n\n銀行可能因其營運方式，甚或在極端情況下因失序地倒閉而影響銀行體系的穩定。作為監管當局，金融管理專員在保障金融穩定方面擔當重要角色，確保銀行有能力抵禦衝擊、對危機作出應對，並自危機中恢復常態，以最終有助防止出現倒閉。金融管理專員負責對銀行進行審慎監管，以及認可香港的持牌銀行、有限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司（統稱「認可機構」）。金融管理專員亦負責某些金融市場基建的指定及監管。\n\n然而，金融管理專員不能確保金融體系全無風險，香港的審慎監管制度亦非為了確保「零風險」而設。作為其中一個處置機制當局，金融管理專員力求確保一旦有認可機構不再可持續經營，即能有序地處理其倒閉。為此，香港已設立金融機構處置機制，金融管理專員於該機制之下作為包括認可機構在內的若干金融機構的處置機制當局。為建立運作暢順的香港處置機制，必須制定處置法例及政策標準、進行處置規劃以清除認可機構處置可行性的障礙，以及建立金管局處置無法經營的認可機構的運作能力。為有效執行上述工作，金管局需要採納與國際一致及協調的方法。\n\n# 2018年回顧\n\n# 監管工作概覽\n\n金管局在2018年共進行187次非現場審查，涵蓋範圍廣泛，包括認可機構的CAMEL評級、企業管治、業務操作及風險管理，以及認可機構應對金融科技發展的業務策略。為繼續加強認可機構的風險管治水平，金管局與認可機構董事局或董事局轄下委員會共舉行27次會議，並跟進認可機構實施企業管治指引的進度。此外，金管局與認可機構及其外聘核數師共舉行28次三方聯席會議。\n\n除了非現場審查工作外，金管局繼續進行定期現場審查，並以專題評估作為配合，以審視被評估為較高風險的範疇。金管局於年內共進行392次現場審查及專題評估，並繼續以信用風險管理作為審查與評估的主要重點。其他重點為科技風險及業務操作風險管理，以及打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集管控措施。金管局亦增加針對流動性與市場風險管理，以及巴塞爾資本充足架構的實施情況的現場審查及專題評估次數。專項審查小組亦對認可機構的證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（強積金）相關業務進行現場審查。\n\n表1載有金管局於2018年的監管工作概要。\n\n# 信用風險的監管\n\n# 信貸增長及資產質素\n\n2018年信貸增長放緩，全年貸款總額增加4.4%，2017年的增幅則為16.1%（表2）。貿易融資於2018年減少7.6%。貸款增長放緩，主要是因為全球經濟及貿易環境越趨不明朗，以致信貸需求收縮。\n\n表2 貸款及墊款的增長\n\n內地相關貸款總額在2018年底增加1.4%至42,490億港元，低於2017年的增幅（表3）。\n\n表3 內地相關貸款增長\n\n認可機構的資產質素在2018年維持穩健。零售銀行的特定分類貸款比率由2017年底的0.56%下降至2018年底的0.50%，遠低於2000年以來的長期平均水平2.1%；同期，整體銀行業的特定分類貸款比率則由0.68%下降至0.55%。內地相關貸款方面，零售銀行的特定分類貸款比率由0.75%下降至2018年的0.63%，整體銀行業的相關比率亦由一年前的0.67%下降至0.54%。\n\n年內金管局加強監管，確保認可機構繼續採取審慎的信用風險管理準則。尤其金管局更主動了解大型企業的背景及結構，從而加強企業信用風險的監察制度。此外，金管局亦進行以主要信用風險管理監控措施為重點的專題評估，例如大型企業貸款的批核準則及風險管理、貸款分類及撥備制度、信用風險管治架構、地產發展商貸款的風險管理、有抵押貸款及保單抵押貸款等。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n住宅物業價格在2018年7月到達歷史高位，但在下半年出現緩和跡象。金管局自2009年10月以來推出的8輪逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施，已增強香港銀行體系應對本港樓市可能逆轉的抵禦能力。新造住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數由2009年9月金管局推出首輪逆周期措施前的64%，降至2018年12月的46%。平均供款與入息比率亦由2010年8月首度推出有關比率上限時的41%，降至2018年12月的34%（圖1）。\n\n圖1 新造住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數及供款與入息比率\n\n# 業務操作及科技風險的監管\n\n銀行業面對的科技風險仍然偏高。金管局於2016年推出「網絡防衛評估框架」。第一期實施安排涵蓋包括所有大型銀行在內的30間認可機構，該等認可機構已完成3個階段的評估，即自身風險程度評估、成熟程度評估及（如適用）風險資訊主導網絡攻防模擬測試。有關評估有助認可機構查找需要改進的運作範疇及採取補救措施，加強網絡防衛。與此同時，金管局已制定第二及第三期實施安排的時間表，這兩期實施安排將涵蓋其餘認可機構。年內金管局進行現場審查，集中檢視認可機構的網絡保安管控措施、外判安排及資訊科技管治。\n\n# 智慧銀行\n\n金管局繼續就2017年9月公布的7項推動智慧銀行的措施與銀行業合作，以促進金融科技在香港的發展。在監管層面，金管局於5月發出《虛擬銀行的認可》指引修訂本。此外，金管局在「銀行易」措施下，已經精簡有關遙距開戶、網上貸款及網上財富管理的監管要求。這些優化的監管要求有助銀行提供更佳的網上銀行用戶體驗。「銀行易」措施的工作範疇在9月擴大至促進銀行採用金融合規科技(Regtech)，而當中3個新的工作重點包括打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集的監察科技、用於審慎風險管理和合規的金融合規科技，以及「機器可讀」的監管要求。\n\n金管局副總裁阮國恒先生在香港銀行學會主辦的「香港銀行家峰會2018」上發表演辭，題為「智慧銀行新紀元下的金融合規科技」。\n\n# 流動性及市場風險的監管\n\n隨着美國貨幣政策持續正常化，金管局加強了流動性風險的監管，以確保認可機構審慎及有效地管理其流動性風險。年內金管局進行了一輪專題評估，以評估認可機構為美元流動性可能收緊所作的準備，以及其內部流動性壓力測試的能力。此外，金管局亦監察認可機構遵守於1月生效的「穩定資金淨額比率」要求的情況。\n\n金管局除檢視認可機構的債券組合的市場風險管理外，亦進行了針對《環球外匯守則》及非中央結算場外衍生工具的保證金和風險緩解標準的專題現場審查，以審視認可機構在財資業務中遵行新國際標準的情況。\n\n# 打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集\n\n政府於4月發表的《香港洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險評估報告》指出，香港銀行體系面對高洗錢威脅，這與其他國際金融中心一樣，亦反映金融服務日趨全球化及複雜。香港面對的洗錢威脅除源自本地犯罪活動外，在更大程度上也來自境外活動。該等境外活動包括來自境外貪污活動的非法得益、跨國犯罪集團的詐騙活動、逃稅及基於香港作為支付及貿易樞紐的地位而引致與制裁相關的風險。在金管局協助下，政府制定打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集政策聲明，列載對該等威脅的回應，目標是在提高打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度的應對能力的同時，又能吸引及便利正當企業。\n\n《2018年打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集（金融機構）（修訂）條例》於3月1日生效，引入的修訂包括在核實客戶身分方面賦予靈活性，以配合認可機構利用科技方便客戶開戶的發展。新法例亦擴大適用範圍，規定律師、會計師、地產代理及信託或公司服務提供者須負上打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集的責任，從而全面強化打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度。該等修訂連同《公司條例》為提高企業實益擁有權透明度而作出的修訂，有助認可機構執行打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集方面的工作。\n\n為鞏固及進一步強化與認可機構就打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集政策與監管方法的溝通，金管局在10月發出《監管政策手冊》下的全新單元「打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集的監管方法」，及配合相關法例修訂的《打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集指引（認可機構適用）》，以能更有效實施風險為本的方法，並減少認可機構就打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度採用新科技的障礙。\n\n資訊交流在打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度中的作用日見重要；在金管局與香港銀行公會（銀行公會）的支持下，銀行業積極參與反訛騙及洗黑錢情報工作組（情報工作組），並已取得實質成果。有關情報工作組先導計劃的檢討工作於2018年末展開，並會於2019年初完成。\n", "en": "# Banking System Stability\n\nDespite increasing uncertainties in the global economy and financial markets, Hong Kong's banking system remained resilient in 2018. The effectiveness of the liquidity and credit risk management systems of licensed institutions continued to be a key supervisory focus for the HKMA during the year. Given the ongoing proliferation of cyber threats and the wider adoption of financial technology by banks, the HKMA enhanced its supervision of technological risk management and business continuity resilience of licensed institutions. The HKMA also issued a revised guideline for \"Recognition of Virtual Banks\" in May and began processing applications for virtual bank recognition. In terms of conduct regulation, the HKMA took further measures to strengthen the supervision of sales practices for investment and insurance products, promote barrier-free banking services for persons with disabilities, and encourage a customer-centric corporate culture.\n\nAs financial crimes become increasingly sophisticated and globalized, the HKMA continues to leverage new technology and a risk-based approach to bolster Hong Kong's response capabilities to money laundering and terrorist financing. The HKMA's progress in implementing international supervisory standards in Hong Kong is encouraging, including capital adequacy standards, disclosure standards, liquidity standards, and large exposure limits. Furthermore, the HKMA has intensified its communication with banks to ensure an appropriate balance is maintained between regulatory effectiveness and market development.\n\nMeanwhile, the HKMA remains committed to ensuring that Hong Kong has a credible resolution mechanism for licensed institutions, including the introduction of rules on minimum capital absorption capacity, to address significant obstacles to the resolution of licensed institutions.\n\n# Objectives\n\nOne of the HKMA’s overarching goals is to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this depends heavily on establishing and maintaining a financial infrastructure that possesses high resilience and can provide the critical financial services necessary for Hong Kong’s economic development.\n\nBanks may pose risks to the stability of the banking system through their operations, or in extreme cases, through disorderly insolvency. As a regulatory authority, the HKMA plays a critical role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring banks' capability to withstand shocks, respond to crises, and recover to normal operations, ultimately helping to prevent insolvencies. The HKMA is responsible for prudent supervision of banks and for recognizing licensed banks, restricted license banks, and deposit-taking companies (collectively “licensed institutions”) in Hong Kong. The HKMA also oversees designated infrastructure related to certain financial markets.\n\nHowever, the HKMA cannot guarantee a risk-free financial system, nor was the prudential regulatory framework in Hong Kong designed to eliminate all risks. As a resolution authority, the HKMA strives to ensure that, when a licensed institution becomes unsustainable, an orderly resolution can be executed. To this end, Hong Kong has established a financial institution resolution mechanism under which the HKMA serves as a resolution authority for a number of financial institutions, including licensed institutions. To develop a smoothly functioning resolution mechanism, it is necessary to formulate resolution legislation and policy standards, plan resolutions to eliminate barriers to resolution for licensed institutions, and build operational capabilities for HKMA to manage failures of licensed institutions. To effectively carry out these tasks, the HKMA adopts an approach aligned with international standards and coordinated frameworks.\n\n# 2018 Review\n\n# Supervisory Work Overview\n\nIn 2018, the HKMA conducted a total of 187 off-site reviews, covering a broad scope including CAMEL ratings, corporate governance, business operations, risk management of licensed institutions, and their strategies on adapting to financial technology developments. To further strengthen the risk governance level of licensed institutions, the HKMA held 27 meetings with the boards of licensed institutions or their relevant committees and followed up on the implementation progress of corporate governance guidelines. Additionally, the HKMA held 28 tripartite meetings with licensed institutions and their external auditors.\n\nBeyond off-site reviews, the HKMA continued regular onsite examinations and conducted focused assessments targeting higher-risk areas. During the year, 392 onsite reviews and special assessments were carried out, with the primary focus on credit risk management. Other priorities included technology risk and operational risk management, as well as anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing controls. The HKMA also increased onsite examinations and assessments related to liquidity and market risk management, as well as the implementation of the Basel capital adequacy framework. Dedicated review teams also conducted on-site inspections on licensed institutions’ securities, investment products, insurance, and MPF businesses.\n\nTable 1 presents an overview of the HKMA’s supervisory activities in 2018.\n\n# Supervision of Credit Risk\n\n# Credit Growth and Asset Quality\n\nIn 2018, credit growth slowed, with total loans increasing by 4.4% for the year, compared to a 16.1% increase in 2017 (Table 2). Trade finance decreased by 7.6% in 2018. The slowdown in loan growth was mainly due to increasing uncertainties in the global economy and trade environment, leading to subdued credit demand.\n\nTable 2 shows the growth figures for loans and advances\n\nThe total Mainland-related loans of licensed institutions increased by 1.4% to HKD 4,249 billion at the end of 2018, lower than the growth rate in 2017 (Table 3).\n\nTable 3 shows Mainland-related loan growth\n\nThe asset quality of licensed institutions remained resilient in 2018. The proportion of classified retail loans declined from 0.56% at the end of 2017 to 0.50% at the end of 2018, well below the long-term average of 2.1% since 2000; during the same period, the overall banking sector’s classified loan ratio decreased from 0.68% to 0.55%. For Mainland-related loans, the classified loan ratio of retail banking decreased from 0.75% to 0.63%, while the overall sector’s related ratio also declined from 0.67% a year earlier to 0.54% in 2018.\n\nThe HKMA strengthened supervision during the year to ensure that licensed institutions continued to adhere to prudent credit risk management standards. In particular, the HKMA proactively gained understanding of major companies’ backgrounds and structures, enhancing the monitoring system for corporate credit risk. The HKMA also conducted focused assessments on key credit risk management measures, such as approval standards and risk management of large corporate loans, loan classification and provisioning systems, credit risk governance frameworks, and the risk management of property developers’ loans, collateralized loans, and insurance policies.\n\n# Property Mortgage Loans\n\nResidential property prices reached historic highs in July 2018 but showed signs of easing in the second half of the year. Since October 2009, the HKMA has introduced eight macroprudential countercyclical measures to strengthen Hong Kong’s resilience against potential reversals in the local housing market. The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio for new residential mortgages decreased from 64% prior to the first macroprudential measure introduced in September 2009 to 46% by December 2018. Similarly, the average repayment-to-income ratio fell from 41% when the ratio cap was first implemented in August 2010 to 34% in December 2018 (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 shows the average LTV and repayment-to-income ratios for new residential mortgages\n\n# Business Operations and Technological Risk Supervision\n\nThe technology risk faced by the banking industry remains high. In 2016, the HKMA launched the \"Cyber Resilience Evaluation Framework.\" Phase 1 implementation covered 30 licensed institutions, including all major banks, which completed three assessment stages: self-assessment of risk levels, maturity assessment, and, where applicable, testing of cyber threat detection and response using risk information-led simulations. This evaluation helps licensed institutions identify operational gaps and implement remedial actions to enhance cyber defenses. The HKMA has also developed timelines for the second and third phases of implementation, which will include the remaining licensed institutions. During the year, onsite reviews focused on cyber security controls, outsourcing arrangements, and information technology governance.\n\n# Smart Banking\n\nThe HKMA continues to collaborate with the banking industry on seven measures announced in September 2017 to promote the development of smart banking in Hong Kong. In the supervisory domain, the HKMA revised the guideline on \"Recognition of Virtual Banks\" in May. Under the \"BankingPlus\" initiative, the HKMA streamlined supervisory requirements for remote account opening, online lending, and online wealth management services. These regulatory adjustments help banks provide better online banking user experiences. In September, the scope of \"BankingPlus\" was expanded to include promoting the adoption of regtech solutions for compliance and risk management. Three new focus areas include regtech solutions for anti-money laundering and countering terrorist financing, regtech for prudential risk management and compliance, and machine-readable regulatory requirements.\n\nDeputy Chief Executive Mr. Evans Mong delivered a speech titled \"The New Era of Smart Banking and Financial Compliance Technology\" at the Hong Kong Association of Banks’ Hong Kong Bankers Summit 2018.\n\n# Liquidity and Market Risk Supervision\n\nWith the continuation of the normalization of US monetary policy, the HKMA intensified its liquidity risk supervision to ensure licensed institutions prudently and effectively manage their liquidity risks. During the year, the HKMA conducted a focused assessment to review preparedness for potential tightening of US dollar liquidity and the internal liquidity stress testing capabilities of licensed institutions. Additionally, the HKMA monitored compliance with the \"Net Stable Funding Ratio\" requirement that became effective in January.\n\nBeyond reviewing liquidity risk, the HKMA also examined market risk management of bond portfolios held by licensed institutions and conducted specialized onsite reviews on the margin and risk mitigation standards of the \"Global Foreign Exchange Code\" and non-central counterparty OTC derivatives, to assess compliance with new international standards in treasury activities.\n\n# Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Terrorist Financing\n\nThe government issued the \"Hong Kong Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment Report\" in April, which highlighted that the Hong Kong banking system faces high threats from money laundering, reflecting the increasing globalization and complexity of financial services. The threats are mainly from overseas activities, including proceeds of overseas corruption, cross-border fraud, tax evasion, and risks related to sanctions due to Hong Kong’s role as a payment and trade hub. With the HKMA’s assistance, the government established policies to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, responding to these threats while also enabling legitimate businesses to operate and expand.\n\nThe amended \"Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) (Amendment) Ordinance\" became effective on March 1, 2018. The amendments introduce flexibility in customer identity verification to facilitate the adoption of technological solutions by licensed institutions. The law also expands scope to require lawyers, accountants, property agents, and trust or company service providers to assume responsibilities in anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing efforts, thereby strengthening the overall system. These modifications, along with the revisions to the \"Companies Ordinance\" to enhance transparency of beneficial ownership, support licensed institutions’ anti-money laundering initiatives.\n\nTo reinforce communication with licensed institutions regarding anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing policies and supervision, the HKMA issued a new unit titled \"Supervisory Approach to Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing\" within the \"Supervision Policy Manual\" in October. This unit is complemented by revised guidance on AML/CTF obligations applicable to licensed institutions, aiming to better implement a risk-based approach and reduce barriers to adopting new technology.\n\nInformation sharing plays an increasingly important role in AML/CTF systems. Supported by the HKMA and the Hong Kong Association of Banks, the banking industry actively participates in the Joint Financial Intelligence Coordination Centre’s anti-fraud and anti-money laundering information-sharing initiatives, achieving tangible results. A review of the pilot program of the task force began at the end of 2018 and is scheduled for completion in early 2019."}

Seven measures aimed at promoting the development and application of financial technology within the banking and payments industry have achieved good progress within the year, exemplified by the successful launch of the Faster Payment System \"FPS\".\n\nOptimisation measures for the connectivity between the mainland China and Hong Kong capital markets, as well as the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, further strengthen Hong Kong's unique position as the main gateway into mainland China. Hong Kong's status as a global offshore renminbi hub is also more robust, with renminbi financial activities thriving.\n\nMeanwhile, the HKMA is committed to exploring new opportunities to enhance Hong Kong’s financial platform competitiveness, including infrastructure financing, corporate treasury centres, and green bond markets. The HKMA has also stepped up its market promotion to overseas and mainland stakeholders, highlighting Hong Kong’s advantages. On the international level, the HKMA plays a leading role in multiple regional and international committees, demonstrating Hong Kong’s professional expertise and responsibilities in related international work.\n\n# Overview\n\nTo strengthen Hong Kong’s position as an Asian fintech hub, the HKMA has been implementing seven measures announced in September 2017 aimed at fostering innovation within the banking and payments sectors. Major progress within the year include:\n\n- Successful launch of the Faster Payment System \"FPS\", connecting multiple banks and stored-value payment tools (collectively known as \"electronic wallets\") for real-time cross-bank funds transfer in Hong Kong dollars and renminbi.\n- Publication of the Banking Industry Open API Framework and facilitation of industry implementation of open APIs.\n- Enhancement of fintech research and talent training.\n- Strengthening cross-border fintech cooperation.\n- Revision of the \"Guideline on Approval of Virtual Banks\" and processing virtual bank licence applications.\n- Upgraded operations of the \"Fintech Supervisory Sandbox\" (FSS 2.0) for smooth operation.\n- Expansion of the \"Banking Connect\" platform to promote the adoption of fintech compliance solutions by banks.\n\nThe HKMA’s Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO), in collaboration with various banking departments, plays an important role in promoting the implementation of these measures.\n\nWith the realisation of optimisation measures for the connectivity between the mainland China and Hong Kong capital markets, Hong Kong’s status as a key entry point into mainland China is further reinforced. The implementation of the Bond Connect scheme with real-time DvP (delivery versus payment) settlement and the State Council’s announcement of tax exemption arrangements for offshore investors investing in mainland China’s bond market enhances the scheme’s efficiency and attractiveness. Additionally, the HKMA works closely with mainland authorities to explore and implement various financial supporting measures to facilitate individuals and enterprises living, working, and doing business in the Greater Bay Area. Hong Kong’s offshore renminbi business continues to flourish, with renminbi deposits rising by 6% year-on-year to RMB 65.77 billion; the daily average transaction value of the RTGS system in renminbi reached a high level of RMB 1,010.1 billion.\n\nThe HKMA is actively exploring new opportunities to further boost the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. To promote the development of the Hong Kong bond market, the HKMA implemented the \"Bond Funding Pilot Scheme\" as proposed in the Budget, providing funding support to issuers of bonds in Hong Kong for the first time. The HKMA works closely with the government to revise relevant legislation, expanding the scope of investment income eligible for tax exemption under the \"Qualifying Debt Instrument Programme\". The HKMA also enhances market promotion activities, showcasing Hong Kong’s advantages through large-scale and specialised outreach events that promote Hong Kong as a green finance, infrastructure financing, and corporate treasury centre hub.\n\nOn the international front, the HKMA leads several regional and global committees. Currently, the HKMA serves as Chair of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s (BCBS) Framework Implementation and Oversight Committee, Chair of the Financial Market Working Group under the East Asia and Pacific Central Banks’ Group (EMEAP), and Chair of the Basel Committee’s Supervision and Implementation Standards Subgroup.\n\nThe secure and efficient operation of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure provides a solid foundation for Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre. The four RTGS systems for banking clearance, the Central Clearing and Settlement System (CMU), and the Hong Kong Trade Repository (HKTR) achieved 100% system availability in 2018, exceeding the target of 99.95%. Through accounts in two mainland China central securities depositories, the CMU continues to facilitate the settlement of northbound Bond Connect trades and holds mainland securities for relevant CMU members.\n\nTo promote overall safety and efficiency in the retail payments sector, the HKMA designated two additional retail payment systems under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVO), bringing the total to six systems under HKMA supervision. The HKMA also supervises 16 stored-value payment licensees, whose products and services are actively being introduced to provide more options and better user experiences for customers. At the same time, the scope of electronic cheques, e-bills, and payment services has been further expanded to include cross-border transactions within Hong Kong and across Guangdong Province.\n\n# Review of 2018\n\n# Hong Kong as an Asian Fintech Hub\n\n# Measures to Promote Smart Banking\n\nIn September 2017, the HKMA announced seven measures to promote smart banking, aimed at helping the banking industry elevate to higher levels and seize the vast opportunities arising from the integration of banking and technology. The HKMA has made good progress in implementing these measures and transforming Hong Kong’s financial ecosystem within the year.\n\n# \"FPS\"\n\n\"FPS\" was successfully launched in September, enabling banking and stored-value payment tool users to perform instant cross-bank transfers in HKD and RMB anywhere and anytime, by simply entering the recipient’s mobile number or email address. A total of 21 banks, including most retail banks, and 10 wallet service providers participated in the scheme, offering real-time payment and/or account linkage services.\n\nWithin 3.5 months of operation, FPS registered over 2 million users, representing 27% of Hong Kong’s population. Since its launch, the system has processed over 4.8 million transactions with a total value exceeding HKD 104.9 billion and RMB 2.75 billion.\n\nIn the same month, the HKMA launched the Hong Kong Retail Payment Common QR Code Standard and the related mobile application \"Hong Kong Common QR Code\" (HKQR), which is the world’s first to integrate multiple QR codes into a single unified mobile application. This facilitates merchants, especially SMEs, to accept payments from various mobile payment providers through a single QR code, eliminating the need to display multiple codes to customers.\n\n# Open Application Programming Interface (API)\n\nOpen API refers to the release of bank-related data to third-party service providers, enabling better and more convenient integration of banking services with other industries. Users can enjoy integrated services under a secure environment by using a single platform. To promote the research and development of open APIs within banks, the HKMA published the Open API Framework in July. This framework adopts a risk-based approach and implements various open API functionalities in four phases. By the end of January 2019, 20 banks had opened around 500 APIs in Phase 1, covering data on over 1,000 products and services.\n\n# Fintech Research and Talent Development\n\nBuilding on the results of the HKMA-led concept verification of trade finance, a consortium of Hong Kong banks launched the \"Trade Connect\" trade finance platform based on distributed ledger technology (DLT) in October. The platform aims to digitise trade documents and automate trade finance processes, reducing errors and fraud risks. By the end of 2018, 12 banks had joined as members. \"Trade Connect\" signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the European trade finance platform \"we.trade\" to connect the two platforms’ proof-of-concept schemes. The HKMA is also exploring opportunities for connecting \"Trade Connect\" with other regions, including cooperation with the Monetary Authority of Singapore to launch the \"Global Trade Connectivity Network\".\n\nHKMA Chief Executive Mr. Norman Chan (left) at the launch ceremony of \"Trade Connect\".\n\nTo cultivate more fintech talents, the HKMA partnered with the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute (ASTRI) in January to upgrade the \"Fintech Talent Development Scheme\" (FCAS 2.0). FCAS 2.0 includes four programmes suitable for young talents at different career stages. Over 200 students have benefited from the scheme.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive Mr. Norman Chan (second from left), Cyberport Chairman Mr. Kenny Lee (left), Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute (ASTRI) Chairman Mr. William Chui (right), and Hong Kong Cyberport Management Company CEO Mr. Tony Tam (right) attended the FCAS 2.0 launch ceremony.\n\n# Cross-Border Cooperation\n\nFollowing the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Shenzhen Municipal People’s Government’s Financial Development Service Office (Shenzhen Fintech Office) in 2017, the HKMA continues to strengthen fintech cooperation with Shenzhen. This includes funding the Shenzhen Fintech Summer Internship Programme, which allows 50 students to undertake six-week internships at several leading Shenzhen companies, experiencing the local fintech ecosystem; and jointly hosting the \"Shenzhen-Hong Kong Fintech Innovation Award\" with the Shenzhen Fintech Office.\n\nHKMA Deputy Chief Executive Mr. Li Da-Zhi (right second) speaks with the first batch of Shenzhen Fintech Summer Interns.\n\nThe HKMA has also signed fintech cooperation agreements in 2018 with the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, the Polish Financial Supervision Authority, the Abu Dhabi Global Market Financial Services Regulatory Authority, and the Central Bank of Brazil to promote regional collaboration.\n\nIn August, the HKMA announced the \"Global Financial Innovation Network\" (GFIN) initiative in collaboration with 11 other financial regulators and related institutions. The network aims to provide a more effective platform for innovative companies to engage with regulators and to facilitate cooperation among regulators on innovation-related issues.\n\n# Virtual Banks\n\nThe introduction of virtual banks will provide new momentum for Hong Kong’s fintech ecosystem and deliver innovative experiences for digital banking customers. Virtual banks target retail clients such as individuals and SMEs, thus also promoting financial inclusion. Following public consultation, the HKMA issued revised \"Guideline on the Approval of Virtual Banks\" in May, and received about 30 applications by the end of August.\n\n# Fintech Supervisory Sandbox\n\nThe usage of the sandbox steadily increased during the year. To help establish an ecosystem for fintech compliance, the sandbox was opened from September to projects involving financial compliance technology.\n\nAs of the end of 2018, 42 fintech or technology products had been approved for testing within the sandbox, with 28 of these having completed the testing phase and been launched in the market. The HKMA also received 220 cases through the \"Fintech Supervisory Chatroom\" platform, seeking regulatory feedback early in project development, with about 70% of these cases from tech companies."}
{"zh": "# 儲備管理\n\n2018年對投資者而言是困難的一年，投資環境備受多項風險因素困擾，包括美國利率持續正常化引發金融狀況收緊、主要經濟體之間的貿易摩擦升級，以及全球多處民粹主義抬頭及地緣政治風險加劇。環球股市普遍向下，美國國庫券收益率亦隨着美國聯邦儲備局4次加息而上升。在美息趨升下，美元轉強。部分新興市場面對國內嚴峻的政治及經濟壓力，其貨幣顯著下挫。儘管投資環境充滿挑戰，外匯基金在2018年仍錄得109億港元投資收入。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》，外匯基金的首要目的是直接或間接影響港元匯價，亦可運用於保持香港貨幣及金融體系穩定健全，藉此保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。金管局根據財政司司長轉授的權力及轉授權力的條款，就外匯基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標及組合架構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會為外匯基金制定下列投資目標：\n\n(a) 保障資本；\n(b) 確保整體貨幣基礎在任何時候都由流通性極高的美元資產提供十足支持；\n(c) 確保流動資金足以維持貨幣及金融穩定；以及\n(d) 在符合上述(a)至(c)項的前提下盡量爭取投資回報，以保障基金的長期購買力。\n\n以上目標全面顧及外匯基金的法定目的，並已於外匯基金的組合結構及目標資產配置中反映。\n\n外匯基金大致上分成兩個主要組合：支持組合及投資組合。支持組合持有流通性極高的美元資產，按照貨幣發行局制度的規定為貨幣基礎提供十足支持。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債市及股市，以保障資產的價值及長期購買力。\n\n為能更妥善管理風險及提高中長期回報，金管局以審慎及循序漸進方式將外匯基金的部分資產分散投資至較多元化的資產類別，包括新興巿場及內地債券與股票、私募股權（包括基建）及房地產。新興巿場及內地債券與股票由投資組合持有，私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合持有。長期增長組合的市值上限為外匯基金累計盈餘的三分之一及未來基金與外匯基金附屬公司存款中與長期增長組合掛鈎部分的總和。\n\n策略性資產組合於2007年設立，以持有政府基於策略性目的而為外匯基金帳目購入的香港交易及結算所有限公司股份。由於這個組合性質獨特，因此外匯基金的投資表現評估並無將其包括在內。\n\n# 於外匯基金的存款\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定組織的存款，利率一般與投資組合的表現掛鈎，但主要以未來基金除外。未來基金存款的利率與投資組合及長期增長組合的表現掛鈎，實際利率視乎組合比重而定。於2018年底，未來基金在投資組合與長期增長組合的比重約為50:50。\n\n# 投資程序\n\n外匯基金的投資程序分別以策略性資產配置及戰略性資產配置作基礎。策略性資產配置，即投資基準反映的配置情況，顯示外匯基金為達到投資目標而可作出的長線資產配置。外匯基金以策略性配置作為指引，對資產進行戰略性配置，以爭取超越基準的回報。因此，實際配置往往會與基準配置（亦即策略性配置）有所偏離，而實際與基準配置之間的差距稱為「戰略性偏離」。財政司司長經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後制定投資基準及循跡誤差限額，金管局獲授權決定戰略性資產配置及定出戰略性偏離的容許範圍。投資組合經理可在戰略性偏離的容許範圍內選持倉盤，從短期市場變化中獲利。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局於8月成立外匯基金投資辦公室，專責投資及相關風險管理職能。該辦公室職員負責直接管理外匯基金約72%的投資，包括整個支持組合及部分投資組合。該部分的投資組合投資於環球定息市場，並透過衍生工具執行外匯基金的宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 外聘投資經理\n\n除透過內部職員管理資產外，金管局亦僱用外聘投資經理負責管理外匯基金約28%的資產，包括所有上市股票組合及其他特別資產。僱用外聘投資經理的目的是要運用市場上最佳的專業投資技術為外匯基金投資，以取得可持續回報，並讓外匯基金受惠於多元化及互補的投資方式，以及汲取市場心得與專業投資技術知識。\n\n僱用外聘投資經理的相關支出包括基金管理與託管費、交易費、預扣稅及其他稅項。這些支出主要受市場因素影響而每年不同。\n\n# 風險管理及監察\n\n投資環境越趨複雜，突顯風險管理的重要。金管局為內部及外聘投資經理所管理的投資組合均訂立嚴格管控措施及投資指引，並密切監察對指引及法規的遵守情況。金管局已加強風險評估，以配合外匯基金越趨多元化的投資；另採用風險管控工具來評估在正常及極度不利市況下的市場風險。金管局亦進行詳細的投資表現因素分析，以識別促成不同表現的成因，藉此評估如何充分利用內部及外聘投資經理的投資管理技術。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n金管局支持負責任投資。例如，金管局已採納證券及期貨事務監察委員會公布的《負責任的擁有權原則》。該套原則旨在協助投資者釐定如何以最佳方法履行其於香港上市公司投資的擁有權責任。就外匯基金的管理而言，金管局已就環境、社會及管治因素制定內部指引，適用於外聘基金經理的甄選、委任及監察程序。獲委任負責主動式管理香港股票組合的外聘基金經理，須在管理有關投資時遵守《負責任的擁有權原則》。整體而言，金管局已將環境、社會及管治因素納入投資及相關監察活動的內部程序。金管局會密切注視環境、社會及管治因素的相關標準的發展，並評估如何能夠將這些標準進一步融入投資程序。此外，為促進負責任投資的國際合作，金管局已成為非牟利組織FCLTGlobal的成員，該組織旨在推動長遠目標為本的業務及投資決定。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2018年的金融市場\n\n在2018年，原先被市場低估的多項風險因素一一浮現，包括美國利率正常化的步伐、美國政府外貿政策和保護主義對全球貿易的衝擊，以及地緣政治的風險，環球金融市場因而出現大幅波動及調整。\n\n中美貿易爭議升級，令投資者非常憂慮，新興市場及香港股市自1月底開始反覆下跌，恒生指數自該月份的高位最多下跌27%。自第4季起，主要歐美股市亦大幅下滑，錄得雙位數字跌幅。就2018年整體而言，全球股市普遍下跌，涵蓋已發展國家股市的MSCI全球指數下跌10.4%，MSCI新興市場指數亦下跌16.6%。\n\n債市方面，由於美國貨幣政策正常化，美國國庫券收益率於2018年大致向上。然而，年內債市仍有波動。例如10年期美國國庫券收益率由年初約2.5%上升至11月3.2%的7年新高，但至年底時受投資者憂慮中美貿易爭議及趨向避險投資所影響而回軟至2.7%。\n\n貨幣市場方面，年內美元跟隨美國加息轉強。美匯指數上升4.4%，歐元及人民幣等主要貨幣兌美元下跌約5%。此外，部分新興市場受到國內政局及經濟不穩影響，其貨幣進一步受挫。例如，阿根廷披索及土耳其里拉兌美元分別下跌約五成及三成。相比之下，避險投資需求帶動日圓兌美元上升2.7%。\n\n表1列載主要貨幣、債巿及股市在2018年的表現。\n\n表1 2018年市場回報\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n外匯基金在2018年錄得109億港元投資收入，當中包括債券投資收益574億港元、香港股票投資虧損207億港元、其他股票投資虧損387億港元、非港元資產外匯估值下調90億港元，以及外匯基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資收益219億港元。另一方面，策略性資產組合錄得5億港元估值下調。\n\n於2018年年底，外匯基金的資產總值達40,549億港元。長期增長組合投資的總市值為2,836億港元，當中私募股權為1,911億港元，房地產為925億港元。已承擔但尚未提取作投資的總額為2,024億港元。\n\n外匯基金（不包括策略性資產組合）在2018年的投資回報率為0.3%，其中投資組合的回報率為負2.4%，支持組合為2.1%。長期增長組合自2009年開展投資以來的內部回報率年率為12.9%。\n\n圖1列明外匯基金由1994至2018年的年度回報率。表2顯示外匯基金在2018年的投資回報率及不同年期的平均投資回報率。外匯基金在過去3年的平均回報率為3.2%、過去5年為2.1%、過去10年為2.8%，以及自1994年起計為4.7%3。表3列載外匯基金資產於2018年12月31日的貨幣比重。\n", "en": "# Reserve Management\n\n2018 was a challenging year for investors, as the investment environment was impacted by multiple risk factors, including the sustained normalization of US interest rates leading to tightening financial conditions, escalation of trade frictions among major economies, and rising populism and geopolitical risks worldwide. Global stock markets generally declined, and US Treasury yields rose as the Federal Reserve raised interest rates four times. Amid the rising US interest rates, the US dollar strengthened. Some emerging markets faced severe political and economic pressures, leading to significant currency depreciations. Despite these challenges, the foreign exchange Fund still recorded an investment income of HKD 10.9 billion in 2018.\n\n# Foreign Exchange Fund\n\nAccording to the Currency Board and Exchange Fund Ordinance, the primary purpose of the Exchange Fund is to directly or indirectly influence the Hong Kong dollar’s exchange rate, and it may also be used to maintain the stability and soundness of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial system, thereby supporting Hong Kong’s position as an international financial centre. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), under delegated authority from the Financial Secretary, is responsible for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund in accordance with the terms of the delegation and the applicable regulations.\n\n# Management of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Investment Goals and Portfolio Structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee has established the following investment goals for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(a) To safeguard capital;\n(b) To ensure that the overall monetary base is always fully supported by highly liquid US dollar assets;\n(c) To ensure liquidity is sufficient to maintain monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) To strive for investment returns as long as they are consistent with the above (a) to (c), thus safeguarding the long-term purchasing power of the Fund.\n\nThese objectives fully reflect the statutory purpose of the Exchange Fund and are incorporated into the Fund’s portfolio structure and target asset allocation.\n\nThe Exchange Fund is generally divided into two main portfolios: a support portfolio and an investment portfolio. The support portfolio holds highly liquid US dollar assets, providing full support for the monetary base in accordance with the currency issuance system. The investment portfolio mainly invests in bond and equity markets of countries that are members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), aiming to preserve asset value and long-term purchasing power.\n\nTo better manage risks and improve medium- to long-term returns, the HKMA adopts a prudent and phased approach to diversify certain assets of the Exchange Fund into more diversified asset classes, including emerging markets, Mainland bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate. The emerging markets and Mainland bonds and equities are held by the investment portfolio, while private equity and real estate are held by the long-term growth portfolio. The maximum market value of the long-term growth portfolio is one-third of the cumulative surplus of the Exchange Fund plus the total of the part linked to the long-term growth portfolio within the deposits of the future fund and the subsidiaries of the Exchange Fund.\n\nThe Strategic Asset Portfolio was established in 2007 to hold shares of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited purchased for strategic purposes based on the Fund’s accounts. Due to its unique nature, the investment performance of the Exchange Fund does not include this portfolio in its evaluation.\n\n# Deposits in the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund periodically accepts deposits from the fiscal reserves, government funds, and statutory bodies. The interest rates are generally linked to the performance of the investment portfolio, except mostly for the future fund. The interest rate for the future fund is linked to the performance of the investment portfolio and the long-term growth portfolio, with actual rates depending on their respective proportions. At the end of 2018, the deposits of the future fund were approximately equally split between the investment portfolio and the long-term growth portfolio.\n\n# Investment Procedures\n\nThe investment procedures of the Exchange Fund are based on strategic and tactical asset allocation. Strategic asset allocation, which reflects the investment benchmark, indicates the long-term asset configuration aimed at achieving the investment objectives. With strategic allocation as a guideline, the Fund implements tactical asset allocation to seek returns exceeding the benchmark. As a result, actual allocations often deviate from the benchmark (strategic) allocation; the difference is called “strategic deviation.” The Financial Secretary, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, sets the investment benchmark and tolerances for tracking error. The HKMA is authorized to determine the strategic asset allocation and set the permissible range of strategic deviation. Portfolio managers can hold positions within the allowed deviation range to profit from short-term market fluctuations.\n\n# Investment Management\n\n# Direct Investment\n\nIn August, the HKMA established the Exchange Fund Investment Office, responsible for investment activities and related risk management functions. Staff in this office manage about 72% of the investments directly, including the entire support portfolio and part of the investment portfolio. The investments in this portion mainly target global fixed income markets and employ derivatives to execute macro risk management strategies for the Exchange Fund.\n\n# External Investment Managers\n\nIn addition to internal management, the HKMA also hires external investment managers to oversee about 28% of the assets, including all listed equity portfolios and other special assets. The purpose of employing external managers is to leverage top-tier market expertise to achieve sustainable returns, benefit from diversified and complementary investment strategies, and gain market insights and professional investment skills.\n\nCosts associated with external managers include fund management and custody fees, transaction fees, withholding taxes, and other applicable taxes, which vary annually based on market conditions.\n\n# Risk Management and Monitoring\n\nAs the investment environment becomes increasingly complex, risk management has become more important. The HKMA has established strict controls and investment guidelines for both internal and external investment portfolios, closely monitoring compliance. It has enhanced risk assessment to accommodate the increasing diversification of assets and employs risk control tools to evaluate market risks under normal and adverse conditions. The HKMA also conducts detailed performance analysis to identify factors contributing to different performance outcomes, helping to fully leverage the investment management capabilities of internal and external managers.\n\n# Responsible Investment\n\nThe HKMA supports responsible investment. For instance, it has adopted the Principles for Responsible Ownership issued by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC). These principles aim to guide investors on fulfilling their ownership responsibilities regarding Hong Kong-listed companies. Regarding the management of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA has established internal guidelines on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors, which apply to the selection, appointment, and monitoring of external fund managers. External managers appointed to actively manage Hong Kong equity portfolios are required to comply with the Principles for Responsible Ownership. Overall, the HKMA has integrated ESG considerations into its internal procedures for investment and monitoring activities. The HKMA continuously observes the development of relevant standards and assesses how to further incorporate these standards into its investment procedures. Additionally, to promote international cooperation on responsible investment, the HKMA has become a member of FCLTGlobal, a non-profit organization dedicated to advancing long-term, values-based business and investment decisions.\n\n# Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Financial Markets in 2018\n\nIn 2018, many risks initially underestimated by markets surfaced one after another, including the normalization pace of US interest rates, US trade policies and protectionism impacts on global trade, and geopolitical risks. As a result, global financial markets experienced significant volatility and adjustments.\n\nThe US-China trade tensions escalated, causing considerable concerns among investors. Emerging markets and Hong Kong stock markets experienced volatile declines from late January, with the Hang Seng Index dropping by as much as 27% from its high in that month. From the fourth quarter onwards, major European and US stock markets also declined sharply, with double-digit drops. Overall, global equity markets declined in 2018: the MSCI World Index fell by 10.4%, and the MSCI Emerging Markets Index dropped by 16.6%.\n\nIn fixed income markets, US Treasury yields generally rose due to normalizing US monetary policy. Despite volatility within the year— for instance, the 10-year US Treasury yield rose from about 2.5% at the start to a seven-year high of 3.2% on November 3— by year-end it softened to 2.7%, influenced by concerns over US-China trade disputes and a flight to safe assets.\n\nIn the currency markets, the US dollar strengthened, following US rate hikes. The US dollar index rose by 4.4%, while major currencies such as the euro and renminbi depreciated by about 5% against the US dollar. Moreover, some emerging market currencies, affected by domestic political and economic instability, suffered further depreciation— for example, the Argentine peso and Turkish lira fell by around 50% and 30%, respectively. Conversely, the yen appreciated by 2.7% against the US dollar amid safe-haven demand.\n\nTable 1 lists the performance of major currencies, bond, and stock markets in 2018.\n\nTable 1 2018 Market Returns\n\n# Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HKD 10.9 billion in 2018, including HKD 5.74 billion from bond investments, HKD -2.07 billion from Hong Kong equity investments, HKD -3.87 billion from other equity investments, HKD -0.90 billion due to valuation declines of non-HKD assets in foreign exchange terms, and HKD 2.19 billion from other investments held through the subsidiaries of the Exchange Fund. Additionally, the strategic asset portfolio experienced valuation declines of HKD 0.50 billion.\n\nBy the end of 2018, the total assets of the Exchange Fund amounted to HKD 4,054.9 billion. The total market value of investments in the long-term growth portfolios was HKD 283.6 billion, including private equity of HKD 191.1 billion and real estate of HKD 92.5 billion. The total committed but unextracted amount for investments was HKD 202.4 billion.\n\nThe investment return for the Exchange Fund (excluding the strategic asset portfolio) in 2018 was 0.3%. The return for the investment portfolios was -2.4%, while the support portfolio achieved a return of 2.1%. Since initiating investments in the long-term growth portfolios in 2009, the internal rate of return has been 12.9% annually.\n\nFigure 1 depicts the annual return rates of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2018. Table 2 shows the 2018 investment return and the average returns over different periods. The average return over the past 3 years was 3.2%, over 5 years 2.1%, over 10 years 2.8%, and since 1994 4.7%.

During the year, the HKMA continued to strengthen its institutional governance, including supporting staff in improving their professional capabilities, implementing strict fiscal control, and enhancing information technology security to address challenges brought by the implementation of new measures and increasing workload.\n\n# Maintaining Public Contact\n\n# Media Relations and Social Media\n\nThe HKMA maintains close ties with the media to increase transparency and deepen the public's understanding of its policies and work. In 2018, the HKMA organized a total of 96 public media events, including 21 press conferences, 11 on-site interviews, and 64 other public activities. Additionally, during the year, 39 media interviews were arranged, and 462 bilingual press releases were issued. The HKMA also handles a large volume of media inquiries daily.\n\nTo enhance society’s awareness of the HKMA’s main functions, the HKMA hosts media briefings and workshops for local and overseas media, covering topics such as the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), fintech development, green finance, and infrastructure financing. Besides enriching content on its YouTube channel and LinkedIn page, the HKMA launched an official Facebook page in July to further strengthen its communication with the public via social media.\n\nThe HKMA Chief Executive, Mr. Norman Chan (left), and the Environment Bureau’s mascot “Big Waste Ghost” promote the use of “Air Pilot Series” Hong Kong dollar banknotes through social media.\n\n# Public Inquiries\n\nPublic inquiry services serve as an effective channel for enhancing citizens’ understanding of the HKMA’s main functions and operations. In 2018, a total of 9,950 inquiries were processed, about half of which related to banking policies and regulations, banking consumer issues, and banknotes and coins, especially the coin collection scheme, banking products and services, related guidelines and notices, the Faster Payment System “FPS,” virtual banks, and the 2018 Hong Kong new banknote series.\n\nFigure 1 shows the total number of public inquiries received annually since 2015, while Figure 2 lists the proportions of different inquiry types in 2018.\n\nFigure 1 Total number of public inquiries\n\nFigure 2 Breakdown of inquiries by type in 2018\n\n# Publications\n\nApart from the HKMA Annual Report, in 2018 the HKMA published two issues of the “Semi-annual Monetary and Financial Stability Report” and four quarterly reports, and regularly updated data in the “Financial Data Monthly.” These provide the latest and topical information and analysis on Hong Kong’s monetary, banking, and economic affairs. Furthermore, the HKMA issued 13 articles in “InSight,” elucidating various thematic topics related to its work.\n\n# The HKMA Website\n\nThe HKMA’s institutional website (www.hkma.gov.hk) provides over 60,000 pages of information in both English and traditional and simplified Chinese, facilitating public access to the latest information. The website also hosts records of “Recognized Institutions and Local Representative Offices,” kept under Section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as records of “Employees of Recognized Institutions and Securities Firms,” and records of “Licenses for Stored Value Payment Service Providers,” kept pursuant to the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance. The website features dedicated thematic pages and prominent quick links, alerting the public to new measures such as “FPS,” as well as important and timely matters like phone scams and the locations for parking cash-in-transit vehicles under the coin collection scheme.\n\nTo promote the adoption of open application programming interfaces (APIs) in banking, the HKMA leads by example by providing open APIs on its website starting July, allowing the public to access key information easily. The first batch of 50 open API data sets was successfully launched in July, covering commonly checked categories such as banking system statistics, the Exchange Fund, press releases, and schedules for cash-in-transit vehicles. The remaining 80 data sets will be phased in before mid-2019. To further facilitate public access to HKMA’s latest news and information, the HKMA is undertaking a comprehensive overhaul of its website design and content, aiming for a more user-friendly experience. The new website is expected to go live within 2019.\n\nThe HKMA actively supports the development and application of open APIs.\n\n# Public Education Program\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre, located on the 55th floor of the International Finance Centre Phase 2, introduces the HKMA’s work and enhances the public’s understanding of monetary and banking matters. The Centre comprises a Gallery and a Library, both open six days a week to visitors. The Gallery showcases the HKMA’s functions and the development of Hong Kong’s currency and banking sector; it also offers reading materials and exhibits for research on Hong Kong’s monetary, banking, and financial affairs.\n\nThe currency exhibit area displays designs, anti-counterfeiting features, production processes, and interesting facts about Hong Kong banknotes and coins. Renovation work was undertaken in Q1 2018, incorporating interactive elements such as educational games that allow visitors to learn about Hong Kong’s currency in an engaging way. The exhibit area also features a new art installation—a glass sculptural “Bauhinia Tree” made from 2,018 shredded banknotes rendered unusable for circulation, arranged into a three-dimensional cube, complemented by a mosaic artwork of Hong Kong coins inside the same area. The reimagined currency exhibition was reopened on August 16.\n\nThe Centre provides guided tours for visitors. Throughout the year, over 59,000 visitors toured the Centre, and more than 580 guided tours were conducted for schools and other groups (see Figure 3). Since opening in December 2003, the Centre has welcomed over 705,000 visitors. The adjacent Library holds more than 26,000 books, journals, and other publications for research topics related to Hong Kong’s currency, banking, finance, and central banking. The Library also houses records similar to those in the “Recognized Institutions and Local Representative Offices Record” and the “Employees of Recognized Institutions and Securities Firms Record” under Section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nAn interactive game illustrating the process of producing Hong Kong banknotes was introduced.\n\nThe art Bauhinia Tree suspended in the air, illuminated to show its changing seasonal beauty.\n\nThe Centre offers guided tours to schools and groups.\n\nSchool students and teachers from various districts attended public education lectures.\n\nTo maintain community ties and increase public understanding of the HKMA’s work, in 2018 the HKMA organized three public education lectures, attracting about 1,500 students and teachers, covering topics such as the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, banking system stability, the Deposit Protection Scheme, FPS, stored value payment tools, fintech, consumer protection, and employment information in the financial industry. Since launching these lectures in 1998, nearly 60,000 teachers and students have taken part.\n\nFigure 3 Classes of visitors to the HKMA Information Centre in 2018\n\n# HKMA Staff\n\nThe HKMA is part of the government structure but employs staff under non-civil service terms, attracting talents with appropriate experience and expertise. As a public sector institution, the HKMA continually streamlines workflows, improves efficiency, and enhances cost-effectiveness. It maintains a lean and flexible organizational structure and endeavors to implement new measures and handle increasing workloads primarily through reallocating existing personnel.\n\nThe HKMA is an equal opportunity employer ensuring staff work in a non-discriminatory environment. Its Equal Opportunities policy covers employment, remuneration and benefits, performance appraisal, promotion, transfer/training opportunities, and general conduct.\n\nThe HKMA hires, trains, and maintains a professional and skilled workforce to fulfill policy objectives and adapt flexibly to changing work demands. Employees are expected to uphold high standards of conduct and ethics at all times, adhering strictly to high personal behavioral and ethical norms, always serving the best interests of the HKMA.\n\n# Main Human Resources Data as of January 1, 2019\n\n# Changes in Organizational Structure in 2018\n\nThe Foreign Exchange Fund Investment Office was established on August 1, replacing the investment and related risk management functions previously handled by the Reserves Management Department and Risk Management and Oversight Department. The establishment of the Foreign Exchange Fund Investment Office highlights the HKMA’s investment functions, enhances its institutional image, and allows greater flexibility to respond to market changes, supporting ongoing expansion and diversification of foreign exchange fund investments.\n\nTable 1 lists the HKMA’s departmental staffing and actual number of personnel as of January 1, 2019.\n\nTable 1 HKMA Staffing and Actual Number of Employees by Department as of January 1, 2019\n\nEmployees responsible for overseeing investment risks are organized within the Foreign Exchange Fund Investment Office but are consolidated under the Risk Management and Oversight Department for presentation purposes.\n\n# Compensation and Benefits Policies and Salary Review Mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary consults the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for opinions from its governing board, references market salary levels and practices, and decides the HKMA staff’s remuneration and employment conditions. Compensation packages include cash salary and MPF contributions, plus basic benefits. Cash salary comprises a fixed monthly salary (basic pay) and, based on individual performance, an annual variable bonus paid at once.\n\nWhen reviewing HKMA staff salaries annually, the Financial Secretary consults the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee’s governing board, considering the previous year’s performance assessments, results from external HR consultancy surveys on financial industry compensation, and other relevant factors. High-performing employees may receive special adjustments to maintain competitiveness.\n\nSalary increments and variable pay for individual staff are approved by the Financial Secretary after consulting the governing board, with affected employees recusing themselves when their remuneration is discussed. Fixed salary adjustments and variable pay for staff at the management level and above are approved by the Financial Secretary based on the total approved allocation, with the relevant employees excusing themselves from meetings discussing their pay. Employees at supervisory and lower levels have fixed salary adjustments and variable pay determined by the HKMA Chief Executive under delegation from the Financial Secretary, based on the total approved remuneration budget.\n\n# Senior Management Compensation\n\nTable 2 shows the salary information of senior management in 2018.\n\n1. Actual salaries of employees with less than one year of service, excluding cumulative annual leave, are annualized to determine the average annual salary for relevant grades.\n2. The employee numbers include staff with less than one year’s service.

{"zh": "# 外匯基金\n\n- 審計署署長報告\n- 外匯基金財務報表\n\n# 審計署署長報告\n\n# 獨立審計師報告致財政司司長\n\n# 意見\n\n茲證明我已審計列載於第167至273頁外匯基金及其附屬公司（「集團」）的財務報表，該等財務報表包括外匯基金及集團於2018年12月31日的資產負債表與截至該日止年度的收支帳目、全面收益表、權益變動表和現金流量表，以及財務報表的附註，包括主要會計政策概要。\n\n我認為，該等財務報表已按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》真實而中肯地反映外匯基金及集團於2018年12月31日的財務狀況及截至該日止年度的財務表現和現金流量，並已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》（第66章）第7條下所發出的指示妥為擬備。\n\n# 意見的基礎\n\n我已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示及審計署的審計準則進行審計。我根據該等準則而須承擔的責任，詳載於本報告「審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任」部分。根據該等準則，我獨立於集團，並已按該等準則履行其他道德責任。我相信，我所獲得的審計憑證是充足和適當地為我的審計意見提供基礎。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項是根據我的專業判斷，對截至2018年12月31日止年度財務報表的審計最為重要的事項。我對整體財務報表進行審計及形成意見時處理了這些事項，而我不會對這些事項提供單獨的意見。\n\n# 按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.5、2.6及40.1。\n\n於2018年12月31日，集團按公平值列帳的金融資產共36,935.89億港元，金融負債共11,338.29億港元。\n\n93%的該等金融資產及所有該等金融負債的公平值為相同資產或負債於活躍市場的報價（第1級參數），或是以估值方法估計，而所用的參數是以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第2級參數）。\n\n其餘7%的該等金融資產的公平值，是以估值方法估計，而所用的參數並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第3級參數）。有關金融資產共2,756.31億港元，主要包括非上市投資基金。\n\n鑑於所涉數額龐大及涉及估計，按公平值列帳的金融 資產及金融負債的估值屬關鍵審計事項。\n\n就按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值，審計程序包括：\n\n- 了解不同類別金融資產及金融負債的估值程序，包括相關監控措施；\n- 評價及測試監控措施，包括電腦系統的相關應用程式監控措施；\n- 就金融資產及金融負債的估值、存在、權利與責任及完整性取得函證；\n- 若使用市場報價，根據獨立來源核實價格；\n- 若所用估值方法的參數是以可觀察市場數據為基礎，評價估值方法是否適合及有關假設是否合理，以及根據獨立來源核實參數；及\n- 若所用估值方法的參數並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎，評價估值方法是否適合，以及有關假設與參數是否合理。\n\n# 按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.12、20及21。\n\n集團的投資物業按公平值列帳，於2018年12月31日共值253.21億港元。集團亦於3間聯營公司及20間合營公司擁有權益，該等公司主要業務為持有海外投資物業，有關權益共值443.36億港元。不論是由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有，該等投資物業的公平值均主要根據獨立專業估值師的估值釐定。該等估值涉及重大判斷及估計，包括所用的估值方法及假設。\n\n就按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值，審計程序包括：\n\n- 獲取及審視由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有的投資物業的估值報告，並核實公平值是根據有關估值報告所列的估值釐定；\n- 評估估值師的獨立性及資歷；及\n- 評價估值方法是否適合，以及有關假設與參數是否合理。\n\n# 其他資料\n\n金融管理專員須對其他資料負責。其他資料包括金融管理局2018年年報內的所有資料，但不包括財務報表及我的審計師報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見並不涵蓋其他資料，我亦不對其他資料發表任何形式的鑒證結論。\n\n就財務報表審計而言，我有責任閱讀其他資料，從而考慮其他資料是否與財務報表或我在審計過程中得悉的情況有重大矛盾，或者似乎存有重大錯誤陳述。基於我已執行的工作，如果我認為其他資料存有重大錯誤陳述，我需要報告該事實。在這方面，我沒有任何報告。\n\n# 金融管理專員及外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會就財務報表而須承擔的責任\n\n金融管理專員須負責按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》及行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示擬備真實而中肯的財務報表，及落實其認為必要的內部控制， 使財務報表不存有因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在擬備財務報表時，金融管理專員須負責評估集團持續經營的能力，以及在適用情況下披露與持續經營有關的事項，並以持續經營作為會計基礎。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會負責監督集團的財務報告過程。\n\n# 審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任\n\n我的目標是就整體財務報表是否不存有任何因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述取得合理保證，並發出包括我意見的審計師報告。合理保證是高水平的保證，但不能確保按審計署審計準則進行的審計定能發現所存有的任何重大錯誤陳述。錯誤陳述可以由欺詐或錯誤引起，如果合理預期它們個別或滙總起來可能影響財務報表使用者所作出的經濟決定，則會被視作重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在根據審計署審計準則進行審計的過程中，我會運用專業判斷並秉持專業懷疑態度。我亦會：\n\n- 識別和評估因欺詐或錯誤而導致財務報表存有重大錯誤陳述的風險；設計及執行審計程序以應對這些風險；以及取得充足和適當的審計憑證，作為我意見的基礎。由於欺詐可能涉及串謀、偽造、蓄意遺漏、虛假陳述，或凌駕內部控制的情況，因此未能發現因欺詐而導致重大錯誤陳述的風險，較未能發現因錯誤而導致者為高；\n- 了解與審計相關的內部控制，以設計適當的審計程序。然而，此舉並非旨在對集團內部控制的有效性發表意見；\n- 評價金融管理專員所採用的會計政策是否恰當，以及其作出的會計估計和相關資料披露是否合理；\n- 判定金融管理專員以持續經營作為會計基礎的做法是否恰當，並根據所得的審計憑證，判定是否存在與事件或情況有關，而且可能對集團持續經營的能力構成重大疑慮的重大不確定性。如果我認為存在重大不確定性，則有必要在審計師報告中請使用者留意財務報表中的相關資料披露。假若所披露的相關資料不足，我便須發出非無保留意見的審計師報告。我的結論是基於截至審計師報告日止所取得的審計憑證。然而，未來事件或情況可能導致集團不能繼續持續經營；\n- 評價財務報表的整體列報方式、結構和內容，包括披露資料，以及財務報表是否中肯反映交易和事項；及\n- 就集團中實體或業務活動的財務資料獲取充足和適當的審計憑證，以對財務報表發表意見。我負責指導、監督和執行集團審計。我對我的審計意見承擔全部責任。\n\n我會與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通計劃的審計範圍和時間以及重大審計發現等事項，包括我在審計期間識別出內部控制的任何重大缺陷。\n\n我亦會向外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會提交聲明，說明我已符合有關獨立性的相關道德要求，並與他們溝通所有被合理認為可能會影響我獨立性的關係和其他事項，以及在適用的情況下，相關的防範措施。\n\n從與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通的事項中，我會決定哪些事項對本期財務報表的審計最為重要，因而構成關鍵審計事項。我會在審計師報告中描述這些事項，除非法律法規不允許對某件事項作出公開披露，或在極端罕見的情況下，因為有合理預期在我報告中溝通某事項而造成的負面後果將會超過其產生的公眾利益而我決定不應在報告中溝通該事項。\n\n審計署署長\n朱乃璋\n\n2019 年 4 月 4 日\n", "en": "# Official Report of the Director of Audit\n\n# Financial Statements of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report to the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI hereby certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) as set out on pages 167 to 273, which comprise the statement of assets and liabilities as at 31 December 2018, and the income and expenditure account, the statement of comprehensive income, the statement of changes in equity, and the cash flow statement for the year then ended, and the notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements have been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants, to present a true and fair view of the financial position of the Exchange Fund and the Group as at 31 December 2018, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended, and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directives issued under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Chapter 66) by the Chief Executive.\n\n# Basis for Opinion\n\nI have conducted my audit in accordance with the directives issued under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Hong Kong Standards on Auditing prescribed by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants. My responsibilities under those standards are described in the “Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements” section of this report. I am independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to my audit of the financial statements in Hong Kong, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.\n\n# Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were the most significant in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2018. These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Valuation of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities at Fair Value\n\nPlease refer to notes 2.5, 2.6, and 40.1 to the financial statements.\n\nAs at 31 December 2018, the Group’s financial assets at fair value amounted to HKD 3,693.589 billion, and financial liabilities at fair value amounted to HKD 1,133.829 billion.\n\n93% of these financial assets and all of these financial liabilities’ fair values were based on quoted prices in active markets (Level 1 inputs), or were estimated using valuation techniques, with the inputs being observable market data (Level 2 inputs).\n\nThe remaining 7% of these financial assets’ fair values were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data (Level 3 inputs). These financial assets, amounting to HKD 275.631 billion, mainly include unlisted investment funds.\n\nDue to the large amounts involved and the estimation process, the valuation of these financial assets and liabilities at fair value is a key audit matter.\n\nAudit procedures for the valuation of financial assets and liabilities at fair value included:\n\n- Understanding the valuation processes for different classes of financial assets and financial liabilities, including related monitoring measures;\n- Evaluating and testing the monitoring measures, including computer system applications and controls;\n- Obtaining confirmations regarding the valuation, existence, rights and obligations, and completeness of the financial assets and liabilities;\n- Verifying prices with independent sources if market quotations are used;\n- For valuation techniques with observable inputs, assessing whether the valuation techniques are appropriate and the assumptions reasonable, and verifying the inputs with independent sources; and\n- For valuation techniques with unobservable inputs, assessing whether the valuation techniques are appropriate and whether the assumptions and inputs are reasonable.\n\n# Valuation of Investment Properties at Fair Value\n\nPlease refer to notes 2.12, 20, and 21 to the financial statements.\n\nThe Group’s investment properties at fair value as at 31 December 2018 were valued at HKD 25.321 billion. The Group also owns interests in three associates and twenty joint ventures, mainly engaged in holding overseas investment properties, which are valued at a total of HKD 44.336 billion. Whether held directly by the Group, or through associates or joint ventures, the fair values of these investment properties are primarily determined based on valuations from independent professional valuers. These valuations involve significant judgments and estimates, including the choice of valuation methods and assumptions.\n\nAudit procedures for the valuation of investment properties at fair value included:\n\n- Obtaining and reviewing valuation reports for properties held directly by the Group or through associates or joint ventures, and verifying that the fair values are determined based on the valuation reports;\n- Assessing the independence and qualifications of the valuers; and\n- Evaluating whether the valuation methods used are appropriate, and whether the assumptions and inputs are reasonable.\n\n# Other Information\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer is responsible for other information. Other information includes all information contained in the Annual Report issued by the Financial Services Bureau in 2018, but excludes the financial statements and my auditor’s report.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover other information, and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion on the other information.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, I have also read the other information to identify whether there are any material inconsistencies with the financial statements or with the knowledge I obtained during the course of my audit, or whether the other information appears to be materially misstated. If I conclude that there is a material misstatement, I are required to report that fact. In this regard, I have nothing to report.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Financial Management Officer and the Audit Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the Financial Statements\n\nThe Financial Management Officer is responsible for preparing the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the directives issued under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance by the Chief Executive, and for implementing the internal controls deemed necessary to ensure that the financial statements are free from material misstatement due to fraud or error.\n\nWhen preparing the financial statements, the Financial Management Officer must evaluate the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, and disclose related matters, as appropriate, and adopt the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\n\nMy objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Hong Kong Standards on Auditing prescribed by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. A misstatement can arise from fraud or error. If it is material, whether due to fraud or error, it could influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nIn performing my audit in accordance with the standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. Also, I:\n\n- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements due to fraud or error; design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks; and obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence to provide a basis for my opinion. Because fraud may involve collusion, forgery, deliberate omission, false statements, or override of internal controls, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than for error;\n- Obtain an understanding of internal controls relevant to the audit to design appropriate audit procedures. This does not, however, involve an assessment of the effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls;\n- Evaluate whether the accounting policies adopted by the Financial Management Officer are appropriate and the accounting estimates and related disclosures are reasonable;\n- Conclude on whether there is a material uncertainty related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my audit report. If the disclosures in the financial statements are inadequate, I am required to modify my audit opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to be unable to continue as a going concern;\n- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure, and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether they give a true and fair view;\n- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for directing, supervising, and performing the Group audit. I bear all the responsibility for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding the scope and timing of the audit, and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal controls identified during the audit.\n\nI also communicate with the Audit Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding my independence and any relationships or other matters that might reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and related safeguards where applicable.\n\nFrom the communications with the Audit Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine which matters are most significant to the current period’s audit and, accordingly, are the key audit matters. I describe these in my auditor’s report unless prohibited by law or regulation, or in extremely rare cases, I consider that including such information would be likely to cause significant negative consequences that outweigh the public interest in disclosure.\n\nThe Commissioner of the Office of the Director of Audit\n朱乃璋\n\nApril 4, 2019"}

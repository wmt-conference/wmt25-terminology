{"en": "The year of 2019 has been anything but uneventful.\n\nUS-China trade tensions remained a big wild card. Lingering uncertainties over trade talks between the world’s two largest economies rattled investor confidence and undermined international trade, manufacturing, investment and even consumption. Gone are the days when global economic expansion was a given. The global economy entered a synchronised slowdown during the year. In response to the slower growth, major central banks around the world have reversed course on their monetary policy normalisation.\n\nLocally, social incidents happening in the second half of the year dealt a further blow to the Hong Kong economy. The retail, tourism and catering sectors were among the hardest hit. For 2019 as a whole, the Hong Kong economy contracted by 1.2%, the first annual decline in a decade, while the unemployment rate rose to 3.3% from a multi-year low of 2.8% at the beginning of the year. As 2020 dawned, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak posed yet another significant threat to both global and local economies.\n\nIn the face of such an uncertain and challenging environment, it is of paramount importance to maintain monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong, as I made clear when taking over as Chief Executive of the HKMA on 1 October 2019.\n\n# Monetary and financial stability: the bedrock of an international financial centre\n\nThe Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) in place since 1983 has helped Hong Kong weather numerous challenges and shocks, demonstrating its important role as an anchor of Hong Kong’s economic prosperity and status as an international financial centre. Notwithstanding the challenging external and domestic environment during the year, the LERS continued to operate in a smooth and orderly manner, once again proving its resilience in times of uncertainty. Hong Kong’s banking system also remained sound and robust. The facts speak for themselves: the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained stable and has strengthened to the strong side of the Convertibility Zone in recent months, while bank deposits continued to grow during the year. In a nutshell, no noticeable outflow of funds from the Hong Kong dollar or the banking system was observed.\n\nThe stability of Hong Kong’s monetary and banking systems reflects not only the robustness of, but also strong confidence in, our systems. This did not happen overnight, but through years of efforts to build up buffers and strengthen surveillance, complemented by our swift response to rumours on social media platforms.\n\nOur preparations over the years for rainy days have built a solid foundation and strong buffers for Hong Kong’s monetary and banking systems. In addition to the vast foreign exchange reserves in our public coffers, our banking system has strong capital buffers, robust liquidity and very good asset quality, whether by international or historical standards. The eight rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures on property mortgages implemented since 2009 have also greatly enhanced banks’ resilience against a property market downturn.\n\nMarket surveillance and banking supervision make up the core part of our work in maintaining monetary and banking stability, and we have been strengthening our surveillance and supervisory framework from time to time. Apart from close monitoring of the credit and liquidity risks of banks, one of our new endeavours in the year was to make use of technology and granular data collected from banks to enhance our capability to monitor Hong Kong dollar funding and financial market activities in a more in-depth and timely manner. Stress tests and contingency planning have also been augmented in the light of the fast evolving economic and operating environment.\n\nIndeed, our robust regulatory regime has won strong endorsements internationally. During the year, the International Monetary Fund reaffirmed that Hong Kong was well placed to address both cyclical and structural changes, given its significant buffers. Hong Kong’s effective legal and institutional framework for combatting money laundering and terrorist financing also obtained a positive assessment from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), making Hong Kong the first in the Asia-pacific region to achieve an overall compliant result in the FATF’s Mutual Evaluation.\n\nConfidence is the foundation for the proper functioning of markets and is crucial to the safeguarding of monetary and financial stability. To maintain market confidence, we have to be on high alert for, and respond swiftly to, any malicious rumours that may potentially cast doubt on Hong Kong’s monetary or banking systems. This is particularly important given the prevalent use of social media and instant messaging nowadays. While a variety of rumours were spread on social media platforms by fearmongers during the outbreak of social unrest, our quick and clear rebuttals to these rumours through social media, in addition to traditional media, proved useful and effective in clearing the air, quelling false rumours from spreading further, and upholding international and public confidence in our systems.\n\n# Banking system: an important pillar of economic activity\n\nThe banking sector, as an essential pillar of economic activity, plays a fundamental role in ensuring the smooth running of society and the economy. Despite the challenging operating environment since the latter half of the year, banks have been working hard alongside others and doing their utmost to maintain normal operation of their core functions and continue serving businesses and the public.\n\nIn addition to basic banking services like deposits and transfers, an important function of banks is in extending credit to borrowers in support of the real economy. We are well aware of, and concerned about, the cash-flow problem facing businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), under the difficult economic conditions. While safeguarding banking stability, we have launched a number of initiatives to ensure continued funding support to SMEs. In particular, the Countercyclical Capital Buffer ratio of banks was reduced on two occasions, in October 2019 and March 2020, by a total of 150 basis points to 1.0%; the level of regulatory reserve requirement on banks was also reduced by half in April 2020. These measures release a total of around HK$1 trillion in lending capacity, providing banks with more room for lending to enterprises including SMEs. We have also set up a platform – the Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism – bringing together major banks in Hong Kong to explore and discuss specific measures to strengthen funding support for SMEs. I am pleased to see that many banks have responded proactively to our call and introduced relief measures such as principal moratorium for customers in need to ride out the storm.\n\nIn view of some SMEs’ feedback about difficulties in opening bank accounts, which is the very first step in accessing various banking services, we have made dedicated efforts to address this issue over the past few years. Our work is bearing fruit, as improvement in account opening for businesses is visible. As a further step to promote financial inclusion, the HKMA spearheaded the launch of tiered account services – Simple Bank Accounts (SBAs) with a streamlined customer due diligence process – to provide start-ups and SMEs with an alternative to traditional bank accounts. More than 2,800 SBAs have been opened so far.\n\n# International financial centre: from strength to strength\n\nWe have always been mindful of the need to strike a reasonable balance between regulation and development. Given the intense competition among financial centres, we have to work hard to strengthen Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre and thereby ensure its longer term stability. There are four key areas of work: technology, green finance, financial connectivity with the Mainland, and talent development.\n\n# Embracing technology in the digital era\n\nHong Kong has been moving fast in promoting financial technology (fintech) since the establishment of the HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office in 2016 and the introduction of the Smart Banking initiatives in 2017.\n\nOn the payment front, the vibrancy of the fintech ecosystem is evident in the strong momentum in the adoption of the Faster Payment System (FPS), the world’s first multi-currency, cross-banks and e-wallets, real-time retail payment platform. FPS registrations reached four million within a short span of 15 months, representing a high rate of penetration in a population of 7.5 million people. The Government has also adopted the FPS to provide the public with greater convenience in paying taxes, rates and water charges. More and more businesses are expected to use this fast, safe and convenient means of receiving and making payment to enhance operational efficiency.\n\nIn the banking sector, significant progress was seen in applying fintech to their banking services and business operations. According to a study conducted by the HKMA, almost 90% of the surveyed retail banks have adopted, or are planning to adopt, artificial intelligence in their business applications. With the HKMA’s facilitation, banks have been applying big data and consumer behavioural analytics in their personal credit products. They have also launched over 800 Open Application programming Interfaces in the first two phases, covering a range of banking products and services. While encouraging banks to use fintech, we did not lose sight of the need for enhanced technology risk management and consumer protection in digital banking services. Timely supervisory guidance has been provided to banks in these areas.\n\nRegulatory technology (Regtech) is another area of great interest to banks, for its potential of enabling banks to conduct regulatory compliance and risk management, particularly in anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT), more efficiently and cost-effectively. To facilitate greater industry adoption of Regtech and the building of a wider Regtech ecosystem, the HKMA organised the inaugural AML/CFT Regtech Forum and issued its first Regtech newsletter in November to discuss possible use cases of Regtech. At the same time, the HKMA, as a banking supervisor, is exploring the use of supervisory technology (Suptech), including new data science and analytics, to enhance work effectiveness and efficiency. We have embarked on a series of studies and developed a road map for the implementation of Suptech in the next few years.\n\nFrom a broader perspective, this is only the start of the fintech journey in the banking sector. The HKMA granted eight licences to virtual banks during the year. One of the virtual banks officially launched its services in March 2020, while some other virtual banks have commenced pilot trials through the HKMA’s Fintech Supervisory Sandbox. I look forward to the launch of the other virtual banks and the introduction of more innovative and diversified banking services to the people of Hong Kong that would help raise the global competitiveness of our banking sector.\n\nMore exciting developments are also expected at the international level. After successfully completing a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) trial to connect our blockchain-based trade finance platform, eTradeConnect, with its European counterpart, we are conducting another PoC trial with the platform of the people’s Bank of China, paving the way for the digitalisation of cross-border trades. We have begun a joint research project with the Bank of Thailand to study the application of Central Bank Digital Currency to cross-border payments. The Bank for International Settlements also put its first Innovation Hub Centre into operation in Hong Kong in November to foster fintech collaboration within the central banking community. All these developments present clear evidence of Hong Kong’s leading global position in fintech development.\n\n# Promoting green and sustainable finance for a better future\n\nClimate-related risks have drawn increasing global attention in recent years. To contribute to the global efforts in addressing this challenge, the HKMA unveiled three key measures in May to promote green finance development in Hong Kong in different capacities.\n\nAs a banking supervisor, the HKMA is undertaking a three-phased approach to promoting green and sustainable banking. A framework for assessing the “greenness” of banks has been developed for industry consultation under phase I, paving the way for the formulation of supervisory expectations and requirements for the banking industry under phase II and implementation under phase III.\n\nAs the manager of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA actively advances responsible investment by integrating environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into its investment activities. Specifically, we have adopted the principle of giving priority to green and ESG investments if their long-term return is comparable to other investments on a risk-adjusted basis. After venturing into the green bond market in 2015 as one of the early investors, we will continue to grow our green bond portfolio and invest in other ESG assets. We will also join hands with like-minded investors and regulators to promote best practices on ESG through our participation in international organisations in the ESG community.\n", "zh": "2019年幾乎沒有任何平凡的一年。\n\n中美貿易緊張局勢依然是個大未知數。兩個世界最大經濟體之間貿易談判的持續不確定性動搖了投資者信心，削弱了國際貿易、製造業、投資甚至消費的基礎。全球經濟擴張曾經是理所當然的事情已經成為過去式。今年，全球經濟同步放緩。為應對增長放緩，全球主要中央銀行紛紛逆轉貨幣政策正常化的步伐。\n\n本地方面，下半年發生的社會事件進一步打擊了香港經濟。零售、旅遊和餐飲業受創最嚴重。整體而言，2019年，香港經濟收縮1.2%，為過去十年來的首次年度負增長，而失業率亦由年初的2.8%的多年低位上升至3.3%。隨著2020年的到來，新型冠狀病毒（COVID-19）疫情又對全球及本地經濟構成了又一重大威脅。\n\n面對如此不確定和充滿挑戰的環境，維持香港的貨幣及金融穩定尤為重要。當我於2019年10月1日就任香港金融管理局（HKMA）行政總裁時，亦特別強調了這一點。\n\n# 貨幣及金融穩定：國際金融中心的基石\n\n自1983年實行聯繫匯率制度（LERS）以來，香港成功應對了多次挑戰與衝擊，展現了其作為香港經濟繁榮的樞紐和國際金融中心地位的重要作用。今年在困難的外部和內部環境下，聯繫匯率制度依然平穩有序地運作，再次證明了其在不確定時代的韌性。香港的銀行體系亦保持健全和強韌。事實本身已經說明了一切：港元匯率保持穩定，並在最近幾個月升至兌換區的較強一側，銀行存款亦持續增長。在總結來說，沒有觀察到港元或銀行體系的資金明顯流出。\n\n香港貨幣及銀行體系的穩定，不僅反映系統的韌性，也彰顯市場對我們系統的高度信心。這不是一夜之功，而是多年來建立儲備和加強監察的努力積累，再加上我們對社交媒體傳言的迅速反應，有效地保護了信心。\n\n多年來的準備工作為香港的貨幣及銀行系統打下了堅實的基礎和強大的儲備。不僅擁有巨額的外匯儲備，我們的銀行體系亦擁有堅實的資本緩衝、充裕的流動性和良好的資產質量，無論按國際或歷史標準衡量。自2009年起實施的八輪反周期宏觀審慎措施，也大大增強了銀行抵禦房地產市場下行的韌性。\n\n市場監測和銀行監管是我們維持貨幣和銀行穩定工作的核心，我們也不斷加強監察和監管框架。除緊密監控銀行信貸和流動性風險外，今年的一個新舉措是利用科技和從銀行收集的詳細數據，提升我們審慎監測港元資金和金融市場活動的能力，更加深入和及時。鑑於經濟和營運環境的快速變化，我們也增強了壓力測試和應急預案。\n\n事實上，我們的堅實監管制度已獲得國際社會的高度認可。今年，國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）重申，依靠充足的緩衝，香港能應對周期性和結構性變化。香港在打擊洗錢和恐怖分子融資方面的法律和制度框架，也獲得了金融行動特別工作組（FATF）的積極評估，使香港成為亞太地區首個在FATF互評中取得全面合規成績的地區。\n\n信心是市場正常運作的基礎，也是維護貨幣和金融穩定的關鍵。為了維持市場信心，我們必須保持高度警覺，迅速回應可能對香港貨幣或銀行系統造成疑慮的惡意傳言。這在當今社交媒體和即時訊息盛行的時代尤為重要。雖然在社會動盪期間，有恐慌者在社交媒體上散布各種謠言，但我們透過社交媒體和傳統媒體快速而清晰的反駁，成功澄清事實，阻止謠言擴散，並維護國際和公眾對我們系統的信心。\n\n# 銀行體系：經濟活動的重要支柱\n\n作為經濟活動的核心支撐，銀行業在確保社會和經濟順利運作方面扮演著根本角色。即使自下半年起操作環境充滿挑戰，銀行仍與其他行業攜手努力，盡最大努力保持核心業務的正常運行，持續為企業和市民提供服務。\n\n除了存款和轉帳等基本銀行服務外，銀行的重要功能還包括向借款人提供信貸，以支持實體經濟運轉。在當前經濟困難的形勢下，我們清楚並關切企業，尤其是中小企業（SMEs）的現金流問題。在保障銀行體系穩定的同時，我們亦推出多項措施，確保持續為SMEs提供融資支持。特別是，銀行的反周期資本緩衝比率已在2019年10月和2020年3月兩次下調，共計降低150個基點至1.0%；2020年4月，監管準備金要求也減半。這些措施釋放約一萬億港元的貸款容量，為銀行向企業，包括SMEs提供貸款提供了更多空間。我們亦建立了一個平台——銀行業中小企業貸款協調機制，匯聚香港主要銀行，共同探討和推動具體措施，增強對SMEs的資金支持。我很高興看到，許多銀行積極響應我們的號召，推出了如展延還款等纾困措施，以協助企業渡過難關。\n\n鑑於部分中小企業反映在開設銀行帳戶上遇到困難——這是進入多項銀行服務的第一步，我們在過去幾年持續努力解決這個問題。業績逐漸顯現，企業開戶情況已有所改善。為進一步推動金融包容，我們引領推出層級賬戶服務——簡便銀行帳戶（SBAs），擁有 streamlined的客戶盡職審查流程，為創業公司和中小企業提供傳統賬戶的替代方案。目前已開設逾2800個SBAs。\n\n# 國際金融中心：實力越發雄厚\n\n我們始終謹慎平衡監管與發展的關係。鑑於金融中心之間競爭激烈，我們必須努力提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力，以確保其長遠穩定。主要工作重點涵蓋四個方面：科技、綠色金融、與內地的金融連通，以及人才發展。\n\n# 在數字時代擁抱科技\n\n香港在推動金融科技（fintech）方面進展迅速，自2016年成立HKMA金融科技推動辦公室及2017年推出智慧銀行（Smart Banking）計劃以來，不斷推進。\n\n在支付領域，科技生態系統的活力體現在「快匯通」（FPS）作為全球首個多貨幣、多銀行和電子錢包的即時零售支付平台的快速採用。推出15個月內，註冊用戶已達四百萬，這在人口7.5百萬的香港是極高的滲透率。政府亦採用快匯通來提供便利的稅款、水費、地價等繳款渠道。預計越來越多企業會使用這種快速、安全、便利的支付方式來提高運作效率。\n\n在銀行業方面，應用金融科技於服務和業務運作方面取得顯著進展。根據HKMA的一項研究，近九成的零售銀行已採用或計畫採用人工智能於業務應用。借助HKMA的推動，銀行將大數據和用戶行為分析應用於個人信用產品。他們也在前兩階段推出超過800個開放API，涵蓋多種銀行產品和服務。同時，我們在促進金融科技發展時，也未忽視數碼銀行服務中技術風險管理和消費者保障的需求，並為銀行提供了及時的監管指引。\n\n另一個備受關注的領域是監管科技（Regtech），其潛力在於幫助銀行更有效、經濟地進行合規和風險管理，尤其是在反洗錢和反恐資金籌集（AML/CFT）方面。為推動行業更廣泛採用Regtech並建立更完整的Regtech生態系，我們組織了首屆反洗錢/反恐融資Regtech論壇，並於11月發行首份Regtech通訊，討論Regtech的應用案例。同時，HKMA作為銀行監管機構，亦在探索運用監管科技（Suptech），包括新數據科學和分析技術，以提升工作效率。過去一年，我們已展開多項研究，並制定了未來幾年實施Suptech的路線圖。\n\n從更宏觀的角度來看，這只是香港銀行科技之旅的開始。今年獲發的八張虛擬銀行牌照中，一家已於2020年3月正式推出服務，其他幾家亦在進行試點。展望未來，期待更多虛擬銀行陸續推出，並為香港帶來更多創新多元的銀行服務，促進我國銀行業的國際競爭力。\n\n在國際層面亦有更多令人振奮的發展。例如，我們成功完成一項概念驗證（PoC）試驗，將我們基於區塊鏈的貿易融資平台eTradeConnect與歐洲合作方連接，並正在與中國人民銀行的平臺進行另一個PoC測試，為跨境貿易數字化鋪路。我們也與泰國央行展開聯合研究，探討中央銀行數字貨幣（CBDC）於跨境支付的應用。幹道國際清算銀行（BIS）於2020年11月在香港啟動了其首個創新中心，促進金融科技與全球央行社群的合作。所有這些都彰顯香港在全球金融科技領域的領先地位。\n\n# 推動綠色和可持續金融，創造更美好的未來\n\n近年來，氣候相關風險引起全球愈來愈多的關注。為了促進香港綠色金融的發展，HKMA於五月推出三項關鍵舉措，從不同層面推動綠色金融。\n\n作為銀行監管機構，HKMA正採用三階段方法推動綠色和可持續銀行業。第一階段已制定一個評估銀行“綠色”程度的框架，供業界諮詢，為第二階段制定監管預期和要求，以及第三階段的執行鋪路。\n\n作為兌換基金管理局，HKMA積極推動負責任投資，在投資活動中融合環境、社會和治理（ESG）因素。我們採用一項原則，即在長遠回報風險調整可比的情況下，優先投資於綠色和ESG資產。自2015年率先投資綠色債券市場以來，我們將持續擴大綠色債券組合，並投資於其他ESG資產。我們亦將與志同道合的投資者和監管機構合作，在國際組織中推動ESG最佳實踐。"}

{"en": "# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nThe Hong Kong economy contracted in 2019, reflecting global economic slowdown, lingering US-China trade conflicts and local social incidents. As economic conditions deteriorated rapidly in the second half of the year, the labour market faced increasing pressures. Inflation also increased due to a sharp rise in pork prices. Economic performance for 2020 is expected to remain challenging as the novel coronavirus outbreak hits the already weakening economy. Given the difficult economic environment, the Government and the HKMA have rolled out measures to support the economy, especially households and small and medium-sized enterprises.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Real activities\n\nFollowing a 2.9% expansion in 2018, the Hong Kong economy contracted by 1.2% in 2019, marking the first annual contraction since 2009. In particular, the economy entered into a recession in the second half of the year, with the seasonally adjusted real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) shrinking consecutively in the second, third and fourth quarters (Table 1). The decline in economic activities reflected a notable reduction in domestic demand (Chart 1). As the local social incidents weighed significantly on consumption activities and sentiments in the latter part of the year, private consumption expenditure recorded the first annual decline since 2003. Overall investment spending also dropped amid dampened business sentiments. On the external front, slowing global economic growth and additional tariffs levied amid the US-China trade tensions led to a decline in Hong Kong’s exports of goods. Exports of services also saw the largest annual decline on record because the social incidents led to a severe deterioration in inbound tourism. With smaller domestic and re-export-induced demand, imports of goods and services also worsened. On a net basis, net trade contributed positively to GDP in 2019 (Chart 1) because total imports declined even faster than total exports.\n\nIn view of the strong economic headwinds, the Government introduced several rounds of measures between August and December 2019 to alleviate the financial burden of residents, safeguard jobs and support enterprises, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as well as those in the hard-hit sectors, such as retail, food services, transport and tourism. To allow banks to be more supportive to the domestic economy and help mitigate the economic cycle, the HKMA announced on 14 October a reduction in the Countercyclical Capital Buffer ratio of banks from 2.5% to 2.0%, thereby providing banks with more flexibility to release HK$200–300 billion in bank credit to enterprises including SMEs, and also established a Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism. A new relief measure for the 80% Guarantee product of the SME Financing Guarantee Scheme (SFGS) was introduced in September, allowing SME borrowers facing weakening cash flows to apply for principal moratorium to get immediate support. Further, a new 90% loan guarantee product under the SFGS was introduced in December to provide additional support to SMEs, businesses with relatively less operating experience, as well as professionals seeking to set up their own practices, to obtain financing.\n\n# Monetary conditions\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate and money markets functioned in a smooth and orderly manner in 2019. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained broadly stable throughout the year. As the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking was triggered in March, the HKMA purchased Hong Kong dollars from, and sold US dollars to, banks at the rate of HK$7.85/US$1, leading to a decline in the Aggregate Balance in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System. The Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained largely steady at the longer end, while short-term rates generally picked up. At the retail level, several retail banks lowered their Best Lending Rates by 12.5 basis points in late October following the decreases in the target range for the US federal funds rate. As for monetary aggregates, total bank loans increased by 6.7% in 2019, up from 4.4% in 2018, and total deposits grew by 2.9% during the year.\n\n# Inflation\n\nThe underlying inflation rate, which nets out the effects of the Government’s one-off relief measures, rose slightly to 3.0% in 2019, from 2.6% in 2018. The mild increase in inflation was mainly driven by the elevated pork prices due to the disrupted supply of fresh pork since May (Chart 2). Excluding basic food items, price pressures were held at moderate levels throughout the year. In particular, the housing component of consumer price inflation softened in tandem with an earlier consolidation of fresh-letting private residential rentals. More broadly, the mild growth in nominal wages and the slower increase in commercial rentals1 helped keep local business costs in check. Externally, import price inflation moderated, in line with lower inflation in some of Hong Kong’s major import sources amid slower global economic growth.\n\n# Labour market\n\nThe labour market remained broadly resilient in the first half of 2019 but faced mounting pressures in the second half (Chart 3). After staying at a multi-year low of 2.8% in the first two quarters, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose to 2.9% in the third quarter and 3.3% in the final quarter, with those for the consumption and tourism-related sectors recording even more visible rises amid the social incidents. Overall labour demand also shrank visibly in the latter part of the year as total employment and the number of privatesector vacancies fell. The reduction in labour demand was particularly prominent in the retail, accommodation and food services sectors, as well as import/export trade and construction sectors. On the supply side, the labour force participation rate edged down, partly due to a cyclical response to the economic recession. As the labour market came under increasing pressures, growth in nominal wage and earnings showed signs of a slowdown towards the end of the year.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe local stock market experienced sharp fluctuations during 2019. After a market rally in the first four months, the Hang Seng Index plunged in May due in part to concerns about the re-escalation of the US-China trade tensions (Chart 4). While recouping some lost ground in June in response to major central banks’ signals of a more accommodative monetary stance, stock prices came under pressure again amid slowing global economic growth and local social incidents. Towards the end of the year, stock prices regained some upward momentum following the announcement of a “phase one” trade agreement between the US and Mainland China. The Hang Seng Index finished the year at 28,190, registering an overall gain of 9.1% for the year. By contrast, the average daily turnover declined by about 19% from a year earlier. The listings of a major Mainland tech company and a leading beer manufacturer helped expand equity funds raised through initial public offerings (IpOs) to HK$314.2 billion in 2019. Hong Kong ranked first globally in terms of funds raised through IpOs for a second straight year in 2019.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market staged a strong rebound in the first five months of 2019 but generally softened in the remainder of the year. Market sentiment improved in early 2019 partly because concerns over US-China trade tensions temporarily eased, but the sentiment was dampened afterwards by the re-escalated US-China trade tensions, prolonged social incidents and weakened domestic economic conditions. Overall housing prices moderated by 5% from the peak in May through December, though still recording an annual growth of 5% due to a 10% rebound in the first five months (Chart 4). Transaction volume in 2019 increased by 4% to 59,797 units from a year earlier, reflecting the strong trading activities in the early part of the year. Housing affordability remained stretched, with the price-toincome ratio and the income-gearing ratio staying high at 17.9 and 80.9 respectively, far above their long-term averages.2 To assist home buyers with immediate housing needs, the Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation (HKMC) in mid-October raised the cap on the value of completed residential properties eligible for a mortgage loan under the Mortgage Insurance programme.3 On the other hand, the non-residential property market faced stronger downward pressures in 2019. In particular, both prices and rentals for retail premises registered the largest declines since the global financial crisis in 2008, reflecting the worsening business conditions during the year.\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nHong Kong’s economic performance for 2020 is expected to be very challenging, with significant near-term downside risks associated with the coronavirus outbreak. Some sectors, such as retail, accommodation, food services, tourism and transport, which have yet to recover from the disruptions caused by the social incidents, will be doubly hit. However, the countercyclical fiscal measures announced in the 2020/21 Budget, which include a one-off cash handout and a new concessionary low-interest loan under the SFGS with 100% Government guarantee, are expected to provide some support to the economy, especially households and SMEs. On 16 March 2020, the HKMA further reduced the Countercyclical Capital Buffer ratio of banks from 2.0% to 1.0%, which will allow banks to be more supportive to the domestic economy, in particular those sectors and individuals that are expected to experience additional short-term stress due to the impact arising from the coronavirus outbreak. Analysed by GDP component, private consumption and investment are likely to remain weak because of the fragile consumer and business confidence. While government consumption will contribute to economic growth, public investment expenditure is anticipated to be relatively sluggish following the completion of some major infrastructure projects. On the external front, the “phase one” trade deal between the US and Mainland China is assessed to be slightly positive for the local economy in the short term. However, Hong Kong’s external trade performance will continue to be weighed down by weak global economic growth and trade flows. In particular, the coronavirus outbreak may lead to regional supply chain disruptions and slower cross-border economic activities, in tourism for example, thereby restraining Hong Kong’s exports. The Government forecasts real GDP growth for 2020 in the range of -1.5% to 0.5%, while growth forecasts by international organisations and privatesector analysts averaged -3.3%.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nInflationary pressures are expected to moderate in 2020 because of the sub-par economic conditions, the consolidation of private residential rentals and mild imported inflation. Market consensus forecasts a headline inflation rate for 2020 of 1.8%, and the Government projects the headline and underlying inflation rates to be 1.7% and 2.5% respectively. In the labour market, the unemployment rate is likely to rise further in the near term, given the weakened economic prospects and the coronavirus outbreak. privatesector analysts expect the unemployment rate to rise to about 4.0% in 2020.\n\n# Uncertainties and risks\n\nThe subdued economic outlook for 2020 is subject to a number of uncertainties and risks, including those stemming from the slowing global economy, US-China trade relations, Mainland’s economic performance, local social incidents and the persistence of the coronavirus outbreak. In particular, a prolonged coronavirus outbreak could trigger a more visible global economic slowdown and a repricing of assets, with the resulting unfavourable macroeconomic environment and tighter financial conditions posing further downward pressures on domestic real activities. However, the more concerted effort by major central banks to ease their monetary policies may provide a cushion against the negative economic impact inflicted by the outbreak.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector was resilient in 2019 despite the challenging environment with the global economic slowdown, US-China trade tensions and local social incidents. Bank balance sheet trends were stable, as both loans and deposits grew moderately. The capital and liquidity positions of the banking sector remained solid and asset quality held up well. The banking sector remained profitable with stable average return on asset.\n", "zh": "# 經濟與金融環境\n\n2019年，香港經濟收縮，反映全球經濟放緩、持續的美中貿易沖突以及本地社會事件。隨著下半年經濟狀況迅速惡化，勞動市場面臨日益加劇的壓力。由於豬肉價格劇烈上升，通脹亦有所增加。預計2020年的經濟表現將依然充滿挑戰，因新冠病毒疫情衝擊已經削弱的經濟。鑑於經濟環境困難，政府和香港金融管理局已推出多項措施，以支持經濟，特別是家庭和中小企業。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 實體活動\n\n繼2018年增長2.9％後，2019年香港經濟收縮1.2％，為自2009年以來首次年度萎縮。特別是在下半年，經濟進入衰退，經季調實質國內生產總值（GDP）在第二、第三和第四季度連續收縮（表1）。經濟活動的下降反映出國內需求的明顯減少（圖1）。由於社會事件對2019年後期的消費活動和情緒造成重大影響，私人消費支出錄得自2003年以來的首次年度下降。整體投資支出亦因企業信心低迷而下降。在外部方面，由於全球經濟增長放緩以及美中貿易緊張期間徵收額外關稅，香港的貨物出口下降。服務出口也出現有史以來最大年度跌幅，因社會事件導致入境旅遊嚴重惡化。隨著國內需求和再出口需求減少，貨物和服務的進口亦呈惡化趨勢。由於進口總額的跌幅甚至快於出口，2019年淨貿易對GDP有正面貢獻（圖1）。\n\n鑑於經濟逆風強勁，政府於2019年8月至12月間多次推出措施，以減輕居民的經濟負擔、保障就業，並支持企業，特別是中小企業和受到嚴重打擊的行業，如零售、餐飲、交通和旅遊。為使銀行能更好支持本地經濟並緩解經濟循環，香港金融管理局於10月14日宣布將逆周期資本緩衝比率由2.5%降至2.0%，為銀行釋放2000至3000億港元信貸，並建立銀行業中小企業貸款協調機制。九月，推出了一項新的80%擔保產品，用於中小企業融資擔保計劃（SFGS），讓財務流動性受壓的中小企業借款人能申請本金展延，以獲得即時支援。同時，十二月推出了新的90%貸款擔保產品，為中小企業、較少經營經驗的企業及尋求自我創業的專業人士提供額外支持，幫助他們取得融資。\n\n# 貨幣狀況\n\n2019年,香港美元匯率和貨幣市場運作平穩有序。全年，港元匯率基本保持穩定。由於三月份啟動了弱方兌換承諾，香港金融管理局按HK$7.85/美元的匯率買入港元並賣出美元，導致聯繫匯率制度下的總體結餘（Aggregate Balance）下降。港元拆息在長期利率方面保持大致平穩，而短期利率則普遍上升。在零售層面，部分零售銀行在十月底下調其最佳貸款利率12.5個基點，原因是美聯儲下調聯邦基金目標利率範圍。關於貨幣總量，2019年，銀行貸款總額上升6.7%，高於2018年的4.4%；存款總額則增長2.9%。\n\n# 通脹\n\n剔除政府一次性紓困措施的影響後，2019年的基本通脹率略升至3.0%，高於2018年的2.6%。通脹的溫和上升主要受豬肉價格升高影響，自五月起新鮮豬肉供應中斷（圖2）。剔除基本食品，全年價格壓力保持適中。尤其是消費物價構成中的房地產部分，隨著較早時期私人物業出租合約的整理而有所緩和。更廣泛來看，名義工資的溫和增長以及商業租金漲幅放緩，幫助控制本地企業的成本。外圍方面，進口價格通脹有所放緩，與香港主要進口來源地的較低通脹同步，原因是全球經濟增長放緩。\n\n# 勞動市場\n\n2019年上半年，勞動市場保持相對韌性，但在下半年面臨越來越多的壓力（圖3）。在前兩個季度穩定於2.8%的多年度低點後，季調失業率升至第三季度的2.9%以及最後一季度的3.3%，其中消費和旅遊相關行業的失業率更為明顯受到社會事件的影響。整體勞動需求也在年底明顯收縮，總就業人數及私營部門空缺數都出現下降。零售、住宿和餐飲業，以及進出口貿易和建築業的失業率下降尤為顯著。在供應面，勞動參與率略有下降，部分原因是經濟衰退引發的週期性反應。隨著勞動市場壓力逐漸增加，名義工資和收入增長顯示放緩跡象。\n\n# 股市\n\n2019年本地股市經歷劇烈波動。在前四個月的市場反彈之後，5月恒生指數因擔憂中美貿易緊張再度升級而暴跌（圖4）。六月份，主要中央銀行暗示將採取更寬鬆的貨幣政策，使股價部分回升，但隨著全球經濟增長放緩和社會事件的持續，股價再次承壓。年底時，隨著美國與中國大陸宣布“第一階段”貿易協議，股價恢復了一些上升動力。恒生指數全年收報28,190點，全年漲幅達9.1%。相比之下，日均成交額同比下降約19%。主要內地科技公司和領先啤酒製造商的上市，促使2019年通過首次公開募股（IPO）籌集的資金達到3142億港元，使香港連續第二年在全球IPO募資金額中排名第一。\n\n# 房地產市場\n\n住宅地產市場在2019年前五個月至五個月展現出強勁反彈，但整體在餘下的時間內逐漸趨緩。2019年初，隨著對美中貿易緊張局勢暫時緩解的憂慮而改善市場情緒，但隨後由於貿易緊張再次升級、社會事件延長和國內經濟疲弱，情緒受挫。整體房價由五月的高點至十二月下調約5%，但因前五個月反彈10%，年內仍錄得5%的增長（圖4）。2019年的成交量較去年增加4%，達59,797宗，反映出年初的交易活躍。房屋負擔能力仍然吃緊，價格與收入比率及收入負擔比率分別保持在17.9和80.9，遠高於長期平均水平。為協助急需住所的買家，香港按揭證券有限公司（HKMC）在十月中旬調高了符合按揭保險計劃的完成住宅物業的最高價值上限。另一方面，非住宅物業市場在2019年面臨更大下行壓力。尤其是零售用地的價格和租金，出現自2008年全球金融危機以來最大幅度的下跌，反映出年度內商業狀況的惡化。\n\n# 經濟展望\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n預計2020年，香港經濟將面臨極大挑戰，與新冠病毒疫情相關的短期下行風險重大。部分行業如零售、住宿、餐飲、旅遊和交通尚未從社會事件造成的破壞中恢復，將受到雙重打擊。然而，2020/21財政預算中宣布的逆周期財政措施，包括一次性現金派發和由政府全額擔保的低息新貸款，預計能為經濟提供一定支持，尤其是家庭和中小企業。2020年3月16日，香港金融管理局再次將銀行的逆周期資本緩衝比率由2.0%降至1.0%，使銀行在支持本地經濟方面更具彈性，特別是那些預計會因新冠疫情而面臨短期額外壓力的行業和個人。按GDP組成分析，私人消費和投資可能仍會疲弱，因為消費者和企業信心脆弱。政府消費將對經濟成長有所貢獻，但由於部分重大基建項目已完工，公共投資支出預計較為緩慢。在外貿方面，美國與中國的“第一階段”貿易協議短期內對本地經濟略有正面影響，但香港的外貿表現仍會受到全球經濟增長放緩和貿易流動性不足的拖累。特別是疫情可能導致地區供應鏈中斷和跨境經濟活動放慢，例如旅遊業，從而抑制香港出口。政府預計2020年實質GDP增長約在-1.5%至0.5%之間，較國際組織及私營分析師的平均預測-3.3%略為樂觀。\n\n# 通脹與勞動市場\n\n由於經濟不佳、私人住宅租金整體收展以及溫和的進口通脹，預計2020年通脹壓力將趨於緩和。市場普遍預測2020年整體通脹率為1.8%，政府則預計標題與基本通脹率分別為1.7%與2.5%。在勞動市場方面，由於經濟前景轉差及新冠病毒疫情，失業率短期內可能進一步上升，私營部門分析師預測2020年失業率約達4.0%。\n\n# 不確定性與風險\n\n2020年經濟前景較為黯淡，存在多種不確定性與風險，包括全球經濟放緩、美中貿易關係、內地經濟表現、本地社會事件以及新冠疫情的持續擴散。尤其是長期疫情可能引發全球經濟的更加明顯放緩和資產重新定價，從而對宏觀經濟環境造成不利影響，加上金融條件收緊，進一步對國內實體活動形成壓力。然而，主要央行更大程度的貨幣政策寬鬆有望提供一定緩衝。\n\n# 銀行業績\n\n即使面對全球經濟放緩、美中貿易緊張和本地社會事件等挑戰，2019年香港銀行業仍展現韌性。資產負債表狀況穩定，貸款與存款均較溫和增長。銀行的資本與流動性狀況依然堅實，資產質素保持良好。整體盈利能力穩定，資產回報率持平。"}
{"en": "# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate and money markets functioned in a smooth and orderly manner in 2019. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained stable throughout the year and strengthened to the strong side of the Convertibility Zone towards the end of the year. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, the Linked Exchange Rate System has shown its resilience to shocks time after time.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability. This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n\n- Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks\n\n- Government-issued notes and coins in circulation the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of the clearing account balances of banks kept with the HKMA\n\n- Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs). When the demand for Hong Kong dollars is greater than the supply and the market exchange rate strengthens to the strong-side CU of HK$7.75 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to sell Hong Kong dollars to banks for US dollars upon request. The Aggregate Balance will then expand to push down Hong Kong dollar interest rates, creating monetary conditions that move the Hong Kong dollar away from the strong-side limit to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if the supply of Hong Kong dollars is greater than demand and the market exchange rate weakens to the weak-side CU of HK$7.85 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to buy Hong Kong dollars from banks upon request. The Aggregate Balance will then contract to drive Hong Kong dollar interest rates up, pushing the Hong Kong dollar away from the weak-side limit to stay within the Convertibility Zone.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2019\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nDespite uncertainties in the external environment and a slowdown in the domestic economy, the Hong Kong dollar remained stable and traded in a smooth and orderly manner in 2019. In the beginning of the year, the widening negative Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads attracted carry trade activities of selling Hong Kong dollars for US dollars, pushing the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate towards the weak-side CU of 7.85 (Chart 1). As the weakening of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate continued, the weak-side CU was eventually triggered eight times in March. Thereafter, the Hong Kong dollar continued to stay near the weak-side CU rate of 7.85. Since late May, the strong Hong Kong dollar demand arising from sizeable initial public offering (IPO) activities, corporates’ demand for dividend payment and the half-year closing had led the Hong Kong dollar to strengthen. While the Hong Kong dollar drifted lower after the half-year mark, it regained momentum from late October and stayed in the strong side of the Convertibility Zone towards the end of the year. This reflected partly equity-related demand including IPOs, and partly the unwinding of short Hong Kong dollar positions due to tightened liquidity near the year end. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market functioned normally throughout 2019.\n\nDue to the triggering of the weak-side CU, the total of the Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding EFBNs declined from HK$1,136.2 billion at the end of 2018 to HK$1,133.0 billion at the end of 2019 (Chart 2). During the year, the HKMA purchased a total of HK$22.1 billion at the request of banks at the weak-side CU of 7.85 in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), leading to a contraction of the Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) from HK$76.4 billion at the end of 2018 to HK$54.3 billion at the end of 2019. The outstanding EFBNs increased slightly from HK$1,059.8 billion to HK$1,078.7 billion during the year, reflecting the issuance of EFBNs to absorb EFBNs’ interest payments according to the established practice. The Monetary Base as a whole remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves. Total Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and Notes at HK$1,133 billion at end-2019.\n\n# Money market\n\nDuring 2019, the Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained largely steady at the longer end, while short-term rates broadly picked up (Chart 3). Short-term rates also experienced more fluctuations driven by IpO-related funding demand and seasonal liquidity needs. The reduction in the Aggregate Balance since April 2018 may have led to a higher sensitivity of the Hong Kong dollar interbank rates to changes in the supply and demand of Hong Kong dollar funding in the local market.\n\nThe Base Rate was adjusted downwards on 1 August, 19 September and 31 October by a total of 75 basis points, from 2.75% at the end of 2018 to 2.00% in early November, as the target range for the US federal funds rate moved downward three times by a total of 75 basis points from 2.25–2.50% to 1.50–1.75% during the year. On 18–26 November and 19–31 December, the Base Rate was set higher than 2.00%, reflecting a marked upward trend of the overnight and one-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs) in the last two months of the year. As such, the Base Rate closed at 2.49% at the end of 2019. The adjustment of the Base Rate was in accordance with the revised formula announced on 26 March 2009, which sets the Base Rate at either 50 basis points above the lower bound of the prevailing target range for the US federal funds rate or the average of the five-day moving averages of the overnight and one-month HIBORs, whichever is the higher. On the retail front, several retail banks lowered their Best Lending Rates by 12.5 basis points following the decrease in the target range for the US federal funds rate in late October.\n\nThe discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points widened during the first two months, broadly tracking the movements of the Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads, with the 12-month Hong Kong dollar forward points reaching about -708 pips in mid-February (Chart 4). Thereafter, along with the narrowing of the negative Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads, the discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points narrowed gradually and turned to premiums towards the end of the year. Overall, Hong Kong’s money markets operated in an orderly manner. Discount Window borrowing decreased to HK$38.3 billion in 2019 from HK$40.2 billion in 2018.\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nThe LERS has contributed significantly to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability for more than three decades and has shown its resilience in multiple regional and global financial crises. Against the backdrop of social incidents happening during the year, a number of unfounded rumours casting doubt on the LERS and financial stability of Hong Kong circulated in the social media. The HKMA acted promptly and vigorously to rebut the rumours and reassure the public through the use of both traditional and social media, reiterating that the LERS would remain in place and Hong Kong would not impose foreign exchange or capital controls. In addition, the HKMA issued a number of articles to help the public understand the LERS operation, the flow of funds and the interest rate outlook. These efforts were effective in maintaining public confidence in the LERS, as evidenced by the orderly functioning of the markets throughout the year. The Government is also firmly committed to the LERS. public confidence in the Government’s commitment and the use of the Hong Kong dollar as a means of payment and storage of value were further reinforced by the stability in the foreign exchange and money markets. In its 2019 Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund reaffirmed its long-standing support for the LERS as an anchor of Hong Kong’s financial stability, and commented that the LERS remained the appropriate exchange rate arrangement for Hong Kong underpinned by Hong Kong’s transparent rules, ample fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy, and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nA robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS. Hong Kong’s banking system is highly liquid and sound, with liquidity positions and capitalisation being well above the minimum international standards. To ensure the resilience of the banking sector, the HKMA has been closely monitoring banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and has maintained its supervisory efforts on corporate, propertyrelated and Mainland-related lending. With a smaller Aggregate Balance relative to previous years, banks have in general strengthened their liquidity management arrangements and have been more proactive in managing their day-to-day funding positions. Furthermore, the HKMA has maintained close dialogue with banks to ensure smooth recycling of liquidity in the market, especially ahead of and during the subscription periods of large IPOs. No settlement gridlocks were noted during the year, with the Discount Window continuing to function effectively and efficiently.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) moved within a range of 109.9–112.1% during 2019, without touching the Upper or Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 111.2% on 31 December (Chart 5). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. In the event of abrupt shocks, the sizeable amount of financial resources of the Exchange Fund, together with Hong Kong’s robust banking system, will provide powerful support to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\n# Other activities\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong. In 2019, the CBC considered issues including an event study on the LERS operations, the relationship between the Aggregate Balance and interest rates in Hong Kong, an improved and more flexible approach to options markets’ views about the LERS, and the impact of future IPOs on HIBORs. Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Research\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMR), formerly the Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research, pursues research studies on topics in monetary policy, banking and finance that are policy relevant. This is reflected in the wide array of topics explored by HKIMR researchers and overseas visitors and in its conferences and events. The HKIMR collaborates with major central banks and policy institutions to jointly organise policy-focused conferences. Its research visiting programmes support research projects on policy issues that are of importance to the HKMA, Hong Kong and the region.\n\nIn 2019, the HKIMR hosted 14 research scholars, published 17 working papers, and held 11 public seminars covering a broad range of economic, monetary and financial issues. It also organised three international conferences:\n\n- The Tenth Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy, titled “China’s Financial Reforms and Economic Transformation”, was held on 10–11 January in Hong Kong, organised jointly by the HKIMR, the Financial Research Institute of the people’s Bank of China and the Research Institute of Finance of the Development Research Centre of the State Council. The conference provided a world-class forum for economic experts from central banks, international institutions, academia and the financial industry to discuss issues related to the risks that Mainland’s financial sector faced in the light of changes introduced by financial reforms and Mainland’s economic development.\n", "zh": "貨幣穩定\n\n2019年，香港元匯率和金融市場運作順暢有序。全年香港元匯率保持穩定，接近年底時升值至可兌換區的高端。作為香港貨幣和金融穩定的基石，聯繫匯率制度屢次展現出其應對衝擊的韌性。\n\n目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的首要目標是貨幣穩定。具體而言，是以港元兌美元在外匯市場的匯率在每美元7.75至7.85港元的波段內保持穩定。貨幣系統的結構以貨幣局安排為特徵，要求貨幣基礎至少由存放在交易基金中的美元儲備全面支持，貨幣基礎的變動必須與美元儲備的相應變動完全匹配。\n\n貨幣基礎（表一）包括：\n\n- 債券證書，為由三家發鈔行發行的鈔票提供全額支持\n\n- 政府發行的紙幣和流通中的硬幣\n\n- 總結餘，即銀行在香港金融管理局的結算帳戶餘額之和\n\n- 交易基金票據與票券（EFBNs），由香港金融管理局代表政府發行\n\n香港元匯率的穩定通過自動利率調整機制和香港金融管理局遵守兌換承諾的堅定承諾來維持。當對港幣的需求大於供應，且匯率升至強側的7.75港元兌一美元時，香港金融管理局隨時準備向銀行出售港幣換取美元。此時，總結餘將擴大，以壓低港幣利率，創造出使港幣脫離強側限制、進入7.75至7.85兌換區的貨幣條件。反之，若港幣供應超過需求，匯率跌至弱側的7.85港元兌一美元，金融管理局則準備從銀行購買港幣，隨之，總結餘將收縮，推高港幣利率，使港幣遠離弱側限制，維持在兌換區內。\n\n2019年回顧\n\n匯率穩定\n\n儘管外部環境不確定性增加和內需放緩，香港元仍在2019年保持穩定，在市場中順利有序地交易。年初，香港元美元利率差的擴大促使套利交易，即賣出港幣換美元，推動港幣匯率向弱側7.85的兌換承諾（圖一）。隨著港元匯率進一步走弱，3月份觸發了8次弱側兌換承諾。此後，港元持續接近7.85的弱側兌換率。自五月底以來，來自大量首次公開募股（IPO）、企業派息需求和半年結束的旺盛需求，促使港幣升值。盡管在半年後港幣略為走低，但從十月下旬開始重新獲得動能，年底前仍處於兌換區的強側範圍內。這一變化部分反映股市相關需求，包括IPO，也部分源於年底前資金緊張導致的空倉平倉。目前，港幣市場整體運作正常。\n\n由於觸發了弱側兌換承諾，2018年底的總結餘（不含貼現窗口）與未償還的EFBNs合計，從2018年的1兆1363億港元下降至2019年底的1兆1330億港元（圖二）。在年內，金融管理局依照聯繫匯率制度設計，應銀行請求於7.85的弱側兌換承諾下購買港幣，共購買了221億港元，導致貨幣基礎（不含貼現窗口）由2018年底的764億港元收縮至2019年底的543億港元。未償還的EFBNs略為增加，由1059.8億升至1078.7億港元，反映按照既定慣例為支付利息而發行的EFBNs。整體貨幣基礎仍由外匯儲備全面支持。2019年末，總結餘（不含貼現窗口）與交易基金票據總額為1133億港元。\n\n金融市場\n\n2019年，香港元同業拆借利率在較長期限保持較穩定，短期利率則較為波動（圖三）。短期利率的波動更多由IPO融資需求和季節性流動性需求推動。自2018年4月以來，總結餘的縮減可能使香港元拆借利率對本地市場供需變動的敏感度提高。\n\n基準利率於8月1日、9月19日及10月31日分別下調，共調整75個基點，由2018年底的2.75%降至11月初的2.00%，同期美國聯邦基金目標利率在一年內三次下調，共75個基點，從2.25–2.50%降至1.50–1.75%。11月18日至26日和12月19日至31日，基準利率調高至超過2.00%，反映出年內最後兩個月港元隔夜拆借利率（HIBOR）和一個月HIBOR的明顯上升趨勢。年底前，基準利率收於2.49%。該調整符合2009年3月26日公布的修訂公式，即將基準利率設置為在美國聯邦基金目標範圍下限之上50個基點或隔夜及一個月HIBOR五天移動平均值中的較高者。在零售方面，幾家零售銀行在10月末美國聯邦基金利率目標調整後，將其最佳貸款利率下調12.5個基點。\n\n前置點貼水於頭兩個月擴大，主要跟蹤港幣/美元利差的變動，二月中旬12個月港幣遠期點數達到約-708點（圖四）。隨後，隨著港幣/美元利差的縮小，遠期點數逐步收窄，並在年底轉為升水。總的來說，香港的貨幣市場運作有序。貼現窗口借款由2018年的402億港元減少至2019年的383億港元。\n\n聯繫匯率制度\n\n聯繫匯率制度在過去三十多年中，對香港的貨幣和金融穩定作出了巨大貢獻，並在多次區域和全球金融危機中展現出韌性。年內社會事件背景下，網絡流傳一些毫無根據、質疑聯繫匯率制度及香港金融穩定的謠言。金融管理局迅速而有力地駁斥謠言，並通過傳統媒體與社交媒體向公眾作出澄清，重申聯繫匯率制度將繼續維持，香港不會實行外匯或資本管制。此外，金融管理局發表多篇專文，幫助公眾了解制度運作、資金流向及利率前景。這些措施有效維持了公眾對制度的信心，市場運作依然有序。政府亦堅持支持聯繫匯率制度，外匯和金融市場的穩定進一步鞏固了公眾對政府承諾和港幣作為支付與價值儲藏媒介的信心。國際貨幣基金組織在2019年對香港的第IV次年度磋商中重申了對聯繫匯率制度作為香港金融穩定支柱的長期支持，並指出該制度在香港透明規則、充足的財政與外匯儲備、健全的金融監管、彈性的經濟及謹慎的財政框架下，仍是適合香港的匯率安排。\n\n強健的銀行系統對聯繫匯率制度的正常運作至關重要。香港的銀行系統高度流動且健康，流動性資產與資本化水平遠高於國際最低標準。為確保銀行業的韌性，金融管理局密切監察銀行的信貸、流動性與利率風險管理及壓力測試結果，並持續對企業、房地產及內地相關貸款進行監督。隨著貨幣基礎較往年縮小，銀行普遍加強流動性管理，更積極管理日常融資運作。此外，金融管理局與銀行保持密切溝通，確保市場流動性平穩循環，尤其在大型IPO申購前後。全年未見交割瓶頸，貼現窗口運作依然高效。\n\n為提升貨幣局帳戶透明度，自1998年10月起，已規定將部分交易基金資產用於支持貨幣基礎。2019年，Backing Ratio（支持資產佔貨幣基礎的比率，即Backing Assets除以貨幣基礎）在109.9%至112.1%之間波動，未觸及上下限標準。2019年12月31日，該比率為111.2%（圖五）。在聯繫匯率制度下，雖然已指定部分交易基金資產支持Backing組合，但所有交易基金資產均可用於支持港幣匯率。在突發震蕩時，交易基金龐大的金融資源和香港強健的銀行系統，將為香港的貨幣金融穩定提供有力支撐。\n\n其他活動\n\n交易基金諮詢委員會的貨幣局委員會（CBC）監察和檢討香港貨幣和金融穩定相關事宜。2019年，委員會討論了包括聯繫匯率制度運作的事件研究、貨幣結餘與利率的關係、期權市場對制度的更靈活看法，以及未來IPO對HIBOR的影響等議題。這些討論記錄及貨幣局運作報告已發佈於香港金融管理局網站。\n\n研究\n\n香港貨幣金融研究所（HKIMR），前稱香港貨幣研究所，專注於貨幣政策、銀行與金融相關的政策性研究。這一點從HKIMR研究人員及訪客探討的多樣主題以及其舉辦的會議和活動可見一斑。HKIMR與多個主要中央銀行及政策機構合作，聯合舉辦政策性會議。其研究訪問計劃支持與HKMA、香港及區域重要政策性議題相關的研究項目。\n\n2019年，HKIMR邀請了14名研究學者，發表了17份工作論文，舉辦了11場涵蓋經濟、貨幣和金融範疇的公開研討會，並組織了三場國際會議：\n\n- 第十屆中國經濟國際研討會，題為「中國的金融改革與經濟轉型」，於1月10日至11日在香港舉行，由HKIMR、中國人民銀行金融研究所和國務院發展研究中心金融研究所聯合主辦。該會議為全球經濟專家、國家機構、學界及金融界提供了討論中國金融改革及經濟發展所面臨風險的國際平台。"}
{"en": "# Banking Stability\n\nThe banking sector in Hong Kong remained sound and stable in 2019, notwithstanding the headwinds brought by the weakening global and local economies. Thanks to the concerted efforts of the industry, the banking sector continued to operate normally amidst the social events. Efforts were taken to ensure that inconvenience caused to the public was kept to a minimum. During the year, the HKMA focused its supervision on the credit and liquidity risk management of authorized institutions. In view of escalating cyber threats and the industry’s growing dependency on technology, the HKMA stepped up the supervision of authorized institutions’ technology risk management. On conduct supervision, the HKMA streamlined its investor protection measures to enhance customer experience while according protection to customers. We also enhanced consumer protection in digital financial services and continued to promote a customer-centric corporate culture.\n\nOn anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT), 2019 marked the conclusion of the Financial Action Task Force’s Fourth Round Mutual Evaluation of Hong Kong’s AML/CFT regime, which was assessed as compliant and effective overall, and earned positive recognition particularly for the banking sector’s good understanding of risks and the HKMA’s risk-based supervisory work in AML/CFT. The HKMA has continued to participate in the public-private partnership for intelligence sharing on fraud and money laundering, and its active support for the adoption of AML/CFT regulatory technology in the banking sector.\n\nOn banking development, the HKMA granted banking licences to eight virtual banks in 2019 and announced a three-phased approach to facilitate the development of green and sustainable banking in Hong Kong. The HKMA has been in close collaboration with the banking industry to optimise supervisory policies and processes and to carry out capacity-building initiatives that facilitate talent development.\n\nMeanwhile, substantial progress was made on the local implementation of international supervisory standards, including capital adequacy standards, disclosure standards, liquidity standards and large exposure standards. The HKMA also continued its work to ensure there would be a credible resolution regime for authorized institutions, including implementing rules on loss-absorbing capacity requirements to enhance the resolvability of authorized institutions.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this objective is contingent upon the financial system being highly resilient and capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their businesses and, in extremis, by failing in a disorderly manner. The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring banks are resilient to shocks and are able to recover their positions in response to crises, ultimately helping to prevent failures. The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks in Hong Kong. It is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs). The Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs).\n\nHowever, the Monetary Authority cannot ensure, nor is the Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework designed to ensure, a zero-risk financial system. Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that, in the event of an AI becoming non-viable, its failure can be managed in an orderly manner. To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong has been established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs. To ensure that the resolution regime in Hong Kong is operational, it is important to lay down resolution legislation and policy standards, undertake resolution planning to remove impediments to AIs’ resolvability and develop the HKMA’s operational capability to resolve a failing AI. In order to carry out these tasks effectively, the HKMA adopts an internationally harmonised and co-ordinated approach.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2019\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nIn 2019, 196 off-site reviews were conducted covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL rating assessment, corporate governance, risk management and fintech strategies. As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance, 26 meetings were held with the boards of directors or board-level committees of AIs. Furthermore, 32 tripartite meetings were held among the HKMA, the AIs and their external auditors.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA conducts regular on-site examinations supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk. A total of 405 on-site examinations and thematic reviews were conducted during the year. Credit risk management remained a key focus of these examinations and reviews. Another major focus was in technology risk and operational risk management. The HKMA also increased the number of on-site examinations and thematic reviews targeted at liquidity and market risk management as well as the implementation of the Basel capital adequacy framework. At the same time, specialist teams performed on-site examinations and thematic reviews of AIs’ activities in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses.\n\nTable 1 contains an overall summary of the HKMA’s supervisory activities in 2019.\n\n# Supervision of credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nBank lending increased moderately in 2019. Total loans grew by 6.7%, compared with 4.4% in 2018. As shown in Table 2, loans for use in Hong Kong and loans for use outside Hong Kong registered growth of 7.7% and 5.8% respectively.\n\nMainland-related lending grew by 7.4% to HK$4,564 billion as at the end of 2019 (Table 3).\n\nThe asset quality of AIs remained healthy. Retail banks’ classified loan ratio edged down from 0.51% at the end of 2018 to 0.48% at the end of 2019, well below the long-run historical average of 2% since 2000. For the banking industry as a whole, the classified loan ratio increased slightly from 0.55% to 0.57%. Specifically in terms of Mainland-related lending, retail banks’ classified loan ratio increased from 0.63% in 2018 to 0.79% in 2019, which was still low by historical standard. For the banking industry as a whole, the ratio increased to 0.75% from 0.55% a year ago.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA devoted increased supervisory efforts in ensuring that AIs continued to adopt prudent credit risk management standards amid the uncertain economic environment. Solvency stress tests were enhanced to incorporate more comprehensive risk coverage and more severe stress assumptions. The results of the enhanced stress tests continued to indicate that banks generally had sufficient capital buffers to withstand extreme shocks. Targeted and thematic examinations were conducted to evaluate the credit risk management practices of AIs in different areas, such as lending to corporates engaged in high-risk business, complex financing arrangements, and collateralised lending to private banking and wealth management customers. Recognising that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) would more likely face greater challenges during economic downturns, the HKMA established a Banking Sector SME Lending Co-ordination Mechanism in October, with a view to encouraging banks to continue to support SMEs’ financing needs to the extent permitted by prudent risk management principles.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nThe resilience of the Hong Kong banking sector to withstand a downturn in the property market has been strengthened significantly by the eight rounds of countercyclical macro-prudential measures introduced by the HKMA since 2009. The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of new residential mortgage loans fell to 53% in December 2019 from 64% in September 2009, before the countercyclical measures were first introduced. The average debt servicing ratio (DSR) of new mortgages also decreased to 36% in December 2019 from 41% in August 2010, when a cap on DSR was first applied (Chart 1).\n\n# Supervision of operational and technology risk\n\nThe HKMA adopts a three-phased approach to implement the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework under the Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative (CFI). phase One assessment, involving all the major banks, was completed in 2018. The remaining AIs covered in the second and third phases have substantially completed the assessment as scheduled. The HKMA has also embarked on a comprehensive review of the CFI to fine-tune the initiative given the experience gained in the past years.\n\nIn October, the HKMA issued a revised Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module on “Risk Management of E-banking”. The revision sought to provide the industry with greater flexibility to meet changing customer expectations on electronic banking services. The HKMA also published a set of high-level principles on the use of artificial intelligence in order to provide guidance for the industry.\n\nSince the social events started in June, the HKMA have maintained close dialogue with the industry to monitor the impact on banking operations and services. Banks were requested to replenish automated teller machines (ATMs) more frequently and repair vandalised facilities as soon as practicable. The HKMA also acted quickly to refute malicious rumours that sought to undermine the public’s confidence in the banking system. Thanks to concerted efforts by the banking industry, the affected bank branches and facilities quickly resumed normal services and the inconvenience caused to the public was kept to a minimum. In view of the rising operational risk posed by the social events, banks were asked to take additional precautionary measures to strengthen their operational resilience.\n\n# Supervision of liquidity and market risk management\n\nDuring the year, a round of thematic reviews was conducted to assess AIs’ capability to cope with liquidity shocks. The reviews focused on the robustness of AIs’ liquidity stress testing programmes and contingency funding management. The HKMA also assessed AIs’ compliance with the regulatory requirements on the calculation of the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) to ensure the prudence and accuracy of the inputs used for the calculation.\n\nAs algorithmic trading gained popularity in the banking industry, the HKMA conducted a round of thematic reviews to evaluate AIs’ risk management practices in this area. Considering that the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) might cease to be published after end-2021, the HKMA reminded AIs to get prepared for the transition to alternative reference rates and conducted a survey to monitor their preparedness for the transition.\n\n# Combating money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF)\n\nThe HKMA carries out risk-based supervision of AIs’ AML/CFT systems. During the year, 18 on-site examinations and 61 off-site reviews were conducted, including targeted thematic reviews on private banking and the governance of the use of new technology. The HKMA shared with the industry the observations and best practices drawn from a thematic review of AIs’ application of risk-based AML/CFT controls for SMEs, in order to assist AIs to adopt appropriate account opening processes and delivery of services for SMEs.\n\n# Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Mutual Evaluation (ME) Report on Hong Kong\n\nA highlight of 2019 for the HKMA and Hong Kong’s overall AML/CFT regime was the publication of the FATF ME Report on Hong Kong in September. The Report represents one of the best overall results to date in the FATF’s fourth-round ME of its member jurisdictions. Hong Kong scored six “Substantial” ratings out of 11 “Immediate Outcomes” in the assessment of the effectiveness of its AML/CFT regime, and a high mark for the technical compliance aspect of the ME.\n\nThe Report favourably assessed the HKMA’s risk-based approach to AML/CFT supervision, noting that the HKMA had a good understanding of ML/TF risks in the banking sector and a reasonable understanding of risks in the stored value facility (SVF) sector. The Report also positively assessed the collective AML/CFT efforts of the banking sector, such as the increased use of data analytics by larger AIs, the fact that the great majority of suspicious transaction reports were filed by AIs, and the sector’s proactive participation in the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce (FMLIT).\n\nThe Report recommended several areas for improvement, including the understanding of some higher-risk areas, such as foreign corruption and tax crimes, and developing sectors such as SVFs. Work has already started to address these recommendations; the HKMA published an updated ML/TF Risk Assessment on the SVF sector in July and has commenced thematic on-site examinations on private banking and the governance of the use of new technology.\n", "zh": "銀行穩定性\n\n儘管全球和本地經濟放緩帶來逆風，香港的銀行業在2019年仍保持良好和穩健。多虧行業的共同努力，銀行業在社會事件中繼續正常運作。已採取措施以將對公眾的不便降至最低。在年度內，香港金融管理局（HKMA）重點監督獲授權機構的信貸及流動性風險管理。鑒於網絡威脅日益升級，以及行業對科技的依賴日增，HKMA加強了對獲授權機構科技風險管理的監管。在行為監管方面，HKMA精簡了投資者保護措施，以提升客戶體驗同時保障客戶利益。我們亦增強數字金融服務的消費者保護，並繼續推動以客戶為中心的企業文化。\n\n在反洗錢及打擊恐怖分子資金籌集（AML/CFT）方面，2019年標誌著金融行動特別工作組（FATF）對香港的第四輪相互評估的結束，其整體評估為符合及有效，並尤其受到正面肯定，特別是銀行界對風險的良好認識以及HKMA在AML/CFT方面的基於風險的監管工作。HKMA持續參與公共與私營部門的反洗錢情報分享合作，並積極支持銀行行業採用AML/CFT監管科技。\n\n在銀行發展方面，HKMA在2019年發出了八張虛擬銀行牌照，並宣布採用三階段策略促進香港綠色及可持續銀行業的發展。HKMA緊密與銀行界合作，優化監管政策和流程，並推動能力建設以促進人才發展。\n\n此外，在國際監管標準的本地化實施方面取得了重大進展，包括資本充足率標準、披露標準、流動性標準及大型曝險標準。HKMA亦持續確保獲授權機構擁有可信的清算制度，包括實施吸收損失能力的新規，提升獲授權機構的解決能力。\n\n# 目標\n\nHKMA的總體目標是促進銀行系統的安全與穩定。實現此目標取決於金融系統具有高度韌性，能夠提供香港經濟所需的關鍵金融服務。\n\n銀行可以通過其業務運作方式影響系統的穩定性，在極端情況下，亦可能因失序失敗而對系統造成風險。作為監管當局，金融管理局在維護金融穩定方面扮演關鍵角色，確保銀行能夠抵禦衝擊，並在危機中恢復其運作，最終幫助防止失敗。金融管理局負責香港銀行的審慎監管，包括授權持牌銀行、限制牌照銀行及吸收存款公司（合稱獲授權機構，AIs），並負責指定及監督某些金融基礎設施（FMIs）。\n\n然而，金融管理局並不能確保亦非設計來確保零風險的金融系統。作為解決方案的管理者，HKMA旨在確保若AIs變得不可行，其破產能夠有序管理。為此，本地建立了一套金融機構的解決制度，由HKMA擔任解決管理者。為確保該制度運作，必須制定相關的解決立法和政策標準，進行解決規劃以消除AIs的可解決障礙，並提升HKMA的運作能力來應對失敗的AIs。為了有效執行這些任務，HKMA採用國際協調一致的方法。\n\n# 2019年回顧\n\n# 監管活動概述\n\n2019年，HKMA進行了196次非現場審查，涵蓋了CAMEL評級、公司治理、風險管理和金融科技策略等多個範疇。為推動更強的風險治理，HKMA與AIs的董事會或董事會委員會舉行了26次會議。此外，HKMA與AIs及其外部審計師之間也舉行了32次三方會議。\n\n除非境外活動外，HKMA還定期進行實地檢查，並針對較高風險範疇進行主題性審查。今年內共完成405次實地檢查和主題性審查。信用風險管理仍是這些檢查和審查的重點。另一個主要焦點是科技風險和操作風險管理。HKMA亦增加了針對流動性和市場風險管理，以及巴塞爾資本充足率框架實施的實地檢查和主題性審查次數。同時，專家團隊也對證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（MPF）相關業務的活動進行了實地檢查和主題性審查。\n\n表1提供了2019年HKMA監管活動的總體摘要。\n\n# 信貸風險監管\n\n# 信貸增長與資產質量\n\n2019年，銀行貸款適度增加。整體貸款增長6.7%，高於2018年的4.4%。如表2所示，香港境內用途貸款和境外用途貸款的增長分別為7.7%和5.8%。\n\n與內地相關的貸款截至2019年底增長7.4%，達HK$4,5640億（表3）。\n\n獲授權機構的資產質量保持良好。零售銀行的分類貸款比率由2018年底的0.51%下降至2019年底的0.48%，遠低於自2000年以來的長期平均2%。整體銀行業的分類貸款比率由0.55%小幅上升至0.57%。就內地相關貸款而言，零售銀行的分類貸款比率由2018年的0.63%增至2019年的0.79%，依然偏低。整體銀行業的比率由0.55%升至0.75%。\n\n年內，HKMA加大監管力度，確保持續採用審慎的信貸風險管理標準，即使在經濟環境不確定的情況下亦如此。資本充足壓力測試被增強，以涵蓋更全面的風險及採用更嚴峻的壓力假設。增強的壓力測試結果持續顯示，銀行通常具有足夠的資本緩衝來承受極端衝擊。並針對不同範疇（如高風險企業貸款、複雜融資安排、私行和財富管理客戶的擔保貸款）進行了有針對性和主題性檢查，以評估AIs的信貸風險管理實踐。考慮到中小企（SMEs）在經濟放緩時更可能面臨較大挑戰，HKMA於十月成立了銀行業SME貸款協調機制，鼓勵銀行在謹慎風險管理原則下持續支持SMEs的融資需求。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n由於HKMA自2009年以來實施的八輪逆周期宏觀審慎措施，香港銀行業抵禦房地產市場下行的能力顯著加強。新房貸的平均樓價成數（LTV）由2009年9月的64%下降到2019年12月的53%，而房貸的平均負擔比率（DSR）亦由2010年8月的41%降至2019年12月的36%（見圖1）。\n\n# 操作及科技風險監管\n\nHKMA採用三階段策略實施「網絡韌性評估框架」（Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework），該措施屬於「資訊科技防護增強計劃」（CFI）的一部分。第一階段評估已於2018年完成，涉及所有主要銀行。第二及第三階段的剩餘AIs亦基本按計劃完成評估。HKMA亦展開全面檢討CFI，以根據過去幾年的經驗進行微調。\n\n10月，HKMA發佈了修訂版的「電子銀行風險管理」監管政策手冊（SPM）模塊，以提供行業面對電子銀行服務不斷變化的需求時更大的彈性。HKMA亦制定了一套有關人工智能（AI）應用的高層次原則，以指導行業。\n\n自6月社會事件爆發以來，HKMA與行業保持密切對話，以監測其對銀行運營和服務的影響。銀行被要求更頻繁地補充自動櫃員機（ATM），並儘快修復受破壞的設施。HKMA亦迅速駁斥旨在破壞公眾信心的惡意謠言。多虧銀行業的共同努力，受影響的分行和設施很快恢復正常營運，對公眾造成的不便亦降至最低。鑑於社會事件帶來的營運風險上升，銀行亦被要求採取額外預防措施，以加強其營運韌性。\n\n# 流動性及市場風險管理監管\n\n年內，HKMA進行了一次針對AIs應對流動性衝擊能力的主題性審查，重點檢視其流動性壓力測試計劃和應急融資管理。HKMA亦評估了AIs按照規定計算流動性覆蓋率（LCR）的合規情況，以確保所用數據的審慎性和準確性。\n\n隨著算法交易在銀行業的普及，HKMA進行了一輪專題性審查，以評估AIs在此範疇的風險管理實踐。考慮到2021年底後可能停止公布倫敦銀行同業拆借利率（LIBOR），HKMA提醒AIs為轉向其他參考利率做好準備，並進行調查以監察其準備情況。\n\n# 打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集（ML/TF）\n\nHKMA採用基於風險的監管方式，對AIs的AML/CFT系統進行監督。年內，HKMA完成18次實地檢查和61次非現場審查，包括針對私人銀行業務和新技術運用的治理層面之專題性審查。HKMA與行業分享了在對SMEs實施風險基礎AML/CFT控制措施方面的觀察和最佳實踐，以協助AIs制定適當的帳戶開立和服務提供流程。\n\n# 香港金融行動特別工作組（FATF）對香港的相互評估（ME）報告\n\n2019年一大亮點是FATF於九月發佈了關於香港的ME報告。該報告是FATF第四輪成員國相互評估中整體結果的最佳展現之一。在對香港AML/CFT制度的11個「立即成果」中，香港獲得6個「實質性」評級，在技術符合性評價中亦獲高分。\n\n該報告正面評價了HKMA的基於風險監管AML/CFT的方法，指出HKMA對銀行業的洗錢/恐怖資金風險有良好的認識，並對儲值支付設施（SVF）行業的風險亦有合理了解。報告亦正面評估銀行界在AML/CFT方面的集體努力，如大型AIs越來越多運用數據分析，絕大多數的可疑交易報告由AIs提交，以及行業積極參與打擊詐騙和洗錢情報專責小組（FMLIT）的工作。\n\n報告亦提出多個改善建議，包括對某些高風險領域（如海外貪腐和稅務犯罪）以及新興行業（如SVF）了解不足等。相關工作已經展開，HKMA於7月公布了更新的SVF行業洗錢/恐怖資金風險評估報告，並已啟動針對私人銀行和新技術運用的專題實地檢查。"}
{"en": "# International Financial Centre\n\nHong Kong is a globally competitive international financial centre. The implementation of the Smart Banking initiatives has been in good progress to further develop Hong Kong as a fintech hub. Capitalising on opportunities arising from the opening up of the Mainland financial markets, much headway has been made to promote financial collaboration in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, especially in easing Hong Kong residents’ cross-border access to financial and banking services in the Area.\n\nAt the same time, much effort has been made to open up new opportunities to further strengthen the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, including infrastructure investment and financing, green finance and private equity funds. The Hong Kong Academy of Finance was set up to enhance Hong Kong’s soft power in a sustainable manner.\n\nIn the central banking and regulatory community, the HKMA plays a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees, which is a clear recognition of Hong Kong’s expertise and commitment to international work.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nTo strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia, the HKMA puts great effort into implementing the seven Smart Banking initiatives that were announced in September 2017, with an aim to facilitate the development and use of fintech in the banking and payment industries. The key progress of these initiatives during the year included:\n\n- expanding the adoption of the Faster Payment System (FPS);\n- facilitating the implementation of phases I and II of the Open Application programming Interface (Open API) Framework in the banking sector;\n- further enhancing fintech research and talent\ndevelopment;\n- stepping up cross-border collaboration in fintech; granting eight virtual bank licences;\n- facilitating the industry’s increasing use of Fintech Supervisory Sandbox (FSS) 2.0 for launching fintech initiatives; and\n- further facilitating the adoption of regulatory technology (Regtech) through the Banking Made Easy initiative.\n\nThe HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO), together with the banking departments of the HKMA, plays a pivotal role in driving the implementation of these initiatives.\n\nHong Kong plays an indispensable role in facilitating international investors’ allocation of renminbi assets, with its unparalleled access to the onshore markets through the Stock Connect and Bond Connect schemes. This was evident by the tripling of the number of registered investors and daily turnover under Bond Connect over the past year. Further enhancements have been introduced to both Bond Connect and Stock Connect, providing more convenience and flexibility for international investors to invest in onshore securities in the Mainland. The HKMA also worked closely with Mainland authorities to explore and implement a series of financial facilitation measures for Hong Kong residents to access financial and banking services across the border in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), including a prospective, two-way wealth management connect scheme. Hong Kong maintains a firm foothold as the global hub for offshore renminbi business. According to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Triennial Survey of Foreign Exchange (FX) and Derivatives Market Turnover, Hong Kong continued to be the largest offshore renminbi FX centre in the world.\n\nContinuous efforts were put into opening up new opportunities to further enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. To promote the development of the fund business in Hong Kong, the HKMA worked closely with the Government and industry to provide a more favourable tax and regulatory environment for fund formation. A number of large-scale events and targeted outreach activities were organised to promote Hong Kong as a hub for green finance, infrastructure investment and financing and corporate treasury centres (CTCs). In an effort to enhance Hong Kong’s soft power, the Hong Kong Academy of Finance (AoF) was set up in June to develop financial leadership and promote research collaboration.\n\nIn the central banking and regulatory community, the HKMA plays a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees. The HKMA chaired the Standing Committee on Supervisory and Regulatory Cooperation (SRC) of the Financial Stability Board (FSB) until 31 August 2019. Currently, the HKMA is chairing the Supervision and Implementation Group (SIG) of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), and the Working Group on Financial Markets (WGFM) established under the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP). The HKMA is also co-chairing the Non-Bank Monitoring Experts Group (NMEG) of the FSB with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure lays a solid foundation for Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre. The four interbank Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) and the Hong Kong Trade Repository (HKTR) achieved 100% system availability in 2019, beating the target of 99.95%. Through its accounts set up with the two Mainland central securities depositories, the CMU facilitates the settlement of transactions conducted under Bond Connect Northbound Trading and the holding of Mainland debt securities on behalf of relevant CMU members.\n\nThe FPS, which serves as an extension of Hong Kong dollar RTGS system to enable the public to make instant retail fund transfers and payments across different banks and stored value facilities (SVFs) on a round-the-clock basis, ran smoothly in its first year of operation. Users’ adoption of the facility had increased steadily, as manifested in the four million registrations and tripling of transaction volumes by the end of 2019. The FPS brings new opportunities to the retail payment industry and promotes fintech innovation.\n\nTo ensure the general safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA has designated and is overseeing a total of six retail payment systems (RPSs) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO). The HKMA also issued two new SVF licences in May, bringing the total number of SVF licensees to 18. SVF licensees continued to launch new products and services actively during the year to diversify customer choices and enhance user experience.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2019\n\n# Hong Kong as a Fintech Hub in Asia\n\n# Smart Banking initiatives\n\nThe seven Smart Banking initiatives were announced by the HKMA in September 2017 with the aim of helping the banking sector achieve higher standards of operation and embrace the enormous opportunities brought about by the convergence of banking and technology. During the year, considerable progress was made in implementing these initiatives and transforming the fintech ecosystem of Hong Kong.\n\n# Faster Payment System\n\nThe launch of the FPS in September 2018 was a major milestone in the financial infrastructure development of Hong Kong in the digital era. The FPS further promotes the adoption of e-payment in Hong Kong by providing efficient and convenient payment services to the general public and corporates. Since the launch of the FPS, the number of participating service providers had increased to 30 banks and 11 SVFs, with the addition of nine banks and one SVF, by the end of 2019.\n\nUsage of the FPS has also grown steadily. As of 31 December 2019, the FPS recorded four million registrations (Chart 1) and processed 44 million transactions involving an aggregate amount of HK$748.5 billion and RMB17 billion. In December 2019, average daily turnover reached 168,000 transactions worth HK$2.4 billion and RMB38 million (Chart 2), as compared with 51,000 transactions during its first full month of operation in October 2018.\n\nFaster payment System recorded: \n- 4 million registrations as of 31 December 2019\n- 44 million transactions as of 31 December 2019\n- 168,000 transactions worth HK$2.4 billion and RMB38 million of average daily turnover in December 2019\n\nThe HKMA works with the industry to extend FPS usage from person-to-person payments to bill payments and other merchant payments. For example, enhancements were made to enable merchants to use a variety of proxy identifiers and accept partial or over-payments via a QR code. A technical specification was developed to facilitate the invocation of a mobile banking or SVF e-wallet mobile application (app) from a business mobile app for FPS payment. This would greatly improve customer experience in making merchant and business payments via the FPS using mobile devices.\n\nThe HKMA also works closely with relevant Government departments to assist them in using the FPS to accept bill payments from the public. From 1 November, bills issued by the Inland Revenue Department, the Rating and Valuation Department and the Water Supplies Department were printed with an FPS QR code so that the public could scan the QR code easily with supporting mobile banking or SVF e-wallet apps to make payment. The HKMA will continue working with various Government departments and public bodies to explore other potential use cases which can make it convenient for the public to make payment via the FPS.\n\nTo raise public awareness of the FPS, the HKMA has developed a new series of education and publicity materials, such as Announcements in the public Interest for broadcast on television and radio, as well as videos and electronic banners for digital platforms. The HKMA also participated in trade fairs to promote the FPS to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and corporates. Various FPS participating banks and SVFs launched promotion campaigns and offered incentives to encourage customers to register with the FPS and to use it for fund transfer and bill payment.\n\nIn addition, the HKMA engaged a number of industry organisations and institutions to provide briefings on the FPS so as to introduce its functionalities and the potential benefits it may bring to different businesses in collecting and making payment.\n\nThe Government has adopted FPS for bill payments on taxes, rates and Government rent and water charges.\n\n# Open Application Programming Interface\n\nThe HKMA continued to facilitate the banking sector’s development and adoption of Open API in accordance with the four-phase approach of the Open API Framework. Under phase I, 20 retail banks opened up over 500 Open API endpoints in January, covering information of banking products and services. Under phase II, the banks opened up in October over 300 APIs to support applications for banking products and services.\n\n# Research and talent development\n\nOn trade finance, a proof-of-concept (PoC) study on linking up eTradeConnect and we.trade was completed in the first quarter of the year. In November, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between the subsidiaries of Hong Kong Interbank Clearing Limited and the Institute of Digital Currency of the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) to conduct a PoC study on linking up eTradeConnect and the PBoC Trade Finance platform to provide firms in both Hong Kong and Mainland China with more convenient trade finance services.\n\nOn Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), the HKMA and the Bank of Thailand embarked on a joint research project named project Inthanon-LionRock to study the application of CBDC to cross-border payments, with a view to facilitating HKD-THB payment-versus-payment (pvp) among banks in Hong Kong and Thailand.\n\nHKMA Executive Director (Financial Infrastructure), Mr Colin Pou (first from left), together with Director-General of the Institute of Digital Currency of the PBoC, Mr Mu Changchun (first from right), witness the signing ceremony of an MoU to conduct a PoC trial on linking up eTradeConnect and the PBoC Trade Finance Platform. The MoU is signed between Chief Executive Officer of the Hong Kong Trade Finance Platform Company Limited, Ms Haster Tang (second from left), and Deputy Director-General of the Institute of Digital Currency of the PBoC and Director of the Shenzhen Fintech Institute, Mr Di Gang (second from right).\n\nOn artificial intelligence (AI), the HKMA carried out a study on the application of AI technology in the Hong Kong banking industry. Key findings of an industry-wide AI survey were published in November, followed by the issuance of the full report, titled “Reshaping Banking with Artificial Intelligence”, in December.\n\nThe report “Reshaping Banking with Artificial Intelligence” is published in December.\n\nA fact sheet is published to highlight the key facts and figures derived from a survey on the use of AI in the Hong Kong banking industry.\n\nIn an effort to enlarge the fintech talent pool, the HKMA continued to run the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme 2.0 in collaboration with its strategic partners to nurture young talent at various stages of their career development. Over 220 students benefited from the programme last year.\n", "zh": "國際金融中心\n\n香港是全球具競爭力的國際金融中心。智慧銀行計劃的推行進展順利，進一步促進香港作為金融科技樞紐的發展。憑藉大陸金融市場開放帶來的機遇，香港在促進粵港澳大灣區金融合作方面取得了顯著進展，特別是在便利香港居民跨境獲取地區金融與銀行服務方面。\n\n同時，香港在基礎設施投資與融資、綠色金融及私募股權基金等領域努力開拓新機遇，以進一步提升香港金融平台的競爭力。香港金融科技學院的成立，旨在以可持續方式提升香港的軟實力。\n\n在中央銀行和監管界，香港金融管理局（HKMA）在多個區域及國際委員會中扮演領導角色，充分展現了香港在專業能力和國際事務上的承諾與聲譽。\n\n概覽\n\n為了鞏固香港在亞洲的金融科技中心地位，香港金融管理局投入巨大努力實施於2017年9月宣布的七項智慧銀行計劃，旨在促進銀行與支付行業的金融科技發展與應用。年內主要進展包括：\n\n- 擴大「快速支付系統」（FPS）的使用範圍；\n- 促進銀行業開展第一期及第二期的開放應用程式介面（Open API）框架實施；\n- 進一步提升金融科技研究與人才發展；\n- 加強跨境金融科技合作；授予八張虛擬銀行牌照；\n- 促進業界更廣泛使用金融科技監理沙盒（FSS）2.0推動金融科技創新；\n- 進一步推動「金融科技監管科技」（Regtech）的應用，通過「金融業變得更容易」計劃。\n\n香港金融管理局金融科技推動辦公室（FFO）與銀行部門在推動這些計劃中扮演關鍵角色。\n\n香港在促進國際投資者配置人民幣資產方面扮演著不可或缺的角色，得益於滬港通和債券通等方案的優勢，提供無與倫比的內地市場准入。去年，債券通的註冊投資者數量和每日成交量皆三倍增长。相關措施亦優化兩地的債券通與股票通，提供國際投資者更便利和靈活的投資渠道。香港亦與內地當局合作，開展並推行多項便利措施，促使香港居民能更方便地跨境使用金融與銀行服務，包括前景中雙向財富管理通道聯通方案。香港作為離岸人民幣業務的全球樞紐地位穩固。根據國際清算銀行（BIS）三年期外匯及衍生品市場交易量調查，香港仍為全球最大的離岸人民幣外匯中心。\n\n香港持續努力開拓新機遇，強化金融平台競爭力。為推動香港基金業發展，香港金融管理局與政府及業界緊密合作，營造有利於基金成立的稅務和監管環境。多場大型活動和專門招商推廣香港作為綠色金融、基礎設施投資與融資以及企業財資中心的樞紐。為提升香港軟實力，香港金融科技學院於六月成立，以培養金融領導力和促進研究合作。\n\n在中央銀行和監管界，HKMA在多個區域及國際委員會中扮演領導角色。香港金融管理局曾直至2019年8月31日主持金融穩定委員會（FSB）監管與監督合作常務委員會（SRC）；目前主持巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（Basel Committee）監督與實施小組（SIG）及經濟東亞—太平洋央行會議（EMEAP）設立的金融市場工作組（WGFM）；此外，與美國證券交易委員會（SEC）共同主持FSB非銀行監控專家組（NMEG）。\n\n香港的金融基礎設施安全高效運作，為其作為國際金融中心的角色奠定堅實基礎。2019年，四個銀行間實時結算系統（RTGS）、中央貨幣市場單位（CMU）及香港交易資料庫（HKTR）皆達到100%的系統可用率，超越99.95%的目標。透過與兩家內地中央證券庫（CSD）設立的帳戶，CMU促成在債券通北向交易中的結算及代表相關CMU成員持有內地債券。一年前，FPS正式啟用，作為港元RTGS系統的延伸，使市民能全天候瞬時進行不同銀行和儲值支付設施（SVF）的個人資金轉帳和支付，運行情況穩定。用戶數由推出初期的數百萬逐步攀升到年底的400萬註冊，交易次數及總額亦同步增長，展現出其促進零售支付創新和金融科技應用的潛力。\n\n為確保本地零售支付行業整體安全與效率，HKMA根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（PSSVFO），主管及監督六個零售支付系統（RPS）。今年五月，HKMA又發出兩張新SVF牌照，SVF持牌人數增至18家，並持續推出新產品和服務，豐富用戶選擇與體驗。\n\n2019年回顧\n\n香港作為亞洲金融科技樞紐\n\n智慧銀行計劃\n\nHKMA於2017年9月公布七項智慧銀行措施，旨在協助銀行業提升營運標準，並擁抱銀行與科技融合帶來的巨大機遇。年內，在這些措施的推行與香港金融科技生態系轉型方面取得了顯著成績。\n\n快速支付系統\n\n2018年9月推出的FPS，是香港金融基礎設施的重大里程碑。該系統促進電子支付普及，為大眾與企業提供高效便捷的支付服務。截至2019年年底，參與服務提供商已擴展至30家銀行及11家儲值支付工具，較推出初期增加九家銀行及一家SVF。\n\nFPS的使用量持續攀升。截至2019年12月，註冊用戶已達400萬，處理交易4.4億宗，總成交金額達7485億港元和170億元人民幣。2019年12月，平均每日交易量達168,000宗，價值約24億港元和3800萬人民幣，較2018年10月系統全月運行時的51,000宗增長顯著。\n\nFPS的交易成果：\n- 截至2019年12月，註冊用戶400萬\n- 處理交易4.4億宗\n- 平均每日交易168,000宗，金額約24億港元和3800萬人民幣\n\nHKMA與業界合作，將FPS應用範圍由個人對個人支付擴展至帳單支付及商戶支付。例如，開發了支持多種代理標識符的功能，並允許用戶使用二維碼進行部分或超額支付。亦制訂技術規格，便於商戶運用移動銀行或SVF電子錢包應用程式（app）進行支付，提升客戶在商戶支付中的便利性。\n\nHKMA亦與政府相關部門合作，推動其採用FPS接收帳單支付。自11月起，內地稅務局、地價及估價署和水務署發出的帳單均印有FPS二維碼，方便市民用手機掃碼支付。未來，HKMA將與不同政府部門及公共機構合作，探索其他應用場景，以促使公共支付更加便捷。\n\n為提升公眾對FPS的認識，HKMA推出一系列宣傳資料，包括電視和電台的公共利益通告，以及數碼平台的影片和電子橫幅廣告。HKMA亦參與展覽會，向中小企業和企業推廣FPS。多家銀行和SVF平台亦推出推廣活動，提供獎勵鼓勵用戶註冊及使用FPS進行資金轉賬和帳單支付。\n\n此外，HKMA還與多個行業組織合作，進行FPS介紹簡報會，以展示其功能及應用潛力，便利不同企業的支付和收款。\n\n政府已採用FPS處理稅款、差餉、政府租金及水費等帳單。\n\n開放應用程式介面（Open API）\n\nHKMA持續推動銀行業根據Open API框架的四階段方法，開發和採用Open API。第一階段，2020年1月，20家零售銀行開放超過500個Open API端點，涵蓋金融產品和服務資訊；第二階段，10月，支援申請金融產品和服務的API數量超過300個。\n\n研究與人才培育\n\n在貿易融資方面，年初完成了eTradeConnect與we.trade整合的概念驗證（PoC）研究。11月，香港銀聯清算有限公司與中國人民銀行數字貨幣研究所簽署了諒解備忘錄（MoU），共同進行聯合測試，連接eTradeConnect與人民銀行貿易融資平台，為香港及內地企業提供更便利的貿易融資服務。\n\n關於央行數字貨幣（CBDC），HKMA與泰國中央銀行合作，啟動項目Inthanon-LionRock，研究CBDC在跨境支付中的應用，促進香港元與泰銖的支付對支付（PVP）交易。HKMA行政總監Colin Pou與中國人民銀行數字貨幣研究所所長穆長春，出席聯合簽約儀式，合作開展聯合測試。\n\n在人工智能（AI）方面，HKMA進行了相關研究，並於11月公佈行業範圍的AI調研結果，12月發表完整報告《用人工智能重塑銀行業》，闡述AI在香港銀行業的應用前景與趨勢。為擴大金融科技人才庫，HKMA聯合合作伙伴推行金融科技職業加速計劃2.0，去年吸引逾220名學生參與，培育年輕人才。"}
{"en": "# Reserves Management\n\nGlobal financial markets performed better than expected in 2019 as the effect of accommodative monetary policies from major central banks outweighed concerns about the global growth slowdown and US-China trade tensions. Global equity markets rebounded following a significant correction in the fourth quarter of 2018, while major government bond yields declined and bond prices went up. Under such a favourable environment, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$262.2 billion in 2019, representing an investment return of 6.6%.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The HKMA, under the delegated authority of the Financial Secretary (FS) and within the terms of the delegation, is responsible to the FS for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(a) to preserve capital;\n(b) to ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(c) to ensure that sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) subject to (a)–(c), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund.\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP). The BP holds highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under Currency Board arrangements. The IP invests primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of its assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA diversifies part of the Exchange Fund’s investments in a prudent and incremental manner into a wider variety of asset classes. This includes emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The cap for the market value of investments under the LTGP is set at the aggregate of one-third of the accumulated surplus of the Exchange Fund and the portion of the Future Fund and placements by subsidiaries of the Exchange Fund linked to the LTGP.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007, holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that have been acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes. This Portfolio is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of its unique nature.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by fiscal reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP, with the major exception of the Future Fund, which links its interest rate to both the IP and the LTGP with reference to the portfolio mix. As at the end of 2019, the portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 40:60.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation. The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents long-term asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark (or strategic) allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and tracking error limit are determined by the FS in consultation with the EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may assume positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nThe HKMA set up the Exchange Fund Investment Office (EFIO) in August 2018 to house its investment and related risk management functions. Staff members of the EFIO directly manage about 71% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, comprising the entire BP and part of the IP. This part of the IP includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 29% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes. The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to realise sustainable returns, draw on diverse and complementary investment styles, and gain their market insights and technical expertise in investment.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is determined primarily by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe growing complexity of the investment environment underlines the importance of risk management. Stringent controls and investment guidelines are in place for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and compliance with guidelines and regulations is closely monitored. As the investment environment has become more complex, risk assessment has been strengthened to support the Exchange Fund’s increased level of investment diversification. Risk-control tools are deployed to assess market risks under both normal and adverse market conditions. Detailed performance attribution analyses are also conducted to identify sources of performance, enabling the HKMA to assess how to make the best use of the investment skills of both internal and external managers.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nThe HKMA is supportive of responsible investment (RI) by weaving environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into the investment process for both public and private market investments of the Exchange Fund.\n\nIn terms of public market investments, the HKMA implements both process-related and investment-related measures. One process-related measure taken by the HKMA is the adoption of the Principles of Responsible Ownership (PRO) issued by the Securities and Futures Commission in 2016, which help investors determine how best to meet their ownership responsibilities in relation to their investments in Hong Kong-listed companies. In managing the Exchange Fund, the HKMA has developed internal guidelines on ESG factors covering the process of selection, appointment and monitoring of external fund managers. The appointed external fund managers for the HKMA’s Hong Kong equities and Mainland active equities portfolios are required to adhere to the pRO in managing the investments on a “comply-or-explain” basis, and external fund managers appointed to manage the HKMA’s portfolios in developed market equities need to adhere to internationally recognised ESG standards. Apart from externally managed funds, ESG factors are also incorporated into the credit risk analysis of the HKMA’s internally managed bond investment.\n\nAs for ESG investments in the public market, the HKMA has invested in green bonds since 2015 as one of the early investors in this market, and participates in the Managed Co-Lending Portfolio Programme, which is run by the International Finance Corporation with a focus on sustainable investments across emerging markets. Going forward, the HKMA will continue to grow its green bond portfolio by either direct investment or investing in green bond funds. The HKMA also plans to construct ESGthemed mandates in equities investment by adopting an ESG equities index as a benchmark for passive portfolios and engaging active equities managers who apply ESG factors in their investment decisions.\n\nWith respect to private market investments, the HKMA examines the ESG policies and practices of general partners as part of its due diligence process. In particular, ESG risk evaluation is conducted as a mandatory part of due diligence in all LTGP investments. For the LTGP, the HKMA invests in projects with sustainable features; for instance, the HKMA has invested in renewables since 2013 in direct and co-investments in the energy sector, as well as green buildings and warehouses with green and sustainable features in its real estate portfolio. Going forward, the HKMA will continue to source projects with sustainable features and include green accreditation as a predominant factor in real estate investment.\n\nThe HKMA will monitor the development of ESG standards closely and assess how these standards can be further integrated into its investment process. The process is facilitated by its collaboration with like-minded investors and relevant international organisations. In particular, being a signatory of the UN-supported principles for Responsible Investment, which is the world’s leading proponent of RI, the HKMA expects to participate in the formulation of ESG best practices and to motivate other investors in adopting RI. Besides, the HKMA is also a member of FCLTGlobal, a not-for-profit organisation that works to encourage a longer-term focus in business and investment decision-making through workshops and research studies. In 2019, the HKMA also became a supporter of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures.\n\nFor more details about the HKMA’s RI policy framework, see the Corporate Social Responsibility chapter.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2019\n\nDespite concerns about the global growth slowdown and US-China trade tensions, global financial markets performed well in 2019 on the back of accommodative monetary policies from major central banks. Following a significant correction in the fourth quarter of 2018, global equity markets rallied in 2019. In the bond markets, major government bond yields declined markedly while bond prices went up in the first three quarters of 2019 as a result of monetary easing. Although bond prices retreated in the fourth quarter amid a slight rebound in yields, the overall gains in the bond markets were still satisfactory in 2019.\n\nIn the currency markets, major currencies performed differently against the US dollar. After declining by 3.8% in the third quarter due to an escalation of US-China trade tensions, the renminbi recovered part of its earlier losses in the fourth quarter given easing trade tensions. Overall, the renminbi depreciated by 1.4% against the US dollar. While the pound fell by 3.2% in the third quarter due to the heightened risk of a no-deal Brexit, it had since rebounded significantly as more clarity on Brexit emerged in the fourth quarter, eventually gaining 4.0% against the US dollar.\n\nThe performances of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2019 are shown in Table 1.\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$262.2 billion in 2019. This comprised gains on bonds of HK$114.5 billion, gains on Hong Kong equities of HK$22.1 billion, gains on other equities of HK$100.7 billion, a negative currency translation effect of HK$13.0 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets, and gains of HK$37.9 billion on other investments held by the investment holding subsidiaries of the Fund. Separately, the Strategic portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$2.5 billion.\n\nThe total assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,206.7 billion at the year end. The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$335.1 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$233.4 billion and real estate at HK$101.7 billion. Outstanding investment commitments reached HK$219.3 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund in 2019, excluding the Strategic portfolio, was 6.6%. Specifically, the IP achieved a rate of return of 9.7%, while the Bp gained 2.5%. The LTGP has recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 12.6% since its inception in 2009.\n", "zh": "儲備管理\n\n2019年，全球金融市場的表現超出預期，主要中央銀行的寬鬆貨幣政策效應超越了對全球經濟增長放緩以及美中貿易緊張局勢的擔憂。全球股市在2018年第四季度大幅調整後反彈，而主要政府債券收益率下跌，債券價格上升。在如此有利的環境下，交易基金在2019年錄得投資收益2622億港元，投資回報率為6.6%。\n\n交易基金\n\n根據《交易基金條例》的規定，交易基金的主要目標是直接或間接影響港幣的匯率價值。基金亦可用於維持香港貨幣金融體系的穩定與完整，以協助維持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。香港金融管理局（HKMA）在財經司司長（FS）授權範圍內，負責交易基金的使用和投資管理，並須遵循授權指令。\n\n交易基金管理\n\n投資目標與組合結構\n\n交易基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）為交易基金設置以下投資目標：\n\n(a) 維持資本；\n(b) 確保整個貨幣基礎，始終由高度流動性、以美元計價的資產全額擔保；\n(c) 確保有足夠的流動性以維持貨幣與金融穩定；\n(d) 在符合(a)至(c)條款的前提下， achieving 可幫助長期保持基金購買力的投資回報。\n\n這些目標充分考慮了交易基金的法定目的，並融入基金的組合結構和目標資產配置。\n\n一般而言，交易基金有兩個主要的投資組合：支持組合（BP）和投資組合（IP）。BP持有高度流動性、美元計價的資產，以滿足貨幣局體制下對貨幣基數的完全擔保。IP主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織（OECD）成員國的債券和股票市場，以維護資產的價值和長期購買力。\n\n為了更好地管理風險並提升中長期回報，HKMA謹慎且逐步地將部分交易基金投資分散到更廣泛的資產類別，包括新興市場與內地債券和股票、私募股權（包括基礎設施）以及房地產。新興市場和內地債券與股票由IP持有，而私募股權和房地產投資則由長期增長組合（LTGP）持有。LTGP的投資市值上限設定為交易基金累計盈餘的三分之一與Future基金及其子公司的投資（與LTGP相關的部分）之合計。\n\n2007年成立的戰略組合（Strategic Portfolio）持有由政府為交易基金戰略目的而收購的香港交易所及結算所股份。由於其特殊性，該組合作為基金投資績效的評估範圍之外。\n\n與交易基金的資產配置\n\n交易基金偶爾接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定機構的資金存放。其利率一般與IP的表現掛鈎，唯一例外是Future基金，其利率則較多地結合IP與LTGP的資產配置比重。截止2019年底，Future基金在IP與LTGP中的配置比例約為40：60。\n\n投資流程\n\n交易基金的投資流程主要基於兩種類型的資產配置決策：戰略資產配置和戰術資產配置。戰略資產配置反映於投資基準，代表根據基金的投資目標所制定的長期資產配置。根據策略配置，資產會進行戰術性調整，以期超越基準的超額回報。這意味著實際配置經常與基準配置不同，差異稱為“戰術偏差”。雖然基準和追蹤誤差的限度由財經司與EFAC協商決定，但戰術性的決策及偏差範圍由HKMA在授權下制定。於允許的範圍內，組合經理可以根據短期市場走勢調整頭寸，以獲取短期收益。\n\n投資管理\n\n直接投資\n\nHKMA於2018年8月成立了交易基金投資部（EFIO），負責投資及相關風險管理職能。EFIO的員工直接管理約71%的交易基金投資，包括全部BP和部分IP的投資。這部分IP包括投資於全球固定收益市場及實施宏觀風險管理策略的衍生工具組合。\n\n外部管理人員的運用\n\n除了內部管理外，HKMA亦聘用外部基金管理人管理約29%的資產，包括所有上市股票組合及其他專業資產類別。聘用外部管理人旨在利用市場上最優秀的投資專業知識，實現可持續回報，並借助多元化和互補的投資風格，獲取市場洞察與投資技術。\n\n涉及外部管理人的開支包括基金管理費、託管費、交易成本以及預扣税和其他稅項，並主要由市場因素影響，年度間可能波動。\n\n風險管理與合規\n\n投資環境的日益複雜強調了風險管理的重要性。對內外投資組合都制定了嚴格的控制措施和投資指引，並密切監控合規情況。隨著投資環境變得更為復雜，風險評估亦得以加強，以支持交易基金多元化投資的提升。運用風險控制工具評估正常及不利市況下的市場風險，並進行詳盡的績效歸因分析，以識別績效來源，使HKMA能有效運用內外管理者的投資專才。\n\n責任投資\n\nHKMA支持負責任的投資（RI），在交易基金的公共和私人市場投資中融入環境、社會和治理（ESG）因素。\n\n在公共市場投資方面，HKMA實施過程及投資兩方面措施。一個過程措施是2016年證券及期貨事務監察委員會（SFC）發布的負責任擁有原則（PRO），幫助投資者決定如何履行其對香港上市公司的擁有責任。管理交易基金時，HKMA制定了內部關於ESG因素的指引，包括篩選、任命和監控外部管理人。HKMA管理的香港股票和內地積極股票的外部基金管理人須遵守PRO原則，以“合規或解釋”方式管理，管理發達市場股票的外部基金管理人亦須遵循國際認可的ESG標準。除了外部管理的基金外，HKMA亦將ESG因素納入內部管理債券的信貸風險分析。\n\n在公共市場的ESG投資方面，HKMA自2015年起就投資於綠色債券，作為早期投資者之一，並參與由國際金融公司（IFC）運行的管理共同借貸組合計劃，該計劃專注於新興市場的可持續投資。未來，HKMA將持續擴大其綠色債券組合，可通過直接投資或投資於綠色債券基金實現。HKMA亦計劃建立以ESG為主題的股票投資委託，採用ESG股票指數作為被動組合的基準，並聘用在投資決策中運用ESG因素的積極管理人。\n\n在私人市場投資方面，HKMA會審查普通合夥人的ESG政策和實踐，作為盡職調查的一部分。特別的是，所有LTGP投資都需進行ESG風險評估，並投資於具可持續特徵的項目，例如自2013年起在能源領域進行的可再生能源直接及共同投資，此外還包括具有綠色或可持續特徵的綠色建築和倉庫。未來，HKMA將持續尋找具有可持續特徵的項目，並將綠色認證作為房地產投資的重要因素。\n\nHKMA將密切監測ESG標準的發展，評估這些標準如何進一步融入其投資流程。此過程得以通過與志同道合的投資者及國際相關組織的合作推動。特別是作為聯合國支持的負責任投資原則（PRI）的簽署機構，HKMA預計參與制定ESG最佳實踐，並促使其他投資者 adopt RI。此外，HKMA亦是FCLTGlobal的成員，該組織致力於通過研討會及研究推廣長期導向的商業與投資決策。2019年，HKMA亦成為氣候相關金融披露工作組（TCFD）的支持者。\n\n有關HKMA的RI政策框架的更多詳情，請參閱企業社會責任章節。\n\n交易基金績效\n\n2019年的金融市場\n\n儘管擔憂全球經濟增長放緩及美中貿易緊張，但2019年全球金融市場在主要中央銀行的寬鬆貨幣政策之下表現良好。在2018年第四季度大幅調整後，全球股市在2019年反彈。在債券市場方面，由於貨幣政策放鬆，前3季度主要政府債券收益率大幅下降，債券價格上升。儘管第四季度由於收益率略有回升，債券價格有調整，但2019年的整體收益仍令人滿意。\n\n在匯率市場，多種貨幣對美元的表現各異。由於美中貿易緊張升级，第三季度人民幣貶值3.8%，但由於貿易緊張緩解，第四季度人民幣部分收復之前的損失，整體對美元貶值1.4%。英鎊在第三季度因無協議脫歐的風險升高而下跌3.2%，但隨著第四季度對脫歐的不確定性減少而大幅反彈，最終對美元升值4.0%。\n\n表1顯示了2019年主要貨幣、債券及股票市場的表現。\n\n交易基金的表現\n\n2019年，交易基金錄得投資收入2622億港元，包括債券收益1145億港元，香港股票收益221億港元，其他股票收益1007億港元，非港幣資產的貨幣轉換負面影響130億港元，以及投資控股子公司持有的其他投資收益379億港元。另計，戰略組合錄得估值增值25億港元。\n\n年末，交易基金的總資產達到42067億港元。LTGP的投資市值合計3351億港元，其中私募股權為2334億港元，房地產為1017億港元。未來投資承諾總額達2193億港元。\n\n剔除戰略組合外，2019年交易基金的投資回報率為6.6%。具體而言，IP的回報率為9.7%，BP則為2.5%。自2009年成立以來，LTGP的年化內部收益率（IRR）為12.6%。"}
{"en": "# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communication with the community and the market through the traditional media, social media platforms, its website, the Information Centre and various other channels to facilitate public understanding about its policies and operations. Within the institution, conscientious efforts are made to improve the HKMA’s corporate governance by supporting the professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline, enhancing information technology security, and promoting a culture of innovation to cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives and the increasing complexity of work.\n\n# ENGAGING THE COMMUNITY\n\n# Media relations and social media\n\nThe HKMA works closely with the media to enhance transparency and promote public understanding about its policies and work. During the year, 125 open press events were held, comprising 10 press conferences, 12 stand-up interviews and 103 other public functions. A further 25 media interviews were arranged. A total of 466 bilingual press releases were issued and a large number of media enquiries were handled every day.\n\nTo raise awareness of the HKMA’s key functions, the HKMA organised media briefings and educational workshops for local and overseas media as well as key opinion leaders in the community to facilitate understanding on a wide range of topics, such as the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), virtual banking, green finance, and Hong Kong as a competitive international financial centre.\n\nSince July 2018, the HKMA has launched various social media channels to strengthen public education and communication. Five social media channels are currently in operation: Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter and YouTube, reaching out to a total of over 45,000 followers as at end-December 2019. Amid the social incidents in the second half of 2019, the HKMA made use of social media to rebut unfounded rumours regarding banking operations and financial stability, a move which proved to be highly effective in disseminating facts and preventing the rumours from spreading further.\n\n# Public enquiries\n\nThe Public Enquiry Service provides an effective means for the public to better understand the key functions and operations of the HKMA. A total of 9,742 enquiries were handled in 2019, about half of which were related to banking policies and regulations, consumer banking, and notes and coins. Some of the notable enquiries raised were about the Coin Collection programme, banking products and services, banking-related guidelines and circulars, the Faster Payment System (FPS), and monetary and economic statistics.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received since 2016 and Chart 2 provides a breakdown by enquiry nature in 2019.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Eddie Yue, speaks at the Hong Kong Association of Banks Distinguished Speaker Luncheon.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Eddie Yue (left), and HKMA's then Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan, meet with media after the announcement of the appointment of Mr Eddie Yue as the next Chief Executive of the HKMA.\n\n# Publications\n\nApart from the HKMA Annual Report, in 2019 the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report, four issues of the Quarterly Bulletin, and regular updates of the Monthly Statistical Bulletin to provide up-to-date and thematic information and analyses on monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. In addition, the HKMA published 19 inSight articles, covering various topics related to its work. The inSight articles provide a useful channel for the HKMA to elucidate the rationale behind its major new initiatives or policies, and provide timely response to topical issues which are of interest to the public.\n\n# HKMA website\n\nThe HKMA official website (www.hkma.gov.hk) presents more than 40,000 pages of content in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, and is the public access gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It also contains the register of authorized institutions (AIs) and local representative offices and the register of the securities staff of AIs, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the register of stored value facility (SVF) licensees under the payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance. The HKMA official website underwent a major revamp and was relaunched in September with a new design layout, enriched content, an enhanced navigation structure, and more convenient search functions. The revamped website enables users to search information more easily and conveniently based on their own preferences. In particular, the revamped website carries a new section on “Smart Consumers”, where the public can find useful information and smart tips on a wide range of banking and related products or services. This is in line with the HKMA’s long-standing efforts to promote “smart and responsible” use of banking services.\n\nThe HKMA launches its revamped website.\n\nThe revamped HKMA website carries a new section on “Smart Consumers”.\n\nThe HKMA has been opening up financial data and important information published on its website via Open Application Programming Interface (Open API) by phases since 2018. By 2019, the HKMA has opened up 130 sets of Open ApIs on the HKMA’s website as originally planned. The HKMA embraces the development and application of Open API.\n\n# HKMA Information Centre\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre is an important resource introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters. It consists of an exhibition area and a library, and is open to the public six days a week. The exhibition area describes the HKMA’s work and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong. It also contains reading materials and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nThe HKMA completed the last phase of revamp of its Information Centre — the Historical Timeline — during the year. The revamped Historical Timeline, featuring multimedia and digital display panels for visitors to review the major monetary and financial events in Hong Kong and globally in a more interactive manner, was re-opened to the public in October.\n\nThe first section of the Historical Timeline is made up of a multimedia display panel presenting major events from 1842 to 1993.\n\nThe second section of the Historical Timeline is a digital display panel presenting major events from 1993, when the HKMA was established, to the present.\n\nThe Information Centre organises guided tours for visitors. During the year, it received more than 48,000 visitors and hosted over 480 guided tours for schools and other groups (Chart 3). More than 753,000 people have visited the Information Centre since it opened in December 2003.\n\nGuided tours of the Information Centre are organised for schools and other group visitors.\n\nThe library, situated next to the exhibition area, houses more than 26,000 books, journals and other publications for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs and central banking topics. It also maintains the register of AIs and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\n# Public and consumer education\n\nTo reach out to the community and raise public awareness of the HKMA’s work, the HKMA organised a public education seminar for over 400 secondary school students and teachers in 2019. Topics covered in the seminar included an introduction to the work of the HKMA, Hong Kong’s banknotes, the FPS, SVFs, fintech and the Deposit Protection Scheme. More than 60,000 teachers and students have participated in this programme since its launch in 1998.\n\nStudents and teachers from secondary schools in different districts attend the 2019 public education seminar.\n\nThe focus of the HKMA’s consumer education initiatives during the year was on educating the public to protect their “personal digital keys”, a concept introduced to help the public visualise the significance of safeguarding information for accessing their online accounts. The central message was that in the digital world, account login details and personal information related to internet banking and other digital financial services were as important as the keys to their home, and should be well protected. Extensive promotion was arranged across different media, including the TV, radio, mobile applications, social media, and other digital and out-of-home platforms, to highlight smart tips on how to protect personal digital keys.\n\nThe Flagship Campaign on Personal Digital Keys is conducted via extensive cross-media promotion.\n\nSustained initiatives were also carried out to educate the public to be smart and responsible financial consumers. For example, members of the public were urged to stay vigilant of bogus phone calls purportedly from banks, and of investment scams promoted on social media. Issues to note when handling personal credit products, in particular personal loans taken out during the tax season, were also promoted.\n\nTo enhance financial literacy among secondary school students, the HKMA co-organised the “Hong Kong Liberal Studies Financial Literacy Championship” with various stakeholders for the fifth year. Infographics were newly used in the Championship this year to help students better understand sophisticated financial concepts. An online quiz was conducted, attracting 10,450 submissions and culminating in the grand final competition, which was held at the HKMA for the first time. \n\nThe Championship, attracting over 10,000 online submissions, ends with a live competition at the HKMA.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA kicked off the Second phase of its Cross-generation Outreach Educational programme, which was organised jointly with an education institution. The programme comprised bank simulation games, parents’ talks and train-the-trainer workshops, targeting kindergarten pupils, their parents and teachers, as well as young adults. Other initiatives on youth education included producing comic storybooks for primary school students and parents jointly with a professional association, as well as delivering talks to tertiary school students.\n\nThe HKMA continued to support the Investor and Financial Education Council in promoting financial literacy and capacity in Hong Kong, and will explore further collaboration with different stakeholders to maximise the impact of consumer education.\n\nThe Achievement Ceremony for the First Phase of the Crossgeneration Outreach Programme is held alongside the launch of the Second Phase.\n\nKindergarten pupils participate in the bank simulation game.\n\nComic storybooks are produced jointly with a professional association to disseminate smart tips on using banking and financial services to primary school students and their parents.\n\n# OUR PEOPLE\n\nWhile the HKMA is an integral part of the Government, it employs staff on terms different from those of the civil service to attract people with the right experience and expertise. The HKMA recruits, develops and maintains a highly professional workforce to support its policy objectives and respond flexibly to changing work priorities.\n\nThe establishment of the HKMA in 2019 was 1,005. During the year, the HKMA conducted a cross-departmental re-engineering exercise to enhance the efficiency of various work processes and redeploy existing resources to support new initiatives. As a result of this rigorous exercise, the overall establishment of the HKMA in 2020 remains unchanged at 1,005.

{"en": "# Corporate Social Responsibility\n\nThe HKMA is committed to fulfilling its corporate social responsibility, and aims to be a responsible and sustainable organisation. This commitment is manifested in various areas, including promoting a sustainable and environment-friendly marketplace, supporting the wider community, protecting the environment and nurturing a caring workplace.\n\n# MARKETPLACE\n\n# Green and sustainable banking\n\nClimate change is one of the major risks threatening the well-being of mankind and the sustainability of the world economy. The financial sector in which banks operate, being an integral part of the society, will also be impacted and hence should be more proactive in managing climate risks. The HKMA is committed to exploring ways to address this challenge. Against this background, the HKMA unveiled in May a number of measures for promoting the development of green finance in Hong Kong, including the adoption of a three-phased approach to promote green and sustainable banking.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nAs the investment manager of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA believes that the concept of responsible investment (RI) is highly relevant to its investment work. As the HKMA is one of the world’s largest asset owners, it will have a major impact on how fund managers pick assets.\n\n# Our Beliefs\n\nThe HKMA sees RI as an investment approach that takes into account the impact of various environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors on long-term investment returns and their sustainability. The HKMA believes that, by putting an appropriate emphasis on RI and sustainable long-term economic performance, it can better achieve the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund and reduce risks associated with the ESG-related matters of its underlying investments.\n\n# Our Principles\n\nThe HKMA’s guiding principle is that priority will generally be given to ESG investments if the long-term risk-adjusted return is comparable with other investments. Where appropriate, the HKMA adopts in its investment process the following RI principles that underpin its beliefs as a responsible long-term investor:\n\n# Integration\n\nThe HKMA incorporates ESG factors into its investment analysis processes to identify risks and opportunities, as it believes that these factors can materially affect the long-term value of its investments. Specifically, the HKMA has been integrating ESG factors into its investment process for both public and private market investments. For public market investments, the HKMA incorporates ESG factors in its credit risk analysis of bond investment. External managers that share the HKMA’s RI beliefs are selected and appointed. The HKMA communicates its RI beliefs to all its external managers and expects them to align in such a way that the overall sustainable long-term economic performance target is attainable. For private market investments, the ESG policies and practices of the HKMA’s general partners are examined as part of its due diligence process.\n\n# Active ownership\n\nThe HKMA exercises shareholder rights in its public equity holding in a manner that helps safeguard the long-term value of its investments. The HKMA believes that responsible corporate behaviour guided by ESG factors will help create shareholder value in the long term. The HKMA’s asset managers are expected to help the HKMA discharge its ownership responsibilities in the underlying investments by adopting active ownership through exercising voting rights and engaging with the corporates concerned.\n\n# Collaboration\n\nThe HKMA seeks to join hands with like-minded investors and regulators to promote good practices for the long-term management of investments. It participates in and speaks at public events to share views and encourage the investment community to adopt RI.\n\nSee the Reserves Management chapter for more details about the HKMA’s work on RI during the year.\n\n# Promoting financial inclusion\n\nThe HKMA attaches great importance to financial inclusion and has been making significant effort in promoting access to basic banking services by different segments of the society to meet the basic daily needs of the general public and the operational needs of legitimate businesses. In particular, the HKMA has been working closely with the banking industry on the following priority areas:\n\n- Encouraging banks to launch more physical banking facilities and develop digital and innovative channels for the delivery of basic banking services to serve the general public, particularly residents of remote areas and public housing estates, and the elderly;\n\n- Facilitating and monitoring the accessibility of bank accounts to individuals and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs);\n\n- Enhancing the accessibility of banking services to specific customer groups, for example, customers with disabilities and ethnic minorities;\n\n- Facilitating and monitoring the accessibility of bank credit to SMEs; and\n\n- Granting authorization to eight virtual banks, which will play an active role in promoting financial inclusion in delivering their banking services.\n\n# COMMUNITY\n\n# Promoting financial literacy\n\nThe HKMA promotes financial literacy through various channels. Apart from running educational programmes to promote smart and responsible use of banking and financial services by the public, the HKMA features on its revamped official website a new dedicated section on “Smart Consumers”, where the public can find useful information and smart tips on a wide range of banking and related products and services. Social media platforms such as Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube, Instagram and Twitter are used in addition to the HKMA official website and publications to provide up-to-date information on banking and financial affairs.\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre, serving as the HKMA’s major public education and research resource since 2003, introduces the work of the HKMA to the community and promotes public awareness of monetary and banking matters. Educational guided tours are offered daily for group visitors from schools and non-profit making organisations. public education seminars and other activities are also organised for students to enhance their financial knowledge and literacy. In addition, the HKMA works closely with the Investor and Financial Education Council to promote financial literacy in Hong Kong via its financial education platform, The Chin Family.\n\nSee the Corporate Functions chapter for more details about the HKMA’s work on promoting financial literacy during the year. See the Banking Stability chapter for more details about the HKMA’s work on promoting financial inclusion during the year.\n\n# Addressing the needs of special groups \n\n# Accessibility of Hong Kong banknotes\n\nThe 2018 Series of Banknotes retains accessibility features used in the previous series of banknotes to help the visually impaired differentiate between the denominations. These accessibility features include Braille, tactile lines and high-tactility numerals.\n\nTo help the visually impaired differentiate between the denomination of the banknotes, a mobile app, sponsored by the HKMA and developed by the Hong Kong Society for the Blind, uses the phone’s camera to scan the banknote patterns for the denomination. The app is available for download from Apple App Store and Google play Store for free. A note-measuring template sponsored by the HKMA and the three note-issuing banks has also been introduced to measure the length of the note. It can measure both the 2018 Series and the notes currently in circulation. The template is embossed with Braille on one side and symbols on the other. It is freely distributed at voluntary agencies serving the visually impaired community.\n\n# Coin Collection Programme\n\nUnder the Coin Collection programme, the HKMA collaborates with the Hong Kong Council of Social Service to deploy the Coin Carts to collect coins on flag days for non-governmental organisations.\n\n# Accessibility of public information\n\nThe revamped HKMA official website was launched in September. The revamped website has enhanced navigation structure to facilitate easy and convenient search by users based on their own preferences. In particular, the website contains a dedicated webpage “Information in Other Languages” under the “Smart Consumers” section, which provides useful information on banking services in seven languages commonly used by the ethnic minority community, namely Bahasa Indonesia, Hindi, Nepali, Punjabi, Tagalog, Thai and Urdu.\n\nThe HKMA is committed to ensuring that its website conforms to the maximum extent possible to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 Level AA standard, to facilitate barrier-free access to its online information by people with special needs.\n\n# volunteer and charitable activities\n\nThe HKMA supports community services by taking part in volunteer and charitable activities. The Senior Citizen Home Safety Association awarded the Community Engagement Crystal Award to the HKMA for participating in the 2018 Love & Peace of Mind Corporate Engagement Programme.\n\nCharitable events participated in by the HKMA Volunteer Team in 2019\n\n“Yo! Let’s Walk the Road” by the Youth Outreach.\n\nArtists and representatives from the social enterprise, Arts with the Disabled Association Hong Kong, visit the HKMA office, where its artworks are displayed.\n\nHKMA staff members take part actively in Blood Donation Day, Territory-Wide Flag Day, Community Chest’s Green Day, Love Teeth Day, Skip Lunch Day, Dress Casual Day and regular campaigns that collect clothes, toys and other reusable items for donation to charities.\n\nHKMA staff members take part actively in Blood Donation Day, organised by the Hong Kong Red Cross.\n\n# Caring organisation\n\nIn recognition of its commitment to care for the community, the HKMA was accredited with the “10 Years Plus Caring Organisation Logo” by the Hong Kong Council of Social Service for the 13th consecutive year.\n\n# ENVIRONMENT\n\n# Green office measures\n\nThe HKMA has an established environmental policy to protect and preserve the environment. The policy and implementation measures are promulgated among its staff regularly. Green office measures include:\n\n# Paper/Photocopying/Printing\n\n- Encouraging the use of recycled paper and envelopes;\nDistributing electronic copies instead of hard copies of documents;\n- printing on both sides of the paper;\n- Using colour printing and copying only when necessary;\n- Avoiding the use of paper cups; and \n- Using environmentally friendly paper and ink for the HKMA’s Annual Report.\n\n# Electricity\n\n- Switching off PCs, printers, lights, audio-visual systems and other electrical appliances when these devices are not in use. Reactivating the preset power-saving mode installed in most equipment, such as water dispensers, electric punching machines and shredders, after use outside their preset operating hours; and \n- Reviewing regularly the need for additional air-conditioning beyond normal business hours.\n\n# Recycling\n\n- Making good use of recycled bins to collect different categories of waste, including paper, cans, bottles, batteries, CDs and ink cartridges.\n\n# WORKPLACE\n\n# Diversity and inclusion\n\n# Equal Opportunities Policy\n\nThe HKMA is an equal opportunities employer. It believes that everyone should be able to work in an environment free of discrimination, harassment, vilification and victimisation. The equal opportunities policy applies to job advertisements, recruitment, terms and conditions of employment, performance assessment, promotion, transfer, training, dismissal, grievance procedures and general conduct.\n\n# Key statistics on diversity\n\npeople are central to the work of the HKMA. We value the diversity of our workforce, which has a balanced gender representation and a spectrum of different age groups.\n\nFemale representation at the senior management levels, that is, Executive Director and above, made up 31% as of February 2020.\n\n# Human capital key statistics on 1 January 2020\n\n# Quality workplace\n\nTo cater for projected operational needs, the HKMA renovated the offices during the year to create an open layout, increase capacity and allow for more efficient use of space. Breakout areas and ergonomic furniture are part of the new office design. To enhance the staff’s physical health, height-adjustable desks were offered to staff members, allowing them to change their postures easily throughout the day between sitting and standing.\n\nHeight-adjustable desks improve office ergonomics.\n\n# Staff well-being\n\nThe HKMA promotes work-life balance and cares about the health and work safety of the staff. Regular talks on healthy lifestyles, stress management and workplace safety are organised and indoor air quality is monitored. Annual on-site medical check-ups and flu vaccinations are arranged.

{"en": "# The Exchange Fund\n\n- Report of the Director of Audit\n- Exchange Fund Financial Statements\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 187 to 293, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2019, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2019, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards. My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report. I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2019. These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.5, 2.6 and 38.1 to the financial statements.\n\nAs at 31 December 2019, the Group had financial assets totalling HK$3,874,223 million and financial liabilities totalling HK$1,158,686 million valued at fair value.\n\nFor 91% of these financial assets and all these financial liabilities, their fair values were quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 inputs) or were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data (Level 2 inputs).\n\nFor the remaining 9% of these financial assets, their fair values were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data (Level 3 inputs). Such financial assets totalled HK$338,758 million, including mainly unlisted investment funds.\n\nGiven the substantial amount and the estimations involved, valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value was a key audit matter.\n\nThe audit procedures on valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value included:\n\n- obtaining an understanding of the procedures, including relevant controls, for valuing different categories of financial assets and financial liabilities;\n\n- evaluating and testing the controls, including relevant application controls of the computer systems;\n\n- obtaining external confirmations on the valuation, existence, rights and obligations and completeness of the financial assets and financial liabilities;\n\n- where quoted market prices were used, verifying the prices to independent sources;\n\n- where valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions, and verifying the inputs to independent sources; and\n\n- where valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Valuation of investment properties at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.11, 18 and 19 to the financial statements.\n\nThe Group’s investment properties were stated at their fair values, totalling HK$22,481 million as at 31 December 2019. The Group also had interests in twenty two joint ventures totalling HK$44,506 million, whose principal activities were holding overseas investment properties. The fair values of these investment properties, whether held by the Group directly or by joint ventures, were mainly determined based on valuations by independent professional valuers. Such valuations involved significant judgments and estimates, including the valuation methodologies and the assumptions used.\n\nThe audit procedures on valuation of investment properties at fair value included:\n\n- obtaining and reviewing the valuation reports of investment properties held by the Group directly or by joint ventures, and verifying that the fair values were based on the valuations stated in the valuation reports;\n\n- assessing the independence and qualifications of the valuers; and\n\n- evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises all the information included in the 2019 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICpA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. I also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nJohn Chu\nDirector of Audit\n\nAudit Commission \n26th Floor\nImmigration Tower\n7 Gloucester Road\nWanchai, Hong Kong\n\n3 April 2020\n", "zh": "交易基金\n\n- 審計署署長報告\n- 交易基金財務報表\n\n審計署署長報告\n\n獨立核數師報告 對財政司司長\n\n意見\n\n我證明我已審核交易基金及其附屬公司（「本集團」）列於第187至293頁的財務報表，包括截止2019年12月31日的交易基金及本集團的資產負債表，以及其截至當年年底的收支帳、全面收益表、權益變動表及現金流量表，並附有財務報表附註，包括主要會計政策摘要。\n\n依據我之專業判斷，財務報表真實公平反映該基金及本集團於2019年12月31日的財務狀況，以及截至該年年底的財務績效和現金流，並已依照由香港會計師公會（「HKICPA」）所頒布的香港財務報告準則（「HKFRSs」）編製，並已適當地採用交易所條例（第66章）第7條下行政長官的指令而編製。\n\n意見基礎\n\n我乃依據交易所條例第7條下行政長官發布的指令及審計署審計標準進行審核。根據該等標準，我的責任在審計報告「審計財務報表」部分有進一步說明。我與本集團保持獨立，並已依照該等標準履行其他道德責任。我相信我所獲得的審計證據充足且適當，能作為我發表意見的基礎。\n\n主要審計事項\n\n主要審計事項是我基於專業判斷，認為在審計2019年12月31日止年度財務報表時最為重要的事項。這些事項在我對整體財務報表的審計過程中已加以處理，並在形成意見時考慮，我不就這些事項另行發表意見。\n\n公平值金融資產及金融負債的評價\n\n參照財務報表附註2.5、2.6及38.1。\n\n截至2019年12月31日，本集團的金融資產總值為HK$3,874,223百萬，金融負債總值為HK$1,158,686百萬，均以公平值計價。\n\n其中91%的金融資產及所有金融負債的公平值是根據活躍市場中對相同資產或負債的報價（Level 1 輸入），或經由利用基於可觀察市場資料的估值技術估算（Level 2 輸入）。\n\n剩餘9%的金融資產的公平值則是利用不基於可觀察市場資料的估值技術估算（Level 3 輸入）。這些金融資產主要包括未上市投資基金，合計HK$338,758百萬。\n\n鑑於估值金額龐大且涉及多項估算，公平值金融資產及金融負債的評價成為一個重要的審計事項。\n\n其審計程序包括：\n\n- 了解用於不同類別金融資產及金融負債的估值程序及相關控制措施；\n- 評估並測試控制措施，包括電腦系統的相關應用控制；\n- 取得外部確認，有關金融資產及負債的估值、存在、權利義務及完整性；\n- 最近市場價格的情況下，核對市場報價與獨立資料來源；\n- 使用基於可觀察市場資料的估值方法時，評估估值方法的適當性和假設的合理性，並核對輸入資料的獨立性；\n- 使用不基於可觀察市場資料的估值方法時，評估估值方法的適當性、假設的合理性及輸入資料的合理性。\n\n投資性物業以公平值的估價\n\n參照財務報表附註2.11、18及19。\n\n本集團的投資性物業截至2019年12月31日的公平值為HK$22,481百萬。該集團亦持有二十二個合資企業，總值HK$44,506百萬，主要是持有海外投資性物業。這些投資性物業（無論由集團直接持有或由合資企業持有）的公平值，主要根據獨立專業估價師的估價作出。這類估價涉及重要的判斷和估算，包括採用的估值方法和假設。\n\n關於投資性物業公平值的估價程序包括：\n\n- 取得並審核集團直接或由合資企業持有的投資性物業的估價報告，並核對公平值是否基於該等報告中的估價結果；\n- 評估估價師的獨立性和資格；\n- 評估估價方法的適當性和假設及輸入資料的合理性。\n\n其他資料\n\n貨幣管理局負責其他資料。該等其他資料包括香港金融管理局2019年年度報告內所有資料，但不包括財務報表及本人審計報告。\n\n本人對財務報表的意見不涵蓋其他資料，亦不就該等其他資料提供任何保證性結論。\n\n在審核財務報表時，本人責任是閱讀其他資料，並考慮該等資料是否在重大程度上與財務報表或審計中獲得的認知資料不符，或似乎存在重大錯誤陳述。如果根據本人已完成的工作判斷，發現該等資料存在重大錯誤陳述，本人須報告該事實。本人在這方面沒有任何事項需要報告。\n\n貨幣管理局及交易基金諮詢委員會審計分委員會對財務報表的責任\n\n貨幣管理局負責編製反映真實及公平觀點的財務報表，這些財務報表須按照香港會計師公會所頒布的HKFRSs及交易所條例第7條下行政長官的指令編製，並負有必要的內部控制，以確保財務報表不存在由於舞弊或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤。\n\n在編製財務報表時，貨幣管理局負責評估集團的持續經營能力，若有相關事項，應披露涉及持續經營的事項，並採用持續經營的會計基礎。\n\n交易基金諮詢委員會的審計分委員會負責監督集團的財務報告流程。\n\n審計署署長對財務報表審計的責任\n\n我的目標是獲取合理保證，確定財務報表整體是否不存在由於舞弊或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤，我會發出一份含有我意見的審計報告。合理保證屬高水準，但並不保證依照審計署審計標準進行的審計一定能在所有情況下發現所有重大錯誤。錯誤可能由舞弊或錯誤引起，若其單獨或合計對用戶基於該等財務報表作出經濟決策產生重大影響，則為重大錯誤。\n\n作為遵循審計署審計標準的審計一部分，我在整個審計過程中行使專業判斷和保持專業懷疑。我還會：\n\n- 識別並評估重大錯誤的風險，包括由舞弊或錯誤引起的，設計並執行響應該些風險的審計程序，並獲取足夠且適當的審計證據，作為我意見的基礎。由舞弊引致的重大錯誤偵測難度高於錯誤，因為舞弊可能涉及串謀、偽造、故意遺漏、虛假陳述或濫用內部控制；\n\n- 了解與審計相關的內部控制，以設計適當的審計程序，但並非對集團內部控制的有效性發表意見；\n\n- 評估貨幣管理局所採用的會計政策是否適當，以及對於會計估算及披露的合理性；\n\n- 評估貨幣管理局使用持續經營假設的適當性，以及根據取得的審計證據，是否存在可能對集團持續經營能力構成重大疑慮的重大不確定因素。如果我認為存在重大不確定，必須在審計報告中提請注意財務報表中的披露，或若披露不足，則須修正意見。我的結論基於我獲得的審計證據直至審計報告之日，但未來事件或情況可能使集團停止持續經營；\n\n- 評估財務報表的整體呈現、結構和內容，包括披露內容，及財務報表是否以公允方式反映根本交易及事件；以及獲取足夠且適當的關於集團內實體或業務活動的財務資料，以形成對財務報表的意見。我負責對集團審計的指導、監督與執行，並全權負責我的審計意見。\n\n我會與交易基金諮詢委員會的審計分委員會聯繫，內容包括計劃的審計範圍及時間、重要的審計發現（包括我在審計過程中發現的內部控制重大缺陷）。\n\n我亦會向交易基金諮詢委員會的審計分委員會提供一份聲明，證明我已符合相關道德規範要求，並與他們溝通所有可能合理影響我獨立性的關係及其他事項（如適用）。\n\n根據我與審計分委員會溝通的事項，我確定本期財務報表審計的最重要事項，即關鍵審計事項。除非法律或規例阻止公開披露，否則我會在審計師報告中描述這些事項；在極少數特殊情況下，如果我認為披露該事項會帶來不利後果，該不利性大於公開披露的公眾利益，則可能決定不披露。\n\n朱志強\n審計署署長\n\n審計署\n入境事務大樓26樓\n告士打道7號\n灣仔，香港\n\n2020年4月3日"}

{"en": "The year of 2019 has been anything but uneventful.\n\nUS-China trade tensions remained a big wild card. Lingering uncertainties over trade talks between the world’s two largest economies rattled investor confidence and undermined international trade, manufacturing, investment and even consumption. Gone are the days when global economic expansion was a given. The global economy entered a synchronised slowdown during the year. In response to the slower growth, major central banks around the world have reversed course on their monetary policy normalisation.\n\nLocally, social incidents happening in the second half of the year dealt a further blow to the Hong Kong economy. The retail, tourism and catering sectors were among the hardest hit. For 2019 as a whole, the Hong Kong economy contracted by 1.2%, the first annual decline in a decade, while the unemployment rate rose to 3.3% from a multi-year low of 2.8% at the beginning of the year. As 2020 dawned, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak posed yet another significant threat to both global and local economies.\n\nIn the face of such an uncertain and challenging environment, it is of paramount importance to maintain monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong, as I made clear when taking over as Chief Executive of the HKMA on 1 October 2019.\n\n# Monetary and financial stability: the bedrock of an international financial centre\n\nThe Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) in place since 1983 has helped Hong Kong weather numerous challenges and shocks, demonstrating its important role as an anchor of Hong Kong’s economic prosperity and status as an international financial centre. Notwithstanding the challenging external and domestic environment during the year, the LERS continued to operate in a smooth and orderly manner, once again proving its resilience in times of uncertainty. Hong Kong’s banking system also remained sound and robust. The facts speak for themselves: the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained stable and has strengthened to the strong side of the Convertibility Zone in recent months, while bank deposits continued to grow during the year. In a nutshell, no noticeable outflow of funds from the Hong Kong dollar or the banking system was observed.\n\nThe stability of Hong Kong’s monetary and banking systems reflects not only the robustness of, but also strong confidence in, our systems. This did not happen overnight, but through years of efforts to build up buffers and strengthen surveillance, complemented by our swift response to rumours on social media platforms.\n\nOur preparations over the years for rainy days have built a solid foundation and strong buffers for Hong Kong’s monetary and banking systems. In addition to the vast foreign exchange reserves in our public coffers, our banking system has strong capital buffers, robust liquidity and very good asset quality, whether by international or historical standards. The eight rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures on property mortgages implemented since 2009 have also greatly enhanced banks’ resilience against a property market downturn.\n\nMarket surveillance and banking supervision make up the core part of our work in maintaining monetary and banking stability, and we have been strengthening our surveillance and supervisory framework from time to time. Apart from close monitoring of the credit and liquidity risks of banks, one of our new endeavours in the year was to make use of technology and granular data collected from banks to enhance our capability to monitor Hong Kong dollar funding and financial market activities in a more in-depth and timely manner. Stress tests and contingency planning have also been augmented in the light of the fast evolving economic and operating environment.\n\nIndeed, our robust regulatory regime has won strong endorsements internationally. During the year, the International Monetary Fund reaffirmed that Hong Kong was well placed to address both cyclical and structural changes, given its significant buffers. Hong Kong’s effective legal and institutional framework for combatting money laundering and terrorist financing also obtained a positive assessment from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), making Hong Kong the first in the Asia-pacific region to achieve an overall compliant result in the FATF’s Mutual Evaluation.\n\nConfidence is the foundation for the proper functioning of markets and is crucial to the safeguarding of monetary and financial stability. To maintain market confidence, we have to be on high alert for, and respond swiftly to, any malicious rumours that may potentially cast doubt on Hong Kong’s monetary or banking systems. This is particularly important given the prevalent use of social media and instant messaging nowadays. While a variety of rumours were spread on social media platforms by fearmongers during the outbreak of social unrest, our quick and clear rebuttals to these rumours through social media, in addition to traditional media, proved useful and effective in clearing the air, quelling false rumours from spreading further, and upholding international and public confidence in our systems.\n\n# Banking system: an important pillar of economic activity\n\nThe banking sector, as an essential pillar of economic activity, plays a fundamental role in ensuring the smooth running of society and the economy. Despite the challenging operating environment since the latter half of the year, banks have been working hard alongside others and doing their utmost to maintain normal operation of their core functions and continue serving businesses and the public.\n\nIn addition to basic banking services like deposits and transfers, an important function of banks is in extending credit to borrowers in support of the real economy. We are well aware of, and concerned about, the cash-flow problem facing businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), under the difficult economic conditions. While safeguarding banking stability, we have launched a number of initiatives to ensure continued funding support to SMEs. In particular, the Countercyclical Capital Buffer ratio of banks was reduced on two occasions, in October 2019 and March 2020, by a total of 150 basis points to 1.0%; the level of regulatory reserve requirement on banks was also reduced by half in April 2020. These measures release a total of around HK$1 trillion in lending capacity, providing banks with more room for lending to enterprises including SMEs. We have also set up a platform – the Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism – bringing together major banks in Hong Kong to explore and discuss specific measures to strengthen funding support for SMEs. I am pleased to see that many banks have responded proactively to our call and introduced relief measures such as principal moratorium for customers in need to ride out the storm.\n\nIn view of some SMEs’ feedback about difficulties in opening bank accounts, which is the very first step in accessing various banking services, we have made dedicated efforts to address this issue over the past few years. Our work is bearing fruit, as improvement in account opening for businesses is visible. As a further step to promote financial inclusion, the HKMA spearheaded the launch of tiered account services – Simple Bank Accounts (SBAs) with a streamlined customer due diligence process – to provide start-ups and SMEs with an alternative to traditional bank accounts. More than 2,800 SBAs have been opened so far.\n\n# International financial centre: from strength to strength\n\nWe have always been mindful of the need to strike a reasonable balance between regulation and development. Given the intense competition among financial centres, we have to work hard to strengthen Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre and thereby ensure its longer term stability. There are four key areas of work: technology, green finance, financial connectivity with the Mainland, and talent development.\n\n# Embracing technology in the digital era\n\nHong Kong has been moving fast in promoting financial technology (fintech) since the establishment of the HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office in 2016 and the introduction of the Smart Banking initiatives in 2017.\n\nOn the payment front, the vibrancy of the fintech ecosystem is evident in the strong momentum in the adoption of the Faster Payment System (FPS), the world’s first multi-currency, cross-banks and e-wallets, real-time retail payment platform. FPS registrations reached four million within a short span of 15 months, representing a high rate of penetration in a population of 7.5 million people. The Government has also adopted the FPS to provide the public with greater convenience in paying taxes, rates and water charges. More and more businesses are expected to use this fast, safe and convenient means of receiving and making payment to enhance operational efficiency.\n\nIn the banking sector, significant progress was seen in applying fintech to their banking services and business operations. According to a study conducted by the HKMA, almost 90% of the surveyed retail banks have adopted, or are planning to adopt, artificial intelligence in their business applications. With the HKMA’s facilitation, banks have been applying big data and consumer behavioural analytics in their personal credit products. They have also launched over 800 Open Application programming Interfaces in the first two phases, covering a range of banking products and services. While encouraging banks to use fintech, we did not lose sight of the need for enhanced technology risk management and consumer protection in digital banking services. Timely supervisory guidance has been provided to banks in these areas.\n\nRegulatory technology (Regtech) is another area of great interest to banks, for its potential of enabling banks to conduct regulatory compliance and risk management, particularly in anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT), more efficiently and cost-effectively. To facilitate greater industry adoption of Regtech and the building of a wider Regtech ecosystem, the HKMA organised the inaugural AML/CFT Regtech Forum and issued its first Regtech newsletter in November to discuss possible use cases of Regtech. At the same time, the HKMA, as a banking supervisor, is exploring the use of supervisory technology (Suptech), including new data science and analytics, to enhance work effectiveness and efficiency. We have embarked on a series of studies and developed a road map for the implementation of Suptech in the next few years.\n\nFrom a broader perspective, this is only the start of the fintech journey in the banking sector. The HKMA granted eight licences to virtual banks during the year. One of the virtual banks officially launched its services in March 2020, while some other virtual banks have commenced pilot trials through the HKMA’s Fintech Supervisory Sandbox. I look forward to the launch of the other virtual banks and the introduction of more innovative and diversified banking services to the people of Hong Kong that would help raise the global competitiveness of our banking sector.\n\nMore exciting developments are also expected at the international level. After successfully completing a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) trial to connect our blockchain-based trade finance platform, eTradeConnect, with its European counterpart, we are conducting another PoC trial with the platform of the people’s Bank of China, paving the way for the digitalisation of cross-border trades. We have begun a joint research project with the Bank of Thailand to study the application of Central Bank Digital Currency to cross-border payments. The Bank for International Settlements also put its first Innovation Hub Centre into operation in Hong Kong in November to foster fintech collaboration within the central banking community. All these developments present clear evidence of Hong Kong’s leading global position in fintech development.\n\n# Promoting green and sustainable finance for a better future\n\nClimate-related risks have drawn increasing global attention in recent years. To contribute to the global efforts in addressing this challenge, the HKMA unveiled three key measures in May to promote green finance development in Hong Kong in different capacities.\n\nAs a banking supervisor, the HKMA is undertaking a three-phased approach to promoting green and sustainable banking. A framework for assessing the “greenness” of banks has been developed for industry consultation under phase I, paving the way for the formulation of supervisory expectations and requirements for the banking industry under phase II and implementation under phase III.\n\nAs the manager of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA actively advances responsible investment by integrating environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into its investment activities. Specifically, we have adopted the principle of giving priority to green and ESG investments if their long-term return is comparable to other investments on a risk-adjusted basis. After venturing into the green bond market in 2015 as one of the early investors, we will continue to grow our green bond portfolio and invest in other ESG assets. We will also join hands with like-minded investors and regulators to promote best practices on ESG through our participation in international organisations in the ESG community.\n", "zh": "2019年絕非平凡的一年。\n\n中美貿易緊張局勢仍然是一個變數。兩個最大經濟體之間的貿易談判仍存在不確定性，動搖投資者信心，削弱國際貿易、製造業、投資甚至消費。全球經濟擴張曾經是理所當然的日子已經一去不復返。年內，全球經濟同步放緩。為應對增長放慢，全球主要央行紛紛轉向收緊貨幣政策，逆轉了此前的寬鬆趨勢。\n\n本地方面，下半年爆發的社會事件進一步沖擊了香港經濟。零售、旅遊和餐飲行業受創最為嚴重。整體而言，2019年香港經濟收縮1.2%，為十年來首次年度萎縮，而失業率由年初的低位2.8%升至3.3%。隨著2020年的到來，新冠病毒（COVID-19）疫情再次對全球和本地經濟構成重大威脅。\n\n在如此不確定且充滿挑戰的環境下，保持香港的貨幣和金融穩定尤為重要，這是我在2019年10月1日接任港金局總裁時所作的明確表態。\n\n# 貨幣金融穩定：國際金融中心的基石\n\n自1983年實行聯繫匯率制度（LERS）以來，香港已成功抵禦多次挑戰和衝擊，彰顯其作為香港經濟繁榮嚴重依賴的一個穩定錨點和國際金融中心的關鍵作用。儘管年內外部和內部環境充滿挑戰，聯繫匯率制度仍能平穩有序運作，再次證明其韌性。香港的銀行體系亦保持穩健可靠。事實勝於雄辯：港幣匯率保持穩定，近期更加升值至兌付區的強勢一方，銀行存款也持續增加。綜合來看，未見港幣或銀行體系有明顯資金外流。\n\n香港貨幣和銀行體系的穩定，不僅反映其韌性，也展現了社會各界對系統的強大信心。這並非一夕之功，而是多年累積準備、建立緩衝、加強監察的成果，再加上我們對社交媒體上傳聞的迅速回應。\n\n我們多年來的準備工作已築起堅實基礎和強大緩衝，為香港的貨幣及銀行體系提供保障。除公共財政的龐大外匯儲備外，我們的銀行體系亦具備雄厚的資本緩衝、穩健的流動性和良好的資產質素，無論以國際標準還是歷史標準來看都是如此。自2009年以來，連續實施的八輪逆周期宏觀審慎措施，更進一步提高了銀行應對房地產市場下行的韌性。\n\n市場監察與銀行監管是我們維持貨幣和銀行穩定的核心工作，我們亦不斷強化監察與監管框架。今年，我們利用技術和從銀行收集的細緻數據，提升監控港幣融資及金融市場活動的能力，使監測更全面、更及時。考慮到經濟運行環境快速變化，我們亦加強了壓力測試和應變規劃。\n\n此外，我們堅實的監管制度在國際上贏得了廣泛認可。國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）確認，憑藉大量緩衝，香港能妥善應對經濟週期性和結構性變化。金融行動特別組織（FATF）對我們打擊洗錢和恐怖分子資金籌集的法律和制度框架給予了積極評價，使香港成為亞太地區首個在FATF相互評估中全面符合標準的地區。\n\n信心是市場正常運作的基礎，也是保障貨幣金融穩定的關鍵。我們必須高度警覺，並迅速回應可能引起疑慮的惡意傳言，尤其是在今日社交媒體和即時通訊盛行的時代。儘管社交媒體上曾被傳播恐慌性謠言，我們通過社交媒體和傳統媒體迅速而明確的反駁，有效澄清事實、阻止虛假傳言擴散，進一步鞏固國際及公眾對我們系統的信心。\n\n# 銀行系統：經濟活動的重要支柱\n\n作為經濟活動的支柱，銀行在確保社會與經濟有序運行方面扮演著基礎性角色。儘管今年下半年運作環境充滿挑戰，銀行仍與其他部門攜手努力，竭盡所能維持核心職能正常運作，持續服務企業和市民。\n\n除了基本的存款、轉帳服務外，銀行的重要職能還包括向企業提供信貸，支援實體經濟。我們深知，尤其在經濟困難時期，企業面臨資金周轉問題，特別是中小企（SMEs）。我們在確保銀行穩定的同時，亦推出多項措施，支持中小企的融資。例如，銀行的逆周期資本緩衝比率在2019年10月和2020年3月兩次合共下調150個基點至1.0%；此外，銀行的法定儲備要求水準在2020年4月亦降低一半。這些措施釋放約一兆港元的貸款能力，為銀行提供更多空間，向企業包括中小企放貸。同時，我們建立了“銀行業中小企貸款協調機制”，匯聚本港主要銀行，商討並推動支持中小企的具體措施。我欣喜地看到，許多銀行積極響應我們的呼籲，引入展延還本、救濟措施等，助力企業渡過難關。\n\n針對一些中小企反映在開立銀行戶口方面的困難，我們過去幾年一直努力，取得了一定成效。帳戶開立的改善已逐漸顯現。在推動金融包容方面，金管局 spearhead（領導推動）推出了分層戶口服務——簡易銀行帳戶（SBAs），流程簡化，適合新創企業和中小企使用。目前已開設超過2800個SBAs。\n\n# 國際金融中心：實力日益強大\n\n我們一直力求在監管與發展之間取得合理平衡。在國際金融中心激烈競爭的背景下，我們要不斷努力提升香港的競爭力，確保其長遠穩定。工作重點涵蓋四個方面：科技、綠色金融、與內地的金融聯繫及人才培育。\n\n# embracing（擁抱）數碼時代的科技\n\n自2016年成立香港金融科技促進辦公室，及2017年推出智慧銀行（Smart Banking）策略起，香港在推動金融科技（Fintech）方面進展迅速。\n\n在支付方面，金融科技生態系的活力體現在“轉數快”快速支付系統（FPS）的高速推廣，這是全球首個多幣種、跨行及電子錢包的即時零售支付平台。短短15個月內，FPS註冊用戶達四百萬，滲透率在7.5百萬人口中屬高。政府亦已採用FPS，方便市民支付稅款、差餉和水費。預計越來越多企業將利用這一快捷、安全、便利的支付工具，提高營運效率。\n\n銀行方面，應用 fintech 於服務和營運的進展令人鼓舞。根據金管局的調查，約90%的零售銀行已或正計劃引進人工智能技術於其業務應用中。在金管局的促成下，銀行運用大數據和消費行為分析開發個人信貸產品。他們已在首兩階段推出超過800個Open Application Programming Interfaces（Open API），涵蓋多種金融服務與產品。同時，為促進數碼銀行的科技風險管理和客戶保障，金管局亦提供相關監管指引。\n\n在監管科技（Regtech）方面，其潛力令人振奮，有助銀行提升合規和風險管理效率，尤其在打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集（AML/CFT）領域。為促進行業採用並擴大生態圈，金管局舉辦首屆AML/CFT Regtech論壇，並於11月發布首份Regtech通訊，討論實踐案例。同時，作為監管者，金管局亦探索使用監管科技（Suptech），借助數據科學和數據分析技術，提升工作效率。我們已展開一系列研究項目，規劃未來幾年推行Suptech。\n\n從宏觀角度看，這只是香港金融科技之路的起點。年內，我們向八家虛擬銀行發放牌照，其中一間已於2020年3月正式開展服務，其他亦陸續啟動試點。期待未來推出更多創新、多元的金融服務，以提升香港銀行業的國際競爭力。\n\n國際層面亦有更多令人振奮的進展。在成功完成連接我們基於區塊鏈的貿易金融平台——eTradeConnect與歐洲合作夥伴的概念驗證（PoC）試驗後，我們又與中國人民銀行的平臺合作，推動跨境貿易數字化。同時，與泰國中央銀行合作研究央行數字貨幣在跨境支付的應用。國際結算銀行（BIS）亦於2022年11月在香港啟動首個創新樞紐中心，促進央行團隊間的金融科技合作。所有這些都清楚展現了香港在金融科技發展中的全球領先地位。\n\n# 推動綠色及可持續金融，創造更美好未來\n\n氣候相關風險近年來日益受到全球關注。為推動綠色金融的發展，香港金融管理局（金管局）於5月推出三項重要措施，致力提升香港在綠色金融方面的角色。\n\n作為銀行監管者，金管局採取分階段策略推動綠色及可持續銀行業。第一階段制定“銀行綠色性”評估框架，供業界討論，為第二階段制定監管期望和要求打下基礎；第三階段則進行政策落實。\n\n作為外匯基金（Exchange Fund）管理者，金管局積極推動負責任投資，經由融入環境、社會及管治（ESG）因素，優先投資綠色和ESG資產，只要長期回報風險調整後相當即可。自2015年在綠色債券市場展開投資以來，我們將持續擴大綠色債券組合並投資於其他ESG資產。亦會與志同道合的投資者和監管者合作，通過參與國際組織推動ESG最佳實踐。"}

{"en": "# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nThe Hong Kong economy contracted in 2019, reflecting global economic slowdown, lingering US-China trade conflicts and local social incidents. As economic conditions deteriorated rapidly in the second half of the year, the labour market faced increasing pressures. Inflation also increased due to a sharp rise in pork prices. Economic performance for 2020 is expected to remain challenging as the novel coronavirus outbreak hits the already weakening economy. Given the difficult economic environment, the Government and the HKMA have rolled out measures to support the economy, especially households and small and medium-sized enterprises.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Real activities\n\nFollowing a 2.9% expansion in 2018, the Hong Kong economy contracted by 1.2% in 2019, marking the first annual contraction since 2009. In particular, the economy entered into a recession in the second half of the year, with the seasonally adjusted real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) shrinking consecutively in the second, third and fourth quarters (Table 1). The decline in economic activities reflected a notable reduction in domestic demand (Chart 1). As the local social incidents weighed significantly on consumption activities and sentiments in the latter part of the year, private consumption expenditure recorded the first annual decline since 2003. Overall investment spending also dropped amid dampened business sentiments. On the external front, slowing global economic growth and additional tariffs levied amid the US-China trade tensions led to a decline in Hong Kong’s exports of goods. Exports of services also saw the largest annual decline on record because the social incidents led to a severe deterioration in inbound tourism. With smaller domestic and re-export-induced demand, imports of goods and services also worsened. On a net basis, net trade contributed positively to GDP in 2019 (Chart 1) because total imports declined even faster than total exports.\n\nIn view of the strong economic headwinds, the Government introduced several rounds of measures between August and December 2019 to alleviate the financial burden of residents, safeguard jobs and support enterprises, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as well as those in the hard-hit sectors, such as retail, food services, transport and tourism. To allow banks to be more supportive to the domestic economy and help mitigate the economic cycle, the HKMA announced on 14 October a reduction in the Countercyclical Capital Buffer ratio of banks from 2.5% to 2.0%, thereby providing banks with more flexibility to release HK$200–300 billion in bank credit to enterprises including SMEs, and also established a Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism. A new relief measure for the 80% Guarantee product of the SME Financing Guarantee Scheme (SFGS) was introduced in September, allowing SME borrowers facing weakening cash flows to apply for principal moratorium to get immediate support. Further, a new 90% loan guarantee product under the SFGS was introduced in December to provide additional support to SMEs, businesses with relatively less operating experience, as well as professionals seeking to set up their own practices, to obtain financing.\n\n# Monetary conditions\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate and money markets functioned in a smooth and orderly manner in 2019. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained broadly stable throughout the year. As the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking was triggered in March, the HKMA purchased Hong Kong dollars from, and sold US dollars to, banks at the rate of HK$7.85/US$1, leading to a decline in the Aggregate Balance in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System. The Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained largely steady at the longer end, while short-term rates generally picked up. At the retail level, several retail banks lowered their Best Lending Rates by 12.5 basis points in late October following the decreases in the target range for the US federal funds rate. As for monetary aggregates, total bank loans increased by 6.7% in 2019, up from 4.4% in 2018, and total deposits grew by 2.9% during the year.\n\n# Inflation\n\nThe underlying inflation rate, which nets out the effects of the Government’s one-off relief measures, rose slightly to 3.0% in 2019, from 2.6% in 2018. The mild increase in inflation was mainly driven by the elevated pork prices due to the disrupted supply of fresh pork since May (Chart 2). Excluding basic food items, price pressures were held at moderate levels throughout the year. In particular, the housing component of consumer price inflation softened in tandem with an earlier consolidation of fresh-letting private residential rentals. More broadly, the mild growth in nominal wages and the slower increase in commercial rentals1 helped keep local business costs in check. Externally, import price inflation moderated, in line with lower inflation in some of Hong Kong’s major import sources amid slower global economic growth.\n\n# Labour market\n\nThe labour market remained broadly resilient in the first half of 2019 but faced mounting pressures in the second half (Chart 3). After staying at a multi-year low of 2.8% in the first two quarters, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose to 2.9% in the third quarter and 3.3% in the final quarter, with those for the consumption and tourism-related sectors recording even more visible rises amid the social incidents. Overall labour demand also shrank visibly in the latter part of the year as total employment and the number of privatesector vacancies fell. The reduction in labour demand was particularly prominent in the retail, accommodation and food services sectors, as well as import/export trade and construction sectors. On the supply side, the labour force participation rate edged down, partly due to a cyclical response to the economic recession. As the labour market came under increasing pressures, growth in nominal wage and earnings showed signs of a slowdown towards the end of the year.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe local stock market experienced sharp fluctuations during 2019. After a market rally in the first four months, the Hang Seng Index plunged in May due in part to concerns about the re-escalation of the US-China trade tensions (Chart 4). While recouping some lost ground in June in response to major central banks’ signals of a more accommodative monetary stance, stock prices came under pressure again amid slowing global economic growth and local social incidents. Towards the end of the year, stock prices regained some upward momentum following the announcement of a “phase one” trade agreement between the US and Mainland China. The Hang Seng Index finished the year at 28,190, registering an overall gain of 9.1% for the year. By contrast, the average daily turnover declined by about 19% from a year earlier. The listings of a major Mainland tech company and a leading beer manufacturer helped expand equity funds raised through initial public offerings (IpOs) to HK$314.2 billion in 2019. Hong Kong ranked first globally in terms of funds raised through IpOs for a second straight year in 2019.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market staged a strong rebound in the first five months of 2019 but generally softened in the remainder of the year. Market sentiment improved in early 2019 partly because concerns over US-China trade tensions temporarily eased, but the sentiment was dampened afterwards by the re-escalated US-China trade tensions, prolonged social incidents and weakened domestic economic conditions. Overall housing prices moderated by 5% from the peak in May through December, though still recording an annual growth of 5% due to a 10% rebound in the first five months (Chart 4). Transaction volume in 2019 increased by 4% to 59,797 units from a year earlier, reflecting the strong trading activities in the early part of the year. Housing affordability remained stretched, with the price-toincome ratio and the income-gearing ratio staying high at 17.9 and 80.9 respectively, far above their long-term averages.2 To assist home buyers with immediate housing needs, the Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation (HKMC) in mid-October raised the cap on the value of completed residential properties eligible for a mortgage loan under the Mortgage Insurance programme.3 On the other hand, the non-residential property market faced stronger downward pressures in 2019. In particular, both prices and rentals for retail premises registered the largest declines since the global financial crisis in 2008, reflecting the worsening business conditions during the year.\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nHong Kong’s economic performance for 2020 is expected to be very challenging, with significant near-term downside risks associated with the coronavirus outbreak. Some sectors, such as retail, accommodation, food services, tourism and transport, which have yet to recover from the disruptions caused by the social incidents, will be doubly hit. However, the countercyclical fiscal measures announced in the 2020/21 Budget, which include a one-off cash handout and a new concessionary low-interest loan under the SFGS with 100% Government guarantee, are expected to provide some support to the economy, especially households and SMEs. On 16 March 2020, the HKMA further reduced the Countercyclical Capital Buffer ratio of banks from 2.0% to 1.0%, which will allow banks to be more supportive to the domestic economy, in particular those sectors and individuals that are expected to experience additional short-term stress due to the impact arising from the coronavirus outbreak. Analysed by GDP component, private consumption and investment are likely to remain weak because of the fragile consumer and business confidence. While government consumption will contribute to economic growth, public investment expenditure is anticipated to be relatively sluggish following the completion of some major infrastructure projects. On the external front, the “phase one” trade deal between the US and Mainland China is assessed to be slightly positive for the local economy in the short term. However, Hong Kong’s external trade performance will continue to be weighed down by weak global economic growth and trade flows. In particular, the coronavirus outbreak may lead to regional supply chain disruptions and slower cross-border economic activities, in tourism for example, thereby restraining Hong Kong’s exports. The Government forecasts real GDP growth for 2020 in the range of -1.5% to 0.5%, while growth forecasts by international organisations and privatesector analysts averaged -3.3%.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nInflationary pressures are expected to moderate in 2020 because of the sub-par economic conditions, the consolidation of private residential rentals and mild imported inflation. Market consensus forecasts a headline inflation rate for 2020 of 1.8%, and the Government projects the headline and underlying inflation rates to be 1.7% and 2.5% respectively. In the labour market, the unemployment rate is likely to rise further in the near term, given the weakened economic prospects and the coronavirus outbreak. privatesector analysts expect the unemployment rate to rise to about 4.0% in 2020.\n\n# Uncertainties and risks\n\nThe subdued economic outlook for 2020 is subject to a number of uncertainties and risks, including those stemming from the slowing global economy, US-China trade relations, Mainland’s economic performance, local social incidents and the persistence of the coronavirus outbreak. In particular, a prolonged coronavirus outbreak could trigger a more visible global economic slowdown and a repricing of assets, with the resulting unfavourable macroeconomic environment and tighter financial conditions posing further downward pressures on domestic real activities. However, the more concerted effort by major central banks to ease their monetary policies may provide a cushion against the negative economic impact inflicted by the outbreak.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector was resilient in 2019 despite the challenging environment with the global economic slowdown, US-China trade tensions and local social incidents. Bank balance sheet trends were stable, as both loans and deposits grew moderately. The capital and liquidity positions of the banking sector remained solid and asset quality held up well. The banking sector remained profitable with stable average return on asset.\n", "zh": "# 經濟及金融環境\n\n香港經濟於2019年收縮，反映全球經濟放緩、持續的中美貿易摩擦以及本地社會事件的影響。隨著下半年經濟形勢急劇惡化，勞動市場面臨增加的壓力。因為豬肉價格急升，通脹亦有所上升。由於新型冠狀病毒疫情衝擊已經走弱的經濟，預計2020年的經濟表現仍將充滿挑戰。在這困難的經濟環境下，政府和金管局推出多項措施支持經濟，尤其是家庭和中小企。\n\n# 《經濟回顧》\n\n# 實體活動\n\n繼2018年擴展2.9%後，香港經濟於2019年收縮1.2%，為自2009年以來首次年度收縮。特別是，下半年經濟陷入衰退，經季節調整的國內生產總值（GDP）連續在第二、三和第四季度縮小（表1）。經濟活動的下降反映內需顯著收縮（圖1）。由於社會事件在下半年嚴重影響消費活動與情緒，私人消費支出出現自2003年以來的首次年度下降。整體投資支出亦因商業信心降低而下跌。在外部方面，全球經濟增長放慢及因中美貿易爭端而加徵的關稅導致香港貨物出口下降。服務出口亦錄得史上最大年度跌幅，原因是社會事件嚴重惡化了入境遊客數量。由於內需和再出口需求縮減，貨物及服務的進口亦惡化。按淨數計，淨貿易為GDP作出正面貢獻（圖1），因進口總額跌得比出口更快。\n\n面對強烈的經濟逆風，政府於2019年8月至12月期間多次推出措施，減輕居民負擔、保障就業、支持企業，尤以受打擊嚴重的零售、餐飲、交通及旅遊等行業的中小企為重。為讓銀行更好支持本地經濟，並幫助緩和經濟周期，金管局於10月14日宣布將逆周期資本緩衝比率由2.5%降至2.0%，為銀行釋放200至300億港元的信貸提供彈性，並成立銀行業中小企貸款協調機制。9月推出針對“八成信貸擔保產品”的新紓困措施，讓面臨資金流緊張的中小企借款人申請主體展延，以獲得即時支持。12月，再推出“九成信貸擔保產品”為中小企、較少營運經驗的企業以及尋求創業人士提供額外融資支持。\n\n# 貨幣條件\n\n2019年，香港元匯率及貨幣市場運作平穩有序。港元匯率全年基本保持穩定。由於3月觸發弱方兌換保證，金管局按港幣7.85/美元的匯率，向銀行買入港幣、賣出美元，導致聯繫匯率制度設計下的總結餘逐步下降。港元的銀行拆息長端保持大致穩定，短期拆息則普遍升幅。零售層面，幾家零售銀行在10月底跟隨美國聯邦基金利率調整的趨勢，降低最佳貸款利率12.5個基點。就貨幣總額而言，2019年銀行總貸款按年增長6.7%，高於2018年的4.4%，而存款總額則於年內增長2.9%。\n\n# 通脹\n\n扣除政府一次性紓困措施影響的基礎通脹率，2019年微升至3.0%，較2018年的2.6%上升。通脹溫和上升，主要由於豬肉價格由於供應中斷自五月起上升（圖2）。剔除基本食品，全年物價升幅保持適中。特別是，住宅部分隨著早前私人住宅租金調整而進一步穩定；整體而言，名義工資的溫和增長和商業租金的放緩，也有助於控制本地企業成本。外部方面，進口物價漲幅放慢，配合主要進口來源國的通脹降低和全球經濟放緩的趨勢。\n\n# 勞動市場\n\n2019年前半年，勞動市場持續較具韌性，但自下半年起壓力日增（圖3）。經季節調整後的失業率在第一、二季度保持2.8%的多年度低位，三季度升至2.9%，最後一季度升至3.3%，社會事件導致消費和旅遊相關行業的失業數據更為明顯。整體而言，年尾勞動需求明顯收縮，總就業人口和私營部門空缺數量減少。零售、住宿、餐飲、進出口貿易和建築行業受影響尤其嚴重。就供應面來看，勞動參與率有所降低，部分由經濟衰退的循環反應所致。隨著勞動市場壓力加大，名義工資和收入的增長亦顯現放緩跡象。\n\n# 證券市場\n\n2019年，本地股市經歷劇烈波動。經過前四個月的升市，恆生指數在5月大幅下挫，部分原因是市場擔憂中美貿易爭端再次升級（圖4）。雖然6月在主要中央銀行傳出更寬鬆貨幣政策訊號後回穩，股價仍受到全球經濟放緩和本地社會事件影響再次承壓。年底前，股價在美國與內地達成“第一階段”貿易協議公告後略見反彈。恆指全年累計升幅9.1%，收於28,190點。相較之下，日均成交額較去年同期約縮減19%。一個內地科技巨頭的上市和領先的啤酒生產商，使2019年通過首次公開招股（IpO）募集資金達到3142億港元，香港連續第二年在全球IpO募集資金數額中排名第一。\n\n# 地產市場\n\n2019年前五個月，住宅物業市場表現強勁，但在餘下時間普遍趨弱。早期受美中貿易緩和暫時緩解憂慮，但隨後由於爭端再升級、社會事件持續以及本地經濟疲弱，市場情緒轉淡。整體住房價格由5月峰值起到12月，下降約5%，但全年仍錄得5%的年度增長（圖4），主要受五個月內10%的反彈所推動。2019年的成交量比去年同期增加4%，達59,797宗，反映年初的交易活躍。房屋負擔能力仍然偏緊，樓價與收入比率（“樓價收入比”）和收入槓桿比率（“收入槓桿比”）保持高位，分別為17.9和80.9，遠高於長期平均。為協助有迫切住房需求的人士，香港按揭證券有限公司在十月中，擴大符合按揭保險計劃的已完成住宅物業價值上限。另一方面，非住宅物業市場在2019年面對較大壓力，零售用房的價格和租金都出現自2008年全球金融危機以來最大跌幅，顯示商業環境惡化。\n\n# 經濟展望\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n預計2020年香港經濟將面對嚴峻挑戰，並伴隨新冠病毒疫情的重大短期下行風險。部分行業如零售、住宿、餐飲、旅遊及交通，尚未從社會事件引致的干擾中恢復，將受到雙重打擊。但是，2020/21年度預算中宣布的逆周期財政措施，包括一次性現金派發和“中小企融資擔保計劃”下的由政府100%擔保的新低息貸款，有望為經濟提供一些支援，特別是對家庭和中小企。2020年3月16日，金管局再次將銀行的逆周期資本緩衝比率由2.0%降至1.0%，使銀行能更積極支持國內經濟，尤其是在新冠疫情可能引致的短期額外壓力的行業和人士。按GDP組成分析，私人消費和投資料仍偏軟，因消費者和企業信心依然脆弱。政府消費將對經濟增長作出貢獻，但在完成一些重大基建項目後，公共投資預計較為遲緩。外部方面，美中“第一階段”貿易協議短期利多，但全球經濟增長乏力和貿易流動仍將拖累香港的外貿表現。特別是，新冠疫情或引起區域供應鏈中斷及跨境經濟活動放緩，如旅遊，從而限制香港出口。政府預計2020年實質GDP增長介乎-1.5%至0.5%，而國際組織與私營部門分析師的平均預測則約為-3.3%。\n\n# 通脹與勞動市場\n\n預計2020年的通脹壓力會有所緩和，原因包括經濟低迷、私人住宅租金調整和溫和的進口通脹。市場普遍預測2020年整體通脹率為1.8%，政府則估計頭條通脹率約為1.7%，核心通脹率約為2.5%。勞動市場方面，因經濟前景轉差和新冠疫情，失業率短期內可能進一步上升，私營機構分析師預測約升至4.0%。\n\n# 不明朗因素及風險\n\n2020年經濟前景較為謹慎，受多項不確定性和風險影響，包括全球經濟放緩、US-China貿易關係、內地經濟走勢和本地社會事件，以及持續的疫情爆發。特別是，長期疫情可能引發更明顯的全球經濟放緩和資產重估，宏觀經濟環境惡化和金融條件收緊將進一步施壓本地實體經濟活動。不過，各主要中央銀行加大寬鬆貨幣政策力度或能緩衝疫情帶來的負面經濟影響。\n\n# 銀行業表現\n\n儘管面對全球經濟放慢、中美貿易摩擦和本地社會事件的挑戰，香港銀行業在2019年保持韌性。銀行的資產負債表趨勢穩定，貸款和存款均適度增長。行業的資本與流動性狀況依然堅實，資產質素保持良好。銀行業依然盈利，平均資產回報率穩定。"}
{"en": "# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate and money markets functioned in a smooth and orderly manner in 2019. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained stable throughout the year and strengthened to the strong side of the Convertibility Zone towards the end of the year. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, the Linked Exchange Rate System has shown its resilience to shocks time after time.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability. This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n\n- Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks\n\n- Government-issued notes and coins in circulation the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of the clearing account balances of banks kept with the HKMA\n\n- Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs). When the demand for Hong Kong dollars is greater than the supply and the market exchange rate strengthens to the strong-side CU of HK$7.75 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to sell Hong Kong dollars to banks for US dollars upon request. The Aggregate Balance will then expand to push down Hong Kong dollar interest rates, creating monetary conditions that move the Hong Kong dollar away from the strong-side limit to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if the supply of Hong Kong dollars is greater than demand and the market exchange rate weakens to the weak-side CU of HK$7.85 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to buy Hong Kong dollars from banks upon request. The Aggregate Balance will then contract to drive Hong Kong dollar interest rates up, pushing the Hong Kong dollar away from the weak-side limit to stay within the Convertibility Zone.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2019\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nDespite uncertainties in the external environment and a slowdown in the domestic economy, the Hong Kong dollar remained stable and traded in a smooth and orderly manner in 2019. In the beginning of the year, the widening negative Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads attracted carry trade activities of selling Hong Kong dollars for US dollars, pushing the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate towards the weak-side CU of 7.85 (Chart 1). As the weakening of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate continued, the weak-side CU was eventually triggered eight times in March. Thereafter, the Hong Kong dollar continued to stay near the weak-side CU rate of 7.85. Since late May, the strong Hong Kong dollar demand arising from sizeable initial public offering (IPO) activities, corporates’ demand for dividend payment and the half-year closing had led the Hong Kong dollar to strengthen. While the Hong Kong dollar drifted lower after the half-year mark, it regained momentum from late October and stayed in the strong side of the Convertibility Zone towards the end of the year. This reflected partly equity-related demand including IPOs, and partly the unwinding of short Hong Kong dollar positions due to tightened liquidity near the year end. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market functioned normally throughout 2019.\n\nDue to the triggering of the weak-side CU, the total of the Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding EFBNs declined from HK$1,136.2 billion at the end of 2018 to HK$1,133.0 billion at the end of 2019 (Chart 2). During the year, the HKMA purchased a total of HK$22.1 billion at the request of banks at the weak-side CU of 7.85 in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), leading to a contraction of the Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) from HK$76.4 billion at the end of 2018 to HK$54.3 billion at the end of 2019. The outstanding EFBNs increased slightly from HK$1,059.8 billion to HK$1,078.7 billion during the year, reflecting the issuance of EFBNs to absorb EFBNs’ interest payments according to the established practice. The Monetary Base as a whole remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves. Total Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and Notes at HK$1,133 billion at end-2019.\n\n# Money market\n\nDuring 2019, the Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained largely steady at the longer end, while short-term rates broadly picked up (Chart 3). Short-term rates also experienced more fluctuations driven by IpO-related funding demand and seasonal liquidity needs. The reduction in the Aggregate Balance since April 2018 may have led to a higher sensitivity of the Hong Kong dollar interbank rates to changes in the supply and demand of Hong Kong dollar funding in the local market.\n\nThe Base Rate was adjusted downwards on 1 August, 19 September and 31 October by a total of 75 basis points, from 2.75% at the end of 2018 to 2.00% in early November, as the target range for the US federal funds rate moved downward three times by a total of 75 basis points from 2.25–2.50% to 1.50–1.75% during the year. On 18–26 November and 19–31 December, the Base Rate was set higher than 2.00%, reflecting a marked upward trend of the overnight and one-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs) in the last two months of the year. As such, the Base Rate closed at 2.49% at the end of 2019. The adjustment of the Base Rate was in accordance with the revised formula announced on 26 March 2009, which sets the Base Rate at either 50 basis points above the lower bound of the prevailing target range for the US federal funds rate or the average of the five-day moving averages of the overnight and one-month HIBORs, whichever is the higher. On the retail front, several retail banks lowered their Best Lending Rates by 12.5 basis points following the decrease in the target range for the US federal funds rate in late October.\n\nThe discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points widened during the first two months, broadly tracking the movements of the Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads, with the 12-month Hong Kong dollar forward points reaching about -708 pips in mid-February (Chart 4). Thereafter, along with the narrowing of the negative Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads, the discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points narrowed gradually and turned to premiums towards the end of the year. Overall, Hong Kong’s money markets operated in an orderly manner. Discount Window borrowing decreased to HK$38.3 billion in 2019 from HK$40.2 billion in 2018.\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nThe LERS has contributed significantly to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability for more than three decades and has shown its resilience in multiple regional and global financial crises. Against the backdrop of social incidents happening during the year, a number of unfounded rumours casting doubt on the LERS and financial stability of Hong Kong circulated in the social media. The HKMA acted promptly and vigorously to rebut the rumours and reassure the public through the use of both traditional and social media, reiterating that the LERS would remain in place and Hong Kong would not impose foreign exchange or capital controls. In addition, the HKMA issued a number of articles to help the public understand the LERS operation, the flow of funds and the interest rate outlook. These efforts were effective in maintaining public confidence in the LERS, as evidenced by the orderly functioning of the markets throughout the year. The Government is also firmly committed to the LERS. public confidence in the Government’s commitment and the use of the Hong Kong dollar as a means of payment and storage of value were further reinforced by the stability in the foreign exchange and money markets. In its 2019 Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund reaffirmed its long-standing support for the LERS as an anchor of Hong Kong’s financial stability, and commented that the LERS remained the appropriate exchange rate arrangement for Hong Kong underpinned by Hong Kong’s transparent rules, ample fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy, and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nA robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS. Hong Kong’s banking system is highly liquid and sound, with liquidity positions and capitalisation being well above the minimum international standards. To ensure the resilience of the banking sector, the HKMA has been closely monitoring banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and has maintained its supervisory efforts on corporate, propertyrelated and Mainland-related lending. With a smaller Aggregate Balance relative to previous years, banks have in general strengthened their liquidity management arrangements and have been more proactive in managing their day-to-day funding positions. Furthermore, the HKMA has maintained close dialogue with banks to ensure smooth recycling of liquidity in the market, especially ahead of and during the subscription periods of large IPOs. No settlement gridlocks were noted during the year, with the Discount Window continuing to function effectively and efficiently.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) moved within a range of 109.9–112.1% during 2019, without touching the Upper or Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 111.2% on 31 December (Chart 5). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. In the event of abrupt shocks, the sizeable amount of financial resources of the Exchange Fund, together with Hong Kong’s robust banking system, will provide powerful support to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\n# Other activities\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong. In 2019, the CBC considered issues including an event study on the LERS operations, the relationship between the Aggregate Balance and interest rates in Hong Kong, an improved and more flexible approach to options markets’ views about the LERS, and the impact of future IPOs on HIBORs. Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Research\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMR), formerly the Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research, pursues research studies on topics in monetary policy, banking and finance that are policy relevant. This is reflected in the wide array of topics explored by HKIMR researchers and overseas visitors and in its conferences and events. The HKIMR collaborates with major central banks and policy institutions to jointly organise policy-focused conferences. Its research visiting programmes support research projects on policy issues that are of importance to the HKMA, Hong Kong and the region.\n\nIn 2019, the HKIMR hosted 14 research scholars, published 17 working papers, and held 11 public seminars covering a broad range of economic, monetary and financial issues. It also organised three international conferences:\n\n- The Tenth Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy, titled “China’s Financial Reforms and Economic Transformation”, was held on 10–11 January in Hong Kong, organised jointly by the HKIMR, the Financial Research Institute of the people’s Bank of China and the Research Institute of Finance of the Development Research Centre of the State Council. The conference provided a world-class forum for economic experts from central banks, international institutions, academia and the financial industry to discuss issues related to the risks that Mainland’s financial sector faced in the light of changes introduced by financial reforms and Mainland’s economic development.\n", "zh": "# 貨幣穩定\n\n2019年，香港美元匯率與貨幣市場運行順暢有序。港幣匯率全年保持穩定，並在年末升值至兌換區域的強勢一側。作為香港貨幣與金融穩定的基石，聯繫匯率制度已反覆展現其抗震能力。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的首要目標是保本先行、長期增值。這一目標被定義為港幣在外匯市場與美元之間的匯率穩定，處於HK$7.75–7.85對US$1的波動範圍內。貨幣制度的結構特點是貨幣局制度，要求貨幣基礎的至少100%由外匯基金持有的美元儲備支持，且貨幣基礎的變動必須由相應的美元儲備變動百分之百匹配。\n\n貨幣基礎（表格1）包括：\n\n- 負債證書，為三家發鈔行所發行的鈔票提供完全支持\n\n- 政府發行的流通紙幣與硬幣\n\n- 總結餘，即由金管局持有的銀行結算帳戶餘額總和\n\n- 由金管局代表政府發行的外匯基金票據及債券（EFBNs）\n\n港幣匯率的穩定通過自動利率調整機制和金管局履行兌換承諾（CU）的堅定承諾來維持。當港幣需求超過供應，且市場匯率升值至強勢CU的HK$7.75對US$1時，金管局準備應需求向銀行出售港幣兌換美元。此時，總結餘將擴大以降低港幣利率，形成貨幣條件，將港幣推離強勢限制，進入HK$7.75–7.85的兌換區域。反之，如果港幣供過於求，市場匯率下跌至弱勢CU的HK$7.85對US$1，金管局準備應需求從銀行購買港幣。這將收縮總結餘，推高港幣利率，使港幣遠離弱勢限制，保持在兌換區域內。\n\n# 2019年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n儘管外部環境存在不確定性及國內經濟放緩，2019年港幣仍保持穩定，有序運行。年初，港幣對美元之間的利差擴大，吸引套息交易活動，即售出港幣換美元，推動港幣匯率向HK$7.85的弱勢CU水平（圖1）發展。隨著港幣匯率持續下跌，弱勢CU在三月被觸發八次。其後，港幣持續在HK$7.85附近徘徊。自五月底以來，由於首次公開募股（IPO）活動較多、企業派息需求和半年底結算，港幣需求增加，促使匯率升值。儘管半年度之後港幣有所回落，但自十月下旬起逐步恢復升勢，到年底在兌換區域的強勢一側保持穩定。這部分反映股票市場的需求，包括IPO，部分則是因年末流動性緊縮而解除空頭倉位。\n\n由於弱勢CU的觸發，2018年底的總結餘（折扣窗口前）及未償還EFBNs由HK$1,136.2億下降至HK$1,133.0億（圖2）。年內，金管局應銀行要求，以HK$7.85的弱勢CU出售了總計HK$221億元，按照聯繫匯率制度（LERS）設計，導致折扣窗口前的總結餘由HK$764億元收縮到HK$543億元。年中未償還EFBNs略增至HK$1,059.8億，至年末HK$1,078.7億，反映按慣例發行EFBNs以吸收利息支出。貨幣基礎整體仍由外匯儲備完全支持。年末，總結餘（折扣窗口前）與未償還的外匯基金票據及債券合計HK$1,133億。\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n2019年，港幣銀行間拆息利率在長端大致保持穩定，短期拆息則普遍上升（圖3）。短期利率波動較大，受IPO相關融資需求和季節性流動性需要影響。自2018年4月起，貨幣基礎的下降可能使港幣銀行間拆息對本地市場港幣資金供需變動更敏感。\n\n基準利率於8月1日、9月19日及10月31日分別調降，合共75個基點，從2018年年底的2.75%降至11月初的2.00%。同期，美國聯邦基金利率目標區間在2019年內三次調低，共75個基點，從2.25–2.50%降至1.50–1.75%。11月18日至26日及12月19日至31日，基準利率被調高至高於2.00%，反映去年底至年末隔夜及一個月拆息（HIBOR）明顯上升的趨勢。由此，2019年末，基準利率定在2.49%。基準利率的調整符合2009年3月26日公布的修訂公式，即以美國聯邦基金利率目標區間的下限上方50個基點或隔夜及一個月HIBOR的五天移動平均值較高者作為設定標準。在零售方面，幾家零售銀行在10月下旬美國聯邦基金利率目標區間下調後，也同步調低最優惠貸款利率12.5個基點。\n\n港幣遠期點數的貼現在前兩個月內擴大，主要追蹤港幣對美元的利差變動，12個月遠期點數於2月中旬約達-708點（圖4）。隨後，隨著港幣對美元利差縮窄，貼現逐步缩小並轉為溢價至年底。整體而言，香港貨幣市場有序運行。2019年，折扣窗口借款由HK$4,020億元降至HK$3,830億元。\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n聯繫匯率制度為香港的貨幣與金融穩定作出了重要貢獻，長達三十餘年，並在多次區域及全球金融危機中展現韌性。今年，社會事件引發一些毫無根據的謠言，質疑LERS及香港的金融穩定。金管局迅速且有力地駁斥謠言，並通過傳統媒體與社交媒體重申，LERS將持續存在，香港不會實施外匯或資本管制。同時，金管局發表多篇文章幫助公眾理解LERS的運作、資金流動及利率前景。這些措施有效維持了公眾對LERS的信心，市場也得以有序運作。政府亦堅定支持LERS。外匯及貨幣市場的穩定進一步增強了公眾對政府承諾，以港幣作為支付及儲值手段的信心。在與國際貨幣基金組織的2019年第四條磋商中，該組織重申長期支持LERS，認為LERS是香港貨幣穩定的適當匯率安排，並強調其基於香港透明規則、充足的財政與外匯儲備、嚴格的金融監管、彈性經濟及審慎財政框架。\n\n健全的銀行體系對LERS的正常運作至關重要。香港的銀行系統高度流動且穩健，流動性狀況與資本充足率遠高於國際最低標準。為確保銀行業的韌性，金管局密切監控銀行在信貸、流動性及利率風險管理方面，並進行壓力測試，持續督促企業、物業及內地相關貸款的監管工作。在貨幣基礎較前幾年縮小的情況下，銀行普遍加強了流動性管理安排，並更加積極管理日常融資需求。此外，金管局與銀行保持密切對話，確保市場流動性順暢循環，特別是在大型IPO的認購期前後。全年未出現結算阻滯，折扣窗口運作有效高效。\n\n為提高貨幣局帳戶的透明度，自1998年10月起，部分外匯基金資產被指定支持貨幣基礎。2019年，Backing Ratio（支持資產除以貨幣基礎）在109.9–112.1%之間浮動，未接觸上下觸發水平。截至12月31日，該比率為111.2%（圖5）。在LERS下，雖然特定外匯基金資產被用於支持Backing組合，但所有外匯基金資產皆可用於支持港幣匯率。面對突發震盪，外匯基金的豐厚資源及堅韌的銀行體系將為香港的貨幣與金融穩定提供有力支援。\n\n# 其他活動\n\n外匯基金咨詢委員會的貨幣局子委員會（CBC）監控並審議與香港貨幣與金融穩定相關的議題。2019年，CBC討論了包括LERS運作的事件研究、總結餘與港幣利率的關係、對期權市場LERS預期的改進及更具彈性的做法，以及未來IPO對HIBOR的影響。關於這些議題，CBC討論記錄與外匯基金運作報告均於金管局網站公布。\n\n# 研究\n\n香港金融研究中心（HKIMR），前身為香港金融研究所，專注於貨幣政策、銀行與金融相關政策議題的研究，並與國內外知名央行及政策機構合作組織相關政策會議。其研究交流計劃支持關乎金管局、香港及區域重要政策問題的研究項目。\n\n2019年，HKIMR接待了14名研究學者，發表了17篇研究論文，舉辦了11場公開研討會，涵蓋經濟、貨幣和金融諸多議題。同年，還舉辦了三場國際會議：\n\n- 第十屆中國經濟年度國際研討會，題為「中國的金融改革與經濟轉型」，於1月10日至11日在香港舉行，由HKIMR、人民銀行金融研究所與國務院發展研究中心金融研究所聯合主辦。該會議為中央銀行、國際機構、學術界及金融業的專家提供了國際一流平台，討論由金融改革帶來的風險及中國經濟發展下的金融挑戰。"}
{"en": "# Banking Stability\n\nThe banking sector in Hong Kong remained sound and stable in 2019, notwithstanding the headwinds brought by the weakening global and local economies. Thanks to the concerted efforts of the industry, the banking sector continued to operate normally amidst the social events. Efforts were taken to ensure that inconvenience caused to the public was kept to a minimum. During the year, the HKMA focused its supervision on the credit and liquidity risk management of authorized institutions. In view of escalating cyber threats and the industry’s growing dependency on technology, the HKMA stepped up the supervision of authorized institutions’ technology risk management. On conduct supervision, the HKMA streamlined its investor protection measures to enhance customer experience while according protection to customers. We also enhanced consumer protection in digital financial services and continued to promote a customer-centric corporate culture.\n\nOn anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT), 2019 marked the conclusion of the Financial Action Task Force’s Fourth Round Mutual Evaluation of Hong Kong’s AML/CFT regime, which was assessed as compliant and effective overall, and earned positive recognition particularly for the banking sector’s good understanding of risks and the HKMA’s risk-based supervisory work in AML/CFT. The HKMA has continued to participate in the public-private partnership for intelligence sharing on fraud and money laundering, and its active support for the adoption of AML/CFT regulatory technology in the banking sector.\n\nOn banking development, the HKMA granted banking licences to eight virtual banks in 2019 and announced a three-phased approach to facilitate the development of green and sustainable banking in Hong Kong. The HKMA has been in close collaboration with the banking industry to optimise supervisory policies and processes and to carry out capacity-building initiatives that facilitate talent development.\n\nMeanwhile, substantial progress was made on the local implementation of international supervisory standards, including capital adequacy standards, disclosure standards, liquidity standards and large exposure standards. The HKMA also continued its work to ensure there would be a credible resolution regime for authorized institutions, including implementing rules on loss-absorbing capacity requirements to enhance the resolvability of authorized institutions.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this objective is contingent upon the financial system being highly resilient and capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their businesses and, in extremis, by failing in a disorderly manner. The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring banks are resilient to shocks and are able to recover their positions in response to crises, ultimately helping to prevent failures. The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks in Hong Kong. It is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs). The Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs).\n\nHowever, the Monetary Authority cannot ensure, nor is the Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework designed to ensure, a zero-risk financial system. Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that, in the event of an AI becoming non-viable, its failure can be managed in an orderly manner. To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong has been established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs. To ensure that the resolution regime in Hong Kong is operational, it is important to lay down resolution legislation and policy standards, undertake resolution planning to remove impediments to AIs’ resolvability and develop the HKMA’s operational capability to resolve a failing AI. In order to carry out these tasks effectively, the HKMA adopts an internationally harmonised and co-ordinated approach.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2019\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nIn 2019, 196 off-site reviews were conducted covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL rating assessment, corporate governance, risk management and fintech strategies. As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance, 26 meetings were held with the boards of directors or board-level committees of AIs. Furthermore, 32 tripartite meetings were held among the HKMA, the AIs and their external auditors.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA conducts regular on-site examinations supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk. A total of 405 on-site examinations and thematic reviews were conducted during the year. Credit risk management remained a key focus of these examinations and reviews. Another major focus was in technology risk and operational risk management. The HKMA also increased the number of on-site examinations and thematic reviews targeted at liquidity and market risk management as well as the implementation of the Basel capital adequacy framework. At the same time, specialist teams performed on-site examinations and thematic reviews of AIs’ activities in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses.\n\nTable 1 contains an overall summary of the HKMA’s supervisory activities in 2019.\n\n# Supervision of credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nBank lending increased moderately in 2019. Total loans grew by 6.7%, compared with 4.4% in 2018. As shown in Table 2, loans for use in Hong Kong and loans for use outside Hong Kong registered growth of 7.7% and 5.8% respectively.\n\nMainland-related lending grew by 7.4% to HK$4,564 billion as at the end of 2019 (Table 3).\n\nThe asset quality of AIs remained healthy. Retail banks’ classified loan ratio edged down from 0.51% at the end of 2018 to 0.48% at the end of 2019, well below the long-run historical average of 2% since 2000. For the banking industry as a whole, the classified loan ratio increased slightly from 0.55% to 0.57%. Specifically in terms of Mainland-related lending, retail banks’ classified loan ratio increased from 0.63% in 2018 to 0.79% in 2019, which was still low by historical standard. For the banking industry as a whole, the ratio increased to 0.75% from 0.55% a year ago.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA devoted increased supervisory efforts in ensuring that AIs continued to adopt prudent credit risk management standards amid the uncertain economic environment. Solvency stress tests were enhanced to incorporate more comprehensive risk coverage and more severe stress assumptions. The results of the enhanced stress tests continued to indicate that banks generally had sufficient capital buffers to withstand extreme shocks. Targeted and thematic examinations were conducted to evaluate the credit risk management practices of AIs in different areas, such as lending to corporates engaged in high-risk business, complex financing arrangements, and collateralised lending to private banking and wealth management customers. Recognising that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) would more likely face greater challenges during economic downturns, the HKMA established a Banking Sector SME Lending Co-ordination Mechanism in October, with a view to encouraging banks to continue to support SMEs’ financing needs to the extent permitted by prudent risk management principles.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nThe resilience of the Hong Kong banking sector to withstand a downturn in the property market has been strengthened significantly by the eight rounds of countercyclical macro-prudential measures introduced by the HKMA since 2009. The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of new residential mortgage loans fell to 53% in December 2019 from 64% in September 2009, before the countercyclical measures were first introduced. The average debt servicing ratio (DSR) of new mortgages also decreased to 36% in December 2019 from 41% in August 2010, when a cap on DSR was first applied (Chart 1).\n\n# Supervision of operational and technology risk\n\nThe HKMA adopts a three-phased approach to implement the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework under the Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative (CFI). phase One assessment, involving all the major banks, was completed in 2018. The remaining AIs covered in the second and third phases have substantially completed the assessment as scheduled. The HKMA has also embarked on a comprehensive review of the CFI to fine-tune the initiative given the experience gained in the past years.\n\nIn October, the HKMA issued a revised Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module on “Risk Management of E-banking”. The revision sought to provide the industry with greater flexibility to meet changing customer expectations on electronic banking services. The HKMA also published a set of high-level principles on the use of artificial intelligence in order to provide guidance for the industry.\n\nSince the social events started in June, the HKMA have maintained close dialogue with the industry to monitor the impact on banking operations and services. Banks were requested to replenish automated teller machines (ATMs) more frequently and repair vandalised facilities as soon as practicable. The HKMA also acted quickly to refute malicious rumours that sought to undermine the public’s confidence in the banking system. Thanks to concerted efforts by the banking industry, the affected bank branches and facilities quickly resumed normal services and the inconvenience caused to the public was kept to a minimum. In view of the rising operational risk posed by the social events, banks were asked to take additional precautionary measures to strengthen their operational resilience.\n\n# Supervision of liquidity and market risk management\n\nDuring the year, a round of thematic reviews was conducted to assess AIs’ capability to cope with liquidity shocks. The reviews focused on the robustness of AIs’ liquidity stress testing programmes and contingency funding management. The HKMA also assessed AIs’ compliance with the regulatory requirements on the calculation of the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) to ensure the prudence and accuracy of the inputs used for the calculation.\n\nAs algorithmic trading gained popularity in the banking industry, the HKMA conducted a round of thematic reviews to evaluate AIs’ risk management practices in this area. Considering that the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) might cease to be published after end-2021, the HKMA reminded AIs to get prepared for the transition to alternative reference rates and conducted a survey to monitor their preparedness for the transition.\n\n# Combating money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF)\n\nThe HKMA carries out risk-based supervision of AIs’ AML/CFT systems. During the year, 18 on-site examinations and 61 off-site reviews were conducted, including targeted thematic reviews on private banking and the governance of the use of new technology. The HKMA shared with the industry the observations and best practices drawn from a thematic review of AIs’ application of risk-based AML/CFT controls for SMEs, in order to assist AIs to adopt appropriate account opening processes and delivery of services for SMEs.\n\n# Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Mutual Evaluation (ME) Report on Hong Kong\n\nA highlight of 2019 for the HKMA and Hong Kong’s overall AML/CFT regime was the publication of the FATF ME Report on Hong Kong in September. The Report represents one of the best overall results to date in the FATF’s fourth-round ME of its member jurisdictions. Hong Kong scored six “Substantial” ratings out of 11 “Immediate Outcomes” in the assessment of the effectiveness of its AML/CFT regime, and a high mark for the technical compliance aspect of the ME.\n\nThe Report favourably assessed the HKMA’s risk-based approach to AML/CFT supervision, noting that the HKMA had a good understanding of ML/TF risks in the banking sector and a reasonable understanding of risks in the stored value facility (SVF) sector. The Report also positively assessed the collective AML/CFT efforts of the banking sector, such as the increased use of data analytics by larger AIs, the fact that the great majority of suspicious transaction reports were filed by AIs, and the sector’s proactive participation in the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce (FMLIT).\n\nThe Report recommended several areas for improvement, including the understanding of some higher-risk areas, such as foreign corruption and tax crimes, and developing sectors such as SVFs. Work has already started to address these recommendations; the HKMA published an updated ML/TF Risk Assessment on the SVF sector in July and has commenced thematic on-site examinations on private banking and the governance of the use of new technology.\n", "zh": "# 銀行體系穩定性\n\n儘管面對全球和本地經濟疲弱帶來的阻力，香港的銀行業在2019年仍然保持穩健和穩定。多虧行業的共同努力，銀行業在社會事件中繼續正常運作，並採取措施將對公眾造成的不便降至最低。年內，金管局專注於認可機構的信貸和流動性風險管理。在網絡威脅升級及行業日益依賴科技的背景下，金管局加強了對認可機構科技風險管理的監管。在行為監管方面，金管局優化投資者保護措施，以提升客戶體驗並保障客戶權益。同時，我們亦加強了數碼金融服務的消費者保障，並持續推動以客為本的企業文化。\n\n關於打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集（AML/CFT），2019年標誌著財務行動特別組織（FATF）對香港AML/CFT制度的第四輪相互評估的結束，評估結果整體符合及有效，特別獲得正面肯定的是銀行業對風險的良好理解以及金管局在AML/CFT的風險為本監管工作。金管局持續參與打擊詐騙及洗錢的公共私營合作夥伴關係，並積極支持銀行業採用AML/CFT監管科技。\n\n在銀行發展方面，金管局2019年授予8家虛擬銀行牌照，並公布一個三階段策略，以促進香港綠色和永續金融的發展。金管局與銀行業緊密合作，優化監管政策與流程，並推行能力建設措施，促進人才發展。\n\n同時，香港在國際監管標準的本地實施方面取得了重大進展，包括資本充足標準、披露標準、流動性標準和大額風險承擔標準。金管局亦持續努力，確保認可機構擁有可信的處置制度，包括執行有助於提升可處置性的虧損吸收能力（LAC）規則。\n\n# 目標\n\n金管局的總體目標是促進銀行系統的安全與穩定。實現此目標的關鍵在於金融系統具有高韌性，能夠提供香港經濟所需的關鍵金融服務。\n\n銀行可以通過其業務運作方式影響系統穩定性，在極端情況下甚至可能因失序而引發問題。作為監管機構，金融管理專員在保障金融穩定中扮演關鍵角色，確保銀行具有韌性以抵禦沖擊，並能在危機中恢復，從而幫助預防銀行失敗。金融管理專員負責香港銀行的審慎監管，包括認可持牌銀行、限制牌照銀行及存款公司（合稱認可機構（AIs））的核准，以及某些金融市場基建（FMIs）的指定和監管。\n\n然而，金融管理專員無法確保，亦非香港的審慎監管架構旨在確保零風險的金融體系。而作為處置機關，金管局的目標是確保在認可機構陷入非生存狀態時，其失敗能夠有序處理。為此，香港已建立金融機構處置制度，金管局在其中擔任處置權責人。為讓香港的處置制度有效運作，須制定處置立法和政策標準、進行處置規劃以消除認可機構的可處置性障礙，以及提升金管局的操作能力，以便處理失敗的認可機構。為了有效完成這些任務，金管局採用國際協調一致的方法進行。\n\n# 2019年回顧\n\n# 監管活動概述\n\n2019年，金管局進行了196次離岸審查，涵蓋範疇廣泛，包括CAMEL評級評估、公司治理、風險管理及金融科技策略。為了促進更強的風險治理，金管局與認可機構董事會或董事委員會舉行了26次會議，又與認可機構及其外部審計師進行了32次三方面會議。\n\n除離岸活動外，金管局定期進行現場審查，並針對較高風險範疇進行專題審查。年內共展開405次現場審查和專題評核。信貸風險管理仍是審查的重點，另一大焦點則是科技風險和營運風險管理。金管局亦增加了針對流動性和市場風險管理，以及落實《巴塞爾協定三》的現場審查和專題評核次數。同期，專家團隊亦進行了證券、投資產品、保險及強積金（MPF）相關企業的現場審查和專題評核。\n\n表1總結了2019年金管局的整體監管活動。\n\n# 信貸風險監管\n\n# 信貸增長與資產質素\n\n2019年，銀行貸款溫和增長。總貸款同比增加6.7%，較2018年的4.4%有所提升。見表2，使用於香港和用於香港以外的貸款分別錄得7.7%和5.8%的增長。\n\n內地相關貸款截至2019年底升至HK$4.564兆，增長7.4%（見表3）。\n\n認可機構的資產質素保持良好。零售銀行的分類貸款比率由2018年底的0.51%下降至2019年底的0.48%，遠低於自2000年以來的長期平均2%。整體銀行業的分類貸款比率由0.55%略升至0.57%。就內地相關貸款而言，零售銀行的分類貸款比率由2018年的0.63%升至2019年的0.79%，仍屬較低水平，整體行業比率由0.55%升至0.75%。\n\n年內，金管局加大監管努力，確保認可機構在經濟不確定的環境下仍採取審慎的信貸風險管理標準。增強的償付能力壓力測試加入更全面的風險範圍和更嚴格的情境假設。測試結果顯示銀行普遍擁有足夠的資本緩衝以應對極端沖擊。針對性和專題性審查亦展開，評估不同範疇認可機構的信貸風險管理實踐，包括向高風險業務企業提供貸款、複雜融資安排，以及向私人銀行和財富管理客戶提供有抵押貸款的情況。認識到中小企在經濟下行時更易面臨挑戰，金管局於10月成立了銀行業中小企貸款協調機制，鼓勵銀行繼續支持中小企的融資需求，前提是符合審慎風險管理原則。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n自2009年起，金管局推出八輪逆周期宏觀審慎措施，顯著增強香港銀行業抗下行能力。新住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數（LTV）由2009年9月的64%降至2019年12月的53%，而在首次實施逆周期措施前的2009年9月，比例為64%。新按揭的平均負債還款比率（DSR）亦由2010年8月的41%降至2019年12月的36%（見圖1）。\n\n# 營運及科技風險監管\n\n金管局採用三階段策略推行網絡防衛評估框架，根據《網絡防衛計劃》（CFI）逐步展開。其中，第一階段涵蓋所有主要銀行，已於2018年完成。第二及第三階段的認可機構基本按計劃完成評估。金管局亦對CFI進行全面檢討，以根據過去幾年的經驗調整措施。\n\n10月，金管局發布修訂的《監管政策手冊》（SPM）“電子銀行風險管理”模組，旨在提供更大彈性以配合客戶對電子銀行服務的日益變化的期望。同時，亦發布有關人工智能運用的高層原則，為行業提供指引。\n\n自6月社會事件開始，金管局與業界保持密切對話，監察其對銀行運作及服務的影響。銀行被要求更頻繁地補充自動櫃員機（ATM），並盡快修復破壞的設施。金管局亦迅速反駁不良謠言，防止對公眾信心造成打擊。在銀行業、受影響的分行及設施的共同努力下，服務迅速恢復正常，將對公眾造成的不便降至最低。考慮到社會事件帶來的營運風險上升，銀行亦被要求採取額外預防措施以加強運作韌性。\n\n# 流動性及市場風險管理監管\n\n年內，金管局進行了針對認可機構應對流動性沖擊能力的專題評核，重點關注流動性壓力測試方案的完備性及應急資金管理。亦評估了銀行符合流動性覆蓋比率（LCR）計算規定的情況，確保計算輸入數據的審慎性及準確性。\n\n隨著程式交易在銀行業的普及，金管局展開了資訊科技範疇的專題評核，評估認可機構的風險管理實踐。考慮到英國倫敦銀行同業拆息（LIBOR）或將在2022年底停止公布，金管局提醒銀行為轉型至其他備用參考利率作好準備，並展開調查以監察其準備情況。\n\n# 打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集（ML/TF）\n\n金管局採用風險為本的監管方法，對認可機構的AML/CFT系統進行監督。年內，展開了18次現場審查及61次離岸審查，包括針對私人銀行及新技術治理的專題審查。金管局亦與行業分享針對中小企採用風險為本AML/CFT控制的專題審查經驗及最佳實踐，協助機構改進開戶流程及服務品質。\n\n# 財務行動特別組織（FATF）對香港的相互評估（ME）報告\n\n2019年，金管局和香港整體AML/CFT制度的重要亮點是9月發布的FATF對香港的ME報告。此報告是FATF第四輪相互評估中最佳的整體成績之一，評分為“重大”級別，且在法規合規方面亦獲得高度評價。\n\n報告正面評價金管局在AML/CFT方面採用風險為本的策略，指出金管局對銀行業ML/TF風險有良好認識，亦對存款支付工具（SVF）行業的風險水平有合理了解。更讚揚銀行業集體努力，例如大型認可機構增加數據分析的應用，大多數可疑交易報告均由認可機構提交，及其積極參與反訛騙及洗黑錢情報工作組（FMLIT）。\n\n報告亦指出一些需改進的範疇，包括加深對高風險領域如外國貪污及稅務犯罪的理解，以及推動SVF等新興行業的發展。相關工作已經展開，金管局於7月公布了更新的ML/TF風險評估報告，並啟動針對私人銀行及新技術治理的專題現場審查。"}
{"en": "# International Financial Centre\n\nHong Kong is a globally competitive international financial centre. The implementation of the Smart Banking initiatives has been in good progress to further develop Hong Kong as a fintech hub. Capitalising on opportunities arising from the opening up of the Mainland financial markets, much headway has been made to promote financial collaboration in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, especially in easing Hong Kong residents’ cross-border access to financial and banking services in the Area.\n\nAt the same time, much effort has been made to open up new opportunities to further strengthen the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, including infrastructure investment and financing, green finance and private equity funds. The Hong Kong Academy of Finance was set up to enhance Hong Kong’s soft power in a sustainable manner.\n\nIn the central banking and regulatory community, the HKMA plays a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees, which is a clear recognition of Hong Kong’s expertise and commitment to international work.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nTo strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia, the HKMA puts great effort into implementing the seven Smart Banking initiatives that were announced in September 2017, with an aim to facilitate the development and use of fintech in the banking and payment industries. The key progress of these initiatives during the year included:\n\n- expanding the adoption of the Faster Payment System (FPS);\n- facilitating the implementation of phases I and II of the Open Application programming Interface (Open API) Framework in the banking sector;\n- further enhancing fintech research and talent\ndevelopment;\n- stepping up cross-border collaboration in fintech; granting eight virtual bank licences;\n- facilitating the industry’s increasing use of Fintech Supervisory Sandbox (FSS) 2.0 for launching fintech initiatives; and\n- further facilitating the adoption of regulatory technology (Regtech) through the Banking Made Easy initiative.\n\nThe HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO), together with the banking departments of the HKMA, plays a pivotal role in driving the implementation of these initiatives.\n\nHong Kong plays an indispensable role in facilitating international investors’ allocation of renminbi assets, with its unparalleled access to the onshore markets through the Stock Connect and Bond Connect schemes. This was evident by the tripling of the number of registered investors and daily turnover under Bond Connect over the past year. Further enhancements have been introduced to both Bond Connect and Stock Connect, providing more convenience and flexibility for international investors to invest in onshore securities in the Mainland. The HKMA also worked closely with Mainland authorities to explore and implement a series of financial facilitation measures for Hong Kong residents to access financial and banking services across the border in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), including a prospective, two-way wealth management connect scheme. Hong Kong maintains a firm foothold as the global hub for offshore renminbi business. According to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Triennial Survey of Foreign Exchange (FX) and Derivatives Market Turnover, Hong Kong continued to be the largest offshore renminbi FX centre in the world.\n\nContinuous efforts were put into opening up new opportunities to further enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. To promote the development of the fund business in Hong Kong, the HKMA worked closely with the Government and industry to provide a more favourable tax and regulatory environment for fund formation. A number of large-scale events and targeted outreach activities were organised to promote Hong Kong as a hub for green finance, infrastructure investment and financing and corporate treasury centres (CTCs). In an effort to enhance Hong Kong’s soft power, the Hong Kong Academy of Finance (AoF) was set up in June to develop financial leadership and promote research collaboration.\n\nIn the central banking and regulatory community, the HKMA plays a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees. The HKMA chaired the Standing Committee on Supervisory and Regulatory Cooperation (SRC) of the Financial Stability Board (FSB) until 31 August 2019. Currently, the HKMA is chairing the Supervision and Implementation Group (SIG) of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), and the Working Group on Financial Markets (WGFM) established under the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP). The HKMA is also co-chairing the Non-Bank Monitoring Experts Group (NMEG) of the FSB with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure lays a solid foundation for Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre. The four interbank Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) and the Hong Kong Trade Repository (HKTR) achieved 100% system availability in 2019, beating the target of 99.95%. Through its accounts set up with the two Mainland central securities depositories, the CMU facilitates the settlement of transactions conducted under Bond Connect Northbound Trading and the holding of Mainland debt securities on behalf of relevant CMU members.\n\nThe FPS, which serves as an extension of Hong Kong dollar RTGS system to enable the public to make instant retail fund transfers and payments across different banks and stored value facilities (SVFs) on a round-the-clock basis, ran smoothly in its first year of operation. Users’ adoption of the facility had increased steadily, as manifested in the four million registrations and tripling of transaction volumes by the end of 2019. The FPS brings new opportunities to the retail payment industry and promotes fintech innovation.\n\nTo ensure the general safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA has designated and is overseeing a total of six retail payment systems (RPSs) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO). The HKMA also issued two new SVF licences in May, bringing the total number of SVF licensees to 18. SVF licensees continued to launch new products and services actively during the year to diversify customer choices and enhance user experience.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2019\n\n# Hong Kong as a Fintech Hub in Asia\n\n# Smart Banking initiatives\n\nThe seven Smart Banking initiatives were announced by the HKMA in September 2017 with the aim of helping the banking sector achieve higher standards of operation and embrace the enormous opportunities brought about by the convergence of banking and technology. During the year, considerable progress was made in implementing these initiatives and transforming the fintech ecosystem of Hong Kong.\n\n# Faster Payment System\n\nThe launch of the FPS in September 2018 was a major milestone in the financial infrastructure development of Hong Kong in the digital era. The FPS further promotes the adoption of e-payment in Hong Kong by providing efficient and convenient payment services to the general public and corporates. Since the launch of the FPS, the number of participating service providers had increased to 30 banks and 11 SVFs, with the addition of nine banks and one SVF, by the end of 2019.\n\nUsage of the FPS has also grown steadily. As of 31 December 2019, the FPS recorded four million registrations (Chart 1) and processed 44 million transactions involving an aggregate amount of HK$748.5 billion and RMB17 billion. In December 2019, average daily turnover reached 168,000 transactions worth HK$2.4 billion and RMB38 million (Chart 2), as compared with 51,000 transactions during its first full month of operation in October 2018.\n\nFaster payment System recorded: \n- 4 million registrations as of 31 December 2019\n- 44 million transactions as of 31 December 2019\n- 168,000 transactions worth HK$2.4 billion and RMB38 million of average daily turnover in December 2019\n\nThe HKMA works with the industry to extend FPS usage from person-to-person payments to bill payments and other merchant payments. For example, enhancements were made to enable merchants to use a variety of proxy identifiers and accept partial or over-payments via a QR code. A technical specification was developed to facilitate the invocation of a mobile banking or SVF e-wallet mobile application (app) from a business mobile app for FPS payment. This would greatly improve customer experience in making merchant and business payments via the FPS using mobile devices.\n\nThe HKMA also works closely with relevant Government departments to assist them in using the FPS to accept bill payments from the public. From 1 November, bills issued by the Inland Revenue Department, the Rating and Valuation Department and the Water Supplies Department were printed with an FPS QR code so that the public could scan the QR code easily with supporting mobile banking or SVF e-wallet apps to make payment. The HKMA will continue working with various Government departments and public bodies to explore other potential use cases which can make it convenient for the public to make payment via the FPS.\n\nTo raise public awareness of the FPS, the HKMA has developed a new series of education and publicity materials, such as Announcements in the public Interest for broadcast on television and radio, as well as videos and electronic banners for digital platforms. The HKMA also participated in trade fairs to promote the FPS to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and corporates. Various FPS participating banks and SVFs launched promotion campaigns and offered incentives to encourage customers to register with the FPS and to use it for fund transfer and bill payment.\n\nIn addition, the HKMA engaged a number of industry organisations and institutions to provide briefings on the FPS so as to introduce its functionalities and the potential benefits it may bring to different businesses in collecting and making payment.\n\nThe Government has adopted FPS for bill payments on taxes, rates and Government rent and water charges.\n\n# Open Application Programming Interface\n\nThe HKMA continued to facilitate the banking sector’s development and adoption of Open API in accordance with the four-phase approach of the Open API Framework. Under phase I, 20 retail banks opened up over 500 Open API endpoints in January, covering information of banking products and services. Under phase II, the banks opened up in October over 300 APIs to support applications for banking products and services.\n\n# Research and talent development\n\nOn trade finance, a proof-of-concept (PoC) study on linking up eTradeConnect and we.trade was completed in the first quarter of the year. In November, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between the subsidiaries of Hong Kong Interbank Clearing Limited and the Institute of Digital Currency of the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) to conduct a PoC study on linking up eTradeConnect and the PBoC Trade Finance platform to provide firms in both Hong Kong and Mainland China with more convenient trade finance services.\n\nOn Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), the HKMA and the Bank of Thailand embarked on a joint research project named project Inthanon-LionRock to study the application of CBDC to cross-border payments, with a view to facilitating HKD-THB payment-versus-payment (pvp) among banks in Hong Kong and Thailand.\n\nHKMA Executive Director (Financial Infrastructure), Mr Colin Pou (first from left), together with Director-General of the Institute of Digital Currency of the PBoC, Mr Mu Changchun (first from right), witness the signing ceremony of an MoU to conduct a PoC trial on linking up eTradeConnect and the PBoC Trade Finance Platform. The MoU is signed between Chief Executive Officer of the Hong Kong Trade Finance Platform Company Limited, Ms Haster Tang (second from left), and Deputy Director-General of the Institute of Digital Currency of the PBoC and Director of the Shenzhen Fintech Institute, Mr Di Gang (second from right).\n\nOn artificial intelligence (AI), the HKMA carried out a study on the application of AI technology in the Hong Kong banking industry. Key findings of an industry-wide AI survey were published in November, followed by the issuance of the full report, titled “Reshaping Banking with Artificial Intelligence”, in December.\n\nThe report “Reshaping Banking with Artificial Intelligence” is published in December.\n\nA fact sheet is published to highlight the key facts and figures derived from a survey on the use of AI in the Hong Kong banking industry.\n\nIn an effort to enlarge the fintech talent pool, the HKMA continued to run the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme 2.0 in collaboration with its strategic partners to nurture young talent at various stages of their career development. Over 220 students benefited from the programme last year.\n", "zh": "# 國際金融中心\n\n香港是全球具競爭力的國際金融中心。智慧銀行措施的推行進展良好，進一步發展香港作為金融科技樞紐。充分利用內地金融市場開放帶來的機遇，在粵港澳大灣區促進金融合作方面已取得顯著成效，尤其是在便利香港居民跨境獲取金融及銀行服務方面。\n\n同時，亦投入大量努力開拓新機遇，包括基建投資及融資、綠色金融及私募股權基金，以進一步鞏固香港金融平台的競爭力。香港金融學院的成立，旨在以可持續的方式提升香港的軟實力。\n\n在中央銀行及規管界，香港金融管理局（金管局）在多個區域及國際委員會中扮演領導角色，彰顯香港在專業能力及國際合作方面的承諾。\n\n# 概覽\n\n為鞏固香港在亞洲的金融科技樞紐地位，金管局積極推行2017年9月宣布的七個「智慧銀行」措施，旨在促進金融科技在銀行及支付行業的發展與應用。年度內這些措施的主要進展包括：\n\n- 擴展快迅支付系統（FPS）的應用；\n- 推動銀行業的開放應用程式介面（Open API）框架第一或第二階段的實施；\n- 加強金融科技研究及人才發展；\n- 推動跨境金融科技合作，並授予八個虛擬銀行牌照；\n- 協助行業積極使用金融科技監管沙盒（FSS）2.0，推動科技創新；\n- 進一步推廣及應用監管科技（Regtech），配合「銀行易」計劃。\n\n金管局金融科技促進辦公室（FFO）連同銀行部門，對推動這些措施起到關鍵作用。\n\n香港在促進國際投資者配置人民幣資產方面，扮演著不可或缺的角色。透過港股通和債券通，香港的市場准入及交易便利性大大提升，見證去年注冊投資者數字及日均成交額的三倍增長。 香港亦與內地當局密切合作，探索及推行多項便利措施，促進香港居民跨境獲取金融及銀行服務，包括預期雙向理財通。\n\n香港仍然是國際離岸人民幣業務的重鎮。根據國際結算銀行（BIS）三年一度的外匯及衍生品市場成交額調查，香港持續位居全球最大離岸人民幣外匯中心。\n\n為進一步提高香港金融平台的競爭力，港府與行業合作，為基金業提供更有利的稅務及規管環境。多個大型活動與推廣活動被舉辦，以促進香港成為綠色金融、基建投資及企業財資中心（CTC）的樞紐。為提升香港的軟實力，香港金融學院於六月成立，專注於金融領袖人才的培育及研究合作。\n\n在中央銀行及規管界，金管局在多個區域及國際委員會中擔任領導角色。2019年8月31日前，曾主持金融穩定理事會（FSB）監管及監督合作常設委員會（SRC）。目前，金管局正主持巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（Basel Committee）監管及實施組（SIG），並與美國證券交易委員會（SEC）共同擔任非銀行監察專家小組（NMEG）聯合主管。\n\n香港金融基建的穩健運作為其作為國際金融中心奠定堅實基礎。2019年，四個銀行間即時支付結算系統（RTGS）、中央結算單位（CMU）及香港交易資料儲存庫（HKTR）系統運行達到100%的可用性，超過99.95%的目標。透過與兩家內地中央證券結算公司合作的帳戶，CMU促成 Bond Connect 北向交易的清算，並代表相關會員持有內地債券。\n\nFPS作為港元RTGS系統的擴展，支持公眾進行全天候即時零售資金轉賬及付款，首次運作年度內表現良好。用戶註冊數逐步增加，至2019年底有四百萬註冊，交易量更是三倍提升。日均交易額達168,000筆，價值港幣24億元及人民幣3,8千萬元。\n\n金管局通過與行業合作，推廣FPS由個人轉賬延伸至帳單支付及商戶支付，並提升技術及服務，例如支持多種代理識別碼、QR碼收付款、和利用手機銀行或電子錢包應用程式進行支付。同時，與政府部門合作，將稅務局、差餉物業價值署及水務署的帳單增設FPS QR碼，方便市民掃描支付。金管局正持續推廣更多應用場景，提升公共利用率和便利性。\n\n為提高公眾認知，金管局設計了一系列推廣材料，包括電視和電台公告、數碼平台影片及電子橫幅，並積極參與展覽推廣。多家銀行及電子錢包亦推出促銷活動，鼓勵用戶註冊並使用FPS進行轉賬及帳單支付。\n\n同時，金管局監管六個零售支付系統（RPSs），並於五月發出兩張新電子錢包（SVF）牌照，總數增至十八宗。相關持牌人持續推出多元化產品和服務，以豐富客戶選擇，提升用戶體驗。\n\n# 2019年度回顧\n\n# 香港作為亞洲金融科技樞紐\n\n# 智慧銀行措施\n\n七個智慧銀行措施由金管局於2017年9月宣布，旨在幫助銀行業提升運營標準，迎接銀行與科技融合帶來的巨大機遇。年度內取得了顯著推進，並推動香港金融科技生態系統轉型。\n\n# 快迅支付系統\n\n2018年9月推出的FPS，成為香港數碼時代金融基建的重要里程碑。FPS推廣電子支付，提供高效便捷的支付服務，讓公眾及企業受益殆盡。截止2019年底，參與服務提供商增至30家銀行及11家電子錢包，較起初多9家銀行及1家電子錢包。\n\nFPS的應用亦穩步增長。截至2019年12月，註冊數達四百萬（見圖1），交易量達4,400萬次，總額約港幣748.5億元及人民幣1,700萬元。12月平均每日交易168,000筆，價值港幣2.4億元及人民幣3800萬元（見圖2），較2018年10月全面啟用的首月，交易量多出三倍。\n\nFPS的主要數據：\n- 註冊人數：400萬；\n- 交易次數：4,400萬次；\n- 平均每日：168,000次，交易額港幣2.4億元、人民幣3,8千萬元。\n\n金管局與行業攜手，將FPS由個人間轉賬拓展至帳單繳費及商戶收款。例如，技術升級支持商戶使用多種代理識別碼，及透過QR碼接受部分或超額付款，並開發技術規範，使商戶及企業可用手機應用程式（APP）從商業用手機進行FPS付款，顯著提升顧客體驗。\n\n金管局亦與相關政府部門合作，自11月起，市民可用支持的手機銀行或電子錢包掃描稅務局、差餉物價署及水務署的帳單上的FPS QR碼完成繳費。金管局將繼續探索其他便利用例。\n\n為提高公眾認知，金管局開發新系列宣傳教材，包括電視廣告、電台宣傳、影片和數碼橫幅，並參與展會推廣FPS。多家銀行和電子錢包亦推出促銷活動及獎勵，鼓勵市民使用。\n\n# 開放應用程式介面\n\n金管局持續推動銀行業按照開放API框架的四階段策略，發展和應用開放API。在第一階段，20家零售銀行於2020年1月開放超過500個API端點，涵蓋金融產品及服務資訊；第二階段則於同年10月推出超過300個API，以支持申請相關金融服務。\n\n# 研究和人才培育\n\n在貿易金融方面，完成一項連結eTradeConnect與we.trade的概念驗證（PoC）研究，促進區域金融科技應用與合作。11月，香港銀行間結算有限公司（HKICL）與中國人民銀行數字貨幣研究所（PBoC）簽署諒解備忘錄（MoU），進行聯合PoC，連結eTradeConnect與人民銀行貿易金融平台，以提供更便捷的跨境貿易融資服務。\n\n在人民幣數碼貨幣（CBDC）方面，港府與泰國央行合作啟動聯合研究項目Inthanon-LionRock，研究CBDC在跨境支付中的應用，促進港幣泰銖（HKD-THB）等支付的向付支付（pvp）操作。\n\n港金管局執行董事（金融基建）周啟良先生與人民銀行數字貨幣研究所所長穆長春先生共同見證簽約，兩方將合作進行相關PoC。\n\n關於人工智能（AI），港府亦進行相關研究，公布行業整體的AI調查結果，並於12月推出完整報告《用人工智能重塑銀行業》。\n\n同時，港府持續推行金融科技人才計劃（Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme 2.0），去年已有超過220名年輕人才受惠，進一步擴大金融科技人才庫。"}
{"en": "# Reserves Management\n\nGlobal financial markets performed better than expected in 2019 as the effect of accommodative monetary policies from major central banks outweighed concerns about the global growth slowdown and US-China trade tensions. Global equity markets rebounded following a significant correction in the fourth quarter of 2018, while major government bond yields declined and bond prices went up. Under such a favourable environment, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$262.2 billion in 2019, representing an investment return of 6.6%.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The HKMA, under the delegated authority of the Financial Secretary (FS) and within the terms of the delegation, is responsible to the FS for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(a) to preserve capital;\n(b) to ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(c) to ensure that sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) subject to (a)–(c), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund.\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP). The BP holds highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under Currency Board arrangements. The IP invests primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of its assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA diversifies part of the Exchange Fund’s investments in a prudent and incremental manner into a wider variety of asset classes. This includes emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The cap for the market value of investments under the LTGP is set at the aggregate of one-third of the accumulated surplus of the Exchange Fund and the portion of the Future Fund and placements by subsidiaries of the Exchange Fund linked to the LTGP.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007, holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that have been acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes. This Portfolio is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of its unique nature.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by fiscal reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP, with the major exception of the Future Fund, which links its interest rate to both the IP and the LTGP with reference to the portfolio mix. As at the end of 2019, the portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 40:60.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation. The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents long-term asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark (or strategic) allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and tracking error limit are determined by the FS in consultation with the EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may assume positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nThe HKMA set up the Exchange Fund Investment Office (EFIO) in August 2018 to house its investment and related risk management functions. Staff members of the EFIO directly manage about 71% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, comprising the entire BP and part of the IP. This part of the IP includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 29% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes. The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to realise sustainable returns, draw on diverse and complementary investment styles, and gain their market insights and technical expertise in investment.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is determined primarily by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe growing complexity of the investment environment underlines the importance of risk management. Stringent controls and investment guidelines are in place for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and compliance with guidelines and regulations is closely monitored. As the investment environment has become more complex, risk assessment has been strengthened to support the Exchange Fund’s increased level of investment diversification. Risk-control tools are deployed to assess market risks under both normal and adverse market conditions. Detailed performance attribution analyses are also conducted to identify sources of performance, enabling the HKMA to assess how to make the best use of the investment skills of both internal and external managers.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nThe HKMA is supportive of responsible investment (RI) by weaving environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into the investment process for both public and private market investments of the Exchange Fund.\n\nIn terms of public market investments, the HKMA implements both process-related and investment-related measures. One process-related measure taken by the HKMA is the adoption of the Principles of Responsible Ownership (PRO) issued by the Securities and Futures Commission in 2016, which help investors determine how best to meet their ownership responsibilities in relation to their investments in Hong Kong-listed companies. In managing the Exchange Fund, the HKMA has developed internal guidelines on ESG factors covering the process of selection, appointment and monitoring of external fund managers. The appointed external fund managers for the HKMA’s Hong Kong equities and Mainland active equities portfolios are required to adhere to the pRO in managing the investments on a “comply-or-explain” basis, and external fund managers appointed to manage the HKMA’s portfolios in developed market equities need to adhere to internationally recognised ESG standards. Apart from externally managed funds, ESG factors are also incorporated into the credit risk analysis of the HKMA’s internally managed bond investment.\n\nAs for ESG investments in the public market, the HKMA has invested in green bonds since 2015 as one of the early investors in this market, and participates in the Managed Co-Lending Portfolio Programme, which is run by the International Finance Corporation with a focus on sustainable investments across emerging markets. Going forward, the HKMA will continue to grow its green bond portfolio by either direct investment or investing in green bond funds. The HKMA also plans to construct ESGthemed mandates in equities investment by adopting an ESG equities index as a benchmark for passive portfolios and engaging active equities managers who apply ESG factors in their investment decisions.\n\nWith respect to private market investments, the HKMA examines the ESG policies and practices of general partners as part of its due diligence process. In particular, ESG risk evaluation is conducted as a mandatory part of due diligence in all LTGP investments. For the LTGP, the HKMA invests in projects with sustainable features; for instance, the HKMA has invested in renewables since 2013 in direct and co-investments in the energy sector, as well as green buildings and warehouses with green and sustainable features in its real estate portfolio. Going forward, the HKMA will continue to source projects with sustainable features and include green accreditation as a predominant factor in real estate investment.\n\nThe HKMA will monitor the development of ESG standards closely and assess how these standards can be further integrated into its investment process. The process is facilitated by its collaboration with like-minded investors and relevant international organisations. In particular, being a signatory of the UN-supported principles for Responsible Investment, which is the world’s leading proponent of RI, the HKMA expects to participate in the formulation of ESG best practices and to motivate other investors in adopting RI. Besides, the HKMA is also a member of FCLTGlobal, a not-for-profit organisation that works to encourage a longer-term focus in business and investment decision-making through workshops and research studies. In 2019, the HKMA also became a supporter of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures.\n\nFor more details about the HKMA’s RI policy framework, see the Corporate Social Responsibility chapter.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2019\n\nDespite concerns about the global growth slowdown and US-China trade tensions, global financial markets performed well in 2019 on the back of accommodative monetary policies from major central banks. Following a significant correction in the fourth quarter of 2018, global equity markets rallied in 2019. In the bond markets, major government bond yields declined markedly while bond prices went up in the first three quarters of 2019 as a result of monetary easing. Although bond prices retreated in the fourth quarter amid a slight rebound in yields, the overall gains in the bond markets were still satisfactory in 2019.\n\nIn the currency markets, major currencies performed differently against the US dollar. After declining by 3.8% in the third quarter due to an escalation of US-China trade tensions, the renminbi recovered part of its earlier losses in the fourth quarter given easing trade tensions. Overall, the renminbi depreciated by 1.4% against the US dollar. While the pound fell by 3.2% in the third quarter due to the heightened risk of a no-deal Brexit, it had since rebounded significantly as more clarity on Brexit emerged in the fourth quarter, eventually gaining 4.0% against the US dollar.\n\nThe performances of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2019 are shown in Table 1.\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$262.2 billion in 2019. This comprised gains on bonds of HK$114.5 billion, gains on Hong Kong equities of HK$22.1 billion, gains on other equities of HK$100.7 billion, a negative currency translation effect of HK$13.0 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets, and gains of HK$37.9 billion on other investments held by the investment holding subsidiaries of the Fund. Separately, the Strategic portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$2.5 billion.\n\nThe total assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,206.7 billion at the year end. The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$335.1 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$233.4 billion and real estate at HK$101.7 billion. Outstanding investment commitments reached HK$219.3 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund in 2019, excluding the Strategic portfolio, was 6.6%. Specifically, the IP achieved a rate of return of 9.7%, while the Bp gained 2.5%. The LTGP has recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 12.6% since its inception in 2009.\n", "zh": "# 儲備管理\n\n2019年，全球金融市場表現優於預期，主要中央銀行的寬鬆貨幣政策效果超越了對全球經濟增長放緩和中美貿易緊張局勢的擔憂。全球股市在2018年第四季度經歷重大調整後反彈，而主要政府債券收益率下降，債券價格上升。在如此有利的環境下，外匯基金在2019年錄得投資收益2622億港元，投資回報率為6.6%。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》，外匯基金的主要目標是影響（或間接影響）港幣的匯率價值。基金亦用於維持香港貨幣金融系統的穩定與完整，以協助保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。金管局在財政司司長（FS）的授權下，負責外匯基金的運用和投資管理，並在授權範圍內行事。\n\n# 外匯基金管理\n\n# 投資目標及組合架構\n\n外匯基金顧問委員會（EFAC）制定了外匯基金的以下投資目標：\n\n(a) 保本；\n(b) 確保整個貨幣基礎在任何時候都由高流動性以美元計價的資產充分支持；\n(c) 確保有足夠的流動性以維持貨幣和金融穩定；\n(d) 在符合（a）–（c）條件下，追求長期投資回報，以幫助維持基金的長期購買力。\n\n這些目標充分考慮了外匯基金的法定宗旨，並融入基金的組合結構和目標資產比重。總體而言，外匯基金擁有兩個主要組合：支撐組合（BP）與投資組合（IP）。支撐組合持有高流動性美元資產，以全額支持貨幣基礎滿足貨幣屯兵制度的要求；投資組合則主要投資於經合組織成員國的債券和股票，以維持資產的價值和長期購買力。\n\n為更好地控制風險並提升中長期回報，金管局謹慎且漸進地將部分外匯基金投資多元化，包括新興市場和內地債券及股票、私募股權（包括基建項目）以及房地產。新興市場和內地債券及股票由投資組合持有，私募股權和房地產則分別由長期增長組合（LTGP）持有。LTGP的市值上限設在外匯基金累積盈餘的三分之一與與LTGP掛鈎的未來基金和子公司的投資金額之和。\n\n於2007年成立的策略性組合，持有由政府為外匯基金的策略性目的而收購的港交所股份，因其特殊性未納入基金的投資績效評估。\n\n# 與外匯基金的資產配置\n\n外匯基金不時接納財政儲備、政府資金及法定機構的存款。利率通常與投資組合的表現掛鈎，唯未來基金除與投資組合掛鈎外，亦參考與LTGP相關的資產配置比例。截止2019年底，未來基金在投資組合與LTGP的配置約為40:60。\n\n# 投資流程\n\n外匯基金的投資流程依據兩種資產配置決策：戰略資產配置及策略性偏離。戰略資產配置反映在投資基準中，代表基金根據長期投資目標的資產配置方向。根據戰略配置，資產進行策略性調整，以追求超越基準的回報，即實際配置通常與基準（或戰略）配置不同，稱為“策略偏差”。基準和追蹤誤差限制由財政司司長在協商EFAC後制定，策略性偏離的決定及可容許範圍由金管局在授權下制定。在允許的偏差範圍內，投資組合經理可持倉以把握短期市場動向。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局於2018年8月成立外匯基金投資辦公室（EFIO），負責其投資及相關風險管理職能。EFIO 成員直接管理約71%的外匯基金投資，涵蓋完整的支撐組合及部分投資組合。該部分投資組合包括全球固定收益市場的投資組合以及用於實施宏觀風險管理策略的衍生品Overlay組合。\n\n# 使用外部經理\n\n除了內部管理外，金管局亦聘用外部基金經理管理約29%的外匯基金資產，包括所有上市股票組合及其他專門資產類別。聘用外部經理旨在利用市場上最佳的投資專長，實現可持續回報，採用多元並相輔相成的投資風格，並借助其市場見解和專業技術。\n\n外聘經理的費用主要包括基金管理和保管人費用、交易成本，以及預扣稅及其他稅項，這些成本受市場狀況影響，可能每年有所不同。\n\n# 風險管理及合規\n\n隨著投資環境日益複雜，風險管理的重要性日增。基金制定了嚴格的控制措施和投資指引，並密切監察合規狀況。由於投資多元程度提高，風險評估也加強，以支持基金的資產多元化。部署風險控制工具，以在正常及不利市場條件下評估市場風險。亦進行詳細的績效歸因分析，以辨識績效來源，協助金管局更善用內外部管理的投資技術。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n金管局支持負責任投資（RI），並將環境、社會及管治（ESG）元素融入外匯基金的公共和私募市場投資流程。\n\n在公共市場投資方面，金管局採取流程和投資兩方面措施。流程方面，包括採用證券及期貨事務監察委員會於2016年推出的負責任擁有權原則（PRO），幫助投資者確定如何履行擁有責任，以及建立相關內部ESG指引，涵蓋外部基金經理的遴選、委任及監控。執行外部基金經理管理港股和內地主動股票投資組合時，須遵守PRO原則，以“若未能遵守須作出解釋”為原則，管理發達市場股票的外部基金經理亦須符合國際認可的ESG標準。除外部基金外，ESG元素亦融入金管局內部管理的債券投資的信用風險分析。\n\n至於公共市場的ESG投資，自2015年起，金管局已投資綠色債券，並參與由國際金融公司推行的管理式共同貸款組合計劃，專注於新興市場的可持續投資。未來，金管局將通過直接投資或投資於綠色債券基金，持續擴大綠色債券組合，並計劃建構以ESG股市指數為基準的被動投資委託，並引入積極型股票經理，將ESG因素融入投資決策。\n\n在私募市場方面，金管局會審查合作夥伴的ESG政策與實踐，尤其將ESG風險評估納入所有長期增長組合的盡職調查範圍內。LTGP投資亦偏向具有可持續特色的項目，例如，自2013年起，涉及可再生能源、綠色建築及倉庫的投資。未来，金管局將持續尋找具可持續性特徵的項目，並將綠色認證作為房地產投資的重要考慮因素。\n\n金管局將密切關注ESG標準的發展，並評估如何進一步融入投資流程。此一過程得以促進與志同道合的投資者及國際組織的合作。特別是作為聯合國支持的負責任投資原則的簽署方，金管局預期參與制定最佳實踐，並激勵其他投資者採納RI。此外，金管局亦為非營利機構FCLTGlobal成員，專注於促進長遠視角的企業與投資決策，並於2019年支持氣候相關財務資訊披露工作組。\n\n欲了解有關金管局RI政策框架的詳情，請參閱企業社會責任章節。\n\n# 外匯基金表現\n\n# 2019年的金融市場\n\n儘管存在對全球經濟增長放緩及中美貿易緊張的不安，2019年全球金融市場在主要中央銀行的寬鬆貨幣政策帶動下表現良好。經歷2018年第四季度的重大調整後，全球股市在2019年反彈。在債券市場，由於寬鬆貨幣措施，主要國家的政府債券收益率大幅下降，債券價格在2019年前三季度持續上升。雖然第四季度收益率回升，導致債券價格略有回調，但整體來看2019年的債市漲幅仍令人滿意。\n\n在貨幣市場方面，主要貨幣對美元的表現有所差異。隨著中美貿易緊張局勢升級，第三季度人民幣貶值3.8%，但隨著貿易緊張局勢緩和，人民幣在第四季度部分回升。整體而言，人民幣兌美元貶值1.4%。英鎊在第三季度因無協議脫歐風險上升而下跌3.2%，但在第四季度隨著脫歐前景逐步明朗，英鎊反彈顯著，最終兌美元升值4.0%。\n\n2019年主要貨幣、債券及股市的表現列於表1。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n2019年，外匯基金錄得投資收益2622億港元。其中，債券收益為1145億港元，香港股票收益為221億港元，其他股票收益為1007億港元，非港幣資產的貨幣轉換負向匯兌影響為130億港元，以及投資控股子公司持有的其他投資收益達徒379億港元。此外，策略性組合錄得估值增值25億港元。\n\n年末，外匯基金總資產達4206.7億港元。LTGP下的投資市值合共335.1億港元，其中私募股權為233.4億港元，房地產為101.7億港元。未來投資承諾尚未履行的金額為219.3億港元。\n\n2019年外匯基金的投資回報率（不包括策略性組合）為6.6%。其中，投資組合的回報率為9.7%，支撐組合為2.5%。自2009年成立以來，LTGP的年化內部回報率已達12.6%。"}
{"en": "# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communication with the community and the market through the traditional media, social media platforms, its website, the Information Centre and various other channels to facilitate public understanding about its policies and operations. Within the institution, conscientious efforts are made to improve the HKMA’s corporate governance by supporting the professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline, enhancing information technology security, and promoting a culture of innovation to cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives and the increasing complexity of work.\n\n# ENGAGING THE COMMUNITY\n\n# Media relations and social media\n\nThe HKMA works closely with the media to enhance transparency and promote public understanding about its policies and work. During the year, 125 open press events were held, comprising 10 press conferences, 12 stand-up interviews and 103 other public functions. A further 25 media interviews were arranged. A total of 466 bilingual press releases were issued and a large number of media enquiries were handled every day.\n\nTo raise awareness of the HKMA’s key functions, the HKMA organised media briefings and educational workshops for local and overseas media as well as key opinion leaders in the community to facilitate understanding on a wide range of topics, such as the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), virtual banking, green finance, and Hong Kong as a competitive international financial centre.\n\nSince July 2018, the HKMA has launched various social media channels to strengthen public education and communication. Five social media channels are currently in operation: Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter and YouTube, reaching out to a total of over 45,000 followers as at end-December 2019. Amid the social incidents in the second half of 2019, the HKMA made use of social media to rebut unfounded rumours regarding banking operations and financial stability, a move which proved to be highly effective in disseminating facts and preventing the rumours from spreading further.\n\n# Public enquiries\n\nThe Public Enquiry Service provides an effective means for the public to better understand the key functions and operations of the HKMA. A total of 9,742 enquiries were handled in 2019, about half of which were related to banking policies and regulations, consumer banking, and notes and coins. Some of the notable enquiries raised were about the Coin Collection programme, banking products and services, banking-related guidelines and circulars, the Faster Payment System (FPS), and monetary and economic statistics.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received since 2016 and Chart 2 provides a breakdown by enquiry nature in 2019.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Eddie Yue, speaks at the Hong Kong Association of Banks Distinguished Speaker Luncheon.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Eddie Yue (left), and HKMA's then Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan, meet with media after the announcement of the appointment of Mr Eddie Yue as the next Chief Executive of the HKMA.\n\n# Publications\n\nApart from the HKMA Annual Report, in 2019 the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report, four issues of the Quarterly Bulletin, and regular updates of the Monthly Statistical Bulletin to provide up-to-date and thematic information and analyses on monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. In addition, the HKMA published 19 inSight articles, covering various topics related to its work. The inSight articles provide a useful channel for the HKMA to elucidate the rationale behind its major new initiatives or policies, and provide timely response to topical issues which are of interest to the public.\n\n# HKMA website\n\nThe HKMA official website (www.hkma.gov.hk) presents more than 40,000 pages of content in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, and is the public access gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It also contains the register of authorized institutions (AIs) and local representative offices and the register of the securities staff of AIs, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the register of stored value facility (SVF) licensees under the payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance. The HKMA official website underwent a major revamp and was relaunched in September with a new design layout, enriched content, an enhanced navigation structure, and more convenient search functions. The revamped website enables users to search information more easily and conveniently based on their own preferences. In particular, the revamped website carries a new section on “Smart Consumers”, where the public can find useful information and smart tips on a wide range of banking and related products or services. This is in line with the HKMA’s long-standing efforts to promote “smart and responsible” use of banking services.\n\nThe HKMA launches its revamped website.\n\nThe revamped HKMA website carries a new section on “Smart Consumers”.\n\nThe HKMA has been opening up financial data and important information published on its website via Open Application Programming Interface (Open API) by phases since 2018. By 2019, the HKMA has opened up 130 sets of Open ApIs on the HKMA’s website as originally planned. The HKMA embraces the development and application of Open API.\n\n# HKMA Information Centre\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre is an important resource introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters. It consists of an exhibition area and a library, and is open to the public six days a week. The exhibition area describes the HKMA’s work and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong. It also contains reading materials and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nThe HKMA completed the last phase of revamp of its Information Centre — the Historical Timeline — during the year. The revamped Historical Timeline, featuring multimedia and digital display panels for visitors to review the major monetary and financial events in Hong Kong and globally in a more interactive manner, was re-opened to the public in October.\n\nThe first section of the Historical Timeline is made up of a multimedia display panel presenting major events from 1842 to 1993.\n\nThe second section of the Historical Timeline is a digital display panel presenting major events from 1993, when the HKMA was established, to the present.\n\nThe Information Centre organises guided tours for visitors. During the year, it received more than 48,000 visitors and hosted over 480 guided tours for schools and other groups (Chart 3). More than 753,000 people have visited the Information Centre since it opened in December 2003.\n\nGuided tours of the Information Centre are organised for schools and other group visitors.\n\nThe library, situated next to the exhibition area, houses more than 26,000 books, journals and other publications for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs and central banking topics. It also maintains the register of AIs and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\n# Public and consumer education\n\nTo reach out to the community and raise public awareness of the HKMA’s work, the HKMA organised a public education seminar for over 400 secondary school students and teachers in 2019. Topics covered in the seminar included an introduction to the work of the HKMA, Hong Kong’s banknotes, the FPS, SVFs, fintech and the Deposit Protection Scheme. More than 60,000 teachers and students have participated in this programme since its launch in 1998.\n\nStudents and teachers from secondary schools in different districts attend the 2019 public education seminar.\n\nThe focus of the HKMA’s consumer education initiatives during the year was on educating the public to protect their “personal digital keys”, a concept introduced to help the public visualise the significance of safeguarding information for accessing their online accounts. The central message was that in the digital world, account login details and personal information related to internet banking and other digital financial services were as important as the keys to their home, and should be well protected. Extensive promotion was arranged across different media, including the TV, radio, mobile applications, social media, and other digital and out-of-home platforms, to highlight smart tips on how to protect personal digital keys.\n\nThe Flagship Campaign on Personal Digital Keys is conducted via extensive cross-media promotion.\n\nSustained initiatives were also carried out to educate the public to be smart and responsible financial consumers. For example, members of the public were urged to stay vigilant of bogus phone calls purportedly from banks, and of investment scams promoted on social media. Issues to note when handling personal credit products, in particular personal loans taken out during the tax season, were also promoted.\n\nTo enhance financial literacy among secondary school students, the HKMA co-organised the “Hong Kong Liberal Studies Financial Literacy Championship” with various stakeholders for the fifth year. Infographics were newly used in the Championship this year to help students better understand sophisticated financial concepts. An online quiz was conducted, attracting 10,450 submissions and culminating in the grand final competition, which was held at the HKMA for the first time. \n\nThe Championship, attracting over 10,000 online submissions, ends with a live competition at the HKMA.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA kicked off the Second phase of its Cross-generation Outreach Educational programme, which was organised jointly with an education institution. The programme comprised bank simulation games, parents’ talks and train-the-trainer workshops, targeting kindergarten pupils, their parents and teachers, as well as young adults. Other initiatives on youth education included producing comic storybooks for primary school students and parents jointly with a professional association, as well as delivering talks to tertiary school students.\n\nThe HKMA continued to support the Investor and Financial Education Council in promoting financial literacy and capacity in Hong Kong, and will explore further collaboration with different stakeholders to maximise the impact of consumer education.\n\nThe Achievement Ceremony for the First Phase of the Crossgeneration Outreach Programme is held alongside the launch of the Second Phase.\n\nKindergarten pupils participate in the bank simulation game.\n\nComic storybooks are produced jointly with a professional association to disseminate smart tips on using banking and financial services to primary school students and their parents.\n\n# OUR PEOPLE\n\nWhile the HKMA is an integral part of the Government, it employs staff on terms different from those of the civil service to attract people with the right experience and expertise. The HKMA recruits, develops and maintains a highly professional workforce to support its policy objectives and respond flexibly to changing work priorities.\n\nThe establishment of the HKMA in 2019 was 1,005. During the year, the HKMA conducted a cross-departmental re-engineering exercise to enhance the efficiency of various work processes and redeploy existing resources to support new initiatives. As a result of this rigorous exercise, the overall establishment of the HKMA in 2020 remains unchanged at 1,005.

{"en": "# Corporate Social Responsibility\n\nThe HKMA is committed to fulfilling its corporate social responsibility, and aims to be a responsible and sustainable organisation. This commitment is manifested in various areas, including promoting a sustainable and environment-friendly marketplace, supporting the wider community, protecting the environment and nurturing a caring workplace.\n\n# MARKETPLACE\n\n# Green and sustainable banking\n\nClimate change is one of the major risks threatening the well-being of mankind and the sustainability of the world economy. The financial sector in which banks operate, being an integral part of the society, will also be impacted and hence should be more proactive in managing climate risks. The HKMA is committed to exploring ways to address this challenge. Against this background, the HKMA unveiled in May a number of measures for promoting the development of green finance in Hong Kong, including the adoption of a three-phased approach to promote green and sustainable banking.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nAs the investment manager of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA believes that the concept of responsible investment (RI) is highly relevant to its investment work. As the HKMA is one of the world’s largest asset owners, it will have a major impact on how fund managers pick assets.\n\n# Our Beliefs\n\nThe HKMA sees RI as an investment approach that takes into account the impact of various environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors on long-term investment returns and their sustainability. The HKMA believes that, by putting an appropriate emphasis on RI and sustainable long-term economic performance, it can better achieve the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund and reduce risks associated with the ESG-related matters of its underlying investments.\n\n# Our Principles\n\nThe HKMA’s guiding principle is that priority will generally be given to ESG investments if the long-term risk-adjusted return is comparable with other investments. Where appropriate, the HKMA adopts in its investment process the following RI principles that underpin its beliefs as a responsible long-term investor:\n\n# Integration\n\nThe HKMA incorporates ESG factors into its investment analysis processes to identify risks and opportunities, as it believes that these factors can materially affect the long-term value of its investments. Specifically, the HKMA has been integrating ESG factors into its investment process for both public and private market investments. For public market investments, the HKMA incorporates ESG factors in its credit risk analysis of bond investment. External managers that share the HKMA’s RI beliefs are selected and appointed. The HKMA communicates its RI beliefs to all its external managers and expects them to align in such a way that the overall sustainable long-term economic performance target is attainable. For private market investments, the ESG policies and practices of the HKMA’s general partners are examined as part of its due diligence process.\n\n# Active ownership\n\nThe HKMA exercises shareholder rights in its public equity holding in a manner that helps safeguard the long-term value of its investments. The HKMA believes that responsible corporate behaviour guided by ESG factors will help create shareholder value in the long term. The HKMA’s asset managers are expected to help the HKMA discharge its ownership responsibilities in the underlying investments by adopting active ownership through exercising voting rights and engaging with the corporates concerned.\n\n# Collaboration\n\nThe HKMA seeks to join hands with like-minded investors and regulators to promote good practices for the long-term management of investments. It participates in and speaks at public events to share views and encourage the investment community to adopt RI.\n\nSee the Reserves Management chapter for more details about the HKMA’s work on RI during the year.\n\n# Promoting financial inclusion\n\nThe HKMA attaches great importance to financial inclusion and has been making significant effort in promoting access to basic banking services by different segments of the society to meet the basic daily needs of the general public and the operational needs of legitimate businesses. In particular, the HKMA has been working closely with the banking industry on the following priority areas:\n\n- Encouraging banks to launch more physical banking facilities and develop digital and innovative channels for the delivery of basic banking services to serve the general public, particularly residents of remote areas and public housing estates, and the elderly;\n\n- Facilitating and monitoring the accessibility of bank accounts to individuals and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs);\n\n- Enhancing the accessibility of banking services to specific customer groups, for example, customers with disabilities and ethnic minorities;\n\n- Facilitating and monitoring the accessibility of bank credit to SMEs; and\n\n- Granting authorization to eight virtual banks, which will play an active role in promoting financial inclusion in delivering their banking services.\n\n# COMMUNITY\n\n# Promoting financial literacy\n\nThe HKMA promotes financial literacy through various channels. Apart from running educational programmes to promote smart and responsible use of banking and financial services by the public, the HKMA features on its revamped official website a new dedicated section on “Smart Consumers”, where the public can find useful information and smart tips on a wide range of banking and related products and services. Social media platforms such as Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube, Instagram and Twitter are used in addition to the HKMA official website and publications to provide up-to-date information on banking and financial affairs.\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre, serving as the HKMA’s major public education and research resource since 2003, introduces the work of the HKMA to the community and promotes public awareness of monetary and banking matters. Educational guided tours are offered daily for group visitors from schools and non-profit making organisations. public education seminars and other activities are also organised for students to enhance their financial knowledge and literacy. In addition, the HKMA works closely with the Investor and Financial Education Council to promote financial literacy in Hong Kong via its financial education platform, The Chin Family.\n\nSee the Corporate Functions chapter for more details about the HKMA’s work on promoting financial literacy during the year. See the Banking Stability chapter for more details about the HKMA’s work on promoting financial inclusion during the year.\n\n# Addressing the needs of special groups \n\n# Accessibility of Hong Kong banknotes\n\nThe 2018 Series of Banknotes retains accessibility features used in the previous series of banknotes to help the visually impaired differentiate between the denominations. These accessibility features include Braille, tactile lines and high-tactility numerals.\n\nTo help the visually impaired differentiate between the denomination of the banknotes, a mobile app, sponsored by the HKMA and developed by the Hong Kong Society for the Blind, uses the phone’s camera to scan the banknote patterns for the denomination. The app is available for download from Apple App Store and Google play Store for free. A note-measuring template sponsored by the HKMA and the three note-issuing banks has also been introduced to measure the length of the note. It can measure both the 2018 Series and the notes currently in circulation. The template is embossed with Braille on one side and symbols on the other. It is freely distributed at voluntary agencies serving the visually impaired community.\n\n# Coin Collection Programme\n\nUnder the Coin Collection programme, the HKMA collaborates with the Hong Kong Council of Social Service to deploy the Coin Carts to collect coins on flag days for non-governmental organisations.\n\n# Accessibility of public information\n\nThe revamped HKMA official website was launched in September. The revamped website has enhanced navigation structure to facilitate easy and convenient search by users based on their own preferences. In particular, the website contains a dedicated webpage “Information in Other Languages” under the “Smart Consumers” section, which provides useful information on banking services in seven languages commonly used by the ethnic minority community, namely Bahasa Indonesia, Hindi, Nepali, Punjabi, Tagalog, Thai and Urdu.\n\nThe HKMA is committed to ensuring that its website conforms to the maximum extent possible to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 Level AA standard, to facilitate barrier-free access to its online information by people with special needs.\n\n# volunteer and charitable activities\n\nThe HKMA supports community services by taking part in volunteer and charitable activities. The Senior Citizen Home Safety Association awarded the Community Engagement Crystal Award to the HKMA for participating in the 2018 Love & Peace of Mind Corporate Engagement Programme.\n\nCharitable events participated in by the HKMA Volunteer Team in 2019\n\n“Yo! Let’s Walk the Road” by the Youth Outreach.\n\nArtists and representatives from the social enterprise, Arts with the Disabled Association Hong Kong, visit the HKMA office, where its artworks are displayed.\n\nHKMA staff members take part actively in Blood Donation Day, Territory-Wide Flag Day, Community Chest’s Green Day, Love Teeth Day, Skip Lunch Day, Dress Casual Day and regular campaigns that collect clothes, toys and other reusable items for donation to charities.\n\nHKMA staff members take part actively in Blood Donation Day, organised by the Hong Kong Red Cross.\n\n# Caring organisation\n\nIn recognition of its commitment to care for the community, the HKMA was accredited with the “10 Years Plus Caring Organisation Logo” by the Hong Kong Council of Social Service for the 13th consecutive year.\n\n# ENVIRONMENT\n\n# Green office measures\n\nThe HKMA has an established environmental policy to protect and preserve the environment. The policy and implementation measures are promulgated among its staff regularly. Green office measures include:\n\n# Paper/Photocopying/Printing\n\n- Encouraging the use of recycled paper and envelopes;\nDistributing electronic copies instead of hard copies of documents;\n- printing on both sides of the paper;\n- Using colour printing and copying only when necessary;\n- Avoiding the use of paper cups; and \n- Using environmentally friendly paper and ink for the HKMA’s Annual Report.\n\n# Electricity\n\n- Switching off PCs, printers, lights, audio-visual systems and other electrical appliances when these devices are not in use. Reactivating the preset power-saving mode installed in most equipment, such as water dispensers, electric punching machines and shredders, after use outside their preset operating hours; and \n- Reviewing regularly the need for additional air-conditioning beyond normal business hours.\n\n# Recycling\n\n- Making good use of recycled bins to collect different categories of waste, including paper, cans, bottles, batteries, CDs and ink cartridges.\n\n# WORKPLACE\n\n# Diversity and inclusion\n\n# Equal Opportunities Policy\n\nThe HKMA is an equal opportunities employer. It believes that everyone should be able to work in an environment free of discrimination, harassment, vilification and victimisation. The equal opportunities policy applies to job advertisements, recruitment, terms and conditions of employment, performance assessment, promotion, transfer, training, dismissal, grievance procedures and general conduct.\n\n# Key statistics on diversity\n\npeople are central to the work of the HKMA. We value the diversity of our workforce, which has a balanced gender representation and a spectrum of different age groups.\n\nFemale representation at the senior management levels, that is, Executive Director and above, made up 31% as of February 2020.\n\n# Human capital key statistics on 1 January 2020\n\n# Quality workplace\n\nTo cater for projected operational needs, the HKMA renovated the offices during the year to create an open layout, increase capacity and allow for more efficient use of space. Breakout areas and ergonomic furniture are part of the new office design. To enhance the staff’s physical health, height-adjustable desks were offered to staff members, allowing them to change their postures easily throughout the day between sitting and standing.\n\nHeight-adjustable desks improve office ergonomics.\n\n# Staff well-being\n\nThe HKMA promotes work-life balance and cares about the health and work safety of the staff. Regular talks on healthy lifestyles, stress management and workplace safety are organised and indoor air quality is monitored. Annual on-site medical check-ups and flu vaccinations are arranged.

{"en": "# The Exchange Fund\n\n- Report of the Director of Audit\n- Exchange Fund Financial Statements\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 187 to 293, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2019, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2019, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards. My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report. I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2019. These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.5, 2.6 and 38.1 to the financial statements.\n\nAs at 31 December 2019, the Group had financial assets totalling HK$3,874,223 million and financial liabilities totalling HK$1,158,686 million valued at fair value.\n\nFor 91% of these financial assets and all these financial liabilities, their fair values were quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 inputs) or were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data (Level 2 inputs).\n\nFor the remaining 9% of these financial assets, their fair values were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data (Level 3 inputs). Such financial assets totalled HK$338,758 million, including mainly unlisted investment funds.\n\nGiven the substantial amount and the estimations involved, valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value was a key audit matter.\n\nThe audit procedures on valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value included:\n\n- obtaining an understanding of the procedures, including relevant controls, for valuing different categories of financial assets and financial liabilities;\n\n- evaluating and testing the controls, including relevant application controls of the computer systems;\n\n- obtaining external confirmations on the valuation, existence, rights and obligations and completeness of the financial assets and financial liabilities;\n\n- where quoted market prices were used, verifying the prices to independent sources;\n\n- where valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions, and verifying the inputs to independent sources; and\n\n- where valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Valuation of investment properties at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.11, 18 and 19 to the financial statements.\n\nThe Group’s investment properties were stated at their fair values, totalling HK$22,481 million as at 31 December 2019. The Group also had interests in twenty two joint ventures totalling HK$44,506 million, whose principal activities were holding overseas investment properties. The fair values of these investment properties, whether held by the Group directly or by joint ventures, were mainly determined based on valuations by independent professional valuers. Such valuations involved significant judgments and estimates, including the valuation methodologies and the assumptions used.\n\nThe audit procedures on valuation of investment properties at fair value included:\n\n- obtaining and reviewing the valuation reports of investment properties held by the Group directly or by joint ventures, and verifying that the fair values were based on the valuations stated in the valuation reports;\n\n- assessing the independence and qualifications of the valuers; and\n\n- evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises all the information included in the 2019 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICpA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. I also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nJohn Chu\nDirector of Audit\n\nAudit Commission \n26th Floor\nImmigration Tower\n7 Gloucester Road\nWanchai, Hong Kong\n\n3 April 2020\n", "zh": "# 外匯基金\n\n- 審計署署長報告\n- 外匯基金財務報表\n\n# 審計署署長報告\n\n# 獨立審計師報告 致財政司司長\n\n# 意見\n\n我證明已審核載於第187至293頁的外匯基金及其附屬公司的財務報表（「本部門」），其中包括截至2019年12月31日的外匯基金及集團的資產負債表，以及該年度的收支帳目、全面收益表、權益變動表、現金流量表和財務報表附註，包括重要會計政策摘要。\n\n依照香港會計師公會（“HKICPA”）頒布的香港財務報告準則（“HKFRSs”）以及由行政長官根據《外匯基金條例》（第66章）第7條制定的指令，我認為財務報表能如實反映外匯基金及集團於2019年12月31日的財務狀況，以及其截至該日的財務業績和現金流量，並已妥善編制。\n\n# 報價依據\n\n我按照《外匯基金條例》第7條行政長官的指令及審計署審計準則執行審計職責。我的責任在審計報告中“審計財務報表的責任”部分進一步描述。我與集團保持獨立，並已依照準則履行其他道德責任。我相信我所獲得的審計證據是充分及適當的，能作為我發表意見的基礎。\n\n# 核心審計事項\n\n核心審計事項是指在我專業判斷中，於2019年12月31日止年度的財務報表審計中最為重要的事項。這些事項在我進行整體財務報表審計及形成我的意見過程中已獲得處理，且我不就這些事項另行發表獨立意見。\n\n# 公允價值金融資產及金融負債評價\n\n參考財務報表附註第2.5、2.6及38.1。\n\n截至2019年12月31日，集團持有公允價值為HK$3,874,223百萬的金融資產及HK$1,158,686百萬的金融負債。\n\n其中91%的金融資產及所有金融負債的公允價值，均以活躍市場中相同資產或負債的報價（Level 1輸入）或基於可觀察市場資料的估值技術（Level 2輸入）估算。\n\n剩下9%的金融資產的公允價值則以非可觀察市場資料的估值技術（Level 3輸入）估算，這些金融資產合共HK$338,758百萬，主要包括未上市投資基金。\n\n由於金額龐大且涉及估算，公允價值金融資產及金融負債的評價為審計的關鍵事項。\n\n在有關公允價值評價的審計程序包括：\n\n- 了解不同類別金融資產及金融負債的估值程序，包括相關控制措施；\n\n- 評估並測試控制措施，包括電腦系統的相關應用控制；\n\n- 取得外部確認，核實金融資產及金融負債的估值、存在、權利與義務及完整性；\n\n- 使用活躍市場報價的，核對其價格的獨立參考來源；\n\n- 使用觀察市場資料的估值技術的，評估估值方法的適當性及合理性，並核實輸入資料的獨立參考來源；\n\n- 使用非可觀察市場資料的估值技術的，評估估值方法的合理性及輸入資料的合理性。\n\n# 公允價值投資物業評價\n\n參考財務報表附註第2.11、18及19。\n\n集團的投資物業按其公允價值列示，截至2019年12月31日為HK$22,481百萬。集團亦持有兩十二項合作企業投資，共HK$44,506百萬，主要是持有海外投資物業。這些投資物業的公允價值，無論由集團直接持有或由合作企業持有，主要根據獨立專業估價師的評估而定，且涉及重大判斷和估算，包括估值方法及假設。\n\n有關投資物業公允價值的審計程序包括：\n\n- 取得並審閱集團直接持有或由合作企業持有的投資物業估值報告，並核實該等公允價值是否以估值報告中所載的價值為準；\n\n- 評估估價師的獨立性及資格；\n\n- 評估估值方法的適用性及假設和輸入資料的合理性。\n\n# 其他資料\n\n金融管理專員（“金管局”）負責其他資料。其他資料包括除財務報表及我的審計師報告外，香港金融管理局2019年度年報中所載的所有資料。\n\n我對財務報表的意見不涵蓋其他資料，亦不就該等資料作任何保證。\n\n在審計財務報表的同時，我的責任是閱讀其他資料，並考慮該等資料是否與財務報表或在審計中獲得的知識存在重大不符，或其他方面明顯有誤。如根據我已執行的工作判斷，發現有該等資料存在重大錯誤，我將有責任報告該事實。我在此方面沒有任何報告。\n\n# 金融管理專員與外匯基金顧問委員會審核委員會審計財務報表的責任\n\n金融管理專員負責根據HKFRSs及《外匯基金條例》第7條行政長官的指令，妥善編制能如實反映財務狀況的財務報表，並建立必要的內部控制，以確保財務報表不存有因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯漏。\n\n在編制財務報表時，金融管理專員亦負責評估集團能否繼續營運，並在必要時披露相關事項，並以持續經營為前提編制會計帳目。\n\n外匯基金顧問委員會的審核委員會則負責監督集團的財務報告流程。\n\n# 審計師對財務報表審計的責任\n\n我旨在獲得合理保證，判斷整體財務報表是否不存在因欺詐或錯誤引致的重大錯漏，並出具包含我意見的審計師報告。合理保證是較高層次的保證，但並非保證依照審計署審計準則的審計一定能察覺所有存在的重大錯漏。錯漏可能由欺詐或錯誤引起，若能就個別或合併來看，對使用者在財務報表基礎上作出的經濟決策有所影響，即屬重大。\n\n根據審計署審計準則進行審計時，我運用專業判斷，保持專業懷疑，並：\n\n- 識別及評估因欺詐或錯誤導致財務報表存在重大錯漏的風險，設計及執行審計程序，以獲取充分且適當的審計證據，作為我形成意見的基礎。由欺詐引發的重大錯漏的風險高於由錯誤引發，因欺詐可能牽涉串謀、偽造、故意遺漏、曲解或內部控制的覆蓋；\n\n- 了解與審計相關的內部控制，以設計適宜的審計程序，但並非用於評價集團的內部控制效能；\n\n- 評估金融管理專員所採用的會計政策的適切性及會計估計和披露的合理性；\n\n- 對金管局使用的持續經營假設是否適當作出結論，並根據取得的審計證據判斷是否存在對集團能持續營運造成重大懸而未決的不確定因素。如我認為存在重大不確定性，需在審計師報告中特別提示有關披露，若披露不足，則需對意見作出修正。我的結論以在我簽發審計報告之日之前所獲得的審計證據為依據。未來的事件或情況可能導致集團停止持續經營；\n\n- 評估財務報表的整體呈現、結構和內容，包括披露內容，及其是否公允反映交易與事件；\n\n- 獲取充分且適當的審計證據，以對集團內相關實體或業務範圍的財務資訊作出意見。我負責指揮、監督及執行整個集團的審計工作，並始終對我的審計意見負全責。\n\n我會就審計範圍及計劃、重大發現（包括任何發現的內部控制缺陷）等事項，與外匯基金顧問委員會審核委員會溝通。\n\n我亦向外匯基金顧問委員會提交聲明，闡明我已符合相關守則規定的獨立性要求，並通報所有可能合理影響我獨立性的關係及其他事項，以及在適用情況下的相關保障措施。\n\n根據與審核委員會溝通的事項，我確定本次財務報表審計中最為重要的事項，即審計的關鍵事項。除法律或規例規定不得公眾披露或在極少數情況下因不良後果經我判斷不宜披露外，我會在審計師報告中描述這些事項。\n\n朱志良\n審計署署長\n\n審計署\n香港灣仔加路連 gevol\n入境事務大樓26樓\n2020年4月3日"}

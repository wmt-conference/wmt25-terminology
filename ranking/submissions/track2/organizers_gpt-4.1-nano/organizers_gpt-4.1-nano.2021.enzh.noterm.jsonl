{"en": "# Chief Executive’s Statement\n\nThe year 2021 was a year of concurrent consolidation and development.\n\nIn 2021, the pandemic entered its second year unabated: global supply chains were disrupted, inflation pressures were on the rise, risk of premature tightening of global financial conditions increased.  Adding to the unpredictability were the emergence of mutant variants of COVID-19 and the intensification of geopolitical tensions.  Despite such a macro environment filled with uncertainties, we continued to safeguard monetary and financial stability and maintain operational resilience.\n\n2021 also brought hope for recovery with the successful rollout of COVID-19 vaccines together with the accommodative monetary and fiscal policies introduced in multiple economies.  The global economy began to recover from the severe contraction in 2020.  Locally, after having endured economic contraction in 2019 and 2020, the Hong Kong economy grew by 6.3% in 2021, thanks to the rollout of the vaccination programme and the Government’s pandemic relief measures which have lent crucial support to our economic recovery.\n\nWith financial and monetary stability maintained, as well as a steadying macro environment, 2021 gave us some room to pursue more development work.  We seized the opportunity and pressed ahead with developmental initiatives that will help our financial sector remain highly competitive. Significant progress has been made across our three strategic priorities, namely fintech, green finance and Mainland market opportunities arising from Hong Kong’s gateway role.\n\nAs we entered 2022, the global environment took a turn for the worse.  But as the saying goes, when the going gets tough, the tough get going.  We will continue to be proactive and pursue our developmental goals and priorities to be better prepared for the next challenge and to cement our status as an international financial centre.  We will also remain steadfast in our commitment to ensure the soundness of Hong Kong monetary and financial systems, as we have risen to the many challenges time and again as in the past.\n\n# Monetary and financial stability: foundation of an international financial centre\n\nSince its establishment in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has been a strong anchor of Hong Kong’s financial system and has helped Hong Kong withstand numerous shocks and challenges.  Despite the lingering uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and market concerns about the pace of US monetary tightening, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to function in an orderly manner throughout the year, reflecting the robustness of the LERS.\n\nThis confidence in our systems did not happen overnight, but is based on the solid foundation which has been built up over the years.  In its 2021 External Sector Report, the International Monetary Fund once again reiterated that the credibility of the LERS has been assured by a transparent set of rules, ample fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy, and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nThe confidence is also a result of our efforts in public and market engagement, as well as effective surveillance.  On the latter, we have leveraged technology and data analytics to strengthen our capability for more timely and comprehensive analysis on financial stability and macroprudential surveillance.\n\nThe robustness of the banking system is of paramount importance to financial stability in Hong Kong.  Two years into the COVID-19 pandemic, our banks remained resilient with liquidity positions and capitalisation faring very well by international standards.  As at end-2021, the capital adequacy ratio of local banks stood at 20.2%, well above the minimum requirement of 8%, while the average Liquidity Coverage Ratio of large banks was 151.9% in the fourth quarter of 2021, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 100%.  Despite a challenging credit landscape amid the pandemic, the asset quality of the banking sector remained largely stable during the year. The classified loan ratio of the industry was 0.88% at the end of 2021, down from 0.90% at the end of 2020, well below the long-run historical average of 1.8% since 2000.\n\n# Banking sector: a pillar of support to the economy\n\nAs always, the banking sector is an important pillar of support to economic activity.  This is ever more crucial in the face of economic fallout from the COVID-19 outbreak.  In the past year, a main challenge was to strike a balance between managing credit risk in the banking sector and maintaining the sector’s support for the real economy.  With our supervisory work over the years, banks continued to manage credit risks effectively.  At the same time, we worked closely with banks to provide the much needed relief to corporate and personal customers through the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme (PPPHS) and other relief measures.  The PPPHS, launched together with the Banking Sector Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) Lending Coordination Mechanism in 2020 allowing eligible corporate customers to defer loan principal payments by six months on a pre-approval basis, was again further extended twice during 2021 until April 2022 recognising that some economic sectors were still hard-pressed by the lingering pandemic and were in need of continued credit relief.  Subsequently, in light of a resurgence of local coronavirus infections, in February 2022, the PPPHS was further extended until the end of October 2022.  It is encouraging to see that the banking sector has joined forces with the HKMA to help relieve cash-flow pressures on corporate and individual borrowers, even whilst the sector itself is experiencing its own difficult operating conditions due to the outbreak of the pandemic.\n\nApart from the challenging credit landscape, the pandemic also brought about a more difficult operating environment and a digital landscape with escalating cyber threat. We have stepped up our efforts to enhance operational and cyber resilience of the banking sector, as well as consumer and investor protection amid increasing digitalisation and a surge in phishing scams.  In particular, the Code of Banking Practice was revised to enhance consumer protection in digital financial services.\n\nBesides supervisory work, we are dedicated to promoting financial inclusion and customer-centric culture in the banking sector.  Enhancing accessibility to banking services by customers in need has been one of our priority areas and we have been working closely with the industry to develop industry guidelines.  Further to the guidance on barrier-free banking services and provision of banking services for persons with intellectual disabilities, the industry, with the support of the HKMA, published in December 2021 a guideline to set out the principles and good practices for the banking industry in providing banking services to persons with dementia and customers in need.\n\nTo support the continued development of the banking sector in the future where the new growth opportunities and challenges require a new set of skills from the workforce, the HKMA has formulated a holistic talent development strategy — “Connecting Talent to the Future” — to groom future talent and upskill existing practitioners in a more systematic and targeted manner.  Our new strategy is built on three “connect” directions: connecting students to the banking industry, connecting practitioners to the future of banking, and connecting the key stakeholders together to enhance collaboration in implementing the strategy.  We have launched a series of outreach and promotional campaigns to attract more students to enter the banking industry. To better prepare university students to be “future ready”, we have launched the Future Banking Bridging Programme jointly with the Hong Kong Institute of Bankers, which comprises a series of courses that cover practical banking knowledge and useful soft skills that are highly in demand in the banking industry.  For the existing banking practitioners, we have been working closely with the industry on developing opportunities for upskilling through providing more in-demand training programmes.  In December 2021, the new Fintech module under the Enhanced Competency Framework for banking practitioners was launched.\n\nFinancial talent is crucial to the future development of Hong Kong as an international financial centre.  We will work hand in hand with all stakeholders with a view to strengthening the talent pool for the further development of the industry.\n\n# International financial centre: strong position underpinned by an unparalleled access to opportunities\n\nThe competitiveness of Hong Kong as an international financial centre is underpinned by the unparalleled access to opportunities it offers.  There is general consensus that global fintech adoption, opening-up of Mainland’s financial markets, and the mainstreaming of green and sustainable finance present huge opportunities for the future development of Hong Kong’s financial sector.  At the HKMA, we have dedicated substantial efforts in leveraging Hong Kong’s unique edge to capture these opportunities.  Let me talk about the fintech and Mainland opportunities first.\n\n# Comprehensive adoption of fintech\n\nThe pandemic has clearly demonstrated the power of fintech and permanently changed customers’ behaviour towards financial services.  To make sure we continue to stay at the forefront of the global fintech scene and are ready to tap all of the potential of fintech, we must build an ecosystem where the value of fintech is experienced across all levels and by all groups of people.\n\nThis vision has driven us to formulate a new strategy, “Fintech 2025”, which was unveiled in June 2021.  As its name suggests, it aspires to help the financial sector adopt technology comprehensively by 2025.  The strategy comprises five focus areas which cover the required elements to achieve a successful ecosystem, and also the right factors for the ecosystem to grow further in a virtuous cycle. The first two parts of the strategy, namely “all banks go fintech” and “future-proofing Hong Kong for Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)” mainly sought to create more demand for fintech adoption.  The other parts of the strategy relate to data, infrastructure, talent and funding, which are vital to the growth of the ecosystem.\n\nUnder this strategy, a number of new initiatives were introduced, such as the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) fintech pilot trial facility which allows financial institutions and technology firms to conduct pilot trials and obtain early feedback from regulators and users on their cross-boundary fintech initiatives, and the pilot launch of the Commercial Data Interchange which leverages the use of alternative data to facilitate SME financing.  We have also stepped up research on the application of wholesale CBDC to cross-border payments, and explored the prospect of e-HKD, which will increase Hong Kong’s readiness in terms of adopting CBDCs and in turn future-proof our city’s financial infrastructure in the decades ahead.\n\nWhile we capitalise on the new opportunities presented by technological advancement, we also continue to build on our existing achievements as well as watch out for new risks that may arise.  For example, the Faster Payment System (FPS) introduced in 2018 has grown rapidly over the years, with the number of registrations reaching 9.6 million at the end of 2021, up 40% year on year.  The average daily turnover also increased 90% from 2020, reaching about 673,000 real-time transactions in 2021.  Meanwhile, in view of the rapid development of crypto-assets particularly payment-related stablecoins, we have issued a discussion paper earlier this year to invite market feedback on the development of an appropriate regulatory framework.\n\nOur new, forward-thinking strategy will set the scene for a healthy growth of the fintech ecosystem.  As the banking sector increasingly adopts fintech to capture the opportunities it offers, this will ultimately benefit both financial institutions and Hong Kong people, while strengthening Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre.\n\n# Hong Kong as the dominant gateway to the Mainland\n\nHong Kong has always played a strategic role in linking the Mainland market with international financial markets, providing international investors with a familiar regime and platform to conduct various kinds of financial, investment and wealth management activities.  The National 14th Five-Year Plan strengthens Hong Kong’s position as an international financial centre, a global offshore renminbi business hub, as well as asset management and risk management centres. This together with global economic trends has reinforced our conviction that Hong Kong should continue to enhance its unique value as a bridge connecting the Mainland and international markets.\n\nIn 2021, we reached a milestone in enhancing connectivity, adding two new members to our family of Connect schemes, namely the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) Scheme in the GBA, and Southbound Trading under Bond Connect, essentially completing the two-way loop of mutual access in a wide spectrum of financial markets including equities, debts and wealth management.  The launch of the two schemes will bring new opportunities for Hong Kong in various aspects. By meeting the increasing diversification needs of Mainland investors, the two schemes will enlarge the customer base of our bond market and wealth management industry.  I am pleased to see that these two schemes have been operating smoothly.  The HKMA will continue to engage the Mainland authorities to further enhance these schemes over time.\n", "zh": "行政長官聲明\n\n2021年是同步鞏固與發展的一年。\n\n在2021年，疫情進入第二年且未見減緩：全球供應鏈受阻，通脹壓力升高，全球金融條件提前收緊的風險增加。 另加變異病毒株的出現以及地緣政治緊張局勢的升級，使局勢更加不可預測。 儘管宏觀環境充滿不確定性，我們仍持續維護金融穩定及操作韌性。\n\n2021年，疫苗的成功推出以及多個經濟體實施的寬鬆貨幣和財政政策，為經濟復甦帶來希望。 全球經濟開始擺脫2020年的嚴重收縮。 在本地方面，經歷2019及2020年的經濟收縮後，香港經濟在2021年增長6.3%，得益於疫苗接種計劃的推行以及政府的抗疫援助措施，為經濟復蘇提供了關鍵支持。\n\n在金融與貨幣穩定得以維持以及宏觀經濟環境趨於穩定的情況下，2021年為我們提供了更多發展工作的空間。 我們把握這一機遇，推進有助於保持金融業高度競爭力的發展措施。 我們在金融科技、綠色金融以及香港作為大陸市場門戶的三大策略優先領域取得了顯著進展。\n\n進入2022年，全球環境轉趨嚴峻。 但俗話說：「艱難時期，英雄當頭。」我們將繼續積極主動，追求發展目標與優先事項，以更好地準備應對下一個挑戰，並鞏固香港作為國際金融中心的地位。 同時，我們亦將堅守承諾，確保香港貨幣及金融系統的健全穩健，因為我們過去一再迎接了諸多挑戰，如今也將如此。\n\n# 貨幣及金融穩定：國際金融中心的基石\n\n自1983年成立以來，聯絡匯率制度（LERS）一直是香港金融系統的重要支柱，也幫助香港應對多次震盪與挑戰。 儘管新冠疫情帶來的不確定性尚未完全解除，加上市場對美國貨幣緊縮步伐的擔憂，香港美元兌換及貨幣市場全年仍有序運作，展現了LERS的韌性。\n\n這種信心並非一夜之間建立，而是建立在多年的堅實基礎之上。 在國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）2021年《外部經濟報告》中，再次強調，聯絡匯率制度的可信性由透明的規則、充足的財政與外匯儲備、嚴格的金融監管與監督、靈活的經濟和謹慎的財政框架所保證。\n\n這種信心也來自我們在公共與市場溝通、以及有效監督方面的努力。 在此方面，我們利用技術和數據分析，加強對金融穩定與宏觀審慎的監測能力，以提供更即時、更全面的分析。\n\n銀行系統的韌性對香港的金融穩定至關重要。 在新冠疫情持續兩年之際，我們的銀行依然展現出韌性，流動性和資本狀況符合國際標準。截至2021年底，本地銀行的資本充足率為20.2%，遠高於8%的最低要求；而2021年第四季度大型銀行的平均流動性覆蓋比率為151.9%，亦遠高於法定的100%最低要求。 儘管面對疫情帶來的嚴峻信貸環境，銀行業的資產質素在全年內保持大致穩定。 行業的不良貸款分類比率於2021年底為0.88%，較2020年底的0.90%略有下降，自2000年以來的長期平均值為1.8%。\n\n# 銀行業：支撐經濟的重要支柱\n\n銀行業一向是經濟的重要支柱。 在新冠疫情帶來的經濟衝擊下，這一角色尤為關鍵。 過去一年，我們面對的主要挑戰是如何在控管信貸風險與支持實體經濟之間取得平衡。 在我們多年的監管工作下，銀行持續有效管理信貸風險。 同時，我們與銀行緊密合作，透過預先批准的貸款寬免計劃（PPPHS）及其他援助措施，為企業和個人客戶提供及時紓困。 2020年啟動的PPPHS，允許合資格的企業客戶預先申請展延六個月的貸款本金償付，並與銀行業中小企貸款協調機制同步運作，至2021年內已兩度延長，直至2022年4月，以應對持續影響的經濟。 隨著2022年2月本地疫情再度升溫，PPPHS亦進一步延長至2022年10月底。在疫情期間，銀行業亦攜手協作，協助企業和個人借款人緩解現金流壓力，雖然部分銀行本身也面臨困難運營條件。\n\n除了信貸環境的挑戰外，疫情亦帶來更嚴峻的營運環境與不斷升級的網絡威脅。 我們已加強措施提高銀行業的運營韌性與網絡安全，以及在數字化趨勢和網絡釣魚詐騙案件激增中保障消費者和投資者的權益。 其中，已修訂《銀行業務守則》，以強化數字金融服務中的客戶保障。\n\n除監管工作外，我們致力於促進金融包容和以客戶為中心的文化。 改善有需要客戶的銀行服務可及性，是我們的優先範疇之一。 我們與業界密切合作，制定行業指南。 在推行防障礙銀行服務及智障人士銀行服務的指引之外，香港金融管理局亦於2021年12月發布一份指引，提出為失智症患者及有特殊需要的客戶提供銀行服務的原則和實踐。\n\n為支持銀行業持續發展，並面對未來新機遇與挑戰需要新技能，香港金融管理局制定了全面的人才發展策略——「連繫人才，迎接未來」，旨在系統性培養未來人才和提升現有從業員技能。 該策略包括三個「連接」方向：連接學生與銀行業、連接從業員與銀行未來，以及連接主要利益相關者以促進合作。我們已推行多項宣傳推廣活動，吸引更多學生進入銀行業。 為使大學生能更好地迎接未來，我們與香港銀行學會合作推出了「未來銀行橋接計劃」，涵蓋實用銀行知識和行業需求高的軟技能課程。 對於現有從業員，我們亦密切與業界合作，提供更多在職培訓機會，提升專業能力。 2021年12月，擴展專為銀行從業員設計的《金融科技》模塊正式推出。\n\n金融人才是香港作為國際金融中心未來發展的關鍵。我們將與所有利益相關者攜手合作，繼續擴充行業人才庫。\n\n# 國際金融中心：以無與倫比的機會接入力保持強大競爭力\n\n香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力，來自於其享有的無與倫比的機會。普遍認為，全球金融科技的推廣、大陸金融市場的開放以及綠色與可持續金融的普及，為香港金融行業的未來發展帶來巨大機遇。在香港金融管理局，我們投入大量努力，利用香港的獨特優勢來捕捉這些機遇。 先談金融科技和內地的機遇。\n\n# 全面推動金融科技\n\n疫情明確展現了金融科技的力量，並永久改變了顧客對金融服務的行為。 為確保我們繼續領先於全球金融科技領域，並充分挖掘金融科技的潛能，我們必須建立一個讓金融科技價值在所有層面和群體中得到體驗的生態系統。\n\n這一願景促使我們制定了新策略「金融科技2025」，於2021年6月公布。 顧名思義，該策略旨在助力金融行業於2025年前全面採用科技。 策略涵蓋五個重點領域，囊括建立成功生態系統所需的元素，以及促進生態系統進入良性循環的正向因素。 其中，前兩個部分：“全面推行金融科技”及“為香港數字央行貨幣（CBDCs）打造未來”，主要旨在提升市場對金融科技的需求。 其他部分則涉及數據、基礎建設、人才以及資金，對生態系統的長遠發展至關重要。\n\n根據這一策略，我們引入多項新措施，包括粵港澳大灣區（GBA）金融科技試點平台，讓金融機構和科技公司試點跨境金融科技項目，並獲得監管者和用戶的早期反饋；以及商業數據交換平台（CDI）試點，利用替代數據促進中小企融資。同時，我們亦加強跨境支付中商品性央行數字貨幣（CBDC）的應用研究，探索電子港元（e-HKD）的前景，進一步提升香港適應CBDC的能力，為未來數十年的金融基礎設施做足準備。\n\n在抓住科技進步帶來的新機遇同時，我們亦持續深化已有成就，並警覺潛在風險。例如，2018年推出的快速支付系統（FPS），逐年快速增長，截至2021年底，註冊用戶達960萬，年增40%。日均交易額較2020年增長90%，2021年約有673,000筆即時交易。同時，面對加密資產，尤其是支付相關穩定幣的快速發展，我們今年初發佈研討文件，徵求市場意見，討論制定適當的監管框架。\n\n我們的前瞻性策略將為金融科技生態系統的健康發展奠定基礎。 隨著銀行業日益採用金融科技以把握新機遇，最終將惠及金融機構與香港市民，同時鞏固香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。\n\n# 香港作為通向內地的主要門戶\n\n香港一直在連結內地市場與國際金融市場方面扮演戰略角色，為國際投資者提供熟悉的制度和平台，展開各類金融、投資及財富管理活動。 國家「十四五規劃」加強了香港作為國際金融中心、人民幣跨境業務樞紐以及資產管理和風險管理中心的地位。 這些亮點與全球經濟趨勢共同鞏固了我們的信念，即香港應持續提升作為內地與國際市場之間橋梁的獨特價值。\n\n2021年，我們在增強連通性方面邁出重要一步，新增了兩個連結方案：大灣區跨境財富管理通（Cross-boundary WMC）方案，以及「債券通」南向交易。 這些舉措基本完成多元金融市場（股票、債券與財富管理）雙向互通的循環。 這些方案的推出將為香港帶來多方面的新機遇。它們能滿足內地投資者日益多樣化的需求，擴大我們債券市場和財富管理業的客戶群。 我高興看到這些方案運作順利。 香港金融管理局將繼續與內地當局合作，逐步提升這些連結措施的範圍與深度。"}

{"en": "# Priorities for 2022 and Beyond\n\nGlobal and local conditions deteriorated notably entering 2022. On the one hand, the escalation of the Ukraine situation and expectations of rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve triggered market volatility. On the other hand, the local economy took a hit from the new wave of COVID-19 pandemic. That said, Hong Kong’s financial system remains well-positioned to withstand adverse shocks given its resilience and buffers built up over the years. Looking ahead, the HKMA will continue to attach high importance to safeguarding monetary and financial stability. In doing so, we will endeavour to stay ahead of the curve by identifying emerging risks and responding to them in an agile manner. At the same time, the HKMA will seek opportunities that would help bolster Hong Kong’s status as a leading international financial centre. In managing the Exchange Fund in this complicated investment environment, the HKMA will continue to invest prudently, while remaining flexible, implementing defensive measures as appropriate, and maintaining a high degree of liquidity.\n\n# STABILITY AND INTEGRITY OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM\n\nThe global economic outlook remains subject to significant uncertainties.  The HKMA will keep abreast of latest developments and stay vigilant against potential risks, with the aim of upholding the resilience and stability of the financial system, which are essential for the ongoing provision of critical financial services that support the functioning of the Hong Kong economy.\n\n# Staying vigilant against potential risks\n\nLooking ahead, markets may be subject to heightened volatilities amid increased uncertainties on various fronts. On the one hand, the US Federal Reserve’s monetary policy normalisation, if continuing at a fast pace, may tighten global financial conditions visibly ahead and increase the global debt-servicing burden.  On the other hand, following the escalation of the Ukraine situation in early 2022, geopolitical uncertainties including the China–US tension may continue to stay high and trigger bouts of financial market volatility again.  Last but not least, with the evolving pandemic developments, there might be a potential downside scenario where lockdowns were to be re-imposed at a large scale, leading to persistent global supply bottlenecks and adversely affecting global growth and inflation.  Having said that, Hong Kong’s financial system is well-positioned to withstand adverse shocks given the resilience and buffers built up over the years.  The HKMA also has the capability, resources and commitment to safeguard Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nThe HKMA will continue to closely monitor risks and vulnerabilities in the domestic and external environments and stand ready to deploy appropriate measures where necessary to maintain Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. Research programmes in 2022 will study issues affecting the Hong Kong economy and assess their potential risks. Meanwhile, the HKMA’s ongoing Digitalisation Programme will help enhance its surveillance capabilities to support more holistic surveillance and comprehensive analysis of the financial system.\n\n# Maintaining banking stability\n\nAs developed markets tighten monetary policies and the impact of the pandemic lingers, the credit landscape facing the banking sector is expected to remain challenging. At the same time, rapid technological advancement and digitalisation present both opportunities and challenges to the banking sector.  Facing an ever-changing financial landscape, the HKMA strives to ensure banks’ ability to withstand shocks through its ongoing supervisory efforts. At the same time, the HKMA will also continue to enhance and refine its banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account international standards and best practices.\n\n# A risk-based supervisory focus\n\n# Credit risk\n\nIn 2022, the HKMA will step up the surveillance of banks’ credit risk exposures and take proactive steps to ensure that overall risk levels remain well contained.\n\nThe HKMA will also continue to monitor the development of the pandemic and its effect on the operating conditions of corporates, as well as maintain close dialogue with the banking and commercial sectors while keeping the various relief measures under review.\n\n# Operational and technology risks\n\nWith the issuance of the new Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module on “Operational Resilience” in May 2022, the HKMA will continue to engage the industry and understand authorized institutions’ (AIs’) progress in developing their operational resilience frameworks.  In parallel, the HKMA will seek to raise the banking sector’s cyber resilience by following up with AIs on issues revealed by the assessments under the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 and monitoring AIs’ implementation of secure tertiary data backup.  Another key supervisory focus will be evaluating and addressing the risks from AIs’ growing dependency on technology service providers.\n\nWith enhanced digital capabilities and extensive remote working experience accumulated during the pandemic, some AIs are planning to transition to a hybrid working model on a business-as-usual basis.  The HKMA will keep track of this development and assess whether the associated risks are adequately addressed by the industry.\n\n# Liquidity and market risks\n\nThe HKMA will focus on the supervision of AIs’ liquidity and market risk management in 2022.  In particular, the HKMA will continue to monitor AIs’ progress in transitioning away from the remaining London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) settings before these settings cease to be published by 30 June 2023.\n\n# Combating money laundering and terrorist financing\n\nIn 2022, the HKMA’s work on anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) will continue to focus on strengthening response to fraud and financial crime through collaboration and information sharing, pursuing closer co-operation with various stakeholders in the AML/CFT ecosystem.  Other priorities are to implement a wider range of risk-sensitive supervisory techniques, by leveraging enhanced data and supervisory technology (Suptech) capabilities, and promote the use of Regtech by banks, including transaction monitoring systems.\n\nThe HKMA will also keep working closely with the Government, the banking and stored value facility (SVF) sectors to publish an updated Hong Kong money laundering and terrorist financing risk assessment, and assist the industry in combatting new and emerging risks.  Work will also continue on understanding evolving money laundering and terrorist financing risks, implementing changes to AML law and related guidance to align with international standards, and maintaining proactive engagement with other regulators and international standard setters.\n\n# Wealth management and mandatory provident fund-related businesses\n\nIn 2022, the HKMA will carry out on-site examinations and off-site surveillance of AIs’ conduct in relation to wealth management and the selling of securities, mandatory provident fund (MPF) and other investment and insurance products, with a focus on the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) Scheme in the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area, digital advisory platforms, complex products, virtual assets and non-investment-linked long term insurance products.\n\nWhile maintaining close communication with other regulators and the banking industry, the HKMA will provide further guidance on regulatory standards in relation to the sale of investment, insurance and MPF products.  This will cover, among other things, investment services related to virtual assets and the selling of Protection Linked Plans, a new subset of investment-linked assurance scheme products with high level of insurance protection.  The HKMA, the Insurance Authority and the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority will jointly launch a mystery shopping programme on the selling practices of intermediaries in respect of Qualifying Deferred Annuity Policies and Tax-deductible Voluntary Contributions.\n\nFollowing the smooth launch of the Cross-boundary WMC, the HKMA will continue engaging the industry and relevant regulatory authorities to enhance the scheme.\n\nMoreover, the HKMA will embark on preparation work for supervising AIs’ trust business under a new SPM module and a new Code of Practice.\n\n# Oversight of financial market infrastructures\n\nThe HKMA will continue to promote the safety and efficiency of the financial market infrastructures (FMIs) under its oversight, in accordance with the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO), the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMI)1, and the various guidances issued by the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI).  It will fine-tune the FMI oversight framework taking into account the latest technological and market developments.\n\nThe HKMA will work with the FMIs on their observance of the PFMI, conducting and updating assessments as appropriate. In addition, the HKMA will continue to participate in the CPMI-IOSCO PFMI implementation monitoring and assessment exercise.  The HKMA will also participate in the work of international standard setting bodies and strengthen its oversight requirements in response to market and technology developments and in line with international practices.  The HKMA will work with relevant authorities to further strengthen co-operative oversight arrangements where appropriate.\n\n# Policy development\n\nThe HKMA will continue to enhance and refine its banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account international standards and best practices.\n\n# Implementation of Basel standards in Hong Kong\n\n# Capital standards\n\nThe HKMA will continue to enhance the capital framework with the implementation of the standards published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) in recent years, which include the following:\n\nThe Capital Requirements for Banks’ Equity Investments in Funds of December 2013 (EIF standard), which will come into effect on 1 July 2022 with the Banking (Capital) (Amendment) Rules 2022 commencing operation after negative vetting by the Legislative Council.\n\nThe revised capital standards set out in the Basel III Finalising Post-crisis Reforms of December 2017, the Minimum Capital Requirements for Market Risk of January 2019 (revised in February 2019), and the Targeted Revisions to the Credit Valuation Adjustment Risk Framework of July 2020, which are collectively referred to as the “Basel III final reform package”.  These revised capital standards set out the revised capital treatment of credit risk, market risk, credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk and operational risk, introduce an output floor requirement, and enhance the leverage ratio framework.  Amendments to the Banking (Capital) Rules (BCR) are being prepared in consultation with the industry with a view to them taking effect from 1 July 2023 as minimum requirements (except for those on market risk and CVA risk2).\n\nGiven that the capital treatment for sovereign concentration risk under the BCR was designed to complement the Basel Committee’s large exposure framework as implemented by the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules, the HKMA will propose amendments to the capital rules in parallel with relevant changes to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules.\n\n# Exposure limits\n\nThe HKMA will continue its work on the proposed amendments to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules in consultation with the industry and the Department of Justice with a target implementation date aligned with the one for the Basel III final reform package, i.e. 1 July 2023.\n\n# Disclosure standards\n\nNew or revised disclosure requirements associated with the revised capital standards in the Basel III final reform package are mainly set out in the Pillar 33 Disclosure Requirements – Updated Framework and the Revisions to Market Risk Disclosure Requirements, published by the Basel Committee in December 2018 and November 2021 respectively.  The Basel Committee also published the Revisions to Leverage Ratio Disclosure Requirements in June 2019 amending the disclosure requirements for leverage ratio to address concerns regarding potential “window-dressing” (i.e. banks reducing the volumes of certain transactions around reporting dates to artificially inflate their leverage ratios for reporting and public disclosure).  Corresponding amendments to the Banking (Disclosure) Rules to implement these new or revised disclosure requirements are also being prepared, with a view to having them take effect in Hong Kong along the same timelines as their associated revised capital standards.\n\n# Other supervisory policies and risk management guidelines\n\nTo reflect developments in regulatory requirements and international standards, the HKMA plans to update certain SPM modules, including those relevant to the implementation of the revised capital and disclosure standards in the Basel III final reform package, “Countercyclical Capital Buffer – Approach to its Implementation”, “Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book”, “New Share Subscription and Share Margin Financing” and “Stress Testing”.  The HKMA will also continue to work on the revised SPM modules on “Code of Conduct” and “Reporting Requirements Relating to Authorized Institutions’ External Auditors under the Banking Ordinance”, with an aim to finalising the revisions within 2022. Consequential to the proposed amendments to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules, the related Code of Practice and SPM modules, e.g. CR-G-8 on “Large Exposures and Risk Concentrations” and CR-G-9 on “Exposures to Connected Parties”, will be updated accordingly.\n", "zh": "2022年及未來的優先事項\n\n2022年開始，全球與本地情況顯著惡化。一方面，烏克蘭局勢升級以及美聯儲預期升息引發市場波動；另一方面，本地經濟受到新一波COVID-19疫情的打擊。儘管如此，香港的金融體系憑藉其韌性與多年累積的緩衝，有良好的韌性以抵禦不利沖擊。展望未來，金管局將繼續高度重視維護貨幣及金融穩定。在此過程中，我們將努力領先一步，識別新興風險並以敏捷反應。同時，金管局將尋找機會，促進香港作為國際金融中心的地位提升。在管理外匯基金方面，面對複雜的投資環境，金管局將繼續審慎投資，同時保持靈活性，採取必要的防禦措施，並維持高水準的流動性。\n\n金融體系的穩定性與完整性\n\n全球經濟前景仍存重大不確定性。金管局將密切追蹤最新動態，警惕可能的風險，並致力於維護金融體系的韌性與穩定性，這些都是持續提供支持香港經濟運作的關鍵金融服務的前提。\n\n對潛在風險保持警覺\n\n展望未來，市場在多方面不確定性增加下，可能會出現更高的波動性。一方面，美聯儲貨幣政策正常化若持續快速推進，可能會明顯收緊全球金融條件，增加全球債務服務負擔；另一方面，隨著2022年初烏克蘭局勢升級，地緣政治不確定性（包括中美之間的緊張局勢）可能保持高位，並再次引發金融市場波動。最後，隨著疫情發展的變化，可能重新實施封鎖措施，導致全球供應鏈瓶頸持續，進而影響全球經濟增長與通脹。然而，鑑於多年建立的韌性與緩衝，香港金融體系仍有較好能力抵抗逆股。金管局也具備能力、資源與決心來維護香港的貨幣及金融穩定。\n\n我們將繼續密切監測國內外的風險與弱點，並準備採取適當措施，以維持香港的貨幣及金融穩定。2022年的研究計劃將專注於分析影響香港經濟的議題及其潛在風險。同時，數碼化方案的推行將增強我們的監測能力，以支持更全面的金融系統監督和分析。\n\n維持銀行體系穩健\n\n隨著發達市場收緊貨幣政策及疫情影響持續，銀行業所面對的信貸環境預期將持續具有挑戰性。同時，科技快速進步和數字化轉型，為銀行業帶來機遇與挑戰。面對持續變化的金融格局，金管局將持續監管，確保銀行能抵禦沖擊；同時，我們也將持續優化和完善監管框架及政策，並考慮國際標準與最佳實踐。\n\n基於風險的監管重點\n\n信貸風險\n\n2022年，金管局將加強對銀行信貸風險敞口的監控，並積極采取措施，確保持整體風險水平受控。\n\n此外，我們還將持續監察疫情對企業經營狀況的影響，與銀行和商業界保持密切溝通，並持續檢討各項援助措施。\n\n營運與技術風險\n\n隨著2022年5月新頒布的《監管政策手冊》（SPM）“營運韌性”單元的生效，金管局將持續與業界互動，了解授權機構（AIs）在建立營運韌性框架方面的進展。同時，將追蹤AIs在Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0（網絡韌性評估框架2.0）下的評估結果，並監察其安全第三方數據備份的落實情況，以提升銀行的網絡韌性。另一重點是評估及應對AIs對技術服務提供商日益依賴所帶來的風險。\n\n在疫情期間，部分AIs已累積了數字化能力與遠端工作經驗，計劃向混合辦公模式過渡。我們將追蹤這一動向，評估其伴隨的風險是否獲得充分應對。\n\n流動性與市場風險\n\n2022年，金管局將重點監管AIs的流動性管理及市場風險，尤其關注其逐步退出倫敦銀行同業拆借利率（LIBOR）剩餘設定的進展，以在2023年6月30日停止發布前做好準備。\n\n打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集\n\n2022年，金管局在反洗錢及反恐怖融資（AML/CFT）方面將持續強化對詐騙與金融犯罪的應對措施，加強合作與資訊共享，與相關社群攜手合作。另外，將推行更多風險導向的監管技巧，運用科技提升監管效率（Supervisory Technology, Suptech），並推廣銀行使用監測交易的Regtech工具。\n\n我們也將與政府、銀行及存款易（SVF）行業緊密合作，發布更新的香港洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險評估，協助業界應對新興風險。同時，持續追蹤洗錢與恐怖融資的趨勢，調整相關法例與指引以符合國際標準，並與其他監管機構保持積極交流。\n\n財富管理及強制性公積金業務\n\n2022年，金管局將對AIs在財富管理、證券銷售、強制性公積金（MPF）及其他投資、保險產品的行為進行實地審查和資料監測，特別聚焦於粵港澳大灣區內的跨境理財通（Cross-boundary WMC）、數碼顧問平台、複雜產品、虛擬資產及非投資連結長期保險產品。\n\n在與其他監管機構和銀行界保持密切溝通的同時，金管局將提供關於投資、保險及MPF產品銷售的監管標準指引，內容包括虛擬資產相關投資服務，以及具有較高保障的保障鏈結計劃（Protection Linked Plans），這是投資連結保險新子集。金管局、保險業監管局及強制性公積金計劃局亦將合作推行神秘購物（mystery shopping）計劃，評估中介在合格延期年金保單及稅務扣除自願性供款方面的銷售行為。\n\n成功推行跨境理財通後，金管局將繼續與業界及相關監管機構合作，提升計劃運作。\n\n此外，金管局還將著手制定新《監管政策手冊》單元與行為準則，準備監管AIs的信託業務。\n\n金融市場基礎建設的監督\n\n金管局將持續推進金融市場基礎建設（FMIs）的安全性與效率，根據《支付系統及儲值設施條例》（PSSVFO）、《金融市場基礎設施原則》（PFMI）及支付與市場基礎設施委員會（CPMI）等發布的指南。將根據最新的科技與市場動態調整監督框架。\n\n合作監督方面，金管局將與FMIs合作，確保其遵守PFMI，並適時進行評估與更新。同時，會積極參與CPMI-IOSCO PFMI 實施監測與評估工作、國際標準制定，並根據市場與科技發展加強監督要求。必要時，會與相關部門合作，強化合作監管安排。\n\n政策制定\n\n金管局將持續完善金融監管框架與政策，融入國際標準與最佳實踐，提升監管效能。\n\n香港巴塞爾協議標準的落實\n\n資本標準\n\n金管局將持續完善資本框架，落實巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（Basel Committee）近年頒布的標準，包括：\n\n2013年12月制定的銀行基金投資資本需求標準（EIF標準），自2022年7月1日起生效，經立法會負面審查後由《資本（修訂）條例》於同日施行。\n\n根據2017年12月的《巴塞爾III危機後改革最終修訂》、2019年1月的《市場風險最低資本要求》（2019年2月修訂），及2020年7月的《信貸估值調整（CVA）風險框架有針對性修訂》，形成的“巴塞爾III最終改革方案”。這些修訂標準包括調整信貸、 市場風險、CVA風險和操作風險的資本處理，加入輸出底線要求，並強化槓桿率框架。相關修訂中的《銀行（資本）規則》正與業界協商，預計於2023年7月1日施行（除市場風險和CVA風險外）。\n\n由於根據《銀行（資本）規則》設計的國債集中風險資本處理，是配合巴塞爾委員會大額敞口框架（由《銀行（敞口限額）條例》實施）的，金管局將提出修訂資本規則，同步調整《敞口限額》相關規定。\n\n敞口限額\n\n金管局將持續推進對《銀行（敞口限額）》條例的修訂工作，並與業界及司法部門協商，目標是於2023年7月1日與巴塞爾III改革同步實施。\n\n披露標準\n\n關於巴塞爾III最終修訂包中新增或修訂的披露要求，主要列於《第三支柱披露要求—最新框架》與《市場風險披露修訂》由巴塞爾委員會於2018年12月和2021年11月分別公布。2019年6月，巴塞爾委員會亦發佈修訂“槓桿率披露要求”，修正披露細則以應對“花絮”行為（即銀行在報告日左右縮減某些交易規模以人工提振槓桿比率）的疑慮。相關的《披露（法規）》修訂亦在準備中，預計與相關資本標準同步於香港生效。\n\n其他監管政策與風險管理指引\n\n為反映監管要求與國際標準的最新發展，金管局計劃更新若干《監管政策手冊》（SPM）模組，包括有關修訂資本與披露標準的“應對逆周期資本緩衝——實施方案”、“銀行帳簿的利率風險”、“新股認購及保證金融資”以及“壓力測試”。同時，也會持續修訂“行為守則”及“關於授權機構外部審計師的申報要求”模組，預計在2022年內完成修訂。隨著《銀行（敞口限額）》條例的修訂，相關的行為準則及SPM模組（如CR-G-8“重大敞口及風險集中度”和CR-G-9“與關聯方的敞口”）也將相應更新。"}
{"en": "# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nWith strong merchandise exports, reviving domestic demand and a boost from the Government’s supportive policy measures, the Hong Kong economy resumed positive growth in 2021, reversing the contraction experienced during 2019 and 2020. The labour market also improved, and inflation remained moderate albeit having edged up. While economic recovery is expected to continue after the fifth wave of COVID-19 subsides, its strength and speed are subject to uncertainties and risks, especially those surrounding the pandemic and the path of US monetary policy normalisation.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Real activities\n\nDriven by strong merchandise exports and improving domestic demand, the Hong Kong economy grew by 6.3% in 2021, ending the economic contraction in 2019 and 2020 (Table 1 and Chart 1).  Private consumption recovered, thanks to improved labour market conditions and a boost from the Government’s Consumption Voucher Scheme1. Overall investment spending also rebounded as the business environment and outlook improved2.  Externally, HongKong’s exports of goods saw strong growth for the whole year, in part supported by the continued global economic recovery.  Export of services recorded modest growth, reflecting active regional trade and cargo flows as well as stronger cross-border business and financial activities. Total imports rose appreciably, mainly because of greater domestic and re-export-induced demand.  On a net basis, external trade contributed positively to real gross domestic product (GDP) growth in 2021 (Chart 1) as total exports grew faster than imports.\n\nTable 1 Real GDP growth by expenditure component (period-over-period)\n\nNote: The seasonally-adjusted quarter-on-quarter rates of change in the gross domestic fixed capital formation are not available. Source: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Inflation\n\nInflationary pressures edged up but remained moderate during the year.  Netting out the effects of the Government’s one-off relief measures, the year-on-year underlying inflation rate3 picked up gradually to a mild 1.4% in December (Chart 2)4.  Prices of consumer items such as dining out, transport, clothing and footwear regained upward momentum as local consumption demand improved. Import prices also increased notably alongside bottlenecks in global supply chains and the surge in international energy and commodity prices.  By contrast, the housing component was a drag on overall inflation, reflecting the feed-through of the earlier decline in fresh-letting private residential rentals (Chart 2).  More broadly, slow growth in nominal wage and commercial rentals helped keep domestic business cost pressures in check.  For 2021 as a whole, the underlying and headline inflation rates5 stayed mild at 0.6% and 1.6% respectively.\n\nChart 2 Underlying consumer price inflation\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Labour market\n\nAlongside the domestic economic recovery, the labour market improved in 2021.  After reaching a 17-year high of 7.2% in February, the unemployment rate declined visibly to 4.0% in December6 (Chart 3) and the decline was broad based across most economic sectors.  Overall labour demand strengthened gradually as reflected by a pick-up in total employment (Chart 3) and private sector vacancies, though they were still below their pre-pandemic peaks.  On the other hand, the labour force shrank slightly by 1.3% in December compared with a year earlier, partly due to a modest decline in the labour force participation rate. The year-on-year growth in nominal wage and labour earnings, while moderate, showed signs of acceleration in the first three quarters of 2021, reversing the trend of deceleration during 2019–2020.\n\nChart 3 Labour market conditions\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe local stock market was broadly sluggish during the year, despite a continued rally in some major overseas equity markets (Chart 4).  Extending its rebound in late 2020, the Hang Seng Index rose to a high of 31,085 on 17 February 2021, but market sentiment had turned sharply negative since then owing to a host of factors, including concerns about the new COVID-19 virus variants, potential monetary policy tightening by major central banks and reduced inflows from southbound trading under Stock Connect7.  The Hang Seng Index closed the year at 23,398, down markedly by 14.1% from a year ago.\n\nChart 4 Asset prices\nSources: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market regained some upward momentum in the first half of 2021 alongside better economic prospects, but saw some consolidation in the second half amid weakened asset market sentiments (Chart 4).  Overall, housing prices and transaction volume still recorded an increase of 3.7% and 24.1% respectively in 2021. Household affordability also became even more stretched, partly reflecting reduced household income.  On the other hand, after going through sharp corrections in 2019 and 2020, the non-residential property markets generally improved, with prices and rentals of industrial properties generally rising to their pre-pandemic peaks, whereas those of retail and office spaces remained below their respective peaks.\n\nSee Table B: Major Economic Indicators on pages 326 to 327 for more details, including their trends during 2017–2021.\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nIn early 2022, the fifth wave of local COVID-19 infections has exerted pressures on domestic economic activities. In response, the Government introduced the fifth and the sixth rounds of the Anti-epidemic Fund and additional countercyclical measures under the 2022–23 Budget to help support the economy.  The HKMA, together with the banking sector, also extended the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme to the end of October 2022.\n\nFor 2022 as a whole, economic recovery is expected to continue, albeit at a more moderate pace compared to 2021, partly reflecting the impact of the fifth wave of COVID-19, slower global economic growth, a less favourable base effect and US monetary policy normalisation.  The Government forecasts real GDP growth for 2022 to be in the range of 1–2% and the latest growth estimates by international organisations and private sector analysts averaged 1.1%.  That said, the strength and pace of the recovery are subject to a host of uncertainties and risks, especially those surrounding the pandemic, the Ukraine situation, and the path of US monetary policy normalisation.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nAlongside rising import prices and pandemic-induced logistics disruptions, inflationary pressures are expected to edge up in the near term, but should stay broadly in check owing to soft rentals and mild local labour cost pressures. Market consensus forecasts a headline inflation rate of 2.4% in 2022, while the Government projects the headline and underlying inflation rates to be 2.1% and 2.0% respectively. The fifth wave of local COVID-19 infections has exerted pressures on the labour market in early 2022, especially for contact-intensive sectors.  Further out, labour market conditions will depend on the pandemic developments and the pace of the domestic economic recovery.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector continued to be stable in 2021.  Total banking assets expanded moderately as both loans and deposits increased.  The capital and liquidity positions of the banking sector remained robust. Asset quality stayed at a healthy level by both historical and international standards.\n\n# Balance sheet trends\n\nThe banking sector’s balance sheet grew by 1.9% in 2021. Driven by the economic recovery, total loans recorded a growth of 3.8% during the year, compared with 1.2% in 2020.  Among the total, loans for use in Hong Kong grew by 4.4%, loans for use outside Hong Kong grew by 1.1% and trade finance increased by 14.2%.  Mainland-related lending expanded by 3.6% in 2021, after remaining largely stable in 2020.\n\nOn the liability side, total deposits rose by 4.6% in 2021, compared with 5.4% in 2020.  As total deposits increased at a faster pace than total loans, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio edged down to 71.8% at the end of 2021 from 72.3% a year ago (Chart 5).\n\nChart 5 Loans and deposits of the banking sector\nSource: HKMA.\n\n# Capital adequacy\n\nThe banking sector remained well capitalised. The consolidated total capital ratio of locally incorporated authorized institutions (AIs) stood at 20.2% at the end of 2021.  The Tier 1 capital ratio was 18.2% (Chart 6). Both ratios were well above their respective international minimum requirements of 8% and 6%.\n\nThe Basel III leverage ratio was 7.9% at the end of 2021, well above the statutory minimum requirement of 3% (Chart 7).\n\n# Liquidity\n\nThe liquidity position of the banking sector was sound.  The quarterly average Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) of category 1 institutions8 was 151.9% in the fourth quarter of 2021, well\n\nabove the statutory minimum requirement of 100%. The quarterly average Liquidity Maintenance Ratio (LMR) of category 2 institutions was 59.1%, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 25% (Chart 8).\n\nChart 8 Liquidity ratios of designated AIs\nSource: HKMA.\n\nThe sources of funding of the banking sector remained stable.  The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) of category 1 institutions was 135.3% at the end of 2021, well above the statutory minimum requirement of 100%.  The Core Funding\n\nRatio (CFR) of category 2A institutions9 was 150.3% at the end of 2021, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 75% (Chart 9).\n\nChart 9 Funding ratios of designated AIs\nSource: HKMA.\n\n# Asset quality\n\nAsset quality remained stable during the year and stayed at a healthy level by both historical and international standards. The classified loan ratio was 0.88% at the end of 2021 as compared to 0.90% at the end of 2020, with the overdue and rescheduled loan ratio edging down to 0.56% from 0.57% during the period (Chart 10).  The classified loan ratio for Mainland-related lending was 0.86% at the end of 2021 as compared to 0.96% at the end of 2020.  The delinquency ratios of residential mortgage lending and credit card lending remained low at 0.04% and 0.20% respectively (Chart 11). The HKMA will continue to closely monitor the change in the asset quality of the banking sector.\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe low interest rate environment continued to weigh on the profitability of the banking sector.  The aggregate pre-tax operating profit of retail banks declined by 19.8% in 2021 (Chart 12), mainly attributable to a decrease in net interest income (-13.6%) and an increase in total operating expenses (+7.1%).  These were partly offset by an increase in income from fees and commissions (+9.6%) and a drop in loan impairment charges (-25.1%).  The net interest margin further narrowed to 0.98% in 2021 from 1.18% in 2020 (Chart 13).\n\nRetail banks’ cost-to-income ratio rose to 54.7% in 2021 from 47.0% in 2020 (Chart 14).\n", "zh": "# 經濟與金融環境\n\n憑藉強勁的商品出口、復甦的內需以及來自政府支持政策措施的推動，香港經濟在2021年重拾正增長，扭轉了2019和2020年的收縮局面。勞動市場亦有改善，通脹保持適度，雖然略有上升。預計在第五波新冠疫情消退後，經濟復甦將繼續，但其力度及速度仍受不確定性和風險影響，尤其是疫情相關的不確定性，以及美國貨幣政策正常化的前景。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 實體活動\n\n由於商品出口強勁及內需改善，香港經濟在2021年增長6.3%，結束了2019和2020年的收縮（表1和圖1）。私人消費恢復，得益於勞動市場情況改善及政府消費券計劃的提振。整體投資支出也隨著商業環境及展望改善而反彈（註2）。在外部方面，全年商品出口增長強勁，部分受到全球經濟持續復甦的支持。服務出口錄得溫和增長，反映區域貿易和貨運流量活躍，以及跨境商業和金融活動的增強。進口總額顯著上升，主要由於國內及轉口需求增加。就淨值而言，2021年外貿對實質國內生產總值（GDP）增長提供積極貢獻（圖1），因為出口增長速度比進口快。\n\n表1 按支出組件劃分的實質GDP增長（較前一期間）\n\n註：由於季節性調整後的國內固定資本形成的季度變化率資料不可用。資料來源：統計處。\n\n# 通脹\n\n通脹壓力略有上升，但仍屬適中。在剔除政府一次性救濟措施的影響後，2021年年度普通通脹率逐步上升至1.4%（圖2）。隨著本地消費需求改善，外出就餐、交通、服裝及鞋類等消費品價格重新上升動能。由於全球供應鏈出現瓶頸以及國際能源和商品價格激增，進口價格亦明顯上升。相比之下，房地產部分對整體通脹形成拖累，反映較早期的私人住宅新租的價格下降（圖2）。更廣泛而言，名義工資和商業租金的增長較為緩慢，有助於控制本地商業成本壓力。2021年整體而言，基本和總體通脹率分別保持溫和，為0.6%和1.6%。\n\n圖2 核心消費者物價指數通脹\n資料來源：統計處。\n\n# 勞動市場\n\n伴隨著內需復甦，2021年勞動市場有所改善。在2月達到17年高點7.2%後，失業率明顯下降至12月的4.0%（圖3），且降幅較為廣泛，涵蓋大多數經濟行業。整體勞動需求逐步增強，反映在就業總數（圖3）及私營行業空缺增加，但仍低於疫情前的高峰。同時，勞動參與率略有下降，12月較一年前縮水1.3%。名義工資和勞動收入的年度增長雖溫和，但在2021年前三季度顯示出加快的跡象，扭轉了2019–2020年期間的放緩趨勢。\n\n圖3 勞動市場狀況\n資料來源：統計處。\n\n# 股市\n\n儘管全球某些主要股市持續上升，香港股市整體表現較為低迷（圖4）。從2020年底的反彈延續到2021年2月17日，恒生指數升至31,085點的高位，但此後市場情緒急轉直下，主要由於新冠病毒的變異株擔憂、主要央行可能收緊貨幣政策，以及南向交易資金減少（港股通）（註7）。2021年底，恒生指數收於23,398點，較去年同期大跌14.1%。\n\n圖4 資產價格\n資料來源：評等及估值部門及香港交易及結算所有限公司。\n\n# 房地產市場\n\n2021年上半年，由於經濟前景改善，住宅房地產市場重新獲得部分上升動能，但下半年由於資產市場情緒疲弱出現盤整（圖4）。全年，房價和交易量分別上升3.7%及24.1%。家庭負擔能力亦變得更加緊張，部分原因是家庭收入下降。另一方面，經歷2019及2020年的急劇修正後，非住宅房地產市場普遍改善，工業地產的價格和租金大致回升至疫情前的高點，而零售及寫字樓空間的價格仍低於其各自的高峰。\n\n詳情請參閱第326至327頁的表B：主要經濟指標，包括2017–2021年的趨勢。\n\n# 經濟展望\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n2022年初，本地第五波新冠疫情疫情攀升，對國內經濟活動造成壓力。為此，政府推出第五及第六輪抗疫基金，並在2022–23年度預算案中增加逆周期措施，以支持經濟。香港金融管理局（HKMA）聯同銀行業亦將預先批准的本金支付暫期計劃延長至2022年10月底。\n\n預計2022年經濟復甦將持續，但力度較2021年較為溫和，部分原因包括第五波疫情、全球經濟增長放緩、不利的基數效應及美國貨幣政策正常化前景。政府預測2022年實質GDP增長在1%至2%之間，國際組織及私營分析師的最新預測平均為1.1%。然而，復甦的力度和速度仍受多重不確定性和風險影響，尤其是疫情、烏克蘭局勢以及美國貨幣政策正常化進展。\n\n# 通脹與勞動市場\n\n隨著進口價格上升及疫情引發的物流中斷，短期內通脹壓力預計將進一步上升，但由於租金疲軟及本地勞動成本增長溫和，整體仍能控制。市場普遍預測2022年總體通脹率為2.4%，而政府預測則為2.1%和2.0%。2022年初，因疫情爆發，勞動市場壓力增大，特別是接觸密集型行業。展望未來，勞動市場狀況將取決於疫情走向及國內經濟復甦速度。\n\n# 銀行業表現\n\n2021年，香港銀行業持續穩健。由於貸款及存款均有增長，銀行資產總額適度擴張。資本及流動性狀況依然堅實，資產質素處於健康水平，符合歷史和國際標準。\n\n# 資產負債表趨勢\n\n2021年，銀行業資產規模增長1.9%。隨著經濟復甦，整體貸款較去年增長3.8%，而2020年為1.2%。其中，用於香港的貸款增長4.4%；用於境外的貸款增長1.1%；貿易融資則增長14.2%。大陸相關貸款在2021年擴大3.6%，而2020年保持相對穩定。\n\n在負債方面，2021年存款總額增長4.6%，2020年則為5.4%。由於存款增長速度快於貸款，整體貸存比由去年的72.3%略微下降至71.8%（圖5）。\n\n圖5 銀行業的貸款與存款\n資料來源：香港金融管理局。\n\n# 資本充足情況\n\n銀行業資本充足率依然良好。2021年底，本地授權機構（AIs）的合併總體資本比率為20.2%。核心一级資本比率為18.2%（圖6），兩者均遠高於國際最低要求8%和6%。\n\n2021年底，巴塞爾協議III的杠杆率為7.9%，高於3%的法定最低要求（圖7）。\n\n# 流動性\n\n銀行業的流動性狀況良好。2021年第四季度，一級銀行的平均流動性覆蓋比率（LCR）為151.9%，遠超過法定最低100%。二級銀行的季度平均流動性維持比率（LMR）為59.1%，亦高於法定最低25%（圖8）。\n\n圖8 指定AIs的流動比率\n資料來源：香港金融管理局。\n\n銀行業的融資來源保持穩定。2021年底，一級銀行的淨穩定資金比率（NSFR）為135.3%，遠高於法定最低100%。二級A類銀行的核心資金比率（CFR）為150.3%，亦高於75%的法定最低要求（圖9）。\n\n圖9 指定AIs的資金比率\n資料來源：香港金融管理局。\n\n# 資產質素\n\n年度內資產質素保持穩定，達到健康水平。2021年底，不良貸款比率為0.88%，較2020年底的0.90%略有下降，逾期及重組貸款比例則由0.57%下降至0.56%（圖10）。大陸相關貸款的不良貸款比率為0.86%，低於2020年的0.96%。按揭貸款和信用卡貸款的拖欠率亦低，分別為0.04%和0.20%（圖11）。香港金融管理局將持續密切關注銀行業資產質素變化。\n\n# 盈利趨勢\n\n低利率環境持續對銀行業盈利能力構成壓力。2021年，零售銀行的稅前經營利潤總額下降19.8%（圖12），主要由於淨利息收入下降13.6%及營運成本上升7.1%。收入來自手續費和佣金較去年增加9.6%，而貸款減值損失則下降25.1%，部分抵消了利潤的下滑。2021年淨利息差縮窄至0.98%，較2020年的1.18%（圖13）。零售銀行的成本收入比由2020年的47.0%升至2021年的54.7%（圖14）。"}
{"en": "# Monetary Stability\n\nDespite the lingering uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and increased concerns about the pace of US monetary tightening, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to trade in a smooth and orderly manner.  As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability since it was implemented in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System has shown its strength and resilience to external shocks.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability.  This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\n# The Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n\nCertificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks; Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation; the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of clearing account balances kept with the HKMA; and Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs).  With the HKMA standing ready to sell (or buy) Hong Kong dollars to (or from) banks in exchange for US dollars upon request at 7.75 (or 7.85) per US dollar, when the strong-side (or weak-side) CU is triggered, the Aggregate Balance will expand (or contract) to push down (or up) Hong Kong dollar interest rates that would help move the Hong Kong dollar back to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2021\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nDriven by equity-related demand arising from fundraising activities and the southbound Stock Connects1, the Hong Kong dollar traded close to the strong-side CU at the beginning of the year.  Thereafter, the Hong Kong dollar weakened amid stock market correction and repatriation of initial public offering (IPO) proceeds by some newly listed firms before rebounding slightly in the second quarter due to corporates’ dividend payment needs and net inflows from the southbound Stock Connects.  Stepping into the second half of the year, while the Hong Kong dollar drifted lower amid softened equity market sentiment, it stayed mostly at the strong side of the Convertibility Zone and continued to trade in a smooth and orderly manner (Chart 1).  Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market functioned normally throughout 2021.\n\nChart 1 Market exchange rate in 2021\n\nAs the CUs were not triggered, the total of the Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs remained virtually unchanged at around HK$1,526.3 billion in 2021 (Chart 2). During the year, the HKMA issued a total of HK$80 billion additional Exchange Fund Bills to meet the ongoing demand for Exchange Fund paper by banks amid the abundance of liquidity in the banking system, which led to a contraction of the Aggregate Balance from HK$457.5 billion at the end of 2020 to HK$377.5 billion at the end of 2021.\n\nReflecting the additional issuance of Exchange Fund Bills and the issuance of EFBNs to absorb EFBNs’ interest payments according to the established practice, the outstanding EFBNs increased from HK$1,069.2 billion to HK$1,148.8 billion during the year.  The Monetary Base as a whole remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\n# HK$1,526.3 billion\n\nTotal Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs\n\nChart 2 Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding Exchange Fund papers in 2021\n\n# Money market\n\nWith the sizeable Aggregate Balance, the Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained largely stable at low levels throughout the year (Chart 3).  While the demand for the Hong Kong dollar increased along with the IPO activities during the first quarter, Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs) of various tenors saw little fluctuations.  Thereafter, HIBORs remained largely stable despite concerns about the pace of US monetary tightening.  Towards the end of 2021, HIBORs witnessed mild pick-ups, partly reflecting anticipated funding needs towards the year end.  On the retail front, banks kept their Best Lending Rates unchanged.  Overall, Hong Kong’s money markets continued to function normally.  Discount Window borrowing decreased to HK$6.8 billion in 2021 from HK$9.1 billion in 2020.\n\nChart 3 Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates in 2021\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nThe Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has been a strong anchor of Hong Kong’s financial system for more than three decades and has shown its strength and resilience to challenges.  Despite lingering uncertainties surrounding global economic recovery, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to function in an orderly manner, reflecting the robustness of the LERS.  The Government is firmly committed to the LERS.  In its 2021 External Sector Report, the International Monetary Fund once again reiterated that the credibility of the LERS has been assured by a transparent set of rules, ample fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nA robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS.  Hong Kong’s banking sector continued to operate smoothly with liquidity positions and capitalisation faring very well by international standards.  To ensure resilience of the banking sector, the HKMA has been closely monitoring banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and has maintained its supervisory efforts on bank lending.\n\nTo improve transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998.  The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) moved within a range of 109.8–110.5% during 2021, without touching the Upper or the Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 110.2% on 31 December (Chart 4). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate.  The ample financial resources of the Exchange Fund, together with the sound banking system, provide a powerful backstop to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nChart 4 Daily movement of the Backing Ratio in 2021\n\n# Currency Board Sub-Committee\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong.  In 2021, the CBC considered issues, including an assessment of inflation in the US, implications of the US dollar depreciation on Hong Kong, assessment of the taper tantrum risk and its impact on Hong Kong, and understanding the influence of Mainland-related fund flows on monetary conditions in Hong Kong.  Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and reports on the Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Notes and coins\n\nAt the end of 2021, the total value of banknotes issued by note-issuing banks in circulation was HK$592.6 billion, an increase of 5.9% from a year earlier (Charts 5, 6 and 7). The total value of Government-issued notes and coins in circulation amounted to HK$12.9 billion at the end of 2021, up 1.7% year on year (Charts 8 and 9).\n\n# HK$592.6 billion, +5.9%\n\nTotal value of banknotes issued by note-issuing banks\n\n# HK$12.9 billion, +1.7%\n\nTotal value of notes and coins issued by Government\n\n# Chart 5\n\nBanknotes in circulation by note-issuing banks at the end of 2021\n\n# Chart 6 \n\nDistribution of banknotes in circulation at the end of 2021\n\n# Hong Kong banknotes\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA arranged 14 seminars for more than 4,000 participants, including professionals in the banking and retail industries as well as students, to help enhance their knowledge and skills in differentiating between authentic and counterfeit banknotes.  These public education programmes on the design and security features of Hong Kong banknotes are well received.\n\n# Coin Collection Programme\n\nThe Coin Collection Programme continued to be well received by the public.  More information about the Programme can be found in the Sustainability chapter on page 198.\n\n# Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\n\nThe EFBN Programme continued to operate smoothly. To meet the ongoing demand for Exchange Fund paper by banks amid the abundance of liquidity in the banking system, the HKMA issued a total of HK$80 billion additional Exchange Fund Bills in the second half of 2021.  The additional issuance resulted in a corresponding reduction of the Aggregate Balance.  At the end of 2021, the nominal amount of outstanding Exchange Fund papers stood at HK$1,148.6 billion (Table 2).\n\nTable 2 Outstanding issues of Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\n\n# Monetary research\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMR)  maintained a steady research output in 2021 despite the ongoing pandemic.  During the year, the HKIMR released 30 working papers and held nine webinars, which encompassed a wide range of topics including monetary policy, banking stability, market microstructure and financial technology (fintech) development.  The HKIMR also organised an international conference and a webinar in hybrid format.\n\nThe webinar, titled RMB Exchange Rate Formation Mechanism and Exchange Rate Outlook, was co-organised with the Hong Kong Academy of Finance on 17 August.  It was live-streamed on a number of online platforms and attracted a total of over 1.16 million real-time views.\n\nThe 11th Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy, titled On the Path to Common Prosperity: China’s Economic Development in Dual Circulation, was held on 11 November.  The conference discussed recent policy developments related to common prosperity, dual circulation, anti-monopoly regulations, property market, Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect and financial developments in the Greater Bay Area5.  Expert speakers also presented in-depth analyses on the impact of population ageing and the sustainability of social security funds, as well as China’s contribution to global financial stability and world economy.  The six different sessions of the conference attracted over 3,200 online and on-site viewers, totaling 5,900 views.\n\n", "zh": "貨幣穩定\n\n儘管COVID-19疫情帶來的延續性不確定性以及對美國貨幣緊縮步伐的擔憂增加，香港美元兌換及貨幣市場仍然保持平穩有序的交易。自1983年實施以來，聯繫匯率制度作為香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石，已展現出其堅韌性與抗外部震盪的能力。\n\n目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的首要目標是貨幣穩定。這被定義為香港貨幣在外匯市場相對美元的外部匯值保持穩定，在HK$7.75至7.85之間的匯率波動範圍內。貨幣制度的結構主要由貨幣局制度構成，要求貨幣基礎帳戶至少由在交易基金持有的美元儲備100%支持，且貨幣基礎的變動必須與美元儲備的相應變動100%匹配。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n\n債券證書，為三家發鈔行發行的鈔票提供全額背書；由政府發行且流通中的貨幣紙幣與硬幣；結算帳戶餘額合計，即與香港金融管理局保持結算帳戶餘額的總和；以及由港府代表港交所發行的交易基金票據（EFBNs）。\n\n通過自動利率調整機制和港交所堅定承諾履行兌付承諾（CUs），保持香港美元兌換率的穩定。當強方（或弱方）兌付承諾被觸發時，港交所準備按每美元7.75（或7.85）出售（或購買）港幣，以美元兌換，則結算餘額將擴大（或縮小），從而壓低（或抬高）香港美元的利率，幫助匯率回到7.75至7.85的兌付區間內。\n\n2021年回顧\n\n匯率穩定\n\n由籌資活動及南向通股票連接引發的股權需求推動，年初港幣接近強方兌付承諾範圍。隨後，股市調整及部分新上市公司回流IPO資金使港幣走弱，第二季度由於企業派息需求及南向通資金淨流入，港幣略有反彈。進入下半年，儘管股市情緒轉弱，港幣大致仍留在兌付區的強側，並保持平穩有序（圖表1）。整體而言，2021年港幣兌換市場所運作正常。\n\n圖表1 2021年市場匯率\n\n由於兌付承諾未被觸發，2021年結算帳戶餘額與未償還的EFBNs總額幾乎保持不變，約為1,526.3億港元（圖表2）。年度內，港交所有額外發行80億港元的交易基金票據，以滿足銀行對交易基金票據的持續需求，這在銀行系統流動性充裕的背景下，導致結算餘額由2020年底的457.5億港元縮減至2021年底的377.5億港元。\n\n反映額外發行的交易基金票據及為吸收EFBN利息支付而發行的EFBNs，未償還的EFBNs在年內由1,069.2億港元增加至1,148.8億港元。貨幣基礎整體仍然由外匯儲備完全支持。\n\n港幣1,526.3億\n\n結算餘額與未償還EFBNs總額\n\n圖表2 2021年結算餘額（折扣窗口前）與未償還的交易基金票據\n\n貨幣市場\n\n由於結算餘額充裕，全年港幣銀行間拆息保持低穩（圖表3）。雖然第一季度伴隨IPO活動，港幣需求增加，香港銀行同業拆借利率（HIBOR）在不同期限內波動不大。此後，儘管市場擔憂美國貨幣緊縮速度，加息預期仍使HIBOR大致保持穩定。臨近年底，HIBOR略為上升，部分反映年底資金需求的預期。零售層面，銀行保持最優惠貸款利率不變。整體來看，香港貨幣市場持續正常運作。折扣窗口借款由2020年的91億港元减少至2021年的68億港元。\n\n圖表3 2021年香港美元銀行間拆息\n\n聯繫匯率制度\n\n聯繫匯率制度（LERS）作為香港金融体系的堅實支柱，已經超過三十年，並扮演著強大的抗壓能力。儘管全球經濟復甦的不確定性仍在，香港美元兌換和貨幣市場仍正常運作，展現了LERS的韌性。政府堅定支持LERS。在其2021年外部部門報告中，國際貨幣基金組織再次重申，LERS的可信度由一套透明的規則、充足的財政和外匯儲備、嚴格的金融監管與監督、彈性的經濟結構以及謹慎的財政框架共同保障。\n\n穩健的銀行系統對LERS的正常運作至關重要。香港的銀行行業持續運行順暢，流動性充裕，資本狀況根據國際標準表現良好。為保障銀行業的韌性，港交所密切監測銀行的信貸管理、流動性和利率風險及壓力測試結果，並保持對銀行貸款的督導力度。\n\n為增強貨幣局帳戶透明度，自1998年10月起，已將一部分交易基金資產分配用於支持貨幣基礎。根據年度，其背書比率（定義為背書資產除以貨幣基礎）在109.8%至110.5%範圍內波動，未觸及上下觸發水平。2021年12月31日收盤時，比率為110.2%（圖表4）。在LERS下，儘管已為背書投資組合指定部分交易基金資產，所有交易基金資產均可用來支持港幣匯率。交易基金充足的財政資源結合穩健的銀行系統，為香港的貨幣與金融穩定提供了強大的後盾。\n\n圖表4 2021年背書比率每日變動\n\n貨幣局委員會子委員會\n\n貨幣局顧問委員會的貨幣局子委員會（CBC）負責監測和審議與香港貨幣與金融穩定相關的事宜。2021年，CBC討論了美國通脹情況、美元貶值對香港的影響、縮減購債規模風險（taper tantrum）及其對香港的影響，以及內地資金流動對香港貨幣形勢的影響等議題。這些討論記錄及提交CBC的貨幣局運作報告均已公布在港交所網站。\n\n鈔票與硬幣\n\n2021年末，流通的由發鈔行發行的鈔票總值為5926億港元，同比增加5.9%（圖表5、6、7）。由政府發行的鈔幣及硬幣的流通總值為129億港元，同比增長1.7%（圖表8、9）。\n\n鈔票總值：5926億，+5.9%\n\n政府鈔幣及硬幣總值：129億，+1.7%\n\n圖表5 發鈔行持有的流通鈔票\n\n圖表6 2021年流通鈔票分佈\n\n香港鈔票\n\n今年，港交所安排了14場研討會，超過4,000名參與者，包括銀行和零售行業的專業人士以及學生，以提升他們辨識真偽鈔票的知識與技能。這些關於香港鈔票設計和安全特徵的公共教育項目反響良好。\n\n硬幣收集計畫\n\n硬幣收集計畫持續受到市民熱捧。更多相關資訊可於第198頁的可持續性章節中查閱。\n\n交易基金票據\n\n交易基金票據計畫（EFBN）持續正常運作。為滿足銀行持續對交易基金票據的需求，2021年下半年港交所發行了總額80億港元的額外交易基金票據。此擴大量的發行使結算餘額相應縮減。到2021年底，未償還的交易基金票據的名義總額為1,1486億港元（表2）。\n\n表2 交易基金票據未償還發行數量\n\n貨幣研究\n\n儘管疫情持續，香港貨幣及金融研究所（HKIMR）在2021年仍保持穩定的研究產出。今年內，該所發表了30份工作文件，舉辦了九場網絡研討會，內容涵蓋貨幣政策、銀行穩定、市場微觀結構及金融科技（FinTech）等廣泛議題。HKIMR還組織了國際會議和混合形式的網絡研討會。\n\n與香港金融學院於8月17日合辦的題為「人民幣匯率形成機制與匯率展望」的網絡研討會，直播於多個平台，吸引超過116萬人次的實時觀看。\n\n第十一屆中國經濟國際年會於11月11日舉行，主題為「共同繁榮之路：雙循環中的中國經濟發展」。會議討論了與共同繁榮、雙循環、反壟斷規範、房地產市場、跨境財富管理通和粵港澳大灣區金融發展相關的最新政策動態。嘉賓專家還深入分析了人口老齡化與社會保障基金的可持續性、中國對全球金融穩定與世界經濟的貢獻等議題。六個不同的會議環節吸引了超過3,200名線上與現場觀眾，總點擊量達5,900次。"}
{"en": "# Banking Stability\n\nThe banking sector in Hong Kong remained sound and stable in 2021, despite the emergence of more contagious COVID-19 variants, causing uncertainty to global economic recovery.  During the year, the HKMA remained focused on the supervision of authorized institutions’ risk management.  Supervision of authorized institutions’ operational and cyber resilience was also stepped up in light of escalating cyber threats and accelerating digitalisation in the banking sector.\n\nOn conduct supervision, the HKMA provided guidance to banks to facilitate the use of non-face-to-face channels for distributing investment and insurance products, and worked with fellow regulators to formulate supervisory requirements on new products in the market such as insurance-linked securities and virtual assets.  The Code of Banking Practice was also revised to enhance consumer protection in digital financial services.\n\nIn the area of anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT), the HKMA’s priority has been to further strengthen banks’ gatekeeper role in the ecosystem and their ability to prevent and detect illicit fund flows associated with increases in online fraud, mule account networks and other financial crimes during the pandemic.  To increase protection for customer accounts against fraud and financial crimes, the HKMA scaled up collaboration and information sharing with other stakeholders via public-private partnerships.  While supporting remote customer on-boarding, the HKMA also encouraged adoption of other technologies including network analytics through the launch of the first AML Regtech Lab in November.  Internationally, proactive engagement has kept the HKMA at the forefront of global AML/CFT efforts in the Financial Action Task Force.\n\nOn the development front, the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Pilot Scheme in the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area was launched smoothly in September.  During the year, the HKMA continued to execute its two-year roadmap for promoting Regtech adoption in Hong Kong.  Several initiatives were rolled out to lay the foundation for banks’ climate risk management and promote green and sustainable banking more broadly, as discussed in the Sustainability chapter. Further efforts were also made in the area of soft infrastructure, including promoting a customercentric corporate culture, as well as working with the banking industry to roll out capacity-building initiatives to facilitate talent development.\n\nMeanwhile, the HKMA has worked closely with the banking industry in optimising supervisory policies and processes. Good progress was made on implementing international supervisory standards locally, including those on capital adequacy and disclosure.  The HKMA continued to advance its work to ensure a credible resolution regime for authorized institutions, including developing new resolution standards and implementing rules on loss-absorbing capacity requirements to enhance authorized institutions’ resolvability.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system.  Achieving this objective is contingent upon a highly resilient financial system that is capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their businesses and, in extreme cases, by failing in a disorderly manner.  The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring that banks are resilient to shocks and able to recover their positions in crises, ultimately helping to prevent failures.  The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks and is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs).\n\nHowever, the Monetary Authority cannot ensure, nor is the Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework designed to ensure, a zero-risk financial system.  Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that, in the event of an AI becoming non-viable, its failure can be managed in an orderly manner.  To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong has been established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs, among other types of institutions.  To operationalise the resolution regime in Hong Kong, it is important to lay down resolution rules and policy standards, undertake resolution planning to remove impediments to AIs’ resolvability and develop the HKMA’s operational capability to resolve a failing AI.  In order to carry out these tasks effectively, the HKMA adopts an internationally harmonised and co-ordinated approach.\n\nThe Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs). In overseeing FMIs, the HKMA aims to promote their general safety and efficiency, limit systemic risk and foster transparency.  Making FMIs more resilient to financial crises protects the monetary and financial systems in Hong Kong from possible destabilising effects arising from disruption to the FMIs.  Information regarding the HKMA’s oversight approach is available on the HKMA website.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2021\n\n# Licensing\n\nAt the end of 2021, Hong Kong had:\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA granted two banking licences and one restricted bank licence to three non-local banks. The HKMA also granted a money broker approval to a foreign trading platform operator.  The authorizations of three licensed banks and two restricted licence banks were revoked during the year.\n\nMore information about the AIs and local representative offices in Hong Kong can be found in the Annex and Tables D to F on pages 321 to 324, and 330 to 333 respectively.\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nThe HKMA conducted 189 off-site reviews covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL rating assessment1, corporate governance, risk management and financial technology (fintech) strategies.  As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance, 40 meetings were held with the AIs’ boards of directors, independent non-executive directors or board-level committees.  A further 38 tripartite meetings were held among the HKMA, AIs and their external auditors.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA conducted regular on-site examinations supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk.  A total of 679 on-site examinations and thematic reviews were carried out during the year with credit risk management as a key focus. Amid growing adoption of technology by banks, management of operational risk and technology risk was another major area of attention.  The HKMA also increased the number of on-site examinations and thematic reviews targeting liquidity and market risk management.  In addition, specialist teams performed on-site examinations and thematic reviews of AIs’ activities in securities, investment products, insurance and mandatory provident fund (MPF)- related businesses, as well as their anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) controls. Table 1 contains a summary of the HKMA’s supervisory activities in 2021.\n\n# Credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nTotal loans increased by 3.8% in 2021, compared with a growth of 1.2% in 2020.  Table 2 shows the breakdown of growth in loans and advances.\n\nMainland-related lending increased by 3.6% to HK$4,725 billion in 2021 (Table 3).\n\nThe asset quality of the banking sector remained largely stable during the year and stayed at a healthy level by both historical and international standards.  The classified loan ratio of the industry was 0.88% at the end of 2021, down from 0.90% at the end of 2020, well below the long-run historical average of 1.8% since 2000.  The ratio for Mainland-related lending also decreased to 0.86% from 0.96% a year ago.\n\nDuring the year, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to weigh on some sectors of the economy, while credit events in the Mainland property sector caught the attention of the market.  The HKMA enhanced the breadth and depth of its surveillance, with deep-dive reviews focused on banks’ exposures to highly leveraged borrowers. Close communication with banks has been maintained to facilitate up-to-date assessment of the impact of economic and market developments as well as the adequacy of banks’ risk management measures.  The overall credit risk facing the banking sector is assessed to be manageable.  The latest results of the HKMA’s solvency stress tests confirm that the banking sector continues to maintain sufficient capital buffers to withstand extreme stress.\n\nTargeted and thematic examinations were conducted during the year to evaluate AIs’ systems and controls over loan classification and loan loss provisioning, overseas lending operations, and collateralised lending to private banking and wealth management customers.\n\n# Alleviating cash-flow pressure faced by customers\n\nIn September, the HKMA and the Banking Sector Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) Lending Coordination Mechanism announced a six-month extension of the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme until the end of April 2022.  This scheme was first launched in May 2020 to defer loan principal payments of eligible corporate customers by six months.  In light of a resurgence of local coronavirus infections, in February 2022, the scheme was further extended until the end of October 2022.  In addition, the scheme was enhanced to offer a one-year partial principal repayment option to those customers who are financially capable and willing to resume principal repayment gradually.\n\nBy the end of December 2021, banks had approved loan tenor extensions and other forms of relief in over 83,000 cases, involving an aggregate amount of over HK$920 billion. For personal customers, banks had approved more than 52,000 cases of principal payment holidays for residential mortgages and other personal relief loans, amounting to over HK$53 billion.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nThe successive rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures introduced by the HKMA since 2009 have strengthened banks’ risk management and the banking sector’s resilience to a possible abrupt downturn in the local property market.  The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of new residential mortgage loans (RMLs) approved in December 2021 was 53%, compared with 64% in September 2009 before the countercyclical measures were first introduced.  The average debt servicing ratio (DSR) of new mortgages remained low at 36% in December 2021, compared with 41% in August 2010, when a cap on DSR was first applied (Chart 1).\n\n# Operational and technology risks\n\nIn light of banks’ increasing reliance on technology to support their operations, the HKMA stepped up supervision of operational and technology risks.  Key supervisory focuses during the year included controls over cloud outsourcing and remote working arrangements.  The HKMA launched an industry consultation in December on a draft new Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module on “Operational Resilience”. The new SPM module seeks to provide guidance to banks on developing a holistic and integrated operational resilience framework.\n\nThe HKMA introduced the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 in January to reflect the latest sound practices on cyber security risk management.  During the year, the HKMA monitored AIs’ implementation of the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 and reviewed their cyber resilience capabilities.  In view of the growing risk of destructive cyber-attacks, in May, the HKMA requested all AIs to critically assess the need for a secure tertiary data backup, taking reference from the Secure Tertiary Data Backup Guideline issued by the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB).\n\nIn response to heightened risks and rising numbers of phishing attacks, the HKMA worked closely with the industry to strengthen the security of internet and mobile banking services.  A large-scale joint HKMA-HKAB public awareness campaign, themed “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!” began in July (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 Raising public awareness of phishing attacks\n\nSlogan icon for the public awareness campaign themed “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!”\n\n# Liquidity and market risks\n\nTo enhance monitoring of AIs’ liquidity risk exposures, the HKMA introduced additional scenarios into its liquidity stress testing framework to evaluate AIs’ ability to cope with liquidity shocks over a prolonged period.\n\nDuring the year, thematic reviews were conducted to assess the adequacy of AIs’ liquidity stress testing programmes and evaluate the sufficiency of their monitoring metrics and control limits for managing liquidity risk.  The HKMA also carried out reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of AIs’ market risk management frameworks for debt securities investments and operational controls over treasury activities.\n\nThe HKMA closely monitored AIs’ progress in preparing for the transition away from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR).  It collaborated with industry associations and developed tools to assist AIs in supporting their customers’ migration to alternative reference rates, including a leaflet to raise corporates’ awareness of the transition and an information note on options available in the loan markets to replace US dollar LIBOR.  AIs have substantially remediated contracts referencing LIBOR settings which ceased to be published after the end of 2021.  They were reminded not to enter into new LIBOR contracts from 1 January 2022 onwards.\n", "zh": "銀行穩定性\n\n儘管COVID-19病毒出現更具傳染性的變異株，導致全球經濟復蘇的不確定性，香港的銀行業在2021年仍保持健全和穩定。在這一年中，香港金融管理局（HKMA）繼續專注於對授權機構的風險管理監督，並在面對不斷升級的網絡威脅以及銀行業數字化加速的背景下，加強了對營運和網絡韌性的監督。\n\n在行為監管方面，HKMA向銀行提供指南，促進利用非面對面渠道推廣投資和保險產品，並與其他監管機構合作制定市場中新產品如保險掛鈎證券和虛擬資產的監管要求。此外，銀行業務守則也進行了修訂，以加強數字金融服務中的消費者保護。\n\n在反洗錢及反恐融資（AML/CFT）領域，HKMA的重點是進一步強化銀行在生態系統中的守門角色及其預防和偵測非法資金流動的能力，特別是在疫情期間，網上詐騙、走私帳戶網絡及其他金融犯罪活動增加之際。為了提升客戶帳戶對詐騙和金融犯罪的保護，HKMA擴展了與其他利益相關者的合作與資訊分享，通過公私合作夥伴關係來進行。支持遠程客戶首次開戶的同時，HKMA也鼓勵採用其他技術，包括在11月啟動的首個AML風險科技實驗室（Regtech）來推動相關技術應用。在國際層面，HKMA積極參與，確保其在金融行動特別工作組（FATF）中的AML/CFT努力保持領先。\n\n在發展方面，粵港澳大灣區的跨境財富管理互聯試點於九月順利啟動。年內，HKMA繼續執行推動風險科技（Regtech）採用的兩年路線圖，並推出多項措施為銀行的氣候風險管理奠定基礎，推廣綠色與可持續銀行業，詳見可持續發展章節。另方面，HKMA在軟基礎建設方面亦加大努力，包括推行以客戶為中心的企業文化，以及與銀行業合作推出能力建設項目，以促進人才發展。\n\n同時，HKMA密切與銀行業合作，優化監管政策和流程。在本地實施國際監管標準方面取得良好進展，包括資本充足率和披露標準。HKMA持續努力確保授權機構有一個可信的解決方案體系，包括制定新的解決標準和規則，強化損失吸收能力（LAC）要求，以提升授權機構的解決能力（resolvability）。\n\n# 目標\n\nHKMA的總體目標是促進銀行系統的安全與穩定。實現此目標依賴於一個高度韌性的金融體系，能夠提供香港經濟所需的關鍵金融服務。\n\n銀行通過其經營方式可以影響系統穩定性，在極端情況下也可能因失序而導致危機。作為監管當局，HKMA在保障金融穩定方面扮演關鍵角色，主要是確保銀行具備韌性以應對沖擊，並能在危機中恢復其業務，最終幫助防止銀行失敗。HKMA負責銀行的審慎監管，包括授權香港的持牌銀行、有限牌照銀行及吸納存款公司（合稱授權機構，AIs）。\n\n然而，HKMA無法及其監管框架也非旨在確保零風險的金融體系，而是作為解決方案的主管機關，確保在AIs變得不可持續時，該失敗能有序管理。為此，香港已建立金融機構的解決規範框架，HKMA作為AIs的解決主管。此外，為落實該體系，制定解決規則和政策標準、進行解決規劃以消除AIs可解決性阻礙，以及提升HKMA解決失敗AIs的操作能力都至關重要。為高效完成這些任務，HKMA採用國際協調與一致的方法。\n\nHKMA亦負責特定金融市場基礎設施（FMIs）的指定與監督。在監督FMIs時，HKMA旨在提升其整體安全性與效率，限制系統性風險，並促進透明度。提升FMIs的韌性，有助於保護香港的貨幣和金融體系免受市場中斷可能引發的動盪，相關監督方針可在HKMA官方網站查閱。\n\n# 2021回顧\n\n# 許可發放\n\n截止2021年底，香港擁有： \n\n在本年度內，HKMA為三家非本地銀行發放了兩張銀行牌照及一張有限牌照銀行牌照。此外，HKMA亦批准了一家外國交易平台營運商的貨幣經紀商資格。在年內，有三家持牌銀行及兩家有限牌照銀行的授權被撤銷。\n\n有關香港的AIs及本地代表處的詳情，請參見第321至324頁的附件及表格D至F，以及第330至333頁。\n\n# 監管活動概述\n\nHKMA進行了189次非現場審查，內容涵蓋廣泛議題，包括CAMEL評級、公司治理、風險管理和金融科技（fintech）策略。作為促進更強風險治理的一部分，HKMA與AIs董事會、獨立非執行董事或董事會委員會共召開了40次會議。另外，HKMA也與AIs及其外部審計師進行了38次三方會議。\n\n除了非現場活動外，HKMA定期進行現場檢查，並針對較高風險領域進行專題檢討。年內共完成679次現場審查和專題檢討，以信貸風險管理為重點。在銀行逐步採用新技術的背景下，運作風險和技術風險的管理也成為重點。HKMA同時增強了針對流動性和市場風險管理的現場審查和專題檢討。此外，專家團隊亦對AIs在證券、投資產品、保險和強制性公積金（MPF）業務，以及其反洗錢與反恐怖融資（AML/CFT）控制措施進行了審查。第1表總結了HKMA在2021年的監管活動。\n\n# 信貸風險\n\n# 信貸增長與資產質素\n\n2021年整體貸款新增3.8%，高於2020年的1.2%。第2表列出貸款與透支增長的細目。\n\n與大陸相關的貸款在2021年增長3.6%，達到4725億港元（第3表）。\n\n銀行業的資產質素在全年內保持大致穩定，並以歷史和國際標準衡量，保持健康水準。截至2021年底，不良貸款分類比率為0.88%，較2020年底的0.90%略為下降，遠低於2000年以來的長期平均值1.8%。與大陸相關的貸款比率亦由一年前的0.96%下降至0.86%。\n\n年內，COVID-19疫情持續影響部分經濟領域，同時大陸房地產行業的信貸事件引起市場關注。HKMA加強監察範圍與深度，重點調查銀行對高槓桿借款人的曝險情況。並與銀行保持密切溝通，以便實時評估經濟與市場發展的影響及風險管理措施的充分性。整體而言，銀行業面對的信貸風險被認為是可以控制的。HKMA最新的資本充足測試結果亦証明，銀行業仍保持足夠的資本緩衝來應對極端壓力。\n\n年內進行了目標性和主題性審查，評估AIs在貸款分類、貸款損失準備、海外貸款業務，以及私行和財富管理客戶的擔保貸款等方面的系統與控制。\n\n# 緩解客戶現金流壓力\n\n九月，HKMA與銀行業中小企協調機制宣布延長預先批准的本金寬限期將至2022年4月底，為期六個月。該計劃於2020年5月率先推出，允許合資格企業客戶暫緩償付本金六個月。隨著本地疫情反覆，2022年2月再將計劃延長至2022年10月底。此外，計劃亦新增提供一年部分本金償還選項，適合財務允許並願意逐步恢復償還本金的客戶。\n\n截至2021年12月，銀行已批准超過83,000宗貸款展期及其他救濟安排，涉及總額超過9200億港元。個人客戶方面，銀行亦批准了超過52,000宗房貸及其他個人救濟貸款的本金寬限，總額超過530億港元。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n自2009年起，HKMA多輪逆周期宏觀審慎措施的推行有效加強了銀行的風險管理及行業韌性，以應對本地房地產市場可能出現的突發性下行壓力。2021年12月批准的新住宅按揭貸款（RML）平均貸款成數（LTV）為53%，較2009年9月引入逆周期措施前的64%有所降低。新貸款的平均負債比（DSR）保持較低水平，12月為36%，而2010年8月首次實行DSR上限時則為41%（圖1）。\n\n# 營運與技術風險\n\n隨著銀行對科技的依賴日益增加，HKMA加強對營運和技術風險的監督。年度的重點監管範圍包括雲端外包和遠端工作安排的控制措施。HKMA於12月啟動行業諮詢，討論新《監管政策手冊》（SPM）「營運韌性」模組草案，旨在為銀行提出建立全面整合的營運韌性框架的指導。\n\n2023年1月，HKMA推出了「網絡韌性評估框架2.0」（Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0），反映最新的網絡安全管理策略。年內，HKMA監控AIs的該框架實施情況，並審查其網絡韌性能力。鑑於破壞性網絡攻擊風險增加，HKMA於5月要求所有AIs根據香港銀行協會（HKAB）發布的「安全第三資料備份指引」，評估是否需要安全的三級資料備份。\n\n為應對日益升高的詐騙攻擊風險，HKMA與業界密切合作，加強網絡銀行和移動銀行的安全措施。7月起，HKMA與HKAB聯合發動「保障您的個人數字鑰匙，提防詐騙鏈接」的公共宣傳活動（圖1）。\n\n圖1 提升公眾對釣魚攻擊的認識\n\n「保障您的個人數字鑰匙，提防詐騙鏈接！」的宣傳標語圖標\n\n# 流動性與市場風險\n\n為提升對AIs流動性風險暴露的監測能力，HKMA在其流動性壓力測試框架中增設額外情景，以評估AIs抗衡長期流動性Shock的能力。\n\n年內，HKMA進行專題評論，評估AIs流動性壓力測試方案的充分性，以及其監控指標和控制界限在管理流動性風險方面的適切性。同時，亦對AIs的債券市場投資的市場風險管理框架和財資活動的操作控制效果進行了評估。 \n\n此外，HKMA密切關注AIs準備從倫敦同業拆借利率（LIBOR）過渡的進展，協同行業協會開發工具幫助支持客戶遷移至其他指標，包括發布企業過渡意識推廣手冊及有關替代利率的資訊公告。大部分與LIBOR相關的合約已於2021年結束後修正，並提醒銀行自2022年1月1日起不得簽訂新LIBOR合約。"}
{"en": "# International Financial Centre\n\nDuring 2021, the HKMA achieved good progress in strengthening Hong Kong’s status as a globally competitive international financial centre through a multi-pronged approach.\n\nThe HKMA unveiled “Fintech 2025” strategy to promote the wide adoption of fintech by the financial sector and bolster Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub more broadly.  On the Faster Payment System, it has seen a surge in turnover during the year amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOn enhancing connectivity, significant progress was made during the year with the addition of the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect and Southbound Trading under Bond Connect to the suite of Connect schemes.  Thanks to its world-class market infrastructure and the Connect schemes, Hong Kong is the favoured platform for Mainland funds to tap into global markets and for international investors to access the fast-growing Mainland markets.\n\nAlso during 2021, the HKMA devoted significant efforts in creating new business opportunities to strengthen the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, in areas including bond issuance, asset and wealth management, corporate treasury centres, and green and sustainable finance.  To promote Hong Kong’s financial services, the HKMA stepped up market outreach to overseas and Mainland stakeholders to keep them informed about the resilience of Hong Kong’s financial system and the prospects it presents.\n\nMeanwhile, the HKMA is active in international and regional central banking and regulatory forums, contributing to global efforts in maintaining financial stability and promoting financial market developments.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nThe HKMA announced its “Fintech 2025” strategy, covering a series of initiatives to promote wide adoption of financial technology (fintech) and strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia.  The HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO), together with the banking departments, played a pivotal role in driving various key initiatives during the year including the following:\n\n- Promoting regulatory technology (Regtech) adoption\n- Rolling out the Tech Baseline Assessment to understand banks' adoption of fintech\n\nHong Kong’s position as an offshore renminbi hub remained firm, with offshore renminbi businesses registering robust growth during the year.  Inflows into renminbi assets continued to gather pace as the inclusion of onshore securities in major financial market indices continued. Hong Kong plays an indispensable role in facilitating international investors’ increased allocation to renminbi assets, with the Mainland–Hong Kong Connect schemes being widely accepted as the channels of choice for international investors to access onshore capital markets. In 2021, daily turnover under Northbound Bond Connect increased 34% to around RMB25.8 billion.\n\nFollowing the success of Northbound Bond Connect, Southbound Bond Connect was launched in September, completing the two-way connection between the Mainland and international bond markets.  In the same month, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), the HKMA and the Monetary Authority of Macao promulgated the implementation details for the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Crossboundary WMC) Scheme in the Guangdong–Hong Kong– Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA).  In October, eligible banks in Hong Kong started providing Cross-boundary WMC services together with their Mainland partner banks.\n\n\n\nTo enhance Hong Kong’s role as a key offshore renminbi centre, a working group comprising the HKMA, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) was formed to conduct a feasibility study on promoting trading of renminbi-denominated equity securities in Hong Kong.  A joint seminar was also co-organised by the PBoC and the HKMA in December, showcasing Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre and a leading renminbi business hub.\n\nThe HKMA continues to make progress towards strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform.  In particular, to increase Hong Kong’s appeal as a preferred fund domicile, the HKMA worked closely with the Government and the financial industry to provide a more facilitating tax and regulatory environment for fund formation.  Significant strides were also made in further elevating Hong Kong’s position as a regional green and sustainable finance hub, and as a bond issuance centre. At the same time, the HKMA stepped up market outreach to promote Hong Kong’s financial services to overseas and Mainland stakeholders.\n\nSafe and efficient operation of financial infrastructure is fundamental for reinforcing Hong Kong’s position as a leading international financial centre.  In 2021, the four interbank Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) and the Hong Kong Trade Repository achieved 100%1 system availability, outperforming the target of 99.95%.  Following the launch of Southbound Bond Connect in September, the CMU became the settlement and custodian service provider for transactions conducted under both Northbound and Southbound Bond Connect.\n\nAdoption of the FPS continued to expand in 2021. The number of registrations grew to 9.6 million at the end of 2021 and the average daily turnover for the year rose by 90% from 2020.  Increased use of the FPS for settling Government bills, making merchant payments and topping up stored value facility (SVF) e-wallets or bank accounts were the key drivers for the continued rise in transaction volume, on top of a steady growth in person-to-person and business payments.\n\nTo promote the safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA oversees six designated retail payment systems (RPSs) and supervises 15 licensed SVFs under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO).  During the year, the HKMA facilitated the smooth implementation of the Government’s Consumption Voucher Scheme by co-ordinating and promoting dialogues and co-operation between the relevant Government parties and the SVF licensees appointed for the scheme.\n\nIn January 2022, the HKMA issued a discussion paper on crypto-assets and stablecoins, setting out the HKMA’s thinking on the relevant regulatory approach and inviting views from stakeholders.  Relevant factors, including feedback to this discussion paper and recommendations of relevant international bodies, will be taken into account when drawing up the appropriate regulatory regime.\n\nInternationally, the HKMA is an active member of the central banking community and plays a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees.  For example, the HKMA chairs the Working Group on Financial Markets (WGFM) established under the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP)2.  The HKMA also co-chairs the Policy and Standards Group of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), the Non-Bank Monitoring Experts Group and the Financial Innovation Network of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), and leads a team that looks into supervisory issues associated with financial benchmark transition.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2021\n\n# Hong Kong as a fintech hub in Asia\n\n# Fintech 2025\n\nIn June, the HKMA unveiled its “Fintech 2025” strategy to drive fintech development in Hong Kong.  The strategy aims to encourage the financial sector to adopt technology comprehensively by 2025, as well as to promote the provision of fair and efficient financial services for the benefit of Hong Kong citizens and the economy.  The five focus areas of the strategy are:\n\n- All banks go fintech\n- Future-proofing Hong Kong for CBDCs\n- Creating the next-generation data infrastructure\n- Expanding the fintech-savvy workforce\n- Nurturing the ecosystem with funding and policies\n\nThe HKMA’s “Fintech 2025” strategy drives fintech development in Hong Kong\n\n# Fintech Adoption in the Banking Sector\n\nTo support the “All banks go fintech” initiative of the “Fintech 2025” strategy, the HKMA rolled out the Tech Baseline Assessment in June 2021.  The assessment aims to help the HKMA develop a better understanding of the current fintech landscape in the banking sector, and identify which fintech areas may warrant the HKMA’s support.  All licensed banks with significant operations in Hong Kong were requested to develop a three-year plan for fintech adoption by the end of 2021.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA also continued to implement its two-year roadmap to promote Regtech adoption by banks in Hong Kong, and incorporate technology in its own supervisory processes to improve efficiency and effectiveness.  See page 98 of the Banking Stability chapter for more details.\n\n# Wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency\n\nThe HKMA and the Bank of Thailand expanded the scope of their joint research project with the joining of the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates and the Digital Currency Institute of the PBoC in February 2021.  Renamed as “Multiple Central Bank Digital Currency Bridge (mBridge)” and strongly supported by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Innovation Hub Centre in Hong Kong, the project further explores the capabilities of distributed ledger technology to facilitate real-time cross-border foreign exchange payment-versus-payment (PvP) transactions in a multi-jurisdictional context and on a 24/7 basis.  A joint report was published in September to deliver the interim findings, followed by the publication of potential use cases and a future roadmap in November.\n\n# Retail Central Bank Digital Currency\n\nTo future-proof Hong Kong in terms of CBDC readiness, the HKMA started a study on the prospect of issuing retail CBDC in Hong Kong, i.e. e-HKD, covering both technical and policy considerations.  In collaboration with the BIS Innovation Hub Centre in Hong Kong, the HKMA embarked on a study called Project Aurum to explore the technical aspect of issuing retail CBDC.  Separately, an internal cross-departmental working group was set up to study the relevant technical, policy and legal issues.  In October, the HKMA released a technical white paper titled e-HKD: A technical perspective to explore and invite comments on potential technical design options for issuing and distributing retail CBDC.\n\nFurthermore, the HKMA supports the Digital Currency Institute of the PBoC on the technical pilot testing of using e-CNY for cross-boundary payments.  This will help promote interconnection in the GBA and bring greater convenience to Hong Kong and Mainland tourists by enhancing the efficiency and user experience of cross-boundary payments.\n\n# Commercial Data Interchange\n\nIn July, the HKMA hosted a virtual symposium to encourage banks and SVF operators to join the CDI, a next-generation financial data infrastructure that aims to enable more efficient financial intermediation in the banking system.  To further facilitate development and adoption, the launch of the CDI Innovation Hub was announced during the symposium. To facilitate small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) financing, the HKMA completed two phases of proof-of-concept study examining the technical feasibility of the CDI.  Applying alternative data to facilitate credit assessment and the underwriting of loans, more than 550 SME loans exceeding HK$900 million in total were approved by the participating banks during the study.  Based on the encouraging results, the HKMA announced the pilot launch of the CDI in November.\n\nSME owners commend the CDI for streamlining their loan applications\n\n# Talent development\n\nTo expand the fintech talent pool, the HKMA continued to run the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme 2.0 in collaboration with its strategic partners3 to nurture young talent at various stages of their career development. More than 180 students benefitted from the scheme in 2021. Separately, the Industry Project Masters Network scheme was piloted in September to provide opportunities for master’s degree students majoring in fintech to work on real-life fintech projects.  To form strategic partnerships and foster collaboration in areas including fintech talent development, the HKMA entered into memorandums of understanding (MoUs) with four local universities in October.\n\nMr Colin Pou (middle), Executive Director (Financial Infrastructure) of HKMA, at the MoU signing ceremony with four local universities\n\n# Fintech Supervisory Sandbox\n\nThe use of Fintech Supervisory Sandbox (FSS) continued to rise during the year.  As of end-December 2021, a total of 234 pilot trials of fintech initiatives had been allowed in the FSS since its launch in 2016, compared with 193 as of end-2020.  As of end-December 2021, the HKMA had also received in total 666 requests to access the FSS Chatroom for supervisory feedback at the early stage of fintech projects since the introduction of the Chatroom in 2017.

{"en": "# Reserves Management\n\nThe global financial markets embarked on a recovery path in 2021.  Although the global economy continued to be affected by the evolving COVID-19 pandemic situation, a number of factors, including an increasing vaccination rate as well as accommodative monetary policies and fiscal measures around the world, have contributed to notable recovery in the global economy and financial markets.  Against this background, a number of overseas equity markets achieved record highs during the year, and the Exchange Fund’s overall equity holdings were able to achieve a decent return despite the sluggish performance in Hong Kong equities. During 2021, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$191.9 billion, representing an investment return of 4.1%.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong.  The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre.  The HKMA, under the delegated authority of the Financial Secretary and within the terms of the delegation, is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(i) to preserve capital;\n(ii) to ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(iii) to ensure that sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(iv) subject to (i)–(iii), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Exchange Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 Portfolio Segregation of the Exchange Fund\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP).  The BP holds highly liquid US dollardenominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The IP invests primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member economies of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of its assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA diversifies part of the Exchange Fund’s investments in a prudent and incremental manner into a wider variety of asset classes.  This includes emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate.  Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP).  The HKMA has put in place a cap1 to guide the pace of diversification into the LTGP since its inception.  As the LTGP has become increasingly mature in investment scale and asset diversity, the EFAC decided in January 2022 to replace the cap by a target asset allocation that is determined concurrently with that of other asset classes, subject to prudent risk management principles.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007, holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that have been acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes.  The Strategic Portfolio is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of its unique nature.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by Fiscal Reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP2, with the major exception of the Future Fund3, which links its interest rate to the return of both the IP and the LTGP in accordance with the portfolio mix.  The portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 40:60 in 2021.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation.  The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents long-term asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund.  Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark.  This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark (or strategic) allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”.  While the benchmark and tracking error4 limit are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with the EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority.  Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may assume positions to take advantage of short-term market movements (Figure 2).\n\nFigure 2 Asset allocation of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nThe HKMA’s Exchange Fund Investment Office houses its investment and related risk management functions. Exchange Fund Investment Office staff members directly manage about 71% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, comprising the entire BP and part of the IP.  This part of the IP includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 29% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes.  The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to realise sustainable returns, draw on diverse and complementary investment styles, and gain market insights and technical expertise in investment.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes.  The expenditure is determined primarily by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe growing complexity of the investment environment underlines the importance of risk management.  The HKMA sets stringent controls and investment guidelines for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and ensures a proper risk monitoring and compliance system is in place. Three lines of defence are in place to implement effective risk management and governance of investment-related activities.  Key risk categories (including credit, market, liquidity and operational risks) are regularly monitored, and the risk management process provides a robust framework to support strategic planning and investment diversification.\n\n# RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT\n\nThe HKMA believes that, by putting an appropriate emphasis on responsible investment and sustainable long-term economic performance, it can better achieve the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund and reduce risks associated with environmental, social and governance (ESG)- related matters of its underlying investments.  The HKMA supports responsible investment by integrating ESG factors into the investment processes for both public and private market investments of the Exchange Fund, underpinned by the guiding principle that priority will generally be given to ESG investments if the long-term risk-adjusted return is comparable with other investments.  For more details about the HKMA’s responsible investment framework and implementation, see the Sustainability chapter on pages 184 to 191.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2021\n\nGlobal equity markets rose sharply and hit new record highs on the back of ultra-loose monetary policies and fiscal measures, driving an accelerated recovery of the global economy and financial markets.  However, Hong Kong and Mainland equity markets underperformed amid market reforms.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index in the US rose by 27%, while the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong dropped by 14%.\n\nFor the bond markets, rising inflation expectations and tapering of asset purchases by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) led to a rise in US Treasury yields and falling bond prices during 2021.  Ten-year US Treasury yields increased by about 60 basis points from 0.9% at the beginning of the year to 1.5% at the end of the year.\n\nIn the currency markets, the US dollar strengthened against other major currencies, particularly towards the end of 2021, on the back of expectations about the Fed’s tapering pace. In particular, the euro and the yen depreciated by 7.1% and 10.3% against the US dollar respectively.\n\nThe performance of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2021 is shown in Table 1.\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$191.9 billion in 2021.  This comprised gains on bonds of HK$12.6 billion, net gains on equities of HK$47.8 billion (with gains of HK$68.8 billion from foreign equities, and losses of HK$21.0 billion from Hong Kong equities), a positive currency translation effect of HK$16.8 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets and gains of HK$114.7 billion on other investments held by the investment-holding subsidiaries of the Fund. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$3.1 billion.\n\nTotal assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,570.2 billion at the end of the year.  The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$515.3 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$392.5 billion and real estate HK$122.8 billion.  Outstanding investment commitments of the LTGP amounted to HK$225.7 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund in 2021, excluding the Strategic Portfolio, was 4.1%.  Specifically, the IP achieved a rate of return of 3.7%, while the BP gained 0.4%.  The LTGP has recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 15.4% since its inception in 2009.\n\nThe annual returns of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2021 are set out in Chart 1.  Table 2 shows the 2021 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over several different time horizons.  The average return was 5.3% during 2019–2021, 4.7% during 2017–2021, 3.3% during 2012–2021 and 4.8% since 1994.  Table 3 shows the currency mix of the Fund’s assets on 31 December 2021.\n\nSee pages 211 to 319 for the audited 2021 financial statements of the Exchange Fund.\n", "zh": "儲備管理\n\n2021年，全球金融市場展開復甦之路。儘管全球經濟仍受到演變中的COVID-19疫情情況的影響，但多種因素，包括疫苗接種率的提升、寬鬆的貨幣政策以及全球範圍內的財政措施，促進了全球經濟和金融市場的顯著復甦。在此背景下，部分海外股市在年內創下歷史新高，基金的整體股票持倉雖在香港股市表現疲軟，但仍取得不錯的回報。2021年，香港交易及結算所有限公司錄得投資收入1919億港元，投資回報率為4.1%。\n\n交易基金\n\n根據《交易基金條例》，交易基金的主要目標是直接或間接影響香港貨幣的匯率價值。基金亦用以維持香港貨幣及金融系統的穩定與完整，以協助香港成為國際金融中心。在財政司司長的授權範圍內，金管局負責交易基金的使用和投資管理，並向財政司司長負責。\n\n交易基金管理\n\n投資目標及組合結構\n\n交易基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）制定了以下投資目標：\n\n（一）維護資本；\n（二）確保整個貨幣基數始終獲得高度流動性的美元計價資產充分背書；\n（三）確保有足夠的流動性以維持貨幣和金融穩定；以及\n（四）在符合（i）－（iii）的前提下，實現投資回報，以幫助維持交易基金的長期購買力。\n\n這些目標充分考慮了交易基金的法定宗旨，並融入基金的組合結構及目標資產配置（見圖1）。\n\n圖1 交易基金的資產配置劃分\n\n一般而言，交易基金擁有兩個主要組合：儲備組合（BP）和投資組合（IP）。BP持有高度流動性的美元計價資產，以在貨幣局安排下提供貨幣基數的全面背書。IP則主要投資於經合組織（OECD）成員經濟體的債券和股票市場，以保護資產的價值及長期購買力。\n\n為更好管理風險及提升中長期回報，金管局謹慎逐步地將交易基金的一部分投資多元化至更廣的資產類別，包括新興市場和內地的債券及股票、私募股權（包括基礎設施）及房地產。新興市場和內地債券及股票由IP持有，而私募股權和房地產投資則由長期增長組合（LTGP）持有。自成立以來，金管局為指導LTGP的多元化步伐，設立了封頂限制（註1）。隨著LTGP投資規模和資產多樣性的日益成熟，EFAC於2022年1月決定以目標資產配置取代封頂限制，並與其他資產類別同步決定。\n\n2007年成立的戰略組合持有由政府為交易基金的戰略目的而收購的香港交易及結算所有限公司股份。由於其特殊性，戰略組合不計入基金投資表現的評估。\n\n存放於交易基金的資金\n\n交易基金不定期接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定機構的存放。利率一般與IP的表現掛鈎，唯獨未來基金（註3）除外，該基金的利率與IP及LTGP的回報率掛鈎，並根據投資組合比例調整。2021年，未來基金在IP與LTGP之間的投資組合比例約為40:60。\n\n投資流程\n\n交易基金的投資均基於兩種資產配置決策：策略性資產配置和策略性資產配置。策略性資產配置反映在投資基準中，代表根據交易基金投資目標的長期資產配置。在此指導下，資產會進行戰術分配，以期超越基準的超額回報。這通常導致實際配置與基準（或策略）配置不同，差異稱為“策略偏離”。策略基準與追蹤誤差（註4）的上限由財政司司長在與EFAC協商後確定，戰術決策和偏離範圍則由金管局在授權下制定。在允許的偏離範圍內，投資組合經理可以根據短期市場行情進行操作（見圖2）。\n\n圖2 交易基金的資產配置\n\n投資管理\n\n直接投資\n\n金管局的交易基金投資辦公室負責其投資及相關風險管理功能。投資辦公室員工直接管理約71%的交易基金投資，包括整個BP和部分IP。這部分IP涵蓋一系列投資於全球固定收益市場的投資組合及執行宏觀風險管理策略的衍生品投資組合。\n\n利用外部管理人\n\n除了內部管理外，金管局亦聘用外部基金管理人管理約29%的交易基金資產，包括所有上市股票投資組合及其他專門資產類別。聘用外部管理人的目的是利用市場上最佳的投資專業知識，實現可持續回報，並借助多元化、互補的投資風格以及獲取市場見解與技術專長。\n\n涉及外部管理人用費用主要包括基金管理費、保管費、交易成本及預扣稅等，這些成本受市場因素影響，可能每年有所變動。\n\n風險管理與合規\n\n日益複雜的投資環境凸顯風險管理的重要性。金管局為內外管理的投資組合制定嚴格的控制和投資指引，並確保建立適當的風險監測和合規制度。為有效實施投資相關的風險管理與治理，設有三道防線。關鍵風險類別（包括信貸、市場、流動性及運作風險）持續受到監控，風險管理流程為戰略規劃與投資多元化提供堅實架構。\n\n負責任投資\n\n金管局認為，若將適當重點放在負責任投資與可持續的長期經濟表現上，能更好實現交易基金的投資目標，並降低與其底層投資相關的環境、社會和治理（ESG）風險。金管局支持將ESG因素融入交易基金公共及私募市場投資的投資流程，並遵循若長期風險調整回報相當，則優先考慮ESG投資的原則。有關金管局負責任投資框架及實施的詳情，請參閱第184至191頁的可持續發展章節。\n\n交易基金績效\n\n2021年金融市場\n\n由於超鬆的貨幣政策和財政措施，全球股市大幅上升並創下新高，推動全球經濟與金融市場的加速復甦。然而，在市場改革影響下，香港和內地股市表現不佳。美國標普500指數升幅27%，而香港恆生指數則下跌14%。\n\n在債券市場方面，通脹預期上升及美國聯邦儲備（聯儲局）逐步縮減資產購買規模，導致美國國債收益率上升，債券價格下跌。十年期美國國債收益率由年初的0.9%升至年末的1.5%，約上升60個基點。\n\n匯率市場方面，美元兌其他主要貨幣升值，尤其是在2021年底，主要由於市場預期聯儲局的縮減步伐。特別是，歐元和日元兌美元的匯率分別貶值7.1%和10.3%。\n\n2021年主要貨幣、債券及股市的表現詳見表1。\n\n交易基金績效\n\n2021年，交易基金錄得投資收入1919億港元。其中，債券收益為126億港元，股票淨收益為478億港元（其中海外股票收益為688億港元，香港股票則虧損210億港元），非港元資產的貨幣匯兌正向效果為168億港元，投資控股子公司持有的其他投資則獲得1147億港元的收益。另，戰略組合錄得估值增益31億港元。\n\n年末，交易基金總資產達到4570.2億港元。LTGP的投資市值合計515.3億港元，其中私人股本為392.5億港元，房地產為122.8億港元。LTGP的未來投資承諾額為2257億港元。\n\n2021年，除戰略組合外，交易基金的投資回報率為4.1%。其中，IP的回報率為3.7%，BP的回報率為0.4%。自2009年成立以來，LTGP的年化內部收益率已達15.4%。\n\n交易基金從1994年至2021年的年度回報率見圖1。表2列出2021年的投資回報及基金在不同期限的平均回報。2019年至2021年的平均回報為5.3%，2017年至2021年為4.7%，2012年至2021年為3.3%，自1994年至今則為4.8%。表3則列出2021年12月31日基金資產的貨幣配置比例。\n\n關於2021年交易基金經審計的財務報表，請參閱第211至319頁。"}

It consists of an exhibition area and a library. The exhibition area presents an overview of the HKMA’s work and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong in an interactive manner.  It also contains information and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.  The library, situated next to the exhibition area, houses more than 26,000 books, journals and other publications on Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs as well as central banking topics.  It also maintains the register of AIs and local representative offices, as well as the register of securities staff of AIs, for public access as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nTo safeguard public health and safety during the COVID-19 pandemic, special operational arrangements were put in place at the Information Centre.  Cleansing and disinfection were stepped up, and facilities and exhibits were sanitised regularly with anti-microbial coating.\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre’s exhibition area comprises the Policy Section, the Currency Section and the Historical Timeline\n\n# Community engagement and public education\n\nTo reach out to the community and raise public awareness of the HKMA’s work, a public education programme has been running since 1998.  In 2021, a webinar was organised for over 2,300 students and teachers from 84 secondary schools.  The webinar covered an overview of the HKMA’s work, the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, protection of personal digital keys, the Deposit Protection Scheme and career opportunities in the banking industry.  To date, more than 63,000 people have participated in the public education programme.\n\nThe HKMA educates and engages the public on how to be smart and responsible financial consumers.  In view of the increase in phishing scams, the HKMA conducted a public awareness campaign themed “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!” with cross-media promotion to urge the public to stay vigilant against fraudulent hyperlinks embedded in SMS messages and emails purportedly from banks.\n\nCross-media promotion reminding the public to beware of fraudulent hyperlinks\n\nThe HKMA also seeks to enhance the public’s understanding of the financial industry and raise the young generation’s interest in pursuing a career in the industry.  Following positive feedback to the online drama series “STEPS” in 2020, the HKMA launched a new series titled “Four Faces of Talents in Central” featuring four growing areas of the financial industry: data science, fintech, green and sustainable finance, and wealth management.  In the video series, the characters of the market practitioners were portrayed in a humorous manner, and seasoned industry players and young talents shared first-hand information on the nature and requirements of jobs, career opportunities and prospects across the above four growing areas.\n\n“Four Faces of Talents in Central” series keeps the young generation abreast of career opportunities in the financial market\n\nThe “Online Parenting and Educational Campaign” launched in 2020 was recognised with a Silver Award in the “Best Event — Corporate Social Responsibility” category of the MarketingInteractive’s Marketing Events Awards 2021.  Building on the campaign’s success and to sustain momentum, the HKMA rolled out additional initiatives, including a parenting financial education workshop where child education experts shared tips on how to teach kids good money sense and demonstrated a DIY (do-it-yourself) financial educational toy, as well as an animated virtual tour of the HKMA Information Centre.\n\nThe “Online Parenting and Educational Campaign” wins an award at the Marketing Events Awards 2021.  The campaign promotes money management concept and skills to let parents and kids learn in an amusing and entertaining way.\n\nTo enhance financial literacy among secondary school students, the HKMA and various stakeholders co-organised the “Hong Kong Financial Literacy Championship”, which featured a fintech theme.  Apart from an online quiz, a new financial design thinking workshop on personal financial management was added to train the participating students to develop innovative proposals on money management tools.  This initiative won the “Highest Student Participation Award” offered by the Business-School Partnership Programme under the Education Bureau, and the “Investor and Financial Education Award (Corporate) — Gold Award” offered by the Investor and Financial Education Council2 (IFEC).\n\nThe “Hong Kong Financial Literacy Championship” educates students on fintech and design thinking concepts and achieves record-high participation\n\nOther community engagement initiatives included talks or webinars for students and retirees.  The HKMA also participated in a teacher training webinar on economic security organised by the Education Bureau.  Online educational materials offering smart tips on using automated teller machines (ATMs) are available in eight languages3 to cater for people of different backgrounds living in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA supports the IFEC in promoting financial literacy and capacity in Hong Kong, and will explore further collaboration with stakeholders to maximise the impact of community engagement.\n\n# Financial disclosure\n\nTo maintain a high level of transparency, the HKMA adopts international standards in financial disclosure insofar as these are applicable to central banking operations.  These include the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and other applicable reporting requirements, for example, the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard.  The Finance Division works with external auditors and other accounting professionals to prepare and present the Exchange Fund’s financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards.  The HKMA also provides detailed disclosures and thorough analyses of a wide range of expense items and budgetary information in its Annual Report.\n\n# ACCOUNTABILITY AND CONTROLS\n\n# Risk management\n\nOne of the HKMA’s most important tasks is to manage risks to the monetary and banking systems.  Risk management is undertaken both at a working level in the day-to-day operations and at a higher level through strategic planning. Under the HKMA’s risk management framework, there are two high-level committees — the Macro Surveillance Committee and the Risk Committee — both of which are chaired by the Chief Executive of the HKMA.\n\nThe terms of reference of the Macro Surveillance Committee are:\n\n- to identify potential risks and threats to the monetary and financial system in Hong Kong and discuss possible measures to address such risks;\n- to review existing measures for managing risks in the monetary and financial system to identify possible gaps and ensure the adequacy of these measures; and\n- to encourage cross-departmental sharing of relevant information on macro surveillance with a view to enhancing the macro surveillance capability of the HKMA.\n\nThe terms of reference of the Risk Committee are:\n\n- to identify potential risks and threats to the organisation and devise strategies to reduce the impact of such events;\n- to review the existing system for managing risks across different departments to identify possible gaps and significant risks and ensure the adequacy of measures to address them;\n- to harmonise the criteria and methods of risk measurement and prioritise the resources management of risks identified; and\n- to encourage a stronger risk management culture institutionally which promotes the proper levels of authorisation and controls.\n\nA robust operational risk management framework is in place covering organisational risks at two levels: the entity level and the department level.  Entity-level risks refer mainly to those which concern the entire organisation in the medium term, or which might call for a cross-departmental response. Potential and emerging risks identified by business units, and the adequacy of the control measures and mitigating strategies they devise, are reviewed and reported every quarter.  This is supplemented by a top-down approach to manage entity-level risks, in which senior colleagues heading different business units actively identify risks of wider impact and propose mitigating measures.  The Risk Committee discusses these assessments and decides on appropriate follow-up actions.\n", "zh": "# 企業職能\n\n企業職能支持香港金融管理局的運作，具有高度透明度、問責制、效率和專業精神。為促進公眾了解其政策和運作，香港金融管理局通過傳統媒體、社交媒體、其網站、資訊中心及其他渠道與社區和市場進行有效溝通。在機構內，香港金融管理局誠摯建立敏捷且可持續的工作團隊，制定嚴格的財務紀律，提升資訊科技能力，以適應變化並確保政策和舉措的有效執行。\n\n# 透明度\n\n# 媒體關係與社交媒體\n\n香港金融管理局與媒體緊密合作，以提升透明度並促進公眾對其政策及運作的了解。2021年，香港金融管理局舉辦或參與了169場實體和虛擬活動，包括八場新聞發布會、八場即場採訪及153場其他公共活動。此外，安排了27次媒體訪問。全年發布了共632份雙語新聞稿，亦每日處理大量媒體查詢。\n\n為提升公眾對香港金融管理局主要職能的認識，局方為本地、中國內地及海外媒體舉行新聞發布會和媒體簡報會，內容涵蓋聯繫計劃、金融科技（fintech）與利率基準改革等主題。\n\n為及時與公眾互動，香港金融管理局經營五個社交媒體頻道（Facebook、Instagram、LinkedIn、Twitter及YouTube），粉絲人數超過80,000人。局方利用這些渠道，提高公眾對各類主題的認識，尤其是指在疫情期間顯著增加的釣魚詐騙。此外，亦透過社交媒體推廣綠色金融、金融科技、聯繫計劃等最新發展，讓公眾掌握最新動向。\n\n香港金融管理局行政總裁余偉文先生參與2021年香港金融科技周的虛擬專題討論\n\n香港金融管理局副行政總裁李浩德主持有關其“金融科技2025”策略的媒體簡報\n\n香港金融管理局副行政總裁袁大道主持有關香港銀行業為倫敦同業拆息轉換作準備工作的媒體簡報\n\n香港金融管理局副行政總裁劉志雄接受國際新聞頻道訪問\n\n# 公共查詢\n\n公共查詢服務為大眾提供更深入了解香港金融管理局核心職能和運作的有效途徑。2021年，該服務處理了9,781個查詢，其中約一半與銀行政策與法規、消費者銀行事務、紙幣硬幣以及金融基礎設施和債券市場發展有關。其中一些重要查詢涉及貨幣收集計劃、銀行產品與服務、銀行相關指引與通告，以及零售債券發行計劃。\n\n圖表1顯示自2018年以來收到的公共查詢數量，圖表2則細分2021年的查詢性質。\n\n圖表1 公共查詢總數\n\n圖表2 2021年查詢性質分布\n\n# 出版物\n\n除年度報告外，香港金融管理局還發布了兩期半年度貨幣和金融穩定報告，以及四期季刊，並定期更新月度統計公報，提供有關香港貨幣、銀行和經濟問題的最新及專題資訊與分析。局方亦發表11篇Insight文章，介紹其主要新措施和政策，並討論熱門議題。\n\n2020年香港金融管理局年度報告榮獲香港管理專業協會2021年最佳年度報告獎“非牟利和慈善組織”類別銀獎及“環境、社會及管治報告卓越獎”。\n\n# 企業網站\n\n企業網站（www.hkma.gov.hk）提供逾44,000頁內容，涵蓋英文、繁體及簡體中文，是大眾了解香港金融管理局最新資訊的門戶。內容包括認可機構（AI）及本地代表處名錄，以及根據《銀行條例》第20條維護的認可機構證券員工名錄，亦同步提供支付系統與預付儲值設施許可證持有人名錄。\n\n自2018年起，香港金融管理局開始分階段通過開放應用程式介面（API）發佈金融資料及重要資訊。截至2021年底，已在網站上開放了148組開放API，配合預定時間表。\n\n# 資訊中心\n\n位於國際金融中心二號大樓第55樓的香港金融管理局資訊中心，是一個重要設施，向社會介紹香港金融管理局的工作，並提高公眾對貨幣和銀行事務的認識。該中心包括展覽區及圖書館。展覽區以互動方式展示香港金融管理局的工作及香港貨幣與銀行的發展，也提供研究香港金融、銀行及金融事務的資料和展品。圖書館位於展覽區旁，藏有超過26,000本關於香港金融、銀行、金融事務及中央銀行主題的書籍、期刊和其他出版物，並保存公開資料包括認可機構及代表處登記名錄及認可機構證券員工名錄，依據《銀行條例》第20條運作。\n\n因應新冠肺炎疫情，資訊中心制定了特別運作安排，加強清潔和消毒，並定期用抗微生物塗層消殺展品和設施。\n\n資訊中心的展覽區包括政策展示區、貨幣展示區及歷史時間表。\n\n# 社區參與與公共教育\n\n為了與社區接觸及提高公眾對香港金融管理局工作的認識，自1998年起推出公共教育計劃。2021年，局方舉辦了一場網絡研討會，超過2,300名中學學生及教師來自84所中學參與。研討會內容涵蓋香港金融管理局的工作概況、聯繫匯率制度、港幣鈔票、個人數位密鑰保護、存款保障計劃及銀行業的就業機會。截至目前，已有超過63,000人參與公共教育計劃。\n\n香港金融管理局致力於教育和引導公眾理智負責地使用金融產品。由於釣魚詐騙案件增加，局方發起主題為“保護您的個人數位密鑰；提防詐騙鏈接！”的公共意識推廣活動，透過多媒體渠道宣傳，提醒市民警惕偽裝來自銀行的短信和電郵中含有的惡意鏈接。\n\n多媒體宣傳提醒公眾留意詐騙鏈接\n\n局方亦希望增進公眾對金融業的了解及激發年青一代的行業興趣。繼2020年正面回應網劇系列“STEPS”的成功後，局方推出名為“中環四面手”的新系列，聚焦金融行業的四大成長領域：資料科學、金融科技、綠色與可持續金融及財富管理。內容運用幽默手法展現行業從業者的角色，並由資深業界人士及年輕才俊分享工作性質、職業要求及行業前景的第一手資訊。\n\n“中環四面手”系列幫助年輕人了解金融市場的職業機會\n\n“網上親子及教育推廣活動”於2020年推出，獲得2021年MarketingInteractive“最佳企業社會責任活動”銀獎。為延續活動的成功並保持熱度，局方推出額外措施，包括親子理財工作坊由專家傳授理財技巧、展示DIY（自己動手做）理財教具，以及虛擬導覽資訊中心的動畫影片。\n\n“網上親子及教育推廣活動”在2021年市場行銷盛事獲獎，促進家長與子女以趣味投入學習金錢管理技巧。\n\n為促進中學生的金融素養，局方與相關持份者合辦“香港金融素養大賽”，以金融科技為主題。除了線上測驗外，還新增了一個以個人理財為主題的金融設計思維工作坊，培養學生提出創新理財工具方案。此活動榮獲教育局商學合作計劃頒發的“最高學生參與獎”及投資者及金融教育理事會（IFEC）頒發的“投資者及金融教育獎（企業）-金獎”。\n\n“香港金融素養大賽”提升學生對金融科技及設計思維的認識，創下參與人數新高\n\n其他社區參與活動還包括為學生和退休人士舉辦的講座或網路研討會。局方亦參與教育局舉辦的經濟安全問題教師培訓網絡研討會。並提供多種語言（包括中文、英文、粵語、普通話及其他）之網上教育材料，內容涵蓋使用自動櫃員機（ATM）的智慧提示，以適應來港不同背景人士的需要。\n\n香港金融管理局支持投資者及金融教育理事會推動本港的金融素養及能力，並將探索與持份者進一步合作，擴大社區參與的影響。\n\n# 財務資訊披露\n\n為維持高度透明，香港金融管理局採用國際財務披露標準，適用於央行運作的範圍內，包括香港財務報告準則（HKFRS）及其他相關報告要求，例如國際貨幣基金組織的特殊資料傳播標準。財務部門與外部審計師及會計專業人士合作，按照香港財務報告準則編製並呈現外匯基金的財務報告。局方亦在年度報告中提供詳細的披露和深入的分析，涵蓋各類支出項目和預算資訊。\n\n# 責任和控制\n\n# 風險管理\n\n香港金融管理局最重要的任務之一是管理對貨幣及銀行系統的風險。風險管理在日常運作層面與策略規劃層面同步進行。在香港金融管理局的風險管理框架下，設有兩個高層委員會——宏觀監測委員會和風險委員會，兩者均由局長主持。\n\n宏觀監測委員會的職責範圍為：\n- 識別香港貨幣及金融系統的潛在風險與威脅，並討論應對措施；\n- 檢討現行管理貨幣與金融系統風險的措施，找出潛在缺口，確保措施充分；\n- 鼓勵跨部門分享宏觀監測相關資訊，以增強整體監測能力。\n\n風險委員會的職責範圍為：\n- 識別組織的潛在風險和威脅，制定降低影響的策略；\n- 檢討不同部門的風險管理系統，找出潛在缺口及重大風險，確保措施有效；\n- 統一風險測量標準與方法，優先配置資源應對已識別的風險；\n- 強化機構內的風險管理文化，推動適當授權與控制。\n\n一個完整的運作風險管理框架已經建立，涵蓋組織層面和部門層面的組織風險。組織層面的風險主要涉及中長期整體機構的風險或需跨部門應對的威脅。由業務單位識別的潛在及新興風險，以及它們提出的控制措施和緩解策略，將每季度進行審查及匯報。該流程亦採用自上而下的方法，資深隊伍負責人積極識別具有較廣泛影響的風險並提出緩解措施。風險委員會討論這些評估，決定後續應對措施。"}
{"en": "# Sustainability\n\nThe HKMA is publishing its first sustainability report, as an integral part of its Annual Report 2021, to set out its strategy on sustainability and document its own efforts, as well as its joint efforts with the financial industry, to support the Government’s climate strategies and contribute to a more climate resilient and sustainable world.\n\nThe HKMA embeds sustainability considerations across its main roles and functions, whether as a banking supervisor, a market facilitator, a responsible investor, or in maintaining financial and monetary stability.  Moreover, the HKMA collaborates with local and overseas counterparts in strengthening the management and disclosures of climate risks, as well as the development of the green and sustainable finance market.\n\nIn addition, the HKMA is committed to fulfilling its corporate social responsibility, and aims to be a responsible and sustainable organisation. This commitment is manifested in various areas, including promoting a sustainable, financially inclusive and environmentally friendly marketplace, supporting the wider community, protecting the environment and nurturing a caring workplace.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nClimate change is one of the most pressing challenges facing the world today.  To combat climate change, countries agreed, under the Paris Agreement1, to take actions to cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and eventually achieve carbon neutrality within this century.  Meeting the Paris Agreement climate change target will require investments of an estimated US$1–2 trillion a year globally2, making sustainability one of the biggest drivers of capital flows in the decades ahead.\n\nHong Kong is determined to be at the forefront of this transition.  The Government announced that it will strive to achieve carbon neutrality before 2050, in line with developed economies globally.  Hong Kong is also the first Asian jurisdiction that has committed to specifically aligning disclosure requirements with recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) by 2025 across relevant sectors.\n\nTo the financial sector, climate change is both a source of risk and opportunity.  While the financial sector cannot be spared from the threats posed by climate change, it has a key role to play in the transition by channelling more financing to activities that are consistent with a pathway towards lower GHG emissions and climate-resilient developments.\n\nThe HKMA is committed to strengthening Hong Kong’s financial system to support a greener and more sustainable future, driving actions to support the Government’s climate goal and contributing to the global agenda.  In doing so, the HKMA incorporates sustainability considerations in carrying out its main functions and in running its operations.\n\nFirst, as a banking supervisor, the HKMA aims to strengthen resilience of the banking system against climate risks and to accelerate banks’ efforts in supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy.  To accomplish this, the HKMA has formulated a regulatory framework setting out supervisory requirements for banks to manage and disclose climate risks.  A pilot exercise on climate risk stress test to assess the resilience of the banking sector was also concluded successfully in 2021.  Meanwhile, on an ongoing basis, the HKMA takes into account climate change in monitoring financial stability risks.\n\nSecondly, in its market development role, the HKMA is focusing its efforts in enhancing Hong Kong’s role as a green and sustainable finance hub in the region, including the Greater Bay Area (GBA).  Hong Kong, being Mainland’s offshore financial centre, is well-positioned to channel global investments into Mainland’s plans to achieve peak carbon emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060.  The HKMA is also working through the Green and Sustainable Finance Cross-Agency Steering Group (CASG)3, which the HKMA co-chairs, to build industry capacity, address data gaps and explore the development of a local green classification framework.\n\nIn fact, Hong Kong is a leader in green finance solutions, having established the world’s first government Global Medium Term Note Programme dedicated to green bond issuances under the Government Green Bond Programme, and increased gradually the diversity of its issuances since 2019, both in terms of currencies and tenors.  To support the issuance of green and sustainable bonds and loans in the private sector, the Government set up the Green and Sustainable Finance Grant Scheme in May 2021. Administered by the HKMA, this scheme has incentivised more corporates to seek green and sustainable financing in Hong Kong, and encouraged more green advisers and external reviewers to establish or expand their presence here.\n\nThirdly, as the manager of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA has ensured that environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations are an integral part of its investment process and asset allocation decisions.  In the latter part of this report, the HKMA makes its inaugural disclosures on its climate scenario analysis and carbon footprint metrics of the Exchange Fund’s portfolios.\n\nFourthly, the HKMA is stepping up its own green office initiatives to ensure its own operations conform to best practices in the management and mitigation of climate risks.  As a start, the HKMA has established its carbon profile across Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions4, and made corresponding disclosures.  At the same time, the HKMA has implemented measures to enhance industry-wide operational efficiency and minimise resource consumption.  In addition, the HKMA holds itself to high standards of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and works with its stakeholders to promote financial inclusion and financial literacy.\n\nGreening the financial system requires close collaboration amongst central banks and supervisors.  The HKMA is an active member of the international community in global policymaking and alignment of sustainability standards. The HKMA has also issued a statement to support the Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) Glasgow Declaration5, reaffirming its commitment to delivering on the NGFS recommendations in taking the necessary measures to foster a greener financial system.\n\nIn driving these sustainability initiatives and assessing climaterelated opportunities and risks, sustainability and green considerations are embedded in the HKMA’s governance and risk management frameworks, in which the leadership is actively involved in setting the overarching objectives and guiding principles, in consultation with the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) and its sub-committees. The HKMA’s CSR and Sustainability Committee (CSC) also assesses the potential impacts of sustainability and climate-related issues on the organisation, and devises strategies to reduce the impacts.  Execution of the relevant strategies and initiatives is closely monitored and reported to the top management regularly.  In addition, external consultants have been engaged to advise the HKMA in selected areas of work.\n\nThe subsequent sections of this chapter will delve into the HKMA’s governance, strategies and risk management measures in undertaking green finance and sustainability work in each of its roles.\n\nThis report is prepared with reference to the disclosure elements recommended in the NGFS’s Guide on Climaterelated Disclosure for Central Banks, published in December 2021.  In addition, information in relation to the HKMA’s office operations makes broad reference to the reporting principles under the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards6 and the ESG Reporting Guide promulgated by the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited.\n\n# Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System\n\nThe NGFS provides a platform for central banks and prudential supervisory authorities to exchange experiences, share best practices, contribute to the development of environmental and climate risk management in the financial sector, and mobilise mainstream finance to support the transition towards a sustainable economy.  Its purpose is to define and promote best practices to be implemented within and outside of the membership of the NGFS, and to conduct or commission analytical work on green finance.\n\n# Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures\n\nIn December 2015, the Financial Stability Board created the TCFD to develop recommendations for more effective climate-related disclosures by companies to investors, lenders and insurance underwriters that could promote more informed decisions.  The TCFD’s recommendations are structured around four thematic areas that represent the core elements of how organisations operate: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets.\n\n# BANKING SUPERVISOR\n\nAs the core part of the financial system, banks should be proactive in managing climate risks, and support channelling more capital to green and sustainable activities.  As a banking supervisor, the HKMA focuses on building banks’ resilience against climate risks and accelerating banks’ efforts in supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\n# Overview of the HKMA’s three-phased approach\n\nSince May 2019, the HKMA has been promoting green and sustainable banking in three phases:\n\n# Phase I\n\nDeveloping a common framework to assess the “greenness baseline” of individual banks, and collaborating with international bodies to provide technical support to banks in Hong Kong.\n\n# Phase II\n\nConsulting the industry and other stakeholders on the supervisory expectations and requirements of green and sustainable banking.\n\n# Phase III\n\nFocusing on the implementation of supervisory requirements, monitoring and evaluation of banks’ progress in green and sustainable banking.\n\n# Guidance\n\n# Supervisory requirements on climate risk management\n\nIn 2020, the HKMA developed a common framework for assessing the “greenness baseline” of individual banks in collaboration with the industry.  The HKMA also conducted the first greenness assessment of banks, which marked the completion of Phase I.  To help banks prepare for the new supervisory requirements, a white paper was published in June 2020, which outlined the HKMA’s initial thinking on supervisory expectations for climate risk management.\n\nIn December 2021, following an industry consultation, the HKMA issued the supervisory requirements for banks to incorporate climate considerations into governance, strategy, risk management and disclosure.  In particular, specific requirements and concrete timeline were set out in mandating climate-related disclosures based on the recommendations of the TCFD before 2025. The requirements will set a benchmark to help banks upgrade their risk management capability.\n\nThe next step is for the HKMA to monitor banks’ implementation of the relevant requirements.  In this regard, the HKMA has stepped up its supervisory capacity by setting up a new dedicated team within its Banking Supervision Department to carry out climate risk supervision.\n\nThis three-phased approach is an iterative and evolving process.  Further to the first round of greenness assessment conducted in 2020, the HKMA is reviewing the framework to encompass the new supervisory requirements on climate risk management and potentially cover a wider scope, such as other environmental risks and measures for supporting the net zero transition.   The HKMA intends to launch an updated framework in the second half of 2022.\n\n# Sound practices supporting the transition to carbon neutrality\n\nApart from incorporating climate risk considerations into the risk management framework, some banks have devoted resources and taken measures to support the goals of the Paris Agreement and contribute to achieving global net zero emissions.  The HKMA issued a circular in December 2021 to share with the industry the sound practices of these banks which would be of reference value to other banks in the industry in formulating their climate strategies.  These sound practices are grouped into four areas: reducing GHG emissions of the banks’ own operations, reducing financed emissions through portfolio alignment, assisting clients to transition, and promoting collective efforts to assist the economy to achieve a net-zero transition.\n\n# Green classification framework to facilitate green finance flows\n\nTo increase transparency across the financial markets and enable consistent policy making on green finance, the HKMA has been working with other financial regulators to explore a local green classification framework, which will facilitate navigation among the Common Ground Taxonomy (CGT) developed by the International Platform on Sustainable Finance (IPSF)8 and the green definitions adopted by China and European Union, for adoption across different financial sectors.  The work will be guided by the principles of interoperability, comparability and inclusiveness, taking into account other definitions of green, transitional activities and local considerations.  This initiative will reduce the risk of green washing, improve product comparability and ultimately enhance investor protection.\n\n# Assessment: climate risk stress test\n\nTo assess the banking sector’s ability to cope with potential shocks brought about by climate change, the HKMA undertook a pilot exercise on climate risk stress test (CRST), which included the participation of 20 major retail banks and seven branches of international banking groups.  A report summarising the results of the pilot CRST exercise was published in December 2021.  The results showed that the banking sector remained resilient even in the face of extreme climate-related shocks, although these shocks could potentially give rise to significant adverse impacts on banks’ financials.  The CRST exercise helped to enhance banks’ capabilities for measuring and assessing climate risks. In light of the CRST results, the participating banks have devised plans to strengthen their climate strategies and risk governance frameworks.  The HKMA will continue to engage the industry to strengthen banks’ capability and enhance the CRST framework, taking into account the lessons learnt from the pilot exercise.\n", "zh": "# 可持續發展\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）正在發表其首份可持續發展報告，作為2021年年度報告的組成部分，闡述其在可持續發展方面的策略，記錄其自身的努力，以及與金融行業的聯合努力，以支持政府的氣候策略並為建立更具氣候韌性的可持續世界做出貢獻。\n\nHKMA將可持續性考量融入其主要角色和職能，無論是作為銀行監管機構、市場促進者、負責任的投資者，還是在維持金融和貨幣穩定方面。此外，HKMA也與本地及海外的合作夥伴合作，加強氣候風險管理與披露，以及綠色和可持續金融市場的發展。\n\n此外，HKMA致力於履行其企業社會責任，並 aims to 成為一個負責任且具有可持續性的機構。這一承諾表現在多個領域，包括促進一個可持續、金融包容和環境友好的市場，支持更廣泛的社區，保護環境，以及營造一個有關懷的工作場所。\n\n# 概述\n\n氣候變化是當今世界面臨的最緊迫挑戰之一。為了對抗氣候變化，各國在巴黎協議下同意採取行動，減少溫室氣體排放，並在本世紀內達到碳中和。實現巴黎協議的氣候目標將需要全球每年約1-2兆美元的投資，這使得可持續發展成為未來數十年資本流動的最大驅動力之一。\n\n香港決心走在這一轉型的前沿。政府宣布將努力在2050年前實現碳中和，與全球發達經濟體同步。香港也是亞洲首個承諾在相關行業中到2025年將披露要求與氣候相關財務披露工作小組（TCFD）的建議對齊的司法管轄區。\n\n對金融行業而言，氣候變化既是風險來源，也是機遇。儘管金融行業無法避免氣候變化帶來的威脅，但它在轉型過程中扮演著關鍵角色，應引導更多資金流向符合降低溫室氣體排放以及氣候韌性發展的活動。\n\nHKMA致力於強化香港的金融體系，以支持更綠色、更可持續的未來，推動支持政府氣候目標的行動，並為全球議程作出貢獻。在此過程中，HKMA將可持續發展方面的考量融入其主要職能及運營中。\n\n首先，作為銀行監管機構，HKMA旨在增強銀行系統應對氣候風險的韌性，加快銀行支持低碳經濟轉型的努力。為此，HKMA制定了一套監管框架，規定銀行管理和披露氣候風險的要求。2021年，HKMA成功完成了一項氣候風險壓力測試的試點，以評估銀行業的韌性。同時，HKMA在持續監測金融穩定風險時，也將氣候變化納入考量。\n\n其次，作為市場發展角色，HKMA專注於加強香港作為區域綠色和可持續金融中心的地位，包括大灣區（GBA）。香港作為內地的離岸金融中心，具備良好條件將全球投資引入內地，協助其實現2030年碳達峰和2060年碳中和的計劃。HKMA亦透過與多個機構共同主持的綠色和可持續金融跨機構指導小組（CASG），致力於提升行業能力、解決數據缺口，並探索建立本地綠色分類框架。\n\n事實上，香港在綠色金融方案方面是領先者，已建立全球首個針對綠色債券發行的政府全球中期票據計畫（Green MTP，屬政府綠色債券計畫的一部分），自2019年起逐步增加多元化的發行範圍，包括貨幣和期限的多樣性。為支持私營企業發行綠色及可持續債券和貸款，政府於2021年5月設立了綠色及可持續金融補助計劃，由HKMA管理，激勵更多企業在香港尋求綠色和可持續融資，並促使更多綠色顧問和外部審查機構在此建立或擴展業務。\n\n第三，作為交易基金的管理者，HKMA確保環境、社會及治理（ESG）因素成為其投資流程和資產配置決策的不可或缺部分。在本報告後段，HKMA首次披露其交易基金投資組合的氣候場景分析及碳足跡指標。\n\n第四，HKMA亦提升自己的綠色辦公室措施，以確保其運營符合气候风险管理的最佳實踐。首先，HKMA已建立範圍一（直接排放）及範圍二（間接排放）的碳足跡資料，並進行了相應披露。同時，HKMA採取措施提升行業整體運營效率，降低資源耗用。此外，HKMA維持高標準的企業社會責任（CSR），與利益相關方合作推動金融包容及財務知識普及。\n\n推動金融體系的綠色化，需銀行間密切合作。HKMA亦是一個活躍的國際成員，參與推動全球政策制定和可持續標準的統一。HKMA支持氣候金融行動平台（NGFS）發布的格拉斯哥聲明，重申其致力於依照NGFS建議，採取措施促進更綠色的金融體系。\n\n在推動這些可持續發展措施，並評估氣候相關的機遇與風險方面，HKMA的治理和風險管理架構將可持續性和綠色考量融入其中。其領導層積極參與制定總體目標和指導原則，並與交易基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）及其小組協商。HKMA的企業社會責任及可持續發展委員會（CSC）亦會評估可持續性及氣候議題對機構的潛在影響，並制定減少影響的策略。相關策略和措施的執行情況亦會受到嚴格監控，並定期向高層管理層匯報。此外，亦聘請外部顧問提供專業建議。\n\n本章後續部分將詳細介紹HKMA在各角色中推行綠色金融及可持續發展的治理、策略及風險管理措施。\n\n本報告參考了2021年12月由NGFS發布的《中央銀行氣候相關披露指南》建議的披露要素。此外，有關HKMA辦公室運營的資訊亦廣泛參照了全球報告倡議（GRI）標準及香港聯交所頒布的ESG披露指南的原則。\n\n# 氣候金融系統綠化聯盟（NGFS）\n\nNGFS為中央銀行和審慎監管機構提供一個交流經驗、分享最佳實踐、促進金融部門環境與氣候風險管理發展的平臺，並動員主流金融支持向可持續經濟轉型。其目標是制定並推廣業內外可落實的最佳做法，並進行或委託相關分析工作，以促進綠色金融。\n\n# 氣候相關財務披露工作組（TCFD）\n\n2015年12月，金融穩定理事會成立了TCFD，旨在制定建議，以促使企業向投資者、貸款機構和保險承銷商提供更有效的氣候相關披露，以促進更明智的決策。TCFD的建議圍繞四個主題領域展開：治理、策略、風險管理及指標與目標，代表組織運作的核心要素。\n\n# 銀行監管\n\n作為金融體系的核心部分，銀行應積極管理氣候風險，並支持引導更多資金流向綠色和可持續活動。HKMA作為銀行監管機構，著重於提升銀行的韌性，並加快其支持低碳經濟轉型的步伐。\n\n# HKMA三階段策略概述\n\n自2019年5月起，HKMA推行綠色及可持續銀行業務，分為三個階段：\n\n# 第一階段\n制定評估單一銀行“綠色基線”的共通框架，並與國際機構合作為香港銀行提供技術支援。\n\n# 第二階段\n諮詢行業及其他相關利益方，制定綠色及可持續銀行的監管預期與要求。\n\n# 第三階段\n專注於監管要求的落實、監控及銀行綠色可持續發展進展的評估。\n\n# 指導方針\n\n# 氣候風險管理的監管要求\n\n2020年，HKMA與行業合作建立了一套共通框架，用於評估個別銀行的“綠色基線”。同年，HKMA進行了首次銀行的綠色評估，標誌著第一階段的完成。同時，為協助銀行準備應對新監管要求，2020年6月發布了白皮書，闡述HKMA對氣候風險管理監管預期的初步思考。\n\n2021年12月，經過行業諮詢後，HKMA發布了規定銀行在治理、策略、風險管理及披露中融入氣候考慮的監管要求，並明確了將根據TCFD建議在2025年前完成氣候相關披露的具體要求和時間表，旨在樹立標杆，提升銀行的風險管理能力。\n\n下一步，HKMA將監督銀行落實相關要求。為此，HKMA已增強監管力量，成立專責團隊在銀行監管部門專門進行氣候風險的監督工作。\n\n此三階段策略為一個循環不斷、持續演進的過程。在2020年首次完成的綠色評估基礎上，HKMA正審查並完善框架，以涵蓋新的氣候風險管理監管要求，並可能擴展範圍，包括其他環境風險和支持碳中和的措施。HKMA計劃於2022年下半年推出更新的框架。\n\n# 支持向碳中和轉型的良策\n\n除了將氣候風險納入風險管理框架外，部分銀行已投入資源，採取措施支持巴黎協議的目標，並為實現全球碳中和做出貢獻。HKMA於2021年12月發出通知，分享這些銀行的良好實踐，為行業其他銀行制定氣候策略提供參考。這些良好實踐涵蓋四個領域：減少銀行自身運營的溫室氣體排放、通過資產組合調整降低逾期排放、協助客戶轉型，以及推動集體努力促進經濟實現碳中和。\n\n# 促進綠色金融流動的綠色分類框架\n\n為增加金融市場的透明度，並促進綠色金融的政策制定一致性，HKMA正與其他金融監管機構合作探索本地綠色分類框架。該框架將協助政府、金融產品和投資者在國際平台（IPSF）制定的共同分類法（CGT）與中國和歐盟的綠色定義之間找到共同點，用於不同金融行業的採用。該工作將遵循互操作性、可比性和包容性原則，並考慮其他綠色、過渡性活動的定義和本地因素。此舉旨在降低“綠色洗牌”的風險，提升產品可比性，並最終增強投資者保護。\n\n# 氣候風險壓力測試評估\n\n為評估銀行業應對氣候變化潛在震盪的能力，HKMA進行了一項氣候風險壓力測試（CRST）試點，包括20家主要零售銀行和7家國際銀行分行參與。2021年12月，HKMA公布了該試點的總結報告。結果顯示，即使在極端氣候相關震盪情況下，銀行業仍保持韌性，但這些震盪仍可能對銀行的財務狀況產生顯著不利影響。CRST幫助提升銀行測量和評估氣候風險的能力。鑒於測試結果，參與銀行已制定計畫，強化其氣候策略和風險治理架構。HKMA將繼續與行業合作，提升銀行的能力，並根據試點經驗改進CRST框架。"}
{"en": "# The Exchange Fund\n\nReport of the Director of Audit Exchange Fund Financial Statements\n\n# Audit Commission The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 217 to 319, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2021, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2021, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards.  My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report.  I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards.  I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021.  These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.5, 2.6 and 38.1 to the financial statements.\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, the Group had financial assets totalling HK$4,502,475 million and financial liabilities totalling HK$1,150,861 million valued at fair value.\n\nFor 89% of these financial assets and all these financial liabilities, their fair values were quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 inputs) or were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data (Level 2 inputs).\n\nFor the remaining 11% of these financial assets, their fair values were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data (Level 3 inputs).  Such financial assets totalled HK$517,316 million, including mainly unlisted investment funds.\n\nGiven the substantial amount and the estimations involved, valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value was a key audit matter.\n\nThe audit procedures on valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value included:\n\n- obtaining an understanding of the procedures, including relevant controls, for valuing different categories of financial assets and financial liabilities;\n- evaluating and testing the controls, including relevant application controls of the computer systems;\n- obtaining external confirmations on the valuation, existence, rights and obligations and completeness of the financial assets and financial liabilities;\n- where quoted market prices were used, verifying the prices to independent sources;\n- where valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions, and verifying the inputs to independent sources; and\n- where valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Valuation of investment properties at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.11, 18 and 19 to the financial statements.\n\nThe Group’s investment properties were stated at their fair values, totalling HK$27,089 million as at 31 December 2021. The Group also had interests in one associate and twenty one joint ventures totalling HK$45,172 million, whose principal activities were holding overseas investment properties.  The fair values of these investment properties, whether held by the Group directly or by associate or joint ventures, were mainly determined based on valuations by independent professional valuers.  Such valuations involved significant judgments and estimates, including the valuation methodologies and the assumptions used.\n\nThe audit procedures on valuation of investment properties at fair value included:\n\n- obtaining and reviewing the valuation reports of investment properties held by the Group directly or by associate or joint ventures, and verifying that the fair values were based on the valuations stated in the valuation reports;\n- assessing the independence and qualifications of the valuers; and\n- evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information.  The other information comprises all the information included in the 2021 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.  If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact.  I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.  I also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.  The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.  If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion.  My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report.  However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and\n- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements.  I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit.  I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.  I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nJohn Chu Director of Audit\n", "zh": "交易基金\n\n審計署長報告 交易基金財務報表\n\n香港特別行政區政府審計委員會\n\n獨立核數師報告書 致財政司司長\n\n意見\n\n本人已審計交易基金及其子公司（「本集團」）所列的財務報表（第217至319頁），包括截至2021年12月31日的交易基金及本集團的資產負債表，以及截至該日的損益表、綜合收益表、權益變動表及現金流量表，以及財務報表附註，包括主要會計政策摘要。\n\n本人認為，財務報表在所有重大方面均依照香港會計師公會（「HKICPA」）頒布的《香港財務報告準則》（「HKFRSs」）以及行政長官根據《交易基金條例》（第66章）第7條所作的指令，真實而公平地反映了基金及本集團截至2021年12月31日的財務狀況，以及其於截至該日的財務績效和現金流量，並已妥善編製。\n\n意見的依據\n\n本人根據《交易基金條例》第7條所作的行政長官指令及審計署的審計準則進行審計。本人在該等準則下的職責，於本報告的「審計師對財務報表的責任」部分進一步闡述。本人在獨立性方面符合該等準則的要求，並已履行相關倫理責任。本認為，我獲得的審計證據充足且適當，能作為我發表意見的基礎。\n\n重點審計事項\n\n重點審計事項是指本人就2021年12月31日止年度的財務報表審計中，憑專業判斷認為最為重要的事項。這些事項是在整個財務報表審計的背景下，形成本人意見時所考慮，並不就這些事項提供獨立的意見。\n\n公平價值金融資產與金融負債的評價\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.5、2.6及38.1。\n\n截至2021年12月31日，本集團的金融資產總額為香港幣4,502,475百萬元，金融負債總額為香港幣1,150,861百萬元，兩者均以公平價值衡量。\n\n其中89%的金融資產及所有金融負債的公平價值是以活躍市場中相同資產或負債的報價（第1級輸入）或基於可觀測市場資料的估值技術估算（第2級輸入）得出。\n\n剩餘11%的金融資產其公平價值則是以未基於可觀測市場資料的輸入而採用的估值技術估算（第3級輸入），這些金融資產合共約為香港幣517,316百萬元，主要為未上市投資基金。\n\n鑑於上述數額龐大及所涉及的估值複雜性，公平價值金融資產與負債的評價成為重點審計事項。\n\n針對公平價值的金融資產及負債的估值所採用的審計程序包括：\n\n- 了解用於不同類別金融資產及負債估值的程序，包括相關控制措施；\n- 評估及測試這些控制措施，包括資訊系統的相關應用控制；\n- 向外部確認金融資產及負債的估值、存在、權利義務及完整性；\n- 使用市價報價進行的，核對相關報價與獨立來源的資料是否一致；\n- 使用基於可觀測市場資料的估值技術時，評估估值方法的適切性及假設的合理性，並核實輸入資料的獨立來源；\n- 使用未基於可觀測市場資料的估值技術時，評估估值技術的適用性、假設的合理性及輸入資料的合理性。\n\n投資物業的公平價值估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.11、18及19。\n\n截至2021年12月31日，本集團投資物業的公平值為香港幣27,089百萬元。此外，集團亦持有一個聯營企業及二十一個合資企業，合計約為香港幣45,172百萬元，其主要活動為持有海外投資物業，這些投資物業的公平價值主要由獨立專業估值師估算。這些估值涉及重大判斷及估算，包括所採用的估值方法及涉及的假設。\n\n就投資物業的公平價值進行的審計程序包括：\n\n- 索取並審核由集團直接持有或由聯營或合資企業持有的投資物業的估值報告，並核實公平價值是否以該等估值報告所載為基礎；\n- 評估估值師的獨立性及資歷；\n- 評估所用估值方法的適切性及假設、輸入的合理性。\n\n其他資料\n\n貨幣管理局負責其他資料的內容。其他資料是指除財務報表及本人審計報告外，香港貨幣管理局2021年年度報告中所載的所有資訊。\n\n本人對財務報表的意見不涵蓋其他資料，也不就該等資料作出任何形式的保證結論。\n\n在審計財務報表的過程中，本人的責任是閱讀其他資料，並在此過程中考慮該等資料是否與財務報表或本人在審計中獲得的知識存在重大不一致，或似乎有重大錯漏。如根據本人已執行的工作，認為該等資料存在重大錯漏，則本人須報告有關事實。本報告在這方面沒有任何要披露的事項。\n\n貨幣管理局與交易基金顧問委員會審計小組就財務報表的編制責任\n\n貨幣管理局負責編制真實、公允反映財務狀況的財務報表，該等報表須符合由香港會計師公會頒布的香港財務報告準則（HKFRSs）及根據《交易基金條例》第7條由行政長官所作指令，以及內部控制措施，確保財務報表不存在重大錯漏，無論因欺詐或過失。\n\n在編製財務報表時，貨幣管理局亦須評估本集團能否持續作為一個經營实体，必要時披露與經營持續性有關的事項，並採用經營持續的假設。\n\n交易基金顧問委員會的審核小組負責監督本集團的財務報告流程。\n\n審計師對財務報表審計的責任\n\n本人旨在獲得合理保證，判斷整體財務報表是否不存在因欺詐或過失而產生的重大錯漏，並出具包含本人意見的審計報告。合理保證是較高水平的保證，但並不保證按照審計署審計準則進行的審計總能發現所有存在的重大錯漏。錯漏如因欺詐或過失而發生，若單獨或合計可合理預期影響用戶根據這些財務報表所作的經濟決策，即屬重大。\n\n作為按照審計署審計準則進行的審計的一部分，本人持續運用專業判斷，保持專業懷疑態度。在整個審計過程中，我亦會：\n\n- 識別和評估財務報表可能存在的重大錯漏風險，並設計及執行應對這些風險的審計程序，獲取充足且適當的審計證據，作為我發表意見的依據。由於涉及協同行動、偽造、故意遺漏、失實陳述或內部控制的越級等欺詐行為，發現其引致的重大錯漏的風險高於因過失產生的錯漏；\n- 了解與本次審計相關的內部控制，以設計出符合作業需要的審計程序，但不作出對本集團內部控制有效性的意見；\n- 評估貨幣管理局採用的會計政策的適當性，以及其作出的會計估算和披露的合理性；\n- 斷定貨幣管理局採用經營持續假設的適切性，並根據獲取的審計證據，判斷是否存有可能對本集團持續經營能力構成重大不確定性的事件或條件。如認為存在重大不確定性，則須在審計報告中指出，若披露不足，亦須修正意見。本人結論基於截至目前所取得的審計證據，但未來事件或條件可能致使本集團停止經營；\n- 評估財務報表的整體呈現、結構及內容，包括披露事項，是否公允反映了相關交易及事件；\n- 獲取足夠的適當的審計證據，對本集團內的實體或業務活動的財務資訊作出意見。我負責指導、監督並執行集團審計，對本人之審計意見獨立負責。\n\n我會就審計範圍、時間安排及重要審計發現等事項，與交易基金顧問委員會進行溝通，包括我在審計中識別的任何重大內部控制缺陷。\n\n我亦向交易基金顧問委員會提供一份聲明，證明本人已遵守有關獨立性的倫理要求，並會將所有可能合理影響本人獨立性的關係及其他事項披露給他們，并在適用情況下提供相關防範措施。\n\n根據與交易基金顧問委員會溝通的事宜，我判定哪些事項在本期的財務報表審計中最為重要，並因此成為重點審計事項。除非法律或規定禁止公開披露，或者在極少數情況下，我認為披露該事項的負面後果較公開披露的益處更大，否則我會在審計報告中描述這些事項。"}

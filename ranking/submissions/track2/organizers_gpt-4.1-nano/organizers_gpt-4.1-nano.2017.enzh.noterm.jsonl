{"en": "# Chief Executive’s Statement\n\nIn 2017, the global economy and financial markets performed much better than expected: the real economy saw steady growth; inflation remained subdued; the three interest rate hikes and the reduction in the balance sheet by the US Federal Reserve during the year did not result in capital outflows from emerging market economies or a strengthening of the US dollar. Amid bullish sentiment, global stock markets, including the three major US stock indices, kept hitting new highs. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index surged by 34%. The Hang Seng Index gained nearly 8,000 points (or 36%) in 2017 and surpassed the 30,000-point level to reach an all-time high in January 2018.\n\nMany investors were filled with optimism, even exuberance, in such a favourable environment. However, this was until early February this year when the latest data showed a higher than expected wage increase in the US, prompting investors to reappraise inflation risks and triggering significant corrections to global stock markets. The Dow Jones Index fell more than 1,000 points in two days during the second week of February, and the Hang Seng Index dropped more than 3,000 points in the same week. The 10-year US Treasury yield surged to as high as 2.95%. The swift reversal of fund flows indicated that the record high market valuation was not built on a solid foundation. It also reminded us of the importance of a sound and robust financial system for Hong Kong to meet the challenges brought by asset market volatility and capital outflows.\n\n# Banking system resilience boosted by precautionary measures\n\nAs the saying goes, “prevention is better than cure”. The HKMA implemented further risk mitigation measures in 2017 to safeguard the stability of Hong Kong’s banking and financial systems. In May, we introduced the eighth round of countercyclical measures for banks’ mortgage loans and strengthened banks’ credit risk management on lending to property developers, with the aim of enhancing the banking system’s resilience to shocks arising from any downturn in the property market. With the several rounds of measures, the average loan-to-value ratio of new residential mortgage loans fell to 49% at the end of 2017 from 64% in September 2009, while the average debt servicing ratio also declined to 35% from 41% in August 2010.\n\nIn 2017, we established the Resolution Office to implement international standards on the resolution of non-viable financial institutions that are considered “too big to fail”. This will help prevent a recurrence of a global financial crisis similar to the one in 2008 where public money was used to save failing financial institutions, and will minimise the impact of their closures on the financial system, the economy and the community at large.\n\nRobust risk management is the cornerstone of steady and sustainable development of the banking sector. The liquidity ratio and capital adequacy ratio of Hong Kong’s banking system are well above the applicable statutory requirements and among the highest in the world. This undoubtedly reflects the high resilience of Hong Kong’s banking system. Indeed, the banking sector registered strong growth in 2017, with total loans increasing by 16%, while the asset quality also held up well. The classified loan ratio of retail banks fell to 0.54% from 0.72% in 2016, well below the long-term average of 2.2% since 2000. The banking industry’s overall return on equity (based on pre-tax operating profits) reached 11.74% in 2017, a very healthy level compared with other international financial centres.\n\n# Sound banking the key to long-term financial stability\n\nThe 2008 global financial crisis revealed the limitations of relying solely on rules and regulations to restrain the financial industry from pursuing profitability without regard to their primary responsibilities. In light of this, the HKMA has stepped up the promotion of “sound banking” practices in recent years, encouraging banks to develop and pursue good corporate culture and values. In particular, to address the issue of bank staff pursuing short-term profits at the expense of the long-term interests of their customers or banks, we are encouraging banks to put in place appropriate incentive systems that are in line with their corporate culture and values. As part of this campaign, we arranged the inaugural Annual Conference for Independent Non-Executive Directors (INEDs) in March 2017 to highlight the importance of establishing a good banking culture and to empower the INEDs to perform their oversight and monitoring roles more effectively.\n\nWith the support of the banking industry, 2017 was a successful year for the HKMA in the advancement of financial inclusion. Six physical bank branches and three mobile branches began operating in remote areas. The Hong Kong Association of Banks worked out an arrangement with EPS and a convenience store chain to launch a pilot scheme allowing the elderly to withdraw cash from the stores in remote areas without the need to make purchases. Hongkong Post is also launching this year a cash withdrawal service for the elderly at seven Post Offices mainly on outlying islands and in the New Territories. Regarding account opening, the HKMA last year set up a webpage and an email account with a dedicated team to follow up public enquiries or complaints relating to the opening of bank accounts. Thanks to the concerted efforts of various stakeholders, there has been a significant improvement in customer experience in opening individual and corporate bank accounts.\n\n# Fintech a game changer for the banking industry\n\nIn an era of rapid technological advancement, fintech has been gradually integrated into our daily lives. In this ever changing technological environment, banks must embrace new developments and pursue innovation in their application of fintech. With the new era of Smart Banking, the HKMA launched seven initiatives in September (see page 106 for details) promoting the adoption of fintech in banking to improve the quality of banking products and services for customers. While these initiatives are independent of one another, they are complementary and will be a game changer for the future landscape of payment and banking services in Hong Kong. Customers will not only enjoy more convenient, efficient and secure payment and banking services, they will also have more choices and greater control over their financial transactions. Fintech will be the key to banks’ future business success, and moving into the new era of Smart Banking will be a great opportunity for the banks to upgrade and transform themselves.\n\n# Enormous opportunities created by the Belt and Road and the Bay Area Initiatives\n\nWith competition among international financial centres becoming more intense, a diversified financial industry is of paramount importance to Hong Kong. In 2017, the HKMA stepped up its work on enhancing Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre. Given Hong Kong’s unparalleled advantage of “having the Mainland as our hinterland while maintaining an international outlook”, the Belt and Road Initiative and the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Bay Area (Bay Area) will offer enormous opportunities for the financial and banking sectors and give new impetus to the economic growth of Hong Kong. The HKMA Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office, which was established in response to the Belt and Road Initiative, saw the number of its partners grow to around 90 since launch, laying a solid foundation for promoting Hong Kong as a financing hub for infrastructure investments. The issuance of the first Belt and Road bond in Hong Kong by the China Development Bank in 2017 highlighted the pivotal role Hong Kong can play in facilitating the financing of these infrastructure projects.\n\nIn addition to infrastructure financing, we are actively involved in the development of Hong Kong as a hub for corporate treasury centres, private equity funds and Asian derivatives businesses, by attracting multinational corporations and major financial institutions to manage their funds, assets and various financial risks in the city. These initiatives will further consolidate and upgrade Hong Kong’s financial and related professional services sectors. The HKMA also maintains close dialogue with the relevant authorities responsible for the development of the Bay Area to strengthen collaboration with a view to contributing to the financial development of the area as a world-class city cluster.\n\nOver the years, Hong Kong’s financial industry has been developing under the theme of “leveraging Hong Kong’s advantages, meeting the country’s needs”. With the introduction of the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect in 2014, the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect in 2016 and the Northbound Trading of Bond Connect in July last year, the mutual market access between the Mainland and the rest of the world through Hong Kong’s financial platform has been expanded from stock markets to bond markets. This underscores Hong Kong’s unique role as a financial intermediary in facilitating global investors’ access to the Mainland’s financial markets. In 2017, Hong Kong maintained its position as the leading global hub for offshore renminbi business. Average daily turnover of the renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement system stood at RMB900 billion. In addition, according to SWIFT statistics, more than 70% of global renminbi payment transactions were handled through Hong Kong during the year. The offshore renminbi market continued to operate smoothly and develop steadily.\n\n# Nurturing talent to strengthen the soft power of the banking industry\n\nWith the continuing growth of the financial industry, nurturing talent is crucial to its sustainable development. The HKMA attaches great importance to the soft power of the banking industry, and we have been encouraging and supporting ongoing capacity building of banking practitioners. Following the introduction of two modules on anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism and cybersecurity under the Enhanced Competency Framework, we expanded its coverage last year by including retail wealth management and treasury management to enhance the level of core competence of banking practitioners through continuing professional development. The HKMA is also committed to nurturing young talent for the banking industry. In 2017, we launched the Pilot Apprenticeship Programme for Private Wealth Management and the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme in collaboration with the industry. Given the overwhelming response, the coverage of these programmes will be further expanded in the future.\n\n# Prudent investment strategy achieving a reasonable and stable return over the medium to long term\n\nOn the back of strong global economic growth, the Exchange Fund achieved a record high investment income of HK$264 billion last year with gains across the board, including equities, bonds and foreign exchange. The overall investment return was 7.4%. The Investment Portfolio achieved a rate of return of 12.1%, while the Backing Portfolio gained 1.8%. The Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP)’s annualised internal rate of return since its inception in 2009 reached as high as 13.7%. While the investment performance last year was satisfactory, the increasingly complex investment environment requires the HKMA to continue its prudent management of the Exchange Fund. We will remain agile and nimble, monitor market developments closely and deploy defensive measures as and when appropriate. Investments under the LTGP will also be further expanded. As always, the investment principle of “capital preservation first, long-term growth next” within acceptable risk levels will be adhered to when managing the wealth for the people of Hong Kong.\n\nWhile the global real economy is extending last year’s growth momentum, uncertainties and risks still abound in 2018. These include a faster-than-expected pace of US interest rate hikes in case inflation picks up, escalating trade frictions and a deteriorating geopolitical landscape. Should these downside risks materialise, they will have significant and widespread implications for global financial markets, and knock-on effects for Hong Kong’s fund flows, asset prices and real economy. It is therefore advisable that we should all manage the risks prudently.\n\nIn the coming months, it is likely Hong Kong dollar interest rate movements will remain in the spotlight. The US Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times since December 2015. With widening spreads between Hong Kong dollar interest rates and their US dollar counterparts, there is a greater incentive for funds to flow from the Hong Kong dollar into the US dollar. The Hong Kong dollar has been under weakening pressure recently and the 7.85 weak-side Convertibility Undertaking (CU) has been triggered. As we have repeatedly stated, when the 7.85 weak-side CU is triggered, the HKMA will act as a “super money changer” by buying Hong Kong dollars and selling US dollars in the market to ensure that the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate will not weaken beyond the 7.85 level. Such operations are normal and in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System. This should not cause any concern. Indeed, the Exchange Fund currently holds more than HK$4 trillion worth of assets, of which the Hong Kong dollar Monetary Base amounts to about HK$1.7 trillion, providing a strong buffer in the event of fund outflows. Over the years, the HKMA has put in place various lines of defence to safeguard the stability of the banking and financial systems. From a positive perspective, capital outflows will lead to a gradual increase in Hong Kong dollar interest rates, which will be conducive to the normalisation of the interest rate environment in Hong Kong and hence the sustainable development of the local economy and asset markets. During this process, the HKMA will stay vigilant and make every effort to maintain monetary and banking stability in Hong Kong.\n", "zh": "首席行政長官聲明\n\n在2017年，全球經濟與金融市場的表現遠超預期：實體經濟穩步增長，通脹保持低迷，美國聯邦儲備局（聯儲局）當年的三次升息及縮減資產負債表並未引發新興市場資本外流或美元走強。在樂觀情緒推動下，全球股市，包括三大美國股指，不斷創出新高。MSCI新興市場指數飆升34%。恒生指數在2017年累升近8,000點（或36%），並在2018年1月突破30,000點，創下歷史新高。\n\n許多投資者在如此有利的環境中充滿樂觀，甚至是亢奮。然而，這情況一直持續到今年2月初，當最新數據顯示美國工資上升超出預期，促使投資者重新評估通脹風險，並引發全球股市大幅調整。2月的第二週，道瓊斯指數在兩天內下跌逾1,000點，同一週，恒生指數亦跌逾3,000點。10年期美國國債收益率升至高點2.95%。資金流向的快速逆轉表明，市場創Record的估值並非建立在穩固的基礎之上，也提醒我們，香港金融體系的健全與韌性對應對資產市場所帶來的波動和資本外流的挑戰至關重要。\n\n銀行體系韌性由預防措施強化\n\n俗話說：「預防勝於治療」。香港金融管理局（HKMA）在2017年進一步實施風險緩解措施，以保障香港金融體系的穩定。五月，我們推出了第八輪逆周期措施，加強對銀行抵押貸款的風險管理，並強化對貸款予房地產開發商的信用風險管理，旨在提升銀行體系應對房地產市場不景氣帶來沖擊的韌性。經過多輪措施，截止2017年底，新增住宅按揭貸款的平均貸款成數由2009年九月的64%下降至49%，而平均負債償還比率亦由2010年八月的41%下降至35%。\n\n2017年，我們成立了解決辦公室，以實施有關被視為“過大而不能倒”的非可行性金融機構的國際解決標準，協助防止類似2008年全球金融危機的重演，確保公共資金不再用於拯救失敗的金融機構，同時減少其倒閉對金融系統、經濟及社會的影響。\n\n強健的風險管理是銀行業穩定與可持續發展的基石。香港的銀行系統的流動比率和資本充足率遠高於法定要求，且位居世界前列。這充分反映了香港銀行系統的高度韌性。事實上，2017年，銀行業實現強勁增長，總貸款增長16%，資產質素亦保持良好。零售銀行的不良貸款分類比率由2016年的0.72%降至0.54%，遠低於2000年以來的長期平均值2.2%。整體股本回報率（以稅前經營利潤計算）在2017年達到11.74%，遠高於其他國際金融中心的水平。\n\n健全的銀行體系是長期金融穩定的關鍵\n\n2008年全球金融危機揭示了僅依靠規則與法規限制金融行業追求盈利而忽視主要責任的弊端。基於此，HKMA近年來加強推廣「健全銀行」的實踐，鼓勵銀行建立和追求良好的企業文化和價值觀。特別是為了解決銀行員工追求短期利潤而損害客戶或銀行長遠利益的問題，我們鼓勵銀行建立符合其企業文化和價值觀的激勵制度。為配合這一倡議，我們於2017年三月舉辦了首屆獨立非執行董事（INED）年度會議，強調建立良好銀行文化的重要性，並賦予INED更有效履行監督職能的能力。\n\n在銀行業的支持下，2017年，HKMA在促進金融包容方面取得了豐碩成果。六間實體分行及三個流動分行在偏遠地區開始營運。香港銀行協會與EPS和便利店連鎖店合作，推出試點計劃，讓長者可以在偏遠地區的商店提取現金，毋需購物。香港郵政亦於今年推出針對離島及新界長者的現金提取服務，於七間郵局提供服務。在帳戶開設方面，HKMA去年建立了一個專用網頁和一個專責團隊來跟進公眾對開戶的查詢或投訴。在各方的共同努力下，個人和企業銀行帳戶的開戶體驗有了顯著改善。\n\n金融科技（Fintech）為銀行業的變革帶來新機遇\n\n在科技快速發展的時代，金融科技正逐步融入我們的日常生活。在不斷變化的科技環境中，銀行必須擁抱新技術並推動創新。隨著智能銀行（Smart Banking）時代的來臨，HKMA於九月推出七項倡議（詳見第106頁），推動金融科技在銀行業的應用，以提升銀行產品和服務質素。這些倡議雖然彼此獨立，但相互補充，並將為香港的支付與銀行服務未來格局帶來變革。客戶不僅能享受更方便、更高效、更安全的支付與銀行服務，還能擁有更多選擇與更大的控制權。金融科技將是銀行未來成功的關鍵，進入智能銀行的新時代，將為銀行業帶來升級與轉型的絕佳機遇。\n\n「一帶一路」和粵港澳大灣區倡議創造的巨大機遇\n\n隨著國際金融中心競爭日益激烈，多元化的金融產業對香港尤為重要。2017年，HKMA加強了提升香港作為國際金融中心競爭力的工作。憑藉「依託內地，面向國際」的獨特優勢，「一帶一路」倡議和粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）的發展，為金融及銀行業帶來巨大機遇，並為香港經濟增長注入新動力。由於應對「一帶一路」的需求而設立的基建融資促進辦公室，自啟動以來合作夥伴已增至約90家，為推動香港成為基礎建設投資融資樞紐打下堅實基礎。2017年，中國國開行發行的首張「一帶一路」債券突顯香港在這些基建項目融資中的重要作用。\n\n除了基礎建設融資外，我們積極促進香港成為企業財資中心、私募股權基金和亞太衍生品業務的樞紐，吸引跨國公司和主要金融機構在本地管理資金、資產及各類金融風險。這些舉措將進一步鞏固和提升香港的金融與相關專業服務產業。HKMA亦與粵港澳大灣區相關主管部門保持密切對話，加強合作，促進該地區作為世界級城市群的金融發展。\n\n多年來，香港金融業一直在「發揮優勢，迎合需求」的主題下穩步發展。自2014年推出滬港通、2016年推出深港通，以及去年七月推出北向債券通，內地與世界的互聯互通平台由股市擴展至債券市場，彰顯香港在促進全球投資者進入內地金融市場的獨特角色。2017年，香港仍然保持著離岸人民幣業務全球中心的地位。人民幣即時結算系統的每日平均交易額達到9000億元人民幣。此外，根據SWIFT數據，去年超過70%的全球人民幣支付交易通過香港處理。離岸人民幣市場持續平穩運行並穩步發展。\n\n培育人才，提升銀行業的軟實力\n\n隨著金融行業的持續增長，人才培養尤為關鍵。HKMA高度重視銀行業的軟實力，並一向鼓勵與支持行內持續的人才能力建設。在引入反洗錢、反恐融資和網絡安全的強化能力框架兩個模組後，我們去年擴展其範圍，加入零售財富管理和財資管理，提升銀行從業員的核心能力。HKMA亦致力於培育年輕人才。2017年，我們與行業合作推出私人財富管理見習計劃及金融科技職業推廣計劃。由於反響熱烈，今後這些計劃的範圍將進一步擴大。\n\n謹慎投資策略達成合理穩健的中長期回報\n\n在全球經濟復甦動力強勁的背景下，匯豐基金去年創下2640億港元的投資收益新高，股票、債券和外匯等多元投資均錄得收益。整體投資回報率為7.4%。投資組合的回報率達12.1%，支持組合則取得1.8%的增長。自2009年成立以來，長期增長組合（LTGP）的年化內部收益率高達13.7%。儘管去年投資表現令人滿意，但愈加複雜的投資環境要求HKMA繼續謹慎管理匯豐基金。我們將保持敏捷，密切監察市場動態，並在適當時採取防禦性措施。LTGP的投資規模亦將進一步擴大。管理香港人民財富時，我們仍將本著「資本首要，長遠成長」的投資原則，在可接受的風險水平下行事。\n\n儘管全球實體經濟仍在延續去年增長動能，但2018年仍有不少不確定因素與風險，包括若通脹上升，美國升息速度快於預期、貿易摩擦升級及地緣政治局勢惡化。若這些下行風險成真，將對全球金融市場產生深遠且廣泛的影響，並對香港的資金流動、資產價格及實體經濟帶來連鎖反應。因此，謹慎管理風險是明智之舉。\n\n在未來數月，港元利率走勢仍值得關注。自2015年12月以來，美聯儲已六次升息。在港元利率與美元利率差距擴大下，資金由港元流向美元的誘因增加。近期港元正面臨貶值壓力，7.85的弱方兌換承諾（CU）已被觸發。正如我們多次重申，當7.85弱方CU被觸發時，HKMA將扮演「超級貨幣兌換商」角色，在市場上買入港元並出售美元，以確保港幣匯率不會貶破7.85水平。這些操作是正常且符合聯匯制度設計的，不應引起擔憂。事實上，匯豐基金持有超過4萬億港元資產，其中港幣貨幣基礎約為1.7萬億港元，在資金外流情況下提供了堅實的緩衝。多年來，HKMA已建立多條防線，以保障銀行及金融系統的穩定。從積極角度看，資金外流將促使港元利率逐步上升，有助於港元利率環境的正常化，促進本地經濟與資產市場的可持續發展。在此過程中，HKMA將保持警覺，竭盡全力維持香港的貨幣與銀行體系穩定。"}

{"en": "# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nAgainst the backdrop of a more synchronised expansion of the global economy, Hong Kong saw faster economic growth, tighter labour market conditions and subdued inflationary pressures in 2017. Economic growth for 2018 is expected to remain solid.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Real activities\n\nAmid a more synchronised expansion of the global economy, the Hong Kong economy grew faster in 2017. Growth in real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increased to 3.8%, much higher than the 2.1% growth in 2016 and the long-term growth of about 3% over the past decade (Chart 1 and Table 1). Domestic demand firmed up, with private consumption growth accelerating and overall investment spending reviving. Stronger domestic demand reflected favourable job and income conditions, booming asset prices and improved business sentiment. Externally, Hong Kong’s exports of goods expanded at a faster pace due to increased global trade flows, and exports of services recovered because of vibrant trade and cargo flows and improving inbound tourism. Imports of goods recorded stronger growth on export-induced demand, and imports of services increased steadily amid strong travel interest among residents. On a net basis, the overall trade surplus shrank, making a negative contribution to GDP growth.\n\n\n# Monetary conditions\n\nOn the monetary front, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate generally eased against the US dollar driven primarily by interest rate arbitrage activities amid the negative interest rate differentials between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar. This reflected the normal functioning of the Linked Exchange Rate System in accordance with its design. While still at relatively low levels, Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates faced more upward pressures towards the end of 2017 due to Initial Public Offeringrelated funding demand and banks’ year-end liquidity needs. For credit growth, after two years of single-digit growth, total bank loans increased at a notably faster pace of 16.1% in 2017, reflecting improving economic conditions and positive financial market sentiment. Despite faster loan growth, there were no signs of loosening of banks’ credit underwriting standards, and overall loan quality remained good.\n\n# Inflation\n\nInflationary pressures remained well contained throughout 2017 (Chart 2). Netting out the effects of the Government’s one-off relief measures, the underlying inflation rate declined to 1.7%, down from 2.3% in 2016. In particular, the housing component of the price index increased at a milder pace, reflecting the filter-through of slower increases in fresh-letting private residential rentals in 2016. More broadly, milder increases in nominal wages and earnings amid strong output growth helped keep local cost pressures in check. Import price inflation was also tame, in line with low inflation in Hong Kong’s major import sources despite a weaker US dollar.\n\n# Labour market\n\nThe labour market tightened in 2017 along with above-par economic growth. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell from 3.4% in 2016 to 2.9% towards the end of 2017, below 3% for the first time in nearly 20 years (Chart 3). Most major economic sectors registered decreases in their respective unemployment rates, with more notable declines seen in the retail, financing and professional and business services sectors. As total employment grew faster and the number of private-sector vacancies picked up, overall labour demand continued to strengthen. The labour force also expanded, partly reflecting more active participation of older-age workers (aged 55 and above). Consistent with tighter labour market conditions and lower inflation, real wages and earnings saw faster increases.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe Hong Kong stock market had an almost uninterrupted rally in 2017. The Hang Seng Index rose by 36%, the largest annual gain since 2010 (Chart 4). The rally reflected optimism about the global economy and corporate earnings, and was in part supported by substantial fund inflows from Mainland investors through the Stock Connects. The Hang Seng Index hit a ten-year high in November and remained at high levels towards the end of 2017. Average daily turnover expanded to HK$88.3 billion from HK$66.9 billion in the previous year, and overall equity funds raised from the local market also increased to HK$581.4 billion, compared with HK$490.1 billion a year earlier.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market maintained its upward momentum throughout the year (Chart 4). Transaction volume expanded from 54,701 units a year ago to 61,591 units and housing prices increased by 14.8% in 2017. Housing affordability stretched further, with a price-toincome ratio of 16.4, higher than the previous peak in 1997, and an income-gearing ratio of 74.1, far above its long-term average.1 In view of rising property prices and the intensifying competition for mortgage business among banks, the HKMA introduced the eighth round of prudential measures in May to strengthen banks’ risk management and safeguard banking stability. Housing price growth moderated temporarily following these measures before accelerating in the fourth quarter. As for the commercial and industrial property markets, trading activities increased significantly during the year, with both transaction value and volume registering double-digit growth. With the pick-up in non-residential property prices, corresponding rental yields fell slightly compared to the previous year.\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nEconomic growth for 2018 is expected to remain solid. The Government forecasts growth in the range of 3–4%, while private-sector analysts project the economy to expand at an average rate of 3.2%. Externally, Hong Kong’s export performance will continue to benefit from the improving global growth outlook and the gradual recovery in inbound tourism. Domestically, private consumption growth is expected to hold up mainly as a result of favourable labour market conditions. As for fixed capital formation, building and construction activity should progress steadily on the back of rising housing supply and continuing infrastructure projects. While improved economic conditions will support business capital spending, headwinds may come from potential rises in interest rates.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nWith still-moderate global inflation and steady increase in local costs, inflationary pressures in Hong Kong are anticipated to remain moderate in 2018, but the inflation rate is likely to pick up gradually from the low in 2017. For example, the rental component of inflation may gather momentum in the latter part of 2018 because of feedthrough from increases in fresh-letting private residential rentals. Market consensus predicts the headline inflation rate to be a still-moderate 2.2% for 2018, and the Government projects the underlying inflation rate to be 2.5%. On the other hand, sustained economic growth, expanding building and construction activity and the gradual recovery in inbound tourism are expected to keep the labour market tight in the near future. Private-sector analysts forecast the unemployment rate to stay at about 3.0% in 2018.\n\n# Uncertainties and risks\n\nThe economic outlook for 2018 is subject to a number of uncertainties and risks including those relating to major central banks’ monetary policy normalisation and global financial market stability, as well as heightened protectionist sentiment and deteriorating geopolitical tensions. In particular, if such risks materialise to trigger reversal of fund flows in Hong Kong, local monetary conditions could tighten faster than expected, putting downward pressures on the real economy and asset prices.\n\nThe outlook for the residential property market remains uncertain. In the near term, the current favourable domestic economic conditions, perceived housing shortage, low mortgage rates and alternative sources of home financing (including mortgage loans provided by property developers and financial support from parents), will continue to support the demand for properties. However, the recent sell-off in global financial markets may dampen sentiments. Over the longer term, the property market will continue to face a number of headwinds. In particular, as the US monetary policy normalisation continues, domestic mortgage rates will rise eventually. In addition, on the back of the Government’s effort to increase the supply of land and residential properties, the housing demand-supply gap is expected to narrow gradually, which would ease the upward pressure on property prices in the longer term.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector continued to be safe and sound in 2017 notwithstanding uncertainties surrounding the global economy. The capital and liquidity positions of authorized institutions (AIs) remained strong, asset quality stayed at healthy levels, and profitability improved notably thanks to increased interest margins and robust credit growth.\n\n# Interest rate trends\n\nAs the US interest rate normalisation continued, the onemonth and three-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) fixings increased by 49 basis points and 39 basis points respectively in 2017. More notable rises were observed in the fourth quarter. Nevertheless, the Hong Kong dollar funding cost of retail banks, as measured by the composite interest rate, remained broadly stable over the year (Chart 5).\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe aggregate pre-tax operating profits of retail banks’ Hong Kong offices grew by 15.8% in 2017. The improved performance was mainly due to increases in net interest income (+20.3%) and fee and commission income (+9.4%). However, these increases were partially offset by a decline in income from foreign exchange and derivatives operations (-29.9%) and a growth in operating expenses (+8.4%). The aggregate post-tax profit of retail banks dropped by 18.1% because of certain non-recurring items recorded in 2016. The post-tax return on average assets of retail banks dropped to 1.07% from 1.44% in 2016 (Chart 6).\n\nRetail banks’ net interest margin widened to 1.45% in 2017 from 1.32% in 2016 (Chart 7) mainly due to rising market interest rates.\n\nThe proportion of retail banks’ non-interest income to total operating income decreased to 40% from 44.3% in 2016. While fee and commission income increased by 9.4%, income originated from foreign exchange and derivatives operations dropped by 29.9%.\n\nRetail banks’ cost-to-income ratio declined to 41.9% in 2017 from 43.2% in 2016, as operating costs (+8.4%) increased at a slower pace than operating income (+11.8%) (Chart 8). Retail banks’ loan impairment charges decreased to HK$7.3 billion from HK$8 billion in 2016.\n\n# Asset quality\n\nLoan quality of retail banks improved during the year, with the classified loan ratio decreasing to 0.54% from 0.72% a year earlier. The overdue and rescheduled loan ratio also decreased to 0.4% from 0.53% in 2016 (Chart 9). Similarly, the classified loan ratio and the overdue and rescheduled loan ratio of the whole banking sector decreased to 0.67% and 0.52%, from 0.85% and 0.67% respectively.\n\nThe quality of banks’ residential mortgage lending portfolios remained good, with the delinquency ratio staying at a low level of 0.03% at the end of 2017 (Chart 10). The rescheduled loan ratio was close to 0%. There was no residential mortgage loan in negative equity at the end of the year, as compared with four cases a year ago.\n\nThe delinquency ratio of credit card lending stayed low at 0.22% at the end of 2017, compared with 0.24% a year ago (Chart 10). The combined delinquent and rescheduled loan ratio edged down to 0.31% from 0.33% during the period. The charge-off ratio also fell slightly to 1.75% from 1.92% in 2016.\n\n# Balance sheet trends\n\nTotal loans of the banking sector grew by 16.1% in 2017, compared with 6.5% in 2016. Demand for credit increased, driven by optimism about the global economic outlook. As total deposits increased at a slower pace than total loans, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio rose to 73% at the end of 2017 from 68.4% a year earlier. The Hong Kong-dollar loan-to-deposit ratio also increased to 82.7% from 77.1% during the same period (Chart 11).\n\nMainland-related lending (including loans booked in Mainland subsidiaries of locally incorporated banks) increased by 17.5% in 2017, compared with a growth of 7% recorded in 2016.\n\n# Holdings of negotiable debt securities\n", "zh": "# 經濟與金融環境\n\n在全球經濟更同步擴張的背景下，香港於2017年經濟增長較快，勞動市場狀況收緊，通脹壓力較為緩和。預計2018年的經濟增長仍將保持穩健。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 實體活動\n\n在全球經濟更同步擴展的情況下，香港經濟在2017年增長速度加快。名義國內生產總值（GDP）增長率升至3.8%，大大高於2016年的2.1%及過去十年的長期平均約3%（圖1及表1）。內需穩固，私人消費增長加快，整體投資亦復甦。強勁的內需反映出就業和收入狀況良好、資產價格繁榮以及商業情緒改善。在外貿方面，香港貨物出口由於全球貿易流量增加而擴展得更快，服務出口亦因貿易及貨運活動旺盛及入境旅遊改善而復甦。貨物進口因出口需求增加而加快增長，服務進口則在居民強烈出行意願的背景下穩步上升。整體而言，貿易順差縮小，對GDP增長呈負面影響。\n\n# 貨幣條件\n\n在貨幣方面，由於港元與美元之間的利差負面，加上套利活動推動，港元兌美元匯率一般呈較弱走勢，反映聯繫匯率制度的正常運作。雖然仍處於較低水平，但2017年底，灣仔區銀行間拆息利率因首次公開募股（IPO）相關融資需求和銀行年終流動性需求而面臨上行壓力較大。就信貸增長而言，經歷兩年單位數增長後，2017年銀行貸款總額以16.1%的明顯速度增長，反映經濟情況改善及金融市場情緒正面。儘管貸款增長較快，但銀行的信貸撥備標準未見鬆動，整體貸款品質依然良好。\n\n# 通脹\n\n2017年，通脹壓力始終受到良好控制（圖2）。扣除政府一次性救濟措施的影響，基礎通脹率由2016年的2.3%下降至1.7%。特別是房地產價格指數中的住宅部分，漲幅較為溫和，反映2016年新租住宅租金漲幅放慢的滲透效應。更廣泛來說，名義工資及收入的增長較為溫和，加上產出快速增長，有助於抑制本地成本壓力。進口物價漲幅亦較為溫和，符合儘管美元走弱但香港主要進口來源國的低通脹水平。\n\n# 勞動市場\n\n隨著經濟超越潛在增長率，2017年勞動市場趨緊。經季節調整失業率由2016年的3.4%下降至2017年底的2.9%，首次低於3%，是近20年來首次（圖3）。各主要經濟行業的失業率均有下降，零售、金融及專業和商業服務等行業尤為顯著。由於就業人數增加及私營部門職缺上升，勞動需求持續增強。勞動力亦有所擴大，部分原因是較為積極的高齡勞工（55歲及以上）參與。與勞動市場緊縮和通脹較低相一致，實質工資及收入亦增長較快。\n\n# 股市\n\n2017年，香港股市幾乎連續上升。恒生指數上升36%，是自2010年以來最大年度升幅（圖4）。此次牛市反映出市場對全球經濟及企業盈利的樂觀預期，也部分由大陸投資者通過通股通的資金大量流入支持。恒生指數於去年11月創十年高點，並在年末仍維持高位。股市日均成交額由前一年的66.9億港元擴大至88.3億港元，另外本地市場籌集的股票基金總額亦由490.1億港元增加到581.4億港元。\n\n# 地產市場\n\n住宅地產市場整年保持上升趨勢（圖4）。成交量由一年前的54,701個單位增加至61,591個單位，房價則上升14.8%。住房負擔能力進一步降低，房價收入比達16.4，超過1997年的高峰，收入負擔比則高達74.1，遠高於其長期平均水平。面對房價上升與銀行之間在按揭業務上的激烈競爭，港銀在5月推出了第八輪樓市審慎措施，以加強銀行風險管理及保障金融穩定。這些措施短暫抑制了房價增長，隨後在第四季度再次加快。商用及工業物業方面，交易活動大增，成交價值與成交量均錄得兩位數增長。非住宅物業價格回升引致相應的租金收益率略有下降。\n\n# 經濟展望\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n預計2018年的經濟增長仍將保持穩健。政府預測增長範圍為3%至4%，而私營分析師則預計平均增長率約3.2%。在外部方面，香港的出口表現將繼續受惠於全球經濟前景的改善及入境旅遊的逐步復甦。國內方面，私人消費增長預計能主要由有利的勞動市場條件支撐。至於固定資本形成，隨著住房供應增加及基礎建設項目持續推進，建築與施工活動應穩步發展。經濟條件的改善將支持企業資本支出，但利率升高的潛在逆風仍存在。\n\n# 通脹與勞動市場\n\n由於全球通脹仍屬溫和，本地成本持續上升，預計香港的通脹壓力在2018年仍將保持適度，但通脹率有望逐步由2017年的低點回升。例如，因反映新租私宅租金上升的傳導效應，租金通脹在2018年後期可能加速。市場普遍預測2018年整體通脹率仍為溫和的2.2%，政府則預測基礎通脹率為2.5%。另一方面，持續的經濟增長、建築和施工活動的擴張，以及入境旅遊的逐步復甦，預計將保持勞動市場的緊俏狀況。私營分析師預測2018年失業率約保持在3.0%左右。\n\n# 不確定因素與風險\n\n2018年的經濟展望存在多種不確定性與風險，包括主要中央銀行貨幣政策正常化及全球金融市場的穩定性，此外還有貿易保護主義情緒升溫和地緣政治緊張局勢惡化。若這些風險成真，導致資金流動在香港逆轉，當地的貨幣條件可能比預期緊張，對實體經濟與資產價格形成下行壓力。\n\n住宅物業市場的前景仍存不確定性。在短期內，有利的國內經濟條件、預期住房短缺、低廉的按揭利率及其他房屋融資渠道（包括地產發展商提供的按揭貸款及父母的財務支持）將繼續支撐房地產需求。然而，近期全球金融市場的拋售可能削弱市場情緒。長遠來看，房地產市場仍將面對多重逆風，尤其隨著美國貨幣政策正常化，國內按揭利率最終將上升。此外，為配合政府增加土地及住宅供應的努力，房屋需求與供應差距預計將逐步縮小，從而在長期內緩解房價的上行壓力。\n\n# 銀行業績表現\n\n儘管全球經濟存在不確定性，2017年香港銀行業仍保持安全穩健。持牌機構的資本與流動性狀況保持強健，資產質量保持在健康水平，盈利能力亦顯著改善，主要得益於利差擴大及信貸增長穩健。\n\n# 利率趨勢\n\n隨著美國利率繼續正常化，2017年港元拆息（HIBOR）的一個月及三個月利率分別上升了49個基點及39個基點。在第四季度尤為顯著。然而，衡量零售銀行融資成本的複合利率在全年大致保持穩定（圖5）。\n\n# 獲利趨勢\n\n零售銀行在港營業的稅前總營運利潤在2017年增長15.8%，主要受淨利息收入（+20.3%）及手續費收入（+9.4%）的提升所推動。但部分增幅被外匯與衍生品業務收入下降（-29.9%）及營運費用上升（+8.4%）所抵銷。由於2016年錄得一些非經常性項目，整體稅後純利下降18.1%。平均資產的稅後回報率由2016年的1.44%降至1.07%（圖6）。\n\n由於市場利率上升，零售銀行的淨利差擴大至1.45%（圖7），高於2016年的1.32%。\n\n零售銀行非利息收入佔總營運收入的比例由2016年的44.3%降低至40%。手續費收入雖然增加9.4%，但外匯及衍生品業務收入則下降29.9%。\n\n營運成本佔收入比由43.2%下降至41.9%，因營運成本（+8.4%）增長速度較收入（+11.8%）緩慢（圖8）。信貸減值準備由2016年的80億港元減少至73億港元。\n\n# 資產質量\n\n全年內，零售銀行的貸款質量改善，不良貸款比率由去年同期的0.72%降至0.54%。逾期及重組貸款比率亦由2016年的0.53%降至0.4%（圖9）。整個銀行業的不良貸款比率及逾期和重組貸款比率亦分別由0.85%和0.67%降至0.67%及0.52%。\n\n住宅按揭貸款的質量依然良好，到年末拖欠比率保持在低水平的0.03%（圖10），重組貸款比率接近0%。年末未有房屋按揭貸款出現負資產情況，較一年前的四宗為零。\n\n信用卡貸款的拖欠比率仍低，年末為0.22%，較一年前的0.24%略有下降（圖10）。拖欠及重組貸款的合併比率由0.33%微降至0.31%。壞帳比率亦由2016年的1.92%略微下降至1.75%。\n\n# 資產負債表趨勢\n\n2017年，銀行業的貸款總額增長16.1%，高於2016年的6.5%。由於對全球經濟前景的樂觀情緒，信貸需求增加。在存款增長較貸款慢的情況下，整體貸存比由去年同期的68.4%上升至73%。港幣貸款存款比亦由77.1%上升至82.7%（圖11）。\n\n與大陸相關的借貸（包括在內地子公司批出的貸款）2017年增長17.5%，高於2016年的7%。"}
{"en": "# Monetary Stability\n\nDespite weakening pressure on the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to operate in an orderly manner with ample liquidity. The Linked Exchange Rate System has served as a strong anchor for Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability and proved to be highly resilient against various shocks.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability. This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n- Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three noteissuing banks\n- Government-issued notes and coins in circulation\n- the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of the clearing account balances of banks kept with the HKMA\n- Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the HKMA’s firm commitment to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs). When the demand for Hong Kong dollars is greater than the supply and the market exchange rate strengthens to the strong-side CU of HK$7.75 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to sell Hong Kong dollars to banks for US dollars. The Aggregate Balance will then expand to push down Hong Kong dollar interest rates, creating monetary conditions that move the Hong Kong dollar away from the strong-side limit to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if the supply of Hong Kong dollars is greater than the demand and the market exchange rate weakens to the weak-side CU of HK$7.85 to one US dollar, the HKMA will buy Hong Kong dollars from banks. The Aggregate Balance will then contract to drive Hong Kong dollar interest rates up, pushing the Hong Kong dollar away from the weak-side limit to stay within the Convertibility Zone.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2017\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate generally saw weakening pressure in 2017 (Chart 1). Driven mainly by interest carry trade activities amid widened negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates, the Hong Kong dollar eased gradually against the US dollar, from 7.7566 on 3 January to the year-low of 7.8265 on 22 August. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate gained some strength between late September and early November, underpinned by a tightening of Hong Kong dollar liquidity due to initial public offering (IPO)-related funding demand, and traded steadily within a narrow range of 7.80–7.81. Weakening pressures on the Hong Kong dollar were seen again towards the end of the year, partly reflecting slightly improved Hong Kong dollar liquidity conditions as well as increased year-end commercial demand for the US dollar. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market functioned normally throughout 2017.\n\nAs the CUs were not triggered, the total of the Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs remained virtually unchanged at around HK$1,225.3 billion in 2017 (Chart 2). During the year, the HKMA issued a total of HK$80 billion additional Exchange Fund Bills to meet banks’ increased demand for liquidity management. This led to a contraction of the Aggregate Balance to HK$179.8 billion at the end of 2017. The issuance of additional Exchange Fund Bills was consistent with Currency Board principles, as it only represented a change in the composition of the Monetary Base, with a shift from the Aggregate Balance to the outstanding EFBNs. The Monetary Base remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\n# Money market\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates stayed soft in the first eight months of 2017 before facing more upward pressure towards the end of the year (Chart 3). Despite concerns about the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes and balance sheet normalisation, the Hong Kong dollar interbank rates generally remained soft for the first eight months. As such, the negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates widened between January and August. From September onward, the shortdated Hong Kong dollar interbank rates witnessed large pick-ups, driven mainly by IPO-related and year-end funding demand. Correspondingly, the negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates narrowed in the short-dated segment. Overall, the short-dated interbank rates traded mostly below the Base Rate in 2017.\n\nThe Base Rate was adjusted upwards on 16 March, 15 June and 14 December, by a total of 75 basis points from 1.00% to 1.75%, as the target range for the US federal funds rate moved upward three times by a total of 75 basis points from 0.50–0.75% to 1.25–1.50% during the year. The adjustment of the Base Rate was in accordance with the revised formula announced on 26 March 2009, in which the Base Rate is set at either 50 basis points above the lower bound of the prevailing target range for the US federal funds rate or the average of the five-day moving averages of the overnight and one-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs), whichever is the higher.\n\nRoughly tracking the movements of the Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads, the discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points widened gradually during the first three quarters, with the 12-month Hong Kong dollar forward points reaching about -615 pips in midSeptember (Chart 4). In the fourth quarter, the discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points narrowed slightly along with the narrowing of the negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates. Overall, Hong Kong’s money market continued to operate in an orderly manner and interbank liquidity remained ample. Discount Window borrowing increased from HK$5.3 billion in 2016 to HK$10.3 billion in 2017.\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nSince its establishment in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has served as a strong anchor for Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, and proved to be highly resilient in a series of regional and global financial crises. The Government has reasserted its full commitment to the LERS and the credibility of its commitment was further reinforced by the stability in the foreign exchange and money markets. There is also continued strong public confidence in the Hong Kong dollar as a means of payment and a storage of value. In its 2017 Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund reaffirmed its support for the LERS, commenting that the LERS remained the best exchange rate arrangement for Hong Kong. Combined with robust financial supervision and regulation, prudent fiscal management, and flexible markets, the LERS has worked well to help Hong Kong navigate successfully through both external and domestic challenges.\n\nInternational Monetary Fund: “The Linked Exchange Rate System remains the best arrangement for Hong Kong.”\n\nA sound banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS. During 2017, the HKMA continued to monitor closely banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and stepped up its supervisory efforts on corporate, property-related and mainland-related lending to bolster the resilience of the banking sector. As the US Federal Reserve continues to normalise its monetary policy, the Hong Kong dollar interest rates will gradually normalise as well. The HKMA reiterated that, under the design of the LERS, the outflow of capital, the weakening of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, the triggering of the weak-side CU and the reduction of the Monetary Base are part of the necessary process of the normalisation of Hong Kong dollar interest rates. The HKMA also reminded the public to manage their risks prudently and be well prepared for potential financial turbulence.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio, defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base, moved within a range of 106.7–108.2% during 2017, without touching the Upper or Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 108.1% on 31 December (Chart 5). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. In the event of abrupt shocks, the sizeable amount of financial resources of the Exchange Fund will provide a powerful backstop in protecting Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\n# Other activities\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to the monetary and financial stability of Hong Kong. In 2017, the CBC considered various issues, including the drivers of short-run dynamics in Hong Kong’s housing prices, the determinants of HIBOR-London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) spreads, the effect of property valuation changes on corporate borrowing in Mainland China, and the effect of mortgage debt service burden on private consumption in Hong Kong. Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and the reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research (HKIMR) continued to sponsor research in the fields of monetary policy, banking and finance. Over the past three years, the HKIMR has been re-orienting its activities towards higher policy relevance. This is reflected, in particular, in its conference activities and visiting fellowship programmes. The HKIMR has been collaborating with major central banks and policy institutions to jointly organise more policyfocused conferences. Meanwhile, a thematic research fellowship programme introduced in 2016 has been supporting more research projects related to policy issues that are of importance to the HKMA.\n\nIn 2017, the HKIMR hosted 18 research fellows and published 29 working papers. It also organised four international conferences and workshops during the year:\n- The Eighth Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy, titled “China’s Economic Rebalancing: Where is it Heading?”, was held in January in Hong Kong. The conference provided a forum for academics, policy makers and business economists to discuss important analytical and policy issues related to the Mainland economy. 11 highquality research papers were presented, covering a wide variety of issues including Mainland’s economic rebalancing, structural reform and international spillovers, issues on the renminbi exchange rate, and Mainland’s monetary policy framework and transmission.\n- The 15th HKIMR Summer Workshop was held in July. The workshop was intended to provide an opportunity for staff members of the HKIMR and the HKMA to present their research papers, and to enhance interaction between research staff and visiting fellows.\n- A joint conference organised by the HKMA and the Bank for International Settlements, titled “The Price, Real and Financial Effects of Exchange Rates”, was held in August. The conference provided a platform for in-depth and insightful discussion. A wide range of important topics were covered, including the exchange rate system, the pricing system of international trade, risk taking in the accumulation of foreign currency reserves, and foreign exchange market behaviour.\n- A conference jointly sponsored by the HKMA, the US Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta on “Unconventional Monetary Policy: Lessons Learned” was held in October. The conference reviewed lessons learned from the unconventional monetary policies (UMP) of major central banks over the past ten years. The topics included monetary policy in a low interest rate environment, UMP and its spillovers to emerging economies, UMP and bank lending, and UMP and its effects on the real economy and financial stability.\n", "zh": "# 貨幣穩定\n\n儘管對港幣兌換率的壓力有所減弱，香港的兌換和貨幣市場仍繼續有序運作，流動性充裕。聯匯制度一直是香港貨幣和金融穩定的堅強錨定，並在多次衝擊中展現出高度的韌性。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的首要目標是貨幣穩定。這被定義為在外匯市場中，港幣兌美元的外部匯率在HK$7.75至7.85的範圍內保持穩定。貨幣制度的結構特點是貨幣局安排，要求貨幣基礎至少由香港金融儲備（匯豐基金）中持有的美元儲備100%支持，貨幣基礎的變化必須與美元儲備的相應變化完全匹配。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n- 債券證券，為三家發鈔銀行發行的鈔票提供全額擔保\n- 政府發行的紙幣和硬幣\n- 總結餘，即香港金融管理局持有的銀行結算賬戶餘額之和\n- 代表政府發行的匯整基金票據（EFBNs）。\n\n通過自動利率調整機制以及金融管理局堅定履行兌換承諾（CUs），維持港幣兌美元匯率的穩定。當對港幣的需求大於供應，市場匯率升向強側CU的HK$7.75兌一美元時，香港金融管理局準備向銀行出售港幣換取美元，擴大總結餘以降低港幣利率，創造貨幣條件，使港幣離開強側限制，回到7.75至7.85的兌換區域。相反，當港幣供應大於需求，市場匯率弱向弱側CU的HK$7.85兌一美元時，金融管理局將從銀行買入港幣，縮減總結餘，推動港幣利率上升，將港幣推離弱側限制，保持在兌換區域內。\n\n# 2017年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定性\n\n2017年，港幣匯率普遍面臨弱勢壓力（圖1）。主要由於港幣與美元利差擴大帶動的利差交易活動，港幣對美元逐步走軟，從1月3日的7.7566漸至8月22日的年低點7.8265。在九月末至十一月初，受IPO相關資金需求以及港幣流動性收緊的支撐，港幣匯率略有回升，並在7.80至7.81的狹窄區間內穩定交易。年底前，港幣壓力再次出現，一部分是因為港幣流動性條件略有改善，以及對美元的年末商業需求增加。整體而言，2017年整年港幣匯市運作正常。\n\n由於未觸發兌換承諾，貨幣基礎與未償付EFBN合計餘額在2017年基本保持不變，約為HK$1225.3億（圖2）。年內，金融管理局增發了總額800億港元的匯豐基金票據，以應對銀行增加的流動性需求，使貨幣基礎於年底縮減至1798億港元。額外發行匯豐基金票據符合貨幣局原則，僅是貨幣基礎的組成變化，從總結餘轉向未償付EFBN，貨幣基礎仍完全由外匯儲備支持。\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n2017年前八個月，港幣同業拆息利率保持平穩，但年末開始壓力逐漸上升（圖3）。儘管市場擔憂美聯儲加息及資產負債表正常化，港幣拆息在前八個月仍較為平穩。此期間，港幣與美元利差擴大。九月起，受IPO和年終資金需求推動，短期港幣拆息大幅上升。相應地，港幣與美元短期利差縮小。整體來看，2017年短期拆息大多低於基準利率。\n\n基準利率在3月16日、6月15日及12月14日調升，共累計增加75個基點，從1.00%升至1.75%，因美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍在一年內累計提升75個基點，從0.50–0.75%上調至1.25–1.50%。基準利率的調整依據2009年3月26日修訂的公式，該公式設定基準利率為美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍的下限上方50個基點或是港幣隔夜及一個月拆借利率五日平均的較高值。\n\n追踪港幣兌美元利差的變動，港幣遠期點數折扣在前三季度逐漸擴大，到9月中旬達約-615點（圖4）。第四季度，隨著港幣與美元利差的縮小，港幣遠期點數折扣也略有收窄。整體來看，香港的貨幣市場仍有序運作，銀行間流動性充裕，批跌窗口借款由2016年的53億港元增加至2017年的103億港元。\n\n# 聯匯制度\n\n自1983年建立以來，聯匯制度（LERS）一直是香港貨幣和金融穩定的重要支柱，在一系列地區及全球金融危機中展現出高韌性。政府重申對聯匯制度的完全承諾，並因外匯及貨幣市場的穩定進一步鞏固其信譽。社會普遍對港幣作為支付手段和價值儲存工具保持高度信心。在2017年的國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）第IV財政會議中，IMF再次支持聯匯制度，並稱其為香港最適合的匯率安排。結合強健的金融監管和監督、謹慎的財政管理以及彈性市場，聯匯制度有效助力香港成功應對外部和內部挑戰。\n\n國際貨幣基金組織：“聯匯制度仍是香港最優的安排。”\n\n健全的銀行體系對於聯匯制度的正常運作至關重要。2017年，香港金融管理局持續密切監測銀行的信貸管理、流動性與利率風險，以及壓力測試結果，加強對企業、房地產相關及內地相關貸款的監督，以增強銀行業的韌性。隨著美聯儲繼續正常化貨幣政策，港幣利率也將逐步正常化。金融管理局重申，在聯匯制度設計下，資本外流、港幣貶值、觸發弱側兌換承諾及貨幣基礎縮減，都是港幣利率正常化過程中的必要步驟。金融管理局亦提醒公眾謹慎管理風險，為可能出現的金融動盪做好充分準備。\n\n為增加貨幣局賬目的透明度，自1998年10月起，已將部分匯豐基金資產作為貨幣基礎的擔保。1997年至2017年間，擔保比率（擔保資產除以貨幣基礎）維持在106.7%至108.2%範圍內，未觸及上下觸發水平。2017年12月31日，該比率結算為108.1%（圖5）。在聯匯制度下，儘管已指定特定匯豐基金資產作為擔保投資組合，但所有匯豐基金資產均可用於支持港幣匯率。在突發衝擊情況下，大量的匯豐基金資金將提供有力的支撐，保障香港的貨幣和金融穩定。\n\n# 其他活動\n\n匯豐基金諮詢委員會的貨幣局分委會（CBC）監督並審查與香港貨幣金融穩定相關的事宜。2017年，CBC審議了多個議題，包括香港樓價短期波動的驅動因素、香港隔夜拆借利率與倫敦銀行間拆借利率（LIBOR）利差的決定因素、房地產估值變化對內地企業借貸的影響，以及按揭債務負擔對香港私人消費的影響。這些討論和貨幣局運作報告均在金融管理局網站公布。\n\n香港貨幣研究所（HKIMR）繼續支持貨幣政策、銀行及金融領域的研究。在過去三年中，HKIMR正逐步調整其活動，使其更具政策相關性，尤其是在研討會和訪問研究員計畫方面。該所與主要中央銀行及政策機構合作，舉辦更多聚焦政策的研討會。同時，2016年引入的主題式研究研究金方案亦支持與HKMA重要政策議題相關的研究項目。\n\n2017年，HKIMR主持了18名研究員並發布了29份工作論文。同年，主辦了四場國際會議與工作坊：\n- 1月於香港舉行的第八屆中國經濟國際研討會，題為“中國經濟再平衡：前景何在？”，為學者、政策制定者與經濟學家討論內地經濟重要分析與政策議題提供平台。會上呈示了11篇高質量研究論文，涵蓋內地經濟再平衡、結構改革與國際溢出效應、人民幣匯率問題，以及內地貨幣政策框架與傳導等議題。\n- 7月舉行的第十五屆HKIMR夏季研討會，旨在促進HKIMR與HKMA研究人員交流研究成果，強化研究人員與訪問研究員之間的互動。\n- 8月由HKMA與國際清算銀行聯合舉辦的“匯率的價格、實體與金融效應”聯合會議，提供深入討論平台，涵蓋匯率制度、國際貿易定價、外匯儲備的風險管理以及外匯市場行為等重要議題。\n- 10月由HKMA、美聯儲聯邦公開市場委員會及亞特蘭大聯邦儲備銀行共同贊助的“非常規貨幣政策：經驗教訓”，回顧過去十年主要中央銀行非常規貨幣政策的經驗教訓。主題涉及低利率環境中的貨幣政策、非常規貨幣政策的溢出效應、銀行貸款，以及其對實體經濟和金融穩定的影響。"}
{"en": "# Banking Stability\n\nIn 2017, the HKMA continued to place its supervisory focus on the effectiveness of authorized institutions’ risk governance framework, including credit and liquidity risk management systems. During the year, another round of countercyclical macro-prudential measures was introduced to strengthen the resilience of the banking sector to cope with any downturn in the property market. With cyber threats on the rise, the HKMA stepped up the supervision of authorized institutions’ technology risk management. At the same time, the HKMA launched seven initiatives that prepare Hong Kong to move into a New Era of Smart Banking. The effectiveness of authorized institutions’ anti-money laundering and counterterrorist financing controls remained a key supervisory focus of the HKMA as part of its efforts to combat financial crimes. On conduct supervision, the HKMA took further steps to promote a customer-centric corporate culture, foster financial inclusion, and address difficulties encountered by small and medium-sized enterprises and start-up companies in opening and maintaining bank accounts in Hong Kong. Efforts were also made to enhance the supervision of authorized institutions’ sales practices for investment and insurance products to further strengthen customer protection.\n\nSubstantial progress was made on the local implementation of international supervisory and accounting standards, including capital adequacy standards, disclosure standards, the Net Stable Funding Ratio, large exposure limits, recovery planning and International Financial Reporting Standard 9. In support of the need for capacity building amid an ever-changing banking environment and evolving risk landscape, the HKMA co-ordinated with the industry to develop director empowerment programmes and the Enhanced Competency Framework for banking practitioners.\n\nThe Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance came into operation on 7 July 2017, making Hong Kong one of the few Financial Stability Board member jurisdictions with a fully cross-sectoral resolution regime for financial institutions. The Ordinance, establishing a new line of defence for financial stability, confers necessary powers on the Monetary Authority to manage, in an orderly manner, failure of a financial institution in circumstances where such failure could have adverse systemic consequences.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this objective is contingent upon the financial system being highly resilient and capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their business and, in extremis, by failing in a disorderly manner. The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring banks are resilient to shocks and are able to recover their positions in response to crises, which ultimately helps prevent failures. The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banking business, which includes the business of taking deposits, in Hong Kong. It is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposittaking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs). The Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs).\n\nHowever, the Monetary Authority cannot ensure, nor is the Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework designed to ensure, a zero-risk financial system. Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that in the event of an AI’s failure, resolution may be conducted in an orderly manner such that continuity in critical financial services provided by AIs to their customers can be maintained. To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong is established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs, amongst other financial institutions.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2017\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nIn 2017, 192 off-site reviews were conducted covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL ratings1, corporate governance, business operations and risk management of AIs. As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance at AIs, 30 meetings were held with the boards of directors or board-level committees of AIs, with the discussions focused on important risk management issues. The HKMA also conducted a survey to monitor the adoption of its recent guidance on corporate governance. 27 tripartite meetings among the HKMA, AIs and their external auditors were also held.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA continued to conduct regular on-site examinations supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk. This approach has allowed the HKMA to prioritise its supervisory resources to focus on emerging and more significant risks faced by AIs. The HKMA conducted 401 on-site examinations and thematic reviews during the year. Credit risk management and controls remained the key focus of these examinations and reviews. Another major focus was technology risk and operational risk management. The HKMA also increased the number of overseas examinations and the number of on-site examinations and thematic reviews targeted at liquidity and market risk management as well as anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML/CFT) controls. On-site examinations of AIs’ activities in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses were also conducted by specialist teams.\n\n# Supervision of credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nTotal bank lending grew by 16.1%, compared with a growth of 6.5% in 2016. As shown in Table 2, the loan growth was broad-based.\n\nSpecifically, Mainland-related lending grew by 17.5% to HK$4,188 billion at the end of 2017 (Table 3). This included HK$644 billion of loans booked with Mainland subsidiaries of banks incorporated in Hong Kong.\n\nThe asset quality of AIs remained healthy in 2017. Retail banks’ classified loan ratio edged down from 0.72% at the end of 2016 to 0.54% at the end of 2017, well below the long-run historical average of 2.2% since 2000. For the banking industry as a whole, the classified loan ratio decreased from 0.85% to 0.67%. As regards Mainlandrelated lending, retail banks’ classified loan ratio of such lending edged down to 0.75% in 2017 from 0.82%. For the banking industry as a whole, the ratio decreased to 0.67% from 0.80% a year ago.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA stepped up its supervisory efforts to ensure that AIs continued to adopt prudent credit risk management standards. In particular, the surveillance of AIs’ exposures to major corporates was enhanced. Targeted thematic examinations were conducted, focusing on key credit risk management controls such as loan underwriting standards, the loan classification and provisioning system, credit risk governance framework and risk management for lending to property developers, asset-backed financing and insurance premium financing.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nProperty prices continued to rise in 2017. There were more loans extended by AIs involving borrowers with multiple mortgages or with income derived from outside of Hong Kong. In view of these developments, the HKMA introduced another round of countercyclical macroprudential measures on 19 May. The eighth round of measures included raising the risk-weight floor for the calculation of capital charges for new residential mortgage loans granted by AIs, lowering the applicable loan-to-value (LTV) ratio cap for property mortgage loans extended to borrowers with pre-existing mortgages, and lowering the applicable debt servicing ratio (DSR) limit for property mortgage loans extended to borrowers whose income is derived mainly from outside of Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA’s macro-prudential measures on property mortgage loans, introduced since 2009, have enhanced banks’ resilience to risks associated with the property market. The average LTV ratio of new residential mortgage loans fell to 49% in December 2017 from 64% in September 2009, before the countercyclical measures were first introduced. The average DSR also decreased to 35% in December 2017 from 41% in August 2010, when a cap on DSR was first applied (Chart 1).\n\nThe HKMA observed that some developers financed their property development projects with high gearing and some of them provided mortgages with high LTV ratios to buyers of properties. To address the risks associated with these developments, the HKMA introduced new risk management measures for lending to property developers on 12 May. These included requiring AIs to lower the financing caps for construction financing; requiring AIs to set aside more capital for their lending to property developers with a higher proportion of mortgage loans relative to equity; and performing a round of thematic examinations to ensure that banks continue to follow prudent underwriting standards in their lending to property developers.\n\nSeparately, the HKMA worked with the Land Registry in launching an e-Alert service in February. The e-Alert service provides a notification to the AI concerned whenever a further mortgage in respect of the mortgaged property is lodged with the Land Registry for registration, so that the mortgagee bank can take appropriate risk mitigating actions as appropriate.\n\n# Supervision of operational and technology risks\n\nCybersecurity threats continued to increase over the year. The HKMA stepped up its supervisory efforts in a bid to enhance the cyber resilience of the banking sector. As part of the Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative (CFI) rolled out by the HKMA in 2016, 30 AIs completed an assessment of the maturity of their cyber defences. Separately, the HKMA and the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), after extensive consultation with the banking and securities industry, jointly decided to introduce a mandatory twofactor authentication for online share trading. A round of on-site examinations focused on banks’ cybersecurity controls and operational resilience was also conducted. The HKMA further completed a round of discussions with the senior management of major banks to assess how the banks were managing strategic risks posed by potential new market entrants powered by technological advancement.\n\n# Smart Banking\n\nIn September, the HKMA announced a package of measures to assist Hong Kong’s banking sector in migrating to a new era of Smart Banking. On the supervisory front, the HKMA enhanced the Fintech Supervisory Sandbox to version 2.0, with new features including a Chatroom facility accessible by both banks and technology firms and the establishment of linkages among the sandboxes of the HKMA, the SFC and the Insurance Authority (IA), so as to provide a single point of entry for conducting trials of cross-sector fintech products.\n\nThe HKMA also launched a Banking Made Easy initiative to identify and minimise regulatory frictions with the aim of further improving customers’ experience in using fintech and digital banking services. A taskforce has been set up with the current focus on remote onboarding and account maintenance, online finance and online wealth management.\n\nA review of the existing Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks has commenced to facilitate the introduction of virtual banking in Hong Kong.\n\n# Supervision of treasury activities and liquidity risk\n\nAs the US continued to normalise its monetary policy, global fund flows might become increasingly volatile. In consideration of this, the HKMA placed increased focus on the supervision of liquidity risk during the year. The HKMA enhanced its supervisory liquidity stress testing with additional scenarios, including a more stressful but plausible scenario of fund outflows and a short-term, confidencedriven bank run scenario. The HKMA also stepped up the monitoring and analysis of individual AIs’ liquidity profiles and required selected AIs to strengthen their liquidity risk management capability.\n\nSeparately, the HKMA conducted more on-site examinations of AIs’ market risk management in respect of their debt securities portfolios. A round of thematic reviews were carried out to evaluate potential risks arising from AIs’ increased investment activities in foreign currency bonds and to assess the effectiveness of the corresponding risk management, including hedging practices.\n\n# Prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF)\n\nThe Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) (Amendment) Bill 2017 was gazetted on 23 June and will come into operation in 2018. The amendment is intended to update Hong Kong’s regulatory regime for AML/CFT in line with the latest international requirements as promulgated by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). These changes, together with updates to the statutory guideline on AML/CFT, will help clarify and implement the risk-based approach in customer due diligence (CDD) processes for account opening and the maintenance of bona fide customers, and encourage innovation where such processes are carried out remotely.\n", "zh": "# 銀行穩定性\n\n2017年，香港金融管理局（HKMA）繼續將監管焦點放在授權機構（AIs）的風險治理框架的有效性，包括信貸和流動性風險管理系統。當年，推出了另一輪逆周期宏觀審慎措施，以增強銀行業應對房地產市場下行的韌性。隨著網絡威脅日益增加，HKMA加強了對授權機構技術風險管理的監督。同時，HKMA推出了七項措施，為香港進入智慧銀行的新时代做準備。授權機構的反洗錢和反恐怖融資控制的有效性仍是HKMA的關鍵監管重點，作為打擊金融犯罪的努力的一部分。在操守監督方面，HKMA進一步推動以客戶為中心的企業文化，促進金融包容性，並解決香港中小企業和初創公司在開立及維持銀行賬戶時遇到的困難。同時加強對授權機構投資和保險產品銷售行為的監管，以進一步保障客戶利益。\n\n在國際監管和會計標準本地落實方面取得了實質性進展，包括資本充足率標準、披露標準、淨穩定資金比率（NSFR）、重大暴露限額、恢復計劃和國際財務報告準則第9號（IFRS 9）。為應對不斷變化的銀行環境和不斷演變的風險格局，HKMA協同行業制定了董事授權項目和加強版能力框架，以提升銀行從業人員的專業能力。\n\n2017年7月7日，金融機構（解決）條例生效，使香港成為少數擁有完整跨行業金融機構解決制度的金融穩定委員會成員司法管轄區之一。該條例建立了新的金融穩定防線，授予貨幣管理局必要的權力，以有序管理金融機構的失敗，確保在其失敗可能帶來系統性不良後果的情況下，能夠依規辦理，維持關鍵金融服務的連續性。\n\n# 目標\n\nHKMA的總體目標是促進銀行系統的安全與穩定。實現這一目標依賴於金融體系的高度韌性和提供香港經濟所需的關鍵金融服務的能力。\n\n銀行通過其經營方式影響系統穩定性，甚至可能在失序中引發金融危機。作為監管機構的貨幣當局在保障金融穩定中扮演關鍵角色，通過確保銀行具備抗震性和在危機中能夠恢復其地位，最終有助於防止失敗。貨幣管理局負責香港銀行業務的審慎監管，包括吸存業務，並負責授權在港的持牌銀行、限制性牌照銀行和存款公司（合稱授權機構）。此外，還負責某些金融市場基礎設施的指定和監督。\n\n不過，貨幣管理局無法確保，也沒有設計成保證金融系統完全無風險。作為解決權力的行使者，貨幣管理局旨在確保在AIs失敗時，可以有序進行解決程序，以保持AIs向客戶提供的關鍵金融服務的連續性。為此，在香港建立了一套金融機構解決制度，貨幣管理局在其中擔任AIs等金融機構的解決機構。\n\n# 2017年回顧\n\n# 監管活動概述\n\n2017年，共進行了192次審查，涵蓋廣泛事項，包括CAMEL評級、公司治理、業務運營和AIs的風險管理。作為促進AIs風險治理增強措施的一部分，舉行了30次與AIs董事會或董事委員會的會議，重點討論重要的風險管理議題。HKMA還進行了一項調查，以監控其最新公司治理指南的採用情況。此外，HKMA也與AIs及其外部審計師舉行了27次三方會議。\n\n除了承受監控活動外，HKMA續常進行定期現場檢查，並加大主題性審查力度，針對較高風險領域進行深入評估。這種方針使得HKMA能更有效地將監管資源集中於新興且更為嚴重的風險。年內，HKMA共進行了401次現場檢查和主題性審查。這些檢查主要集中在信貸風險管理與控制，另一重點則是技術風險和操作風險管理。此外，HKMA還增加了海外檢查次數，以及針對流動性、市場風險管理及反洗錢和反恐怖融資（AML/CFT）控制的現場檢查與主題性審查。專家團隊亦對AIs在證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（MPF）業務的活動進行現場檢查。\n\n# 信貸風險監管\n\n# 信貸增長與資產質素\n\n整體銀行貸款於2017年增長16.1%，高於2016年的6.5%。根據表2的數據，貸款增長屬於較為廣泛的基礎。\n\n具體而言，與內地相關的貸款於2017年底增長17.5%，達到4188億港元（表3）。其中，包括由香港註冊銀行的內地子公司入賬的貸款644億港元。\n\nAIs的資產質素在2017年保持健康。零售銀行分類貸款比率由2016年底的0.72%下降至2017年底的0.54%，遠低於自2000年以來的長期平均水平2.2%。整個銀行行業的分類貸款比率由0.85%降至0.67%。就內地相關貸款而言，零售銀行此類貸款的分類比率由0.82%降至0.75%。整體銀行行業的比率則由0.80%降至0.67%。\n\n在年度內，HKMA加大監管力度，確保AIs持續採用審慎的信貸風險管理標準。特別是，對AIs對主要企業的暴露情況進行加強監控。針對性地進行主題性檢查，焦點包括貸款承批標準、貸款分類與撥備制度、信貸風險治理框架以及對房地產開發商、資產支持融資和保費融資的貸款的風險管理。\n\n# 房地產按揭貸款\n\n2017年房地產價格持續上升。AIs向涉及多次按揭或收入來自香港以外地區借款人的貸款比例增加。鑑於此，HKMA於5月19日推出了另一輪逆周期宏觀審慎措施。第八輪措施包括提高新抵押貸款的風險權重底線，降低提供給已有按揭的借款人的房地產抵押貸款的可融資比率（LTV）上限，以及降低大部分收入來自香港以外地區借款人的房產按揭貸款的負債服務比率（DSR）限制。\n\n自2009年起實施的HKMA房地產按揭宏觀審慎措施，已提升銀行對房地產市場相關風險的韌性。到2017年12月，新抵押貸款的平均LTV比率已降至49%，低於2009年9月的64%（措施首次推出前的數值）。同期，平均DSR也由2010年8月的41%降低至2017年12月的35%（當時首次設定DSR上限（圖1））。\n\nHKMA觀察到一些開發商以高槓桿進行房地產開發，部分甚至向買家提供高LTV的按揭。為應對這些風險，HKMA於5月12日推出了針對房地產開發商的新的風險管理措施，包括要求AIs降低建築融資的融資上限，要求AIs為向房地產開發商放貸時留出更多資本，並針對房地產開發商貸款比例較高的情況進行主題性檢查，以確保銀行在對房地產開發商的放貸中仍然遵守審慎的核保標準。\n\n另外，HKMA與土地註冊處於2月份合作推出了電子提醒服務。該服務在土地註冊局登記房地產再次抵押時向相關AIs發出通知，使得抵押銀行能採取適當的風險緩解措施。\n\n# 操作與技術風險監管\n\n年內，網絡安全威脅持續上升。HKMA加強監管，提升銀行業的網絡韌性。作為2016年推出的網絡安全強化計劃（CFI）的一部分，30家AIs完成了其網絡防禦成熟度評估。此外，HKMA與證券及期貨事務監察委員會（SFC）經過與行業廣泛磋商後，決定引入強制性的雙因素認證，以保障線上證券交易的安全。亦已進行針對銀行網絡安全控制和操作韌性的現場檢查。HKMA進一步與主要銀行的高層管理人員討論，評估銀行應對潛在新市場競爭者帶來的策略風險管理措施。\n\n# 智慧銀行\n\n九月，HKMA宣布一套措施，協助香港銀行業進入智慧銀行的新时代。在監管方面，HKMA將金融科技監管沙箱升級至版本2.0，新增功能包括銀行和科技公司皆可使用的聊天室，並建立HKMA、SFC和保險業監管局（IA）沙箱之間的連接，以提供針對跨行業金融科技產品的統一試點入口。\n\nHKMA亦啟動了「智慧銀行」計劃，旨在確定並減少監管阻力，進一步改善客戶在使用金融科技和數碼銀行服務時的體驗。專責小組著眼於遠端開戶、賬戶維護、線上理財和線上財富管理。\n\n同時對現有的虛擬銀行授權指引進行了檢討，以促進虛擬銀行在香港的推出。\n\n# 財資活動和流動性風險監管\n\n隨著美國持續進行貨幣政策正常化，全球資金流動可能變得更加波動。在此背景下，HKMA將重點放在流動性風險監管，加強流動性壓力測試，加入包括更嚴峻但合理的資金外流情景，以及短期的信心驅使銀行擠兑情景。HKMA還加強了對個別AIs流動性狀況的監控與分析，並要求部分AIs提升其流動性管理能力。\n\n另外，HKMA增加了對AIs所持有債券組合的市場風險管理的現場檢查，並進行主題性審查，評估外幣債券投資增加可能帶來的潛在風險，以及相關的對沖措施的有效性。\n\n# 反洗錢及反恐怖融資（ML/TF）防範\n\n2017年6月23日公布了《反洗錢及反恐怖融資（金融機構）條例（修訂）》草案，預計於2018年生效。修訂旨在根據金融行動特別工作組（FATF）最新國際規定，更新香港的反洗錢/反恐規範體系。這些變化以及對法定指引的補充，有助於明確並實施以風險為本的客戶盡職調查（CDD）方法，用於開戶和維持正當客戶，並鼓勵在遠端進行的創新操作。"}

These initiatives included:\n- developing the Faster Payment System (FPS) to achieve full connectivity of digital retail payments;\n- introducing an Open Application Programming Interface (Open API) framework;\n- enhancing fintech research and talent development;\n- stepping up cross-border collaboration in fintech;\n- upgrading our existing Fintech Supervisory Sandbox (FSS) 1.0 to Version 2.0;\n- facilitating the introduction of virtual banking; and\n- promoting a new Banking Made Easy initiative to minimise regulatory frictions in customers’ digital experience.\n\nThe HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO), together with the banking departments of the HKMA, played a pivotal role in driving the implementation of these initiatives to strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia.\n\nHong Kong’s international profile as a financing hub for infrastructure investments was raised further, as the number of partners of the HKMA Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO) grew to 87 as at 31 January 2018 from about 40 at inception. During the year, IFFO organised and participated in more than 10 seminars and workshops to facilitate experience sharing and collaborative networking among key stakeholders. In particular, IFFO steered the development of an infrastructure equity investment reference term sheet in its inaugural Debt Financing and Investors’ Roundtables with a view to enhancing infrastructure projects’ bankability and investability.\n\nBond Connect was launched in July, marking another major milestone in mutual access between the Hong Kong and Mainland capital markets, and further solidifying our gateway position for international investors seeking to enter the Mainland market. During the year, Hong Kong’s Renminbi Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (RQFII) quota was increased to RMB500 billion from RMB270 billion. Hong Kong maintained the world’s largest offshore renminbi liquidity pool, with vibrant renminbi financial intermediation activities as evidenced by a high turnover of our renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system and the lion’s share of Hong Kong’s renminbi payment activities in the world.\n\nFollowing the introduction of the tax regime for corporate treasury centres (CTCs) in 2016, the HKMA stepped up its outreach efforts with a view to attracting more multinational corporates to set up treasury centres in Hong Kong. By the end of 2017, more than 40 corporates reflected to the HKMA that they were actively planning to set up, or had set up, treasury centre operations in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA actively contributed to international discussions on issues of significance to global and regional financial stability. The Chief Executive of the HKMA became the Chair of the Standing Committee on Supervisory and Regulatory Co-operation (SRC) of the Financial Stability Board (FSB)1 in April to lead discussions on key financial stability issues.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure lays a solid foundation for Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre and global offshore renminbi business hub. The four interbank RTGS systems and the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) achieved 100% system availability in 2017, as compared to the target of 99.95%. To support Northbound Trading of Bond Connect, CMU has set up accounts with the two Mainland central securities depositories (CSDs) to facilitate the settlement of Bond Connect transactions and holding of Mainland debt securities on behalf of relevant CMU members.\n\nTo promote the general safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA designated four retail payment systems (RPSs) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO) in August to bring their operations under the HKMA’s oversight. The HKMA also conducted supervision of 16 stored value facility (SVF) licensees which actively launched new products and services that sought to offer customers more choices and better user experience. Separately, the coverage of e-Cheque and Electronic Bill Presentment and Payment (EBPP) service was further expanded to include crossboundary payments between Hong Kong and the entire Guangdong Province.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2017\n\n# Hong Kong as a fintech hub in Asia\n\n# Smart Banking Initiatives\n\nIn light of the rapid technological advancements, the HKMA in September announced seven initiatives that would prepare Hong Kong to move into a new era of Smart Banking. The initiatives aimed to help the banking sector to rise to a higher level and embrace the enormous opportunities brought about by the convergence of banking and technology.\n\n“Smart Banking would offer full interconnectivity amongst retail and corporate customers and allow financial services and transactions to be undertaken with great mobility, speed, ease and safety.”\n\nThe HKMA has been working closely with the banking industry and the fintech community, and made good progress in implementing the seven initiatives.\n\n# Faster Payment System\n\nThe FPS is a multi-currency platform that would enable the public to make round-the-clock funds transfers in a real-time manner with ease, through using mobile phone numbers or email addresses. It can support payments in Hong Kong dollars and renminbi. Banks and non-bank payment service providers can participate in the FPS, enabling full connectivity among all payment participants. With system development work close to completion, the FPS is scheduled to launch in September 2018.\n\nFurthermore, the HKMA led a working group, comprising major credit card scheme operators, banks, licensed SVF operators and merchant acquirers, to establish a common QR code standard for retail payments in Hong Kong. A common QR code standard would facilitate merchants in using a single QR code to accept QR code payment solutions from multiple payment service providers, providing greater convenience to customers and merchants. The working group has finalised the relevant technical specification, and would work out the implementation arrangements.\n\n# Open Application Programming Interface\n\nOpen API allows banks’ data to be accessed by third parties to facilitate better and easier integration of services offered by banks and other industries. Users can therefore conveniently stay on one system to enjoy integrated services in a secure environment. To facilitate the development and adoption of Open API by the banking sector, the HKMA has come up with a draft Open API framework, comprising a selection of Open API functions and deployment time frame, technical standards, third-party service provider governance, facilitation measures and maintenance models, for a two-month industry consultation.\n\n# Research and talent development\n\nOne of the major research projects was on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). Following the first DLT whitepaper in 2016, the second whitepaper on DLT was published in October 2017. The second whitepaper further explores the three Proof-of-Concept works, namely trade finance, digital identity management and mortgage application. It also offers advice on the implementation issues relating to governance, legal and compliance, and general control principles on deploying DLT for the banking and payment industries.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan, announces the release of the second whitepaper on DLT at the HKMA Fintech Day.\n\nRiding on the success of the Proof-of-Concept work on trade finance led by the HKMA, seven banks in Hong Kong decided to commercialise the prototype into a production system named Hong Kong Trade Finance Platform (HKTFP) to digitise and share trade documents and automate processes with a view to improving the overall trade process and reducing risks and fraud in the trade finance business.\n\nIn an effort to enlarge the talent pool in the fintech industry, the HKMA launched the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme in collaboration with the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute in December 2016. Response from students was positive. More than 3,000 applications from 421 applicants were received. Finally, 74 students accepted internship offers from the HKMA and 12 banks to work on fintech-related projects for six months or one year starting from July.\n\n# Cross-border collaboration\n\nAs the first step of strengthening our collaboration within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Bay Area, we are partnering with Shenzhen to promote fintech and talent developments. Specifically, the HKMA and the Office of Financial Development Service, the People’s Government of Shenzhen Municipality (OFDS) entered into an agreement in June to (i) provide reciprocal soft-landing support for fintech firms, (ii) co-organise the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Fintech Award in October to recognise and reward outstanding fintech products and solutions in the two cities; and (iii) arrange summer internships at Shenzhen fintech and techfin firms for Hong Kong students.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan (middle), signs and exchanges Memoranda of Understanding on softlanding arrangements with OFDS Director-General, Mr He Xiaojun (left), and Cyberport Chairman, Dr Lee George Lam, at the HKMA Fintech Day.\n\nE-leaflet for the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Fintech Award.\n\nThe HKMA also signed fintech co-operation agreements with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Dubai Financial Services Authority on innovation projects, referrals of innovative businesses, information sharing and exchange of expertise.\n\nIn November, the HKMA further signed a Memorandum of Understanding with MAS to jointly build the Global Trade Connectivity Network (GTCN), which would connect Singapore’s National Trade Platform to the HKTFP to form a cross-border DLT infrastructure in order to digitalise cross-border trade and trade finance processes, making them safer, more efficient and costeffective. It will be an open platform that allows other interested jurisdictions to participate in the future. The GTCN is expected to be launched in the first quarter of 2019.\n\n# Fintech Supervisory Sandbox\n\nThe FSS launched by the HKMA in September 2016 was upgraded to FSS 2.0 to expedite communication with banks and tech firms to facilitate new ideas and initiatives. Specifically, FSS 2.0 has the following new features:\n- A Fintech Supervisory Chatroom is set up to provide feedback to banks and tech firms at an early stage of their fintech projects.\n- Tech firms can access the FSS by seeking feedback from the Chatroom without going through a bank.\n- The sandboxes of the HKMA, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Insurance Authority are linked up so that there is a single point of entry for pilot trials of cross-sector fintech products.\n\nAs of end-2017, 28 new technology products have been tested in the FSS. Out of these cases, 14 pilot trials have been completed, and the relevant products have been rolled out to the market subsequently.\n\n# Banking Made Easy initiative\n\nA Banking Made Easy initiative was launched to minimise regulatory frictions hindering technological innovations. A taskforce has been set up with current focus on the following areas:\n- Remote onboarding and account maintenance\n- Online finance\n- Online wealth management\n\n# Virtual Banking\n\nVirtual banks, which operate without physical branches, are expected to provide additional impetus to the application of fintech in Hong Kong and offer a new kind of customer experience in mobile and digital banking. They may also help promote financial inclusion as they normally target the retail segment, be they individuals or small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The HKMA has commenced the review of the existing Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks with a view to facilitating the introduction of virtual banking in Hong Kong.\n\n# A New Era of Smart Banking\n\n# Supervision and Innovation\n\nThe seven initiatives unveiled by the HKMA last year to prepare Hong Kong for a new era of Smart Banking are a large-scale project involving cooperation among various departments within the HKMA. With fintech becoming an unstoppable force, Mr Raymond Chan, Executive Director (Banking Supervision) of the HKMA, indicated that the HKMA, as a regulator, must embrace this new trend by keeping abreast of the latest technological developments and adjusting its supervisory mindset and approach as appropriate, in order to take bank services and customer experience to a new level.\n", "zh": "國際金融中心\n\n為鞏固香港作為國際金融中心的地位，香港金融管理局（HKMA）致力於提升香港金融平台的競爭力。在金融科技方面，七個旨在促進銀行及支付行業金融科技發展與應用的新措施受到持份者和公眾的高度歡迎。由於一系列在網絡及能力建設方面的努力，香港作為基礎設施投資融資樞紐的國際形象進一步提升。債券通的推出鞏固了香港作為內地投資機會主要通道的地位。香港金融管理局在企業財資中心等其他領域的努力也開始取得成果。\n\n概要\n\n鑑於科技快速發展，香港金融管理局於九月宣布推出七項措施，為香港進入智慧銀行的新時代做準備。這些措施包括：\n- 發展快速支付系統（FPS），實現數碼零售支付的全面連接；\n- 推行開放應用程序接口（Open API）框架；\n- 增強金融科技研究及人才發展；\n- 加強跨境金融科技合作；\n- 將現有的金融科技監管沙箱（FSS）由1.0升級至2.0版本；\n- 推動虛擬銀行的引入；\n- 宣傳“智慧銀行易”項目，旨在減少客戶數碼體驗中的監管阻力。\n\n香港金融管理局金融科技促進辦公室（FFO）與銀行部門密切合作，在推動這些措施的實施方面發揮了關鍵作用，以鞏固香港作為亞洲金融科技中心的地位。\n\n香港作為基礎設施投資融資樞紐的國際形象進一步提升，香港金融基建促進辦公室（IFFO）的合作夥伴由成立初期約40家增至2018年1月31日的87家。今年內，IFFO組織並參與超過10場研討會和工作坊，促進主要利益相關者之間的經驗交流與合作網絡。尤其是在首次債務融資與投資者圓桌會議中，IFFO 推動制定基礎設施股權投資參考條款表，以提升基礎設施項目之可融資性及投資價值。\n\n債券通於七月正式啟動，成為香港與內地資本市場互通的另一重要里程碑，進一步鞏固我們面向國際投資者的門戶地位。在年度內，香港人民幣合格境外機構投資者（RQFII）配額由人民幣2700億元增至5000億元。香港保持著全球最大的離岸人民幣流動性池，人民幣金融中介活動活躍，體現在人民幣即時結算系統（RTGS）的高周轉率及香港在全球人民幣支付中的份額。\n\n在2016年推出企業財資中心（CTC）稅制之後，香港金融管理局進一步擴大外聯力度，以吸引更多跨國公司於香港設立財資中心。截至2017年底，超過40家公司反映他們正積極籌劃或已在香港設立財資中心運作。\n\n香港金融管理局積極參與國際討論，聚焦全球及區域金融穩定的重要議題。其行政總裁於四月成為金融穩定理事會（FSB）監管合作常務委員會（SRC）主席，領導相關金融穩定重大議題的討論。\n\n香港金融基礎設施的安全高效運作為香港作為國際金融中心和全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐奠定了堅實基礎。2017年，四個銀行間即時結算系統（RTGS）及中央資金市場單位（CMU）均達到100%的系統可用率，遠超99.95%的目標。為支持債券通北向交易，CMU已在內地兩個中央證券存管機構（CSD）開設帳戶，以促進債券通交易的結算及代表相關CMU成員持有內地債券。\n\n為促進本地零售支付行業的安全與效率，香港金融管理局於八月批准四個零售支付系統（RPS）進入支付系統及存款證照（PSSVFO）監管範圍。該行亦監督16家存款證照持牌人，它們積極推出新產品服務，為客戶提供更多選擇及更佳用戶體驗。此外，電子支票和電子帳單呈示與支付（EBPP）服務的覆蓋範圍進一步擴展，涵蓋香港與整個廣東省之間的跨境支付。\n\n2017年回顧\n\n香港作為亞洲金融科技中心\n\n智慧銀行倡議\n\n鑑於科技快速發展，香港金融管理局於九月公布了七項措施，準備香港迎來智慧銀行的嶄新時代。這些措施旨在幫助銀行業躍升至新層次，並擁抱銀行與科技融合帶來的巨大機遇。\n\n“智慧銀行將實現零售和企業客戶之間的全互聯互通，並使金融服務與交易能以更高的流動性、速度、便利性和安全性進行。”\n\n香港金融管理局一直與銀行業和金融科技界密切合作，在推行這七項措施方面取得了良好進展。\n\n快速支付系統（FPS）\n\nFPS是一個支持多貨幣的平臺，讓公眾可通過手機號碼或電郵地址，輕鬆實時轉賬，支持港幣和人民幣支付。銀行和非銀行支付服務供應商均可參與FPS，實現所有支付參與者之間的全面連通。隨著系統開發接近完成，預計於2018年九月正式推出。\n\n此外，香港金融管理局領導一個由主要信用卡交易組織、銀行、持牌存款證照持有人和商戶收單行組成的工作小組，建立了香港零售支付的統一二維碼標準。這將方便商戶使用單一二維碼接受多個支付服務提供商的支付方案，提升便利性和用戶體驗。該工作小組已完成相關技術規範，並將制定落實方案。\n\n開放應用程序接口（Open API）\n\nOpen API允許第三方存取銀行數據，以促進更佳、更便捷的服務整合。用戶可在同一系統內便捷安全地享受一體化服務。為推動銀行業Open API的發展與推廣，香港金融管理局推出了Open API框架草案，內容涵蓋API功能選擇、部署時間表、技術標準、第三方服務提供者治理、促進措施及維護模式，並進行為期兩個月的業界諮詢。\n\n研究與人才培育\n\n其中一個重要研究項目是分佈式帳簿技術（DLT）。自2016年首份DLT白皮書發佈後，第二份白皮書於2017年十月推出，進一步探索貿易融資、數字身份管理和按揭申請三個概念驗證（PoC）項目，並就治理、法律合規及部署DLT於銀行和支付行業的普遍控制原則提供建議。\n\n香港金融管理局行政總裁陳德霖先生在金融科技日宣佈發佈第二份DLT白皮書。\n\n延續HKMA主導的貿易融資PoC的成功，香港七家銀行決定將該原型商品商業化，建立“香港貿易金融平台”(HKTFP)，用於數字化貿易文件及自動化流程，以改善整體貿易流程、降低風險和詐騙。\n\n為擴大金融科技人才庫，香港金融管理局於2016年12月與香港應用科技研究院合作推出“金融科技職業推廣計劃”。反響良好，超過3,000名申請人來自421份報名。最終，74名學生接受了由HKMA和12家銀行提供的實習邀請，從七月開始進行為期六個月至一年的金融科技相關項目實習。\n\n跨境合作\n\n作為加強粵港澳大灣區合作的第一步，我們與深圳合作促進金融科技及人才發展。具體而言，香港金融管理局與深圳市人民政府金融發展局（OFDS）於六月簽訂協議，內容包括（i）為金融科技公司提供互惠的“軟著陸”支持，（ii）於十月合辦“深港金融科技獎”，表彰和獎勵兩地優秀金融科技產品與解決方案，以及（iii）為香港學生安排在深圳金融科技及科技金融公司實習。\n\n香港金融管理局行政總裁陳德霖先生（中）與金融發展局局長何曉軍先生（左）及數碼港主席藍天科技博士（右）在金融科技日簽署並交換有關“軟著陸”安排的諒解備忘錄。\n\n“深港金融科技獎”電子傳單。\n\n香港金融管理局還與新加坡金融管理局（MAS）及迪拜金融服務局簽署合作協議，涉及創新項目、創新企業轉介、信息共享及經驗交流。\n\n2018年11月，香港金融管理局與新加坡金融管理局進一步簽署諒解備忘錄，共同打造“全球貿易連通網絡（GTCN）”，將新加坡的“國家貿易平臺”與HKTFP相連接，形成一個跨境分佈式帳簿基礎設施，實現跨境貿易與貿易融資流程的數字化，提升安全性、效率及成本效益。該平台將是開放式平臺，未來其他適格法域亦可參與。GTCN預計在2019年第一季度推出。\n\n金融科技監管沙箱（FSS）\n\n香港金融管理局於2016年九月啟動的金融科技監管沙箱（FSS）已升級為FSS 2.0，以加快與銀行和科技企業的溝通，促進新想法和新措施的落實。具體而言，FSS 2.0具有以下新特點：\n- 建立金融科技監管聊天室，早期向銀行和科技企業提供反饋；\n- 科技公司可直接在聊天室獲取反饋而無需經由銀行；\n- 香港金融管理局、證券及期貨事務監察委員會（SFC）及保險事務監管局的沙箱已聯通，在不同監管範圍內的金融科技產品可一站式進行試點。\n\n截至2017年底，已有28款新技術產品在FSS中進行測試，當中14個試點已完成，相關產品隨後也已推向市場。\n\n“易用金融”倡議\n\n為減少阻礙科技創新的監管壁壘，香港金融管理局啟動“金融服務易”計劃，現階段重點範疇包括：\n- 遠程啟動及賬戶維護\n- 在線金融\n- 在線財富管理\n\n虛擬銀行\n\n無實體分行的虛擬銀行預期將為香港金融科技的應用提供額外推動力，並帶來全新數碼及移動銀行客戶體驗。它們亦有助於促進金融普惠，因多數虛擬銀行目標定位零售客群，包括個人和中小企。香港金融管理局已展開對現有虛擬銀行核准指引的檢討，旨在促使香港虛擬銀行的推出。\n\n智慧銀行新時代\n\n監管與創新\n\n去年由香港金融管理局公布的七項措施，旨在為香港進入智慧銀行新時代作準備，這是一個涉及香港局內多個部門合作的大型項目。隨著金融科技成為不可阻擋的力量，香港金融管理局（特別是銀行監管執行總監）陳德霖先生表示，作為監管機構，必須擁抱這一潮流，把握最新科技發展，並根據情況調整監管思維與方式，以將銀行服務和客戶體驗提升至新水平。"}
{"en": "# Reserves Management\n\nThe global economy and financial markets performed better than expected in 2017. Global equity markets went up on the back of synchronised economic growth in major developed and emerging market economies, strong corporate earnings, and market expectation of slow and gradual tightening of monetary policies by major central banks. While the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates three times as expected, and began to reduce its balance sheet in October, the 10- Year US Treasury yield remained stable and the US dollar weakened (rather than strengthened) against other major currencies. Under such a favourable environment, the Exchange Fund’s investment income reached a record high of HK$264 billion in 2017, representing an investment return of 7.4%.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary and may be invested in securities or other assets he considers appropriate, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC).\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nEFAC has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n(a) to preserve capital;\n(b) to ensure the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(c) to ensure sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) subject to (a)–(c), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the Fund’s long-term purchasing power.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund.\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP). The BP holds highly liquid US dollardenominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The IP is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of the assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA has been diversifying part of the Exchange Fund’s investments, in a prudent and incremental manner, into a wider variety of asset classes, including emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity and real estate. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The cap for the market value of investments under the LTGP is set at onethird of the accumulated surplus of the Exchange Fund, with further capacity arising from the allocation of part of the Future Fund to long-term assets.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007 to hold shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that were acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes, is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of the unique nature of this Portfolio.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by fiscal reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP1, with the exception of the Future Fund which links its interest rate to both the IP and the LTGP depending on the portfolio mix. As at the end of 2017, the portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 65:35. The portion of the Future Fund linked with the LTGP is expected to gradually build up to around 50% by 2018.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation. The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents the long-term optimal asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark, or strategic allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and tracking error limit are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may take positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nHKMA staff in the Reserves Management Department directly manage about 73% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, which includes the entire BP and part of the IP. This part of the IP includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 27% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes. The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to capture sustainable returns, to benefit from diverse and complementary investment styles and to share market insights and technical expertise with the Exchange Fund.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is primarily determined by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe high volatility of the financial markets subsequent to the 2008/09 global financial crisis has highlighted the importance of risk management. Stringent controls and investment guidelines have been established for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and compliance with guidelines and regulations is closely monitored. Risk assessment has been strengthened to support the Exchange Fund’s increased pace of investment diversification. Risk-control tools are deployed to assess market risks under both normal and adverse market conditions. Detailed performance attribution analyses are also conducted to identify sources of performance, allowing the HKMA to make the best use of the investment skills of internal and external managers.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nThe HKMA is supportive of responsible investment. For instance, the HKMA supports the Principles of Responsible Ownership issued by the Securities and Futures Commission on 7 March 2016, which are voluntary and help investors determine how best to meet their ownership responsibilities in relation to their investments in Hong Kong-listed companies. For the management of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA has encouraged the appointed external fund managers for its Hong Kong equity portfolio to adopt the Principles of Responsible Ownership in managing the investments. Furthermore, the front offices and the Risk Management and Compliance Division have incorporated environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into various internal procedures for making and monitoring investment activities. The HKMA will closely monitor the development of ESG standards and assess how these standards can be further integrated into the investment process.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2017\n\nThe global economy and financial markets in 2017 performed better than expected. On the back of synchronised economic growth in major developed and emerging market economies, strong corporate earnings, and market expectation of slow and gradual tightening of monetary policies by major central banks, the global equity markets performed well. In particular, the Hong Kong equity market rose by 36%, outperforming other major equity markets.\n\nIn the bond markets, short-dated US Treasury yields shot up as the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates three times as expected, and began to reduce its balance sheet in October. Nevertheless, the 10-year US Treasury yield remained stable at about 2.4% over the year. Other major 10-Year government bond yields also ended the year little changed, with the exception of German Bunds which rose on the euro area’s solid economic growth and market expectation of the European Central Bank’s policy tightening.\n\nIn the currency markets, the US dollar weakened against other major currencies, despite the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes and the beginning of its balance sheet reduction. The depreciation of the US dollar was a result of the reviving economic growth in Europe and Japan, and market expectation of diminishing monetary policy divergence between the US and other major economies. The euro and yen appreciated by around 14% and 4% respectively against the US dollar in 2017.\n\nThe performance of major currencies as well as bond and equity markets in 2017 is shown in Table 1.\n\nTable 1 2017 market returns\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$264 billion in 2017. This comprised gains of HK$80.4 billion on overseas equities, gains of HK$58.3 billion on Hong Kong equities, gains of HK$34.4 billion on bonds, a positive currency translation effect of HK$53.5 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets and gains of HK$37.4 billion on other investments held by the investment holding subsidiaries of the Exchange Fund. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$4.5 billion.\n\nThe investment income of HK$264 billion last year is a record high for the Exchange Fund, surpassing the previous record in 2007 (HK$142.2 billion) by HK$121.8 billion.\n\nThe total assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,015.3 billion at year end. The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$235.6 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$157.2 billion and real estate at HK$78.4 billion. Outstanding investment commitments amounted to HK$162.4 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund (excluding the Strategic Portfolio) in 2017 was 7.4%. Specifically, the IP achieved a rate of return of 12.1%, while the BP gained 1.8%. The LTGP recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 13.7% since its inception in 2009.\n\nThe annual return of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2017 is set out in Chart 1. Table 2 shows the 2017 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over several different time horizons. The average return was 2.9% over the past three years, 2.5% over the past five years, 2.2% over the past ten years and 4.9% since 1994. Table 3 shows the currency mix of the Fund’s assets as at 31 December 2017.\n\nHKMA Deputy Chief Executive, Mr Eddie Yue (middle), speaks at the press conference on 2017 Exchange Fund Results.\n\nChart 1 Investment return of the Exchange Fund (1994–2017)\n\nTable 2 Investment return of the Exchange Fund in Hong Kong dollar terms\n\nTable 3 Currency mix of the Exchange Fund’s assets on 31 December 2017 (including forward transactions)\n", "zh": "儲備管理\n\n2017年，全球經濟和金融市場的表現超出預期。由於主要發達和新興市場經濟同步增長，企業盈利強勁，加上市場預期主要中央銀行將逐步收緊貨幣政策，全球股市上漲。在此背景下，美國聯邦儲備局按預期連續三次升息，並於十月開始縮減資產負債表，但10年期美國國債收益率保持穩定，美國美元對其他主要貨幣則走弱。這樣有利的環境促使本基金的投資收益於2017年達到創記錄的2640億港元，投資回報率為7.4%。\n\n交易基金\n\n根據《交易基金條例》，交易基金的主要目標是直接或間接影響香港貨幣的兌換價值。該基金亦用於維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定與完整，以幫助香港保持國際金融中心地位。交易基金由財政司司長掌管，可在徵詢交易基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）意見後，投資於其認為適合的證券或其他資產。\n\n交易基金管理\n\n投資目標及組合結構\n\nEFAC為交易基金設定以下投資目標：\n(a) 保本；\n(b) 確保整個貨幣基數始終由高流動性、以美元計價的資產全額支持；\n(c) 確保有足夠流動性，以維持貨幣和金融穩定；\n(d) 在(a)至(c)的前提下，達到能幫助維持基金長期購買力的投資回報。\n\n這些目標充分考慮交易基金的法定用途，並融入基金的組合結構和目標資產配置中。\n\n一般而言，交易基金有兩個主要投資組合：支持組合（BP）與投資組合（IP）。支持組合持有高度流動的美元計價資產，以按貨幣局安排提供貨幣基數的全面支持。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織（OECD）成員國的債券與股市，以保存資產的價值與長期購買力。\n\n為更好管理風險和提升中長期回報，香港金融管理局（HKMA）逐步將部分交易基金的投資分散到更廣泛的資產類別，包括新興市場及內地債券與股票、私募股權與房地產。新興市場及內地的債券與股票由投資組合持有，而私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合（LTGP）持有。LTGP的投資市值上限設定為交易基金累算盈餘的三分之一，而未來基金資產的部分配置也提供額外容量。\n\n自2007年成立，用於持有由政府為策略性目的收購的香港交易及結算所有限公司（HKEX）股份的策略組合，因其特殊性不在基金投資績效的評估範圍內。\n\n向交易基金存放的資金\n\n根據需要，交易基金會接受來自財政儲備、政府基金及法定機構的存款。利率通常與投資組合（IP1）的表現掛鉤，除非是未來基金與投資組合及長期增長組合（LTGP）之間的關聯利率。截止2017年底，未來基金在投資組合和LTGP之間的比重約為65:35。其中，與LTGP掛鉤的部分預計到2018年將逐步增加到約50%。\n\n投資流程\n\n交易基金的投資流程建立於兩類資產配置決策之上：策略性資產配置與戰術性資產配置。策略性資產配置，反映在投資基準中，代表長期佳的資產配置，以符合基金的投資目標。在此指導下，資產會進行戰術性配置，試圖超越基準的回報。這意味著實際配置常常與基準不同，稱為“戰術偏離”。儘管基準和追蹤誤差範圍由財政司司長在與EFAC協商後決定，HKMA在授權下作出戰術決策並設定戰術偏離的合理範圍。在允許範圍內，組合經理可根據短期市場變動調整持倉。\n\n投資管理\n\n直接投資\n\nHKMA的儲備管理部門直接管理約73%的交易基金投資，包括整個支持組合及部分投資組合。該部分投資組合包括投資於全球固定收益市場及運用宏觀風險管理策略的多種衍生品對沖組合。\n\n外部基金經理的使用\n\n除了內部管理外，HKMA亦聘請外部基金經理管理約27%的資產，包括所有上市股權投資及其他專門資產類別。聘用外部經理旨在利用市場中最優秀的投資專才追求可持續回報，並借助多元而互補的投資風格，分享市場見解與技術專長。\n\n與外部經理合作產生的開支包括基金管理費、保管費、交易費用及預扣稅等，這些費用主要由市場因素影響，每年可能有所變動。\n\n風險管理與合規\n\n2008/09年全球金融危機後，市場波動性大幅增加，突顯風險管理的重要性。為所有內外管理的投資組合制定了嚴格的控制和投資指引，並密切監控合規情況。加強風險評估以支持投資多元化加快的步伐，並部署風險控制工具，評估正常及不利市場條件下的市場風險。此外，還進行詳細的績效歸因分析，以識別績效來源，協助HKMA充分發揮內外經理的投資能力。\n\n責任投資\n\nHKMA支持負責任投資，例如，2016年3月7日證券及期貨事務監察委員會（SFC）發布的《負責任所有權原則》，該原則屬自願性質，協助投資者確定如何履行其股權責任。對於交易基金管理，HKMA鼓勵其香港股權投資的外部經理採用負責任所有權原則。此外，前線部門及風險管理與合規部門已將環境、社會及治理（ESG）因素納入各項內部程序，以制定和監管投資活動。HKMA將密切關注ESG標準的發展，並評估如何進一步將這些標準融入投資流程。\n\n交易基金績效\n\n2017年金融市場\n\n2017年，全球經濟與金融市場表現超出預期。得益於主要發達與新興市場經濟同步增長，企業盈利強勁，加上市場預期主要中央銀行會逐步收緊貨幣政策，全球股市表現良好。特別是香港股市上升36%，超越其他主要股市。\n\n在債券市場方面，美國聯邦儲備局按預期連續三次升息，並於十月開始縮減資產負債表，短期美國國債收益率大幅上升。不過，10年期美國國債收益率全年仍保持在約2.4%的穩定水平，其他主要國債如德國聯邦國債因歐元區經濟穩健及市場預期歐洲央行貨幣政策收緊而略有上升。\n\n在貨幣市場方面，儘管聯儲局升息及縮表，但美元對其他主要貨幣走弱。美元貶值的原因是歐洲及日本經濟復甦，以及市場預期美元與其他主要經濟體貨幣的貨幣政策差異逐漸縮小。2017年，歐元和日圓相對美元升值約14%和4%。\n\n表1列出2017年主要貨幣與債券、股市的表現。\n\n表1 2017年市場回報\n\n交易基金績效\n\n2017年，交易基金錄得投資收益2640億港元，包括海外股市收益804億、香港股市收益583億、債券收益344億，非港幣資產的貨幣折算正面效應535億，以及其他由基金持有子公司持有的投資收益374億。另有策略組合錄得4.5億元的市值增值。\n\n去年投資收益屬交易基金歷史最高，超越2007年的1422億港元，增幅為121.8億港元。\n\n年末，交易基金總資產達到40153億港元。長期增長組合的投資市值合計2356億港元，其中私募股權1572億，房地產784億。尚有投資承諾額1624億。\n\n2017年，交易基金（不包括策略組合）的投資回報率為7.4%。其中，投資組合的回報率為12.1%，支持組合為1.8%。自2009年成立以來，LTGP的年內經內部回報率為13.7%。\n\n1994年至2017年的年度回報率見圖1。表2列出2017年投資回報及在不同時間範圍內的平均回報，過去三年平均約2.9%，五年約2.5%，十年約2.2%，自1994年起則為4.9%。表3顯示2017年12月31日基金資產的貨幣配置比重。\n\n副行政長官余偉文先生（中）於2017年交易基金結果新聞發布會發言。\n\n圖1 交易基金的投資回報（1994–2017）\n\n表2 以港元計算的交易基金投資回報\n\n表3 截至2017年12月31日交易基金資產的貨幣組合（包括遠期交易）"}
{"en": "# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communication with the community and the market through the media, public education programmes and other various channels to facilitate public understanding of its policies and operations. During the year, the HKMA continued to improve corporate governance by supporting professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline and enhancing IT security to cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives and the increasing complexity of work.\n\n# ENGAGING THE COMMUNITY CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT\n\n# Media relations\n\nThe HKMA works closely with the media to enhance transparency and promote public understanding about its policies and work. In 2017, 86 open press events were organised, comprising nine press conferences, 16 stand-up interviews and 61 other public functions. In addition, 42 media interviews were arranged and a total of 360 bilingual press releases were issued. It also handles a large number of media enquiries every day.\n\nTo raise awareness of the HKMA’s key functions, guided tours were organised for the media to visit the newly revamped HKMA Information Centre. Furthermore, indepth media briefings and educational workshops were conducted for local and overseas media on a wide range of topics, including the Bond Connect scheme, prudential measures for property mortgage loans, the Resolution Regime and Exchange Fund investments.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan, introduces a mosaic artwork called “Small Change, Big Ode” to the media at the HKMA Information Centre. The artwork, featuring the Victoria Harbour and the Hong Kong skyline, was created using a total of 135,811 pieces of Hong Kong coins in different denominations.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan, conducts a media interview with local newspapers regarding the key initiatives of the HKMA’s Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office and Fintech Facilitation Office.\n\n# Public enquiries\n\nThe Public Enquiry Service provides an effective means for the public to better understand the key functions and operations of the HKMA. A total of 8,752 enquiries were handled in 2017, about half of which were related to banking policies and regulations, monetary and economic issues, consumer banking issues as well as notes and coins. Notable examples included the Coin Collection Programme, banking products and services, bankingrelated guidelines and circulars, monetary and economic statistics, prudential measures for property mortgage loans, and prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received since 2014 and Chart 2 provides a breakdown in terms of the nature of enquiries received in 2017.\n\nChart 1 Total number of public enquiries\n\nChart 2 Nature of enquiries received in 2017\n\n# Publications\n\nApart from the HKMA Annual Report, in 2017 the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report and four issues of the Quarterly Bulletin, and released regular updates of the Monthly Statistical Bulletin to provide up-to-date and thematic information and analyses on monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. In addition, the HKMA issued a total of 23 inSight articles, covering various topical issues related to its work.\n\n# HKMA website\n\nThe HKMA corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk), with over 60,000 pages in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, is the public access gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It also contains the register of authorized institutions (AIs) and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the register of stored value facility (SVF) licensees under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance. Dedicated webpages and eye-catching short-cut links are designed to draw public attention to the new initiatives of the HKMA, such as account opening, the regulatory regime for SVFs, the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office and the Fintech Facilitation Office, as well as important and timely information, such as reminders on the need to remain vigilant against bogus telephone calls and the location of Coin Carts under the Coin Collection Programme.\n\n# Public Education Programme\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre is an important resource for introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters. It consists of an exhibition area and a library, and is open to the public six days a week. The exhibition area introduces the work of the HKMA and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong. It also contains reading materials and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nThe new look of the policy section of the Information Centre, which introduces the work of the HKMA and related financial concepts, was re-opened to the public on 24 February 2017 upon completion of the refurbishment work. The revamped policy section contains various interactive games and devices that integrate play into learning and explain complicated financial concepts in a simple way. Feedback from the visitors has been positive.\n\nStudents try out the educational games at the policy section of the Information Centre to learn about the work of the HKMA.\n\nGuided tours of the Information Centre are organised for visitors. During the year, it received more than 59,000 visitors and hosted over 650 guided tours for schools and other groups (Chart 3). More than 645,000 people have visited the Information Centre since it opened in December 2003.\n\nThe library, situated next to the exhibition area, houses more than 23,000 books, journals and other publications for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs and central banking topics. It also maintains the register of AIs and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nThe library in the HKMA Information Centre.\n\nTo reach out to the community and raise public awareness of the HKMA’s work, the HKMA organised four public education seminars for about 2,000 secondary school students and teachers in 2017. Topics covered in the seminars included the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, banking stability, consumer protection, the Deposit Protection Scheme, fintech, the Belt and Road Initiative and careers in the financial industry. More than 58,400 people have participated in this public education programme since its launch in 1998.\n\nStudents and teachers from secondary schools in different districts participate in one of the public education seminars.\n\nChart 3 Types of group visits to the Information Centre in 2017\n\n# HUMAN RESOURCES\n\nThe HKMA recruits, develops and maintains a highly professional workforce to support its policy objectives and respond flexibly to changing work priorities. While the HKMA is an integral part of the Government, it employs staff on terms different from those of the civil service to attract personnel with the right experience and expertise. As a public organisation, the HKMA aims to maintain a lean and flexible structure and, where possible, to redeploy staff resources to undertake new initiatives and meet increasing workload.\n\n# Organisational changes\n\nThe Resolution Office was established on 1 April 2017 to implement the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance enacted in June 2016. The Office aims to ensure that the Hong Kong resolution regime is operational for banks. This is essential to enhancing the resilience of the Hong Kong banking sector in the event of any crisis.\n\n# Staffing\n\nThe establishment of the HKMA in 2017 was 927. This will be increased by 35 to 962 in 2018 (an increase of 3.8%) to ensure that sufficient resources are provided to cope with the new initiatives and the increasing complexity and volume of existing work. The new posts are deployed to the following functions:\n\n- Enhancing banking and financial stability, which includes:\n    – enhancing capacity to support the launch of the Faster Payment System and easy banking initiatives;\n    – strengthening supervisory capacity to deal with the regional and business expansion of banks and to facilitate (i) the wider adoption of fintech in the provision of banking services and (ii) collaboration with other regulatory authorities on cyber security and fintech issues; and\n    – supporting the work of the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce to fight against fraud, money laundering and other types of financial crimes, and strengthening legal support for enforcement actions under legislation governing anti-money laundering and SVFs.\n- Strengthening investment, risk management and other related support for the further expansion and diversification of the Exchange Fund’s investment activities.\n- Stepping up global macro and financial-sector surveillance, and strengthening talent development programmes to ensure that the HKMA has the necessary human capital to meet the long-term development needs of the organisation.\n\nTable 1 gives a breakdown of the establishment and strength of the HKMA.\n\nTable 1 Establishment and strength of the HKMA on 1 January 2018\n\nTemporary resources are deployed to meet other work demands. The HKMA also transfers staff members on secondment to other international or local organisations, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Services Development Council, to assist in activities or policy initiatives in which Hong Kong or the HKMA has an interest. Some staff members are deployed on a full-time or part-time basis to provide operational support to the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board and the Treasury Markets Association.\n\n# Remuneration policies and pay review mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary (FS) determines the pay and conditions of service for HKMA staff on the advice of the Governance Sub-Committee (GSC) through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC), taking into account the prevailing market rates and practices. Remuneration comprises a total cash package and a provident fund scheme, with minimal benefits in kind. The cash package consists of monthly fixed pay (or basic pay) and variable pay, which may be awarded to individual staff members as a lump sum once a year, depending on performance.\n\nPay for HKMA staff is reviewed annually by the FS in the light of recommendations made to him by the GSC through the EFAC, taking into account the GSC’s assessment of the performance of the HKMA in the preceding year, the paysurvey findings of the financial sector conducted by independent human resources consultants, and any other relevant factors. Special pay adjustments may be made from time to time for individual meritorious staff members to maintain their pay competitiveness.\n\nAny approved annual adjustments to the fixed pay and any variable pay awards for the HKMA are distributed to individual staff members based on their performance. Investment professionals in the HKMA are subject to a variable pay system that seeks to strengthen the link between their investment performance and remuneration award. The pay adjustments and awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Executive Director and above are approved by the FS on the advice of the GSC. The staff members concerned are not present at the meetings when their pay is discussed. The pay adjustments and awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Division Head and below are determined by the Chief Executive of the HKMA under delegated authority from the FS and within the approved overall pay awards.\n\n# Remuneration of senior staff members\n\nThe remuneration packages of senior staff members in 2017 are shown in Table 2.\n\nTable 2 Remuneration packages of HKMA senior staff members in 2017\n\n# Manager Trainee (MT) and Graduate Economist (GE) programmes\n\nTo develop a pool of young talent with sharp analytical minds, strong communication skills and good team spirit for a long-term career in central banking, the HKMA runs two trainee programmes: the MT programme and the GE programme. Each programme lasts for a period of two years.\n\nThe MT programme prepares young graduates interested in central banking work to become the HKMA’s future key management staff and contribute to the financial stability and prosperity of Hong Kong. Each MT undergoes on-the-job training in two to three departments to acquire hands-on experience on the important functions of the HKMA. For the GE programme, young graduates interested in economic research are offered the opportunity to harness their research skills in two to three departments to provide important input to the policy formulation process.\n\nBoth the MT and GE programmes provide an all-rounded career development environment for the trainees.

{"en": "# The Exchange Fund\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 157 to 243, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2017, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2017, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards.  My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report.  I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards.  I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017.  These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information.  The other information comprises all the information included in the 2017 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.  If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact.  I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.  I also:\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.  The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.  If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion.  My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report.  However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and\n- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements.  I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit.  I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nDavid Sun\nDirector of Audit\n\n11 April 2018\n\n# 1 PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES\n\nThe Monetary Authority, under delegated authority from the Financial Secretary as Controller of the Exchange Fund (the Fund), manages the Fund in accordance with the provisions of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).  The principal activities of the Fund are safeguarding the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong and maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems.\n\nThe assets of the Fund are managed as four portfolios: the Backing Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio and the Strategic Portfolio.  The assets of the Backing Portfolio fully match the Monetary Base, under Hong Kong’s Currency Board system.  The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.  The Long-Term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments.  The Strategic Portfolio holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited acquired by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) for the account of the Fund for strategic purposes. Operating segment information is set out in note 30.\n\n# 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n# 2.1 Statement of compliance\n\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with all applicable Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRSs), which is a collective term that includes all applicable individual Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, Hong Kong Accounting Standards (HKASs) and Interpretations issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), and accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong.  A summary of the significant accounting policies adopted by the Fund and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) is set out below.\n\nThe HKICPA has issued certain new and revised HKFRSs that are first effective or available for early adoption for the current accounting period.  Note 3 provides information on the changes, if any, in accounting policies resulting from initial adoption of these developments to the extent that they are relevant to the Group for the current and prior accounting periods reflected in these financial statements.\n\n# 2.2 Basis of preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe Group financial statements include the financial statements of the Group as well as the Group’s interests in associates and joint ventures.  The principal activities of the principal subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are shown in notes 16 and 17.\n\nThe measurement basis used in the preparation of the financial statements is historical cost except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair values as explained in the accounting policies set out below:\n- trading financial instruments (note 2.6.2.1);\n- financial assets and financial liabilities designated at fair value (note 2.6.2.2);\n- available-for-sale securities (note 2.6.2.5);\n- gold (note 2.11); and\n- investment properties (note 2.12).\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with HKFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure.  The estimates and associated assumptions are based on experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.  Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nNote 18 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of investment properties.  Note 36 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of financial instruments.  Apart from the accounting judgements involving these fair value estimations, there are no other critical accounting judgements involved in the application of the Group’s accounting policies.\n\n# 2.3 Subsidiaries and non-controlling interests\n\nA subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group.  The Group controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.  When assessing whether the Group has power, only substantive rights (held by the Group and other parties) are considered.\n", "zh": "外匯基金\n\n審計署署長報告\n\n獨立核數師致財經司司長的報告\n\n意見\n\n我證明已審核外匯基金及其附屬公司（「集團」）在第157至243頁所列的財務報表，包括截至2017年12月31日的外匯基金和集團的資產負債表，以及截至該年度的收支帳、全面收益表、權益變動表及現金流量表和附註，包括重要會計政策摘要。\n\n依據我之意見，該等財務報表真實公正地反映基金及集團截至2017年12月31日的財務狀況，以及其該年度的財務表現及現金流量，並已按香港會計師公會（「HKICPA」）發布的《香港財務報告準則》（「HKFRSs」）編製，亦已根據《外匯基金條例》（第66章）第7條下由行政長官發布的指示妥善準備。\n\n意見的依據\n\n我根據《外匯基金條例》第7條所作的行政長官指示及審計署審計標準進行審計。我的責任在前述標準中有進一步說明，並在本報告的「審計師對財務報表審計的責任」部分作詳細描述。本人與集團保持獨立，並已依照該些標準履行其他倫理責任。我相信我所取得的審計證據充分且適當，能構成本意見的基礎。\n\n關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項是指我專業判斷中在本人對2017年12月31日結束的財務報表審計中認為最為重要的事項。這些事項是在整體審計及形成意見的過程中處理的，並不對這些事項作出獨立意見。\n\n其他資料\n\n貨幣管理局負責其他資料。其他資料包括香港貨幣管理局2017年年度報告中所含的所有資料，除了財務報表及其審計師報告之外。\n\n我對財務報表的意見不涵蓋其他資料，且不對其作出任何保證性結論。\n\n在審計財務報表過程中，我的責任是閱讀其他資料，並在此過程中考慮該些資料是否與財務報表或我在審計中獲得的知識在實質上有出入，或似乎有重大誤報。如果根據我所執行的工作，我得出結論：該些資料存在重大錯誤，我須就此情況作出報告。至今我沒有相關事項需要報告。\n\n貨幣管理局及外匯基金諮詢委員會審計小組的責任\n\n貨幣管理局負責編製具有真實和公平反映的財務報表，該等報表須符合由香港會計師公會發布的HKFRSs及第7條指示，並且負責制定必要的內部控制，以確保財務報表不存在因欺詐或錯誤而造成的重要錯報。\n\n在編製財務報表時，貨幣管理局須評估集團能否繼續作營運中的實體，並就有關存續經營的事宜披露（如有），並以經營存續為基礎進行會計處理。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會的審計小組則負責監督集團的財務報告流程。\n\n審計師對財務報表的審計責任\n\n我的目標是獲得合理保證，確信整份財務報表在整體上不存在因欺詐或錯誤造成的重大錯誤，並發出包含我意見的審計師報告。合理保證屬於較高層次的保證，但不能保證根據審計署審計標準進行的審計一定能夠查明所有存在的重大錯誤。錯誤可以由欺詐或疏忽引起，若單獨或合併起來，可能對用戶根據該等財務資料作出的經濟決策產生重大影響，即屬重大。\n\n作為遵循審計署審計標準的審計工作一部分，我在整個審計過程中保持專業判斷和專業懷疑心態，並且：\n\n- 識別及評估財務報表重大錯誤的風險（因欺詐或疏忽），設計及執行有效的審計程序，取得足夠且適當的審計證據，作出合理的判斷。由欺詐引起的重大錯誤未能察覺的風險高於由疏忽引起的，因為欺詐可能涉及串謀、偽造、故意遺漏、虛假陳述或篡改內部控制；\n- 了解與審計相關的內部控制以設計適當的審計程序，但並非為了對集團內部控制的有效性作出意見；\n- 評估貨幣管理局採用的會計政策的適當性及會計估算及披露的合理性；\n- 對貨幣管理局的存續經營假設的適當性作出結論，並根據取得的審計證據判定有關事件或條件是否可能引起重大不確定性。如果有重大不確定性，須在審計師報告中提請注意財務報表披露；如披露不足，則須修正意見。我的結論基於截至我簽發審計報告日之前所得的證據，但未來的事件或情況可能導致集團停止存續；\n- 評估財務報表的整體表達、結構、內容和披露，確保財務報表所反映的交易和事件以公平披露的方式呈現；\n- 就集團內各實體或業務活動的財務資訊，取得足夠且適當的審計證據，以發表意見。我負責監督和管理集團審計工作，且我對我的審計意見負全部責任。\n\n我就計劃的審計範圍及時間及重大審計發現（包括我在審計過程中識別的任何重大內控缺陷）與外匯基金諮詢委員會的審計小組進行溝通。\n\n我亦向該委員會提交聲明，證明我已符合相關倫理要求，並進行了多方面與我獨立性相關的溝通，包括所有可能影響獨立性的關係或其他事宜，以及相關的保障措施。\n\n根據與審計小組的溝通，我確定在本年度財務報表審計中最為重要且具有關鍵性的事項，並在審計報告中描述這些事項，除非法律或規例禁止公開披露，或在極少數特殊情況下，認為披露該事項的負面後果大於其公共利益。\n\n戴維孫\n審計署署長\n\n2018年4月11日"}

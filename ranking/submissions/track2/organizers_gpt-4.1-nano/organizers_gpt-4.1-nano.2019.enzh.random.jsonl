{"en": "The year of 2019 has been anything but uneventful.\n\nUS-China trade tensions remained a big wild card. Lingering uncertainties over trade talks between the world’s two largest economies rattled investor confidence and undermined international trade, manufacturing, investment and even consumption. Gone are the days when global economic expansion was a given. The global economy entered a synchronised slowdown during the year. In response to the slower growth, major central banks around the world have reversed course on their monetary policy normalisation.\n\nLocally, social incidents happening in the second half of the year dealt a further blow to the Hong Kong economy. The retail, tourism and catering sectors were among the hardest hit. For 2019 as a whole, the Hong Kong economy contracted by 1.2%, the first annual decline in a decade, while the unemployment rate rose to 3.3% from a multi-year low of 2.8% at the beginning of the year. As 2020 dawned, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak posed yet another significant threat to both global and local economies.\n\nIn the face of such an uncertain and challenging environment, it is of paramount importance to maintain monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong, as I made clear when taking over as Chief Executive of the HKMA on 1 October 2019.\n\n# Monetary and financial stability: the bedrock of an international financial centre\n\nThe Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) in place since 1983 has helped Hong Kong weather numerous challenges and shocks, demonstrating its important role as an anchor of Hong Kong’s economic prosperity and status as an international financial centre. Notwithstanding the challenging external and domestic environment during the year, the LERS continued to operate in a smooth and orderly manner, once again proving its resilience in times of uncertainty. Hong Kong’s banking system also remained sound and robust. The facts speak for themselves: the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained stable and has strengthened to the strong side of the Convertibility Zone in recent months, while bank deposits continued to grow during the year. In a nutshell, no noticeable outflow of funds from the Hong Kong dollar or the banking system was observed.\n\nThe stability of Hong Kong’s monetary and banking systems reflects not only the robustness of, but also strong confidence in, our systems. This did not happen overnight, but through years of efforts to build up buffers and strengthen surveillance, complemented by our swift response to rumours on social media platforms.\n\nOur preparations over the years for rainy days have built a solid foundation and strong buffers for Hong Kong’s monetary and banking systems. In addition to the vast foreign exchange reserves in our public coffers, our banking system has strong capital buffers, robust liquidity and very good asset quality, whether by international or historical standards. The eight rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures on property mortgages implemented since 2009 have also greatly enhanced banks’ resilience against a property market downturn.\n\nMarket surveillance and banking supervision make up the core part of our work in maintaining monetary and banking stability, and we have been strengthening our surveillance and supervisory framework from time to time. Apart from close monitoring of the credit and liquidity risks of banks, one of our new endeavours in the year was to make use of technology and granular data collected from banks to enhance our capability to monitor Hong Kong dollar funding and financial market activities in a more in-depth and timely manner. Stress tests and contingency planning have also been augmented in the light of the fast evolving economic and operating environment.\n\nIndeed, our robust regulatory regime has won strong endorsements internationally. During the year, the International Monetary Fund reaffirmed that Hong Kong was well placed to address both cyclical and structural changes, given its significant buffers. Hong Kong’s effective legal and institutional framework for combatting money laundering and terrorist financing also obtained a positive assessment from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), making Hong Kong the first in the Asia-pacific region to achieve an overall compliant result in the FATF’s Mutual Evaluation.\n\nConfidence is the foundation for the proper functioning of markets and is crucial to the safeguarding of monetary and financial stability. To maintain market confidence, we have to be on high alert for, and respond swiftly to, any malicious rumours that may potentially cast doubt on Hong Kong’s monetary or banking systems. This is particularly important given the prevalent use of social media and instant messaging nowadays. While a variety of rumours were spread on social media platforms by fearmongers during the outbreak of social unrest, our quick and clear rebuttals to these rumours through social media, in addition to traditional media, proved useful and effective in clearing the air, quelling false rumours from spreading further, and upholding international and public confidence in our systems.\n\n# Banking system: an important pillar of economic activity\n\nThe banking sector, as an essential pillar of economic activity, plays a fundamental role in ensuring the smooth running of society and the economy. Despite the challenging operating environment since the latter half of the year, banks have been working hard alongside others and doing their utmost to maintain normal operation of their core functions and continue serving businesses and the public.\n\nIn addition to basic banking services like deposits and transfers, an important function of banks is in extending credit to borrowers in support of the real economy. We are well aware of, and concerned about, the cash-flow problem facing businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), under the difficult economic conditions. While safeguarding banking stability, we have launched a number of initiatives to ensure continued funding support to SMEs. In particular, the Countercyclical Capital Buffer ratio of banks was reduced on two occasions, in October 2019 and March 2020, by a total of 150 basis points to 1.0%; the level of regulatory reserve requirement on banks was also reduced by half in April 2020. These measures release a total of around HK$1 trillion in lending capacity, providing banks with more room for lending to enterprises including SMEs. We have also set up a platform – the Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism – bringing together major banks in Hong Kong to explore and discuss specific measures to strengthen funding support for SMEs. I am pleased to see that many banks have responded proactively to our call and introduced relief measures such as principal moratorium for customers in need to ride out the storm.\n\nIn view of some SMEs’ feedback about difficulties in opening bank accounts, which is the very first step in accessing various banking services, we have made dedicated efforts to address this issue over the past few years. Our work is bearing fruit, as improvement in account opening for businesses is visible. As a further step to promote financial inclusion, the HKMA spearheaded the launch of tiered account services – Simple Bank Accounts (SBAs) with a streamlined customer due diligence process – to provide start-ups and SMEs with an alternative to traditional bank accounts. More than 2,800 SBAs have been opened so far.\n\n# International financial centre: from strength to strength\n\nWe have always been mindful of the need to strike a reasonable balance between regulation and development. Given the intense competition among financial centres, we have to work hard to strengthen Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre and thereby ensure its longer term stability. There are four key areas of work: technology, green finance, financial connectivity with the Mainland, and talent development.\n\n# Embracing technology in the digital era\n\nHong Kong has been moving fast in promoting financial technology (fintech) since the establishment of the HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office in 2016 and the introduction of the Smart Banking initiatives in 2017.\n\nOn the payment front, the vibrancy of the fintech ecosystem is evident in the strong momentum in the adoption of the Faster Payment System (FPS), the world’s first multi-currency, cross-banks and e-wallets, real-time retail payment platform. FPS registrations reached four million within a short span of 15 months, representing a high rate of penetration in a population of 7.5 million people. The Government has also adopted the FPS to provide the public with greater convenience in paying taxes, rates and water charges. More and more businesses are expected to use this fast, safe and convenient means of receiving and making payment to enhance operational efficiency.\n\nIn the banking sector, significant progress was seen in applying fintech to their banking services and business operations. According to a study conducted by the HKMA, almost 90% of the surveyed retail banks have adopted, or are planning to adopt, artificial intelligence in their business applications. With the HKMA’s facilitation, banks have been applying big data and consumer behavioural analytics in their personal credit products. They have also launched over 800 Open Application programming Interfaces in the first two phases, covering a range of banking products and services. While encouraging banks to use fintech, we did not lose sight of the need for enhanced technology risk management and consumer protection in digital banking services. Timely supervisory guidance has been provided to banks in these areas.\n\nRegulatory technology (Regtech) is another area of great interest to banks, for its potential of enabling banks to conduct regulatory compliance and risk management, particularly in anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT), more efficiently and cost-effectively. To facilitate greater industry adoption of Regtech and the building of a wider Regtech ecosystem, the HKMA organised the inaugural AML/CFT Regtech Forum and issued its first Regtech newsletter in November to discuss possible use cases of Regtech. At the same time, the HKMA, as a banking supervisor, is exploring the use of supervisory technology (Suptech), including new data science and analytics, to enhance work effectiveness and efficiency. We have embarked on a series of studies and developed a road map for the implementation of Suptech in the next few years.\n\nFrom a broader perspective, this is only the start of the fintech journey in the banking sector. The HKMA granted eight licences to virtual banks during the year. One of the virtual banks officially launched its services in March 2020, while some other virtual banks have commenced pilot trials through the HKMA’s Fintech Supervisory Sandbox. I look forward to the launch of the other virtual banks and the introduction of more innovative and diversified banking services to the people of Hong Kong that would help raise the global competitiveness of our banking sector.\n\nMore exciting developments are also expected at the international level. After successfully completing a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) trial to connect our blockchain-based trade finance platform, eTradeConnect, with its European counterpart, we are conducting another PoC trial with the platform of the people’s Bank of China, paving the way for the digitalisation of cross-border trades. We have begun a joint research project with the Bank of Thailand to study the application of Central Bank Digital Currency to cross-border payments. The Bank for International Settlements also put its first Innovation Hub Centre into operation in Hong Kong in November to foster fintech collaboration within the central banking community. All these developments present clear evidence of Hong Kong’s leading global position in fintech development.\n\n# Promoting green and sustainable finance for a better future\n\nClimate-related risks have drawn increasing global attention in recent years. To contribute to the global efforts in addressing this challenge, the HKMA unveiled three key measures in May to promote green finance development in Hong Kong in different capacities.\n\nAs a banking supervisor, the HKMA is undertaking a three-phased approach to promoting green and sustainable banking. A framework for assessing the “greenness” of banks has been developed for industry consultation under phase I, paving the way for the formulation of supervisory expectations and requirements for the banking industry under phase II and implementation under phase III.\n\nAs the manager of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA actively advances responsible investment by integrating environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into its investment activities. Specifically, we have adopted the principle of giving priority to green and ESG investments if their long-term return is comparable to other investments on a risk-adjusted basis. After venturing into the green bond market in 2015 as one of the early investors, we will continue to grow our green bond portfolio and invest in other ESG assets. We will also join hands with like-minded investors and regulators to promote best practices on ESG through our participation in international organisations in the ESG community.\n", "zh": "2019年絕非平靜一帆。\n\n美中貿易緊張局勢依然是一個變數。兩個最大經濟體之間的貿易談判持續存在不確定性，令投資者信心動搖，並削弱了國際貿易、製造業、投資甚至消費的信心。全球經濟擴張曾被視為理所當然的事情，這些日子已一去不復返。整個全球經濟在年內同步放緩。為應對這一放緩，世界各地主要央行已逆轉貨幣政策正常化的步伐。\n\n在本地方面，下半年發生的社會事件進一步打擊了香港經濟。零售、旅遊和餐飲業是受創最嚴重的行業之一。2019年，香港經濟收縮了1.2%，為十年來首度出現年度跌幅，而失業率由年初的多年度低點2.8%上升至3.3%。隨着2020年的到來，新型冠狀病毒（COVID-19）疫情再次對全球及本地經濟構成重大威脅。\n\n面對如此充滿不確定性和挑戰的環境，保持香港的貨幣金融穩定尤為重要，正如我在2019年10月1日接任香港金融管理局局長時所強調的。\n\n# 貨幣金融穩定：國際金融中心的基石\n\n自1983年實行聯繫匯率制度（LERS）以來，香港經歷了多次挑戰與震盪，證明其在香港經濟繁榮及作為國際金融中心的地位中扮演重要的錨定作用。儘管年內外部和內部環境充滿挑戰，聯繫匯率制度仍能順利有序運作，再次證明其在逆境中的韌性。香港的銀行體系亦保持穩健和強韌。事實勝於雄辯：港元匯率保持穩定，並在近期進一步升值至兌換區的強側，而年內銀行存款亦持續增長。總而言之，未察覺有資金從港元或銀行體系流出。\n\n香港的貨幣及銀行系統之所以能保持穩定，不僅體現其本身的韌性，更源自透明的制度信心。這絕非一夜之功，而是多年努力建立緩衝、強化監管的結果，加上我們對社交媒體傳言的迅速反應。\n\n我們過去多年來的準備工作，已為香港的貨幣和銀行系統打下堅實的基礎和充足的緩衝。除公開金庫中龐大的外匯儲備外，我們的金融系統擁有強健的資本緩衝、雄厚的流動性及優良的資產質素，無論按國際或歷史標準來看都是如此。而自2009年實施的八輪逆周期宏觀審慎措施，也大大提升了銀行應對房地產市場下行的韌性。\n\n市場監測與銀行監管是我們維持貨幣金融穩定工作的核心。我們亦不斷強化監控體系。除密切監察銀行的信貸和流動性風險外，今年我們新力推利用科技及來自銀行的細緻數據，以更深入、更即時地監測港幣資金及金融市場所進行的活動。經濟與營運環境瞬息萬變，我們亦加強了壓力測試和應急預案。\n\n無可否認，我們的監管制度在國際上獲得一致認可。年內，國際貨幣基金組織重申，憑藉豐厚的緩衝，香港有望應對周期性和結構性變化。香港有效的反洗錢和打擊恐怖融資的法律制度，也獲得了金融行動特別工作組（FATF）的正面評估，使香港成為亞太地區首個在FATF「相符評估」中取得全面合規成果的地區。\n\n信心是市場正常運作的基礎，也是保障貨幣及金融穩定的關鍵。為維護市場信心，我們須對任何可能引發疑慮的惡意傳言保持高度警覺，並快速回應，特別是在社交媒體和即時通訊日益普及的今日。雖然在社會動盪期間，恐慌製造者在社交平台散佈了各種謠言，但我們迅速而清楚的反駁，加上傳統媒體的協調配合，有效澄清了事實，平息了不實傳聞，並重申了國際及公共對我們制度的信心。\n\n# 銀行系統：經濟活動的重要支柱\n\n作為經濟活動的根幹，銀行業在確保社會及經濟平穩運作中扮演根本角色。儘管年中後段運作環境充滿挑戰，銀行仍戮力合作，盡心盡力維持核心職能的正常運作，並持續為商戶和市民提供服務。\n\n除基本的存款、轉帳服務外，銀行的重要功能還在於向借款人提供信貸，以支持實體經濟。我們深知，中小企（SMEs）在經濟困境中面臨資金流動問題，亦十分關注。因此，我們在確保銀行穩健的同時，亦推出多項措施，確保中小企資金持續獲得支持。例如，自2019年10月和2020年3月起，我們兩度將銀行的逆周期資本緩衝比率（Countercyclical Capital Buffer）合併調低150個基點，至1.0%；而在2020年4月，銀行的法定準備金要求亦減半。這些措施共釋放約一萬億港元的貸款能力，為銀行向企業，包括中小企提供貸款提供更大空間。我們亦成立「銀行業中小企貸款協調機制」，匯聚主要銀行，探討並討論加強資金支持的具體措施。很高興看到，許多銀行積極響應，推出 Relief Measures，如展延貸款本金還款期限，幫助客戶渡過難關。\n\n為解決部分中小企反映開設銀行帳戶困難的問題——這是申請各類銀行服務的第一步，我們多年來作出專門努力，成效逐步顯現。為促進金融包容，我們率先推出層級賬戶服務——簡易銀行賬戶（SBAs），流程簡化，讓初創公司和中小企有別於傳統銀行賬戶的選擇。至今，已有逾2800個簡易賬戶開立完畢。\n\n# 國際金融中心：持續邁向更高峰\n\n我們始終謹慎處理監管與發展之間的平衡。鑒於金融中心之間激烈的競爭，我們需要不斷努力，加強香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力，以確保其長遠穩定。相關工作聚焦於四個重點範疇：科技、綠色金融、與內地的金融聯繫以及人才培育。\n\n# 在數碼時代推動科技\n\n自2016年設立HKMA金融科技推廣辦事處和2017年推出智慧銀行計劃以來，香港在推動金融科技（fintech）方面步伐迅速。\n\n在支付領域，金融科技生態系統的活力由於採用快捷支付系統（FPS）的高速增長而展現無遺。作為全球首個實現多幣種、跨銀行及電子錢包的即時零售支付平台，FPS用戶在短短15個月內突破400萬，滲透率在人口僅750萬的香港相當高。政府亦採用FPS來提供便捷的稅費、水費及差餉支付方式。越來越多的商戶將運用這一快速、安全、便捷的支付工具，以提升營運效率。\n\n在銀行業方面，金融科技在銀行服務及業務運作中的應用取得顯著進展。根據HKMA一項調查，接近90%的零售銀行已採用或計劃採用人工智能（AI）技術於其商業應用。借助HKMA的推動，銀行亦在個人信貸產品中運用大數據及消費者行為分析。同時，已推出超過800個開放式API，涵蓋多種銀行產品和服務。在鼓勵銀行利用金融科技的同時，我們亦重視提升技術風險管理和消費者保障，並為銀行提供了及時的監管指引。\n\n監管科技（Regtech）是另一高速發展的領域，能幫助銀行更高效、經濟地落實監管合規和風險管理，特別是在反洗錢和打擊恐怖主義融資（AML/CFT）方面。為推動行業採用Regtech，HKMA組織了首屆AML/CFT Regtech論壇和在2019年11月發行首份Regtech通訊，探討Regtech的應用案例。同時，HKMA作為銀行監管者，亦正探索運用監管科技（Suptech）如數據科學及分析工具，以提升工作效率與效果。未來數年，我們已展開多項研究並制定了Suptech的實施路線圖。\n\n從更宏觀的角度來看，這只是金融科技之旅的起點。年內，我們授予八家虛擬銀行牌照，一家虛擬銀行於今年3月正式啟動服務，另一些則在HKMA的金融科技監管沙箱中進行試點。期望未來更多虛擬銀行加入，並推出更多創新多元的銀行服務，提升香港銀行業的國際競爭力。\n\n同時，國際層面亦有令人振奮的發展。成功將我們的區塊鏈貿易金融平台——eTradeConnect，與歐洲對應平台連結的PoC測試結束後，我們正進行與中國人民銀行平台的另一個PoC測試，為跨境貿易數字化鋪路。我們亦與泰國央行合作，研究中央銀行數字貨幣在跨境支付中的應用。此外，國際清算銀行( BIS)亦於11月在香港正式啟用其首個創新中心，促進中央銀行金融科技合作。所有這些都彰顯香港在全球金融科技領域中的領先地位。\n\n# 推動綠色與可持續金融，締造更美好未來\n\n近年來，氣候相關風險受到越來越多的國際關注。為配合全球應對措施，HKMA於五月推出三項措施，以多方面推動香港綠色金融發展。\n\n作為銀行監管者，我們採用分階段策略推動綠色及可持續銀行業。第一階段已委託行業制定“銀行綠色”評估框架，為第二階段建立監管期望和要求鋪路，並在第三階段落實執行。\n\n作為基金管理者，HKMA積極推進負責任投資，將環境、社會及治理（ESG）因素融入投資活動。特別是，我們採用優先投資於綠色和ESG資產的原則，前提是長期回報風險調整後與其他投資相當。自2015年成為早期投資者涉足綠色債券市場以來，我們將持續擴大綠色債券組合，並投資於其他ESG資產。同時，我們亦將與志同道合的投資者和監管機構合作，推動ESG國際標準和最佳實踐。"}

{"en": "# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nThe Hong Kong economy contracted in 2019, reflecting global economic slowdown, lingering US-China trade conflicts and local social incidents. As economic conditions deteriorated rapidly in the second half of the year, the labour market faced increasing pressures. Inflation also increased due to a sharp rise in pork prices. Economic performance for 2020 is expected to remain challenging as the novel coronavirus outbreak hits the already weakening economy. Given the difficult economic environment, the Government and the HKMA have rolled out measures to support the economy, especially households and small and medium-sized enterprises.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Real activities\n\nFollowing a 2.9% expansion in 2018, the Hong Kong economy contracted by 1.2% in 2019, marking the first annual contraction since 2009. In particular, the economy entered into a recession in the second half of the year, with the seasonally adjusted real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) shrinking consecutively in the second, third and fourth quarters (Table 1). The decline in economic activities reflected a notable reduction in domestic demand (Chart 1). As the local social incidents weighed significantly on consumption activities and sentiments in the latter part of the year, private consumption expenditure recorded the first annual decline since 2003. Overall investment spending also dropped amid dampened business sentiments. On the external front, slowing global economic growth and additional tariffs levied amid the US-China trade tensions led to a decline in Hong Kong’s exports of goods. Exports of services also saw the largest annual decline on record because the social incidents led to a severe deterioration in inbound tourism. With smaller domestic and re-export-induced demand, imports of goods and services also worsened. On a net basis, net trade contributed positively to GDP in 2019 (Chart 1) because total imports declined even faster than total exports.\n\nIn view of the strong economic headwinds, the Government introduced several rounds of measures between August and December 2019 to alleviate the financial burden of residents, safeguard jobs and support enterprises, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as well as those in the hard-hit sectors, such as retail, food services, transport and tourism. To allow banks to be more supportive to the domestic economy and help mitigate the economic cycle, the HKMA announced on 14 October a reduction in the Countercyclical Capital Buffer ratio of banks from 2.5% to 2.0%, thereby providing banks with more flexibility to release HK$200–300 billion in bank credit to enterprises including SMEs, and also established a Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism. A new relief measure for the 80% Guarantee product of the SME Financing Guarantee Scheme (SFGS) was introduced in September, allowing SME borrowers facing weakening cash flows to apply for principal moratorium to get immediate support. Further, a new 90% loan guarantee product under the SFGS was introduced in December to provide additional support to SMEs, businesses with relatively less operating experience, as well as professionals seeking to set up their own practices, to obtain financing.\n\n# Monetary conditions\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate and money markets functioned in a smooth and orderly manner in 2019. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained broadly stable throughout the year. As the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking was triggered in March, the HKMA purchased Hong Kong dollars from, and sold US dollars to, banks at the rate of HK$7.85/US$1, leading to a decline in the Aggregate Balance in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System. The Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained largely steady at the longer end, while short-term rates generally picked up. At the retail level, several retail banks lowered their Best Lending Rates by 12.5 basis points in late October following the decreases in the target range for the US federal funds rate. As for monetary aggregates, total bank loans increased by 6.7% in 2019, up from 4.4% in 2018, and total deposits grew by 2.9% during the year.\n\n# Inflation\n\nThe underlying inflation rate, which nets out the effects of the Government’s one-off relief measures, rose slightly to 3.0% in 2019, from 2.6% in 2018. The mild increase in inflation was mainly driven by the elevated pork prices due to the disrupted supply of fresh pork since May (Chart 2). Excluding basic food items, price pressures were held at moderate levels throughout the year. In particular, the housing component of consumer price inflation softened in tandem with an earlier consolidation of fresh-letting private residential rentals. More broadly, the mild growth in nominal wages and the slower increase in commercial rentals1 helped keep local business costs in check. Externally, import price inflation moderated, in line with lower inflation in some of Hong Kong’s major import sources amid slower global economic growth.\n\n# Labour market\n\nThe labour market remained broadly resilient in the first half of 2019 but faced mounting pressures in the second half (Chart 3). After staying at a multi-year low of 2.8% in the first two quarters, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose to 2.9% in the third quarter and 3.3% in the final quarter, with those for the consumption and tourism-related sectors recording even more visible rises amid the social incidents. Overall labour demand also shrank visibly in the latter part of the year as total employment and the number of privatesector vacancies fell. The reduction in labour demand was particularly prominent in the retail, accommodation and food services sectors, as well as import/export trade and construction sectors. On the supply side, the labour force participation rate edged down, partly due to a cyclical response to the economic recession. As the labour market came under increasing pressures, growth in nominal wage and earnings showed signs of a slowdown towards the end of the year.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe local stock market experienced sharp fluctuations during 2019. After a market rally in the first four months, the Hang Seng Index plunged in May due in part to concerns about the re-escalation of the US-China trade tensions (Chart 4). While recouping some lost ground in June in response to major central banks’ signals of a more accommodative monetary stance, stock prices came under pressure again amid slowing global economic growth and local social incidents. Towards the end of the year, stock prices regained some upward momentum following the announcement of a “phase one” trade agreement between the US and Mainland China. The Hang Seng Index finished the year at 28,190, registering an overall gain of 9.1% for the year. By contrast, the average daily turnover declined by about 19% from a year earlier. The listings of a major Mainland tech company and a leading beer manufacturer helped expand equity funds raised through initial public offerings (IpOs) to HK$314.2 billion in 2019. Hong Kong ranked first globally in terms of funds raised through IpOs for a second straight year in 2019.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market staged a strong rebound in the first five months of 2019 but generally softened in the remainder of the year. Market sentiment improved in early 2019 partly because concerns over US-China trade tensions temporarily eased, but the sentiment was dampened afterwards by the re-escalated US-China trade tensions, prolonged social incidents and weakened domestic economic conditions. Overall housing prices moderated by 5% from the peak in May through December, though still recording an annual growth of 5% due to a 10% rebound in the first five months (Chart 4). Transaction volume in 2019 increased by 4% to 59,797 units from a year earlier, reflecting the strong trading activities in the early part of the year. Housing affordability remained stretched, with the price-toincome ratio and the income-gearing ratio staying high at 17.9 and 80.9 respectively, far above their long-term averages.2 To assist home buyers with immediate housing needs, the Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation (HKMC) in mid-October raised the cap on the value of completed residential properties eligible for a mortgage loan under the Mortgage Insurance programme.3 On the other hand, the non-residential property market faced stronger downward pressures in 2019. In particular, both prices and rentals for retail premises registered the largest declines since the global financial crisis in 2008, reflecting the worsening business conditions during the year.\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nHong Kong’s economic performance for 2020 is expected to be very challenging, with significant near-term downside risks associated with the coronavirus outbreak. Some sectors, such as retail, accommodation, food services, tourism and transport, which have yet to recover from the disruptions caused by the social incidents, will be doubly hit. However, the countercyclical fiscal measures announced in the 2020/21 Budget, which include a one-off cash handout and a new concessionary low-interest loan under the SFGS with 100% Government guarantee, are expected to provide some support to the economy, especially households and SMEs. On 16 March 2020, the HKMA further reduced the Countercyclical Capital Buffer ratio of banks from 2.0% to 1.0%, which will allow banks to be more supportive to the domestic economy, in particular those sectors and individuals that are expected to experience additional short-term stress due to the impact arising from the coronavirus outbreak. Analysed by GDP component, private consumption and investment are likely to remain weak because of the fragile consumer and business confidence. While government consumption will contribute to economic growth, public investment expenditure is anticipated to be relatively sluggish following the completion of some major infrastructure projects. On the external front, the “phase one” trade deal between the US and Mainland China is assessed to be slightly positive for the local economy in the short term. However, Hong Kong’s external trade performance will continue to be weighed down by weak global economic growth and trade flows. In particular, the coronavirus outbreak may lead to regional supply chain disruptions and slower cross-border economic activities, in tourism for example, thereby restraining Hong Kong’s exports. The Government forecasts real GDP growth for 2020 in the range of -1.5% to 0.5%, while growth forecasts by international organisations and privatesector analysts averaged -3.3%.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nInflationary pressures are expected to moderate in 2020 because of the sub-par economic conditions, the consolidation of private residential rentals and mild imported inflation. Market consensus forecasts a headline inflation rate for 2020 of 1.8%, and the Government projects the headline and underlying inflation rates to be 1.7% and 2.5% respectively. In the labour market, the unemployment rate is likely to rise further in the near term, given the weakened economic prospects and the coronavirus outbreak. privatesector analysts expect the unemployment rate to rise to about 4.0% in 2020.\n\n# Uncertainties and risks\n\nThe subdued economic outlook for 2020 is subject to a number of uncertainties and risks, including those stemming from the slowing global economy, US-China trade relations, Mainland’s economic performance, local social incidents and the persistence of the coronavirus outbreak. In particular, a prolonged coronavirus outbreak could trigger a more visible global economic slowdown and a repricing of assets, with the resulting unfavourable macroeconomic environment and tighter financial conditions posing further downward pressures on domestic real activities. However, the more concerted effort by major central banks to ease their monetary policies may provide a cushion against the negative economic impact inflicted by the outbreak.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector was resilient in 2019 despite the challenging environment with the global economic slowdown, US-China trade tensions and local social incidents. Bank balance sheet trends were stable, as both loans and deposits grew moderately. The capital and liquidity positions of the banking sector remained solid and asset quality held up well. The banking sector remained profitable with stable average return on asset.\n", "zh": "# 經濟及金融環境\n\n香港經濟於2019年收縮，反映全球經濟放緩、美中貿易衝突持續以及本地社會事件。由於經濟狀況在下半年迅速惡化，勞動市場面臨越來越大的壓力。由於豬肉價格急升，通脹亦有所上升。預計2020年，隨著新型冠狀病毒疫情害及本已疲弱的經濟受到沖擊，經濟表現仍將持續挑戰。在如此困難的經濟環境下，政府及香港金融管理局已推出多項措施以支持經濟，特別是家庭和中小企。\n\n# 回顧經濟\n\n# 實質活動\n\n继2018年增長2.9%後，香港經濟於2019年收縮1.2%，為自2009年以來首次年度收縮。尤其在下半年，經濟進入衰退，經季調後的實質國內生產總值（GDP）連續在第二、第三及第四季度收縮（表1）。經濟活動的跌幅反映出內需大幅減少（圖1）。由於社會事件在年底時對消費活動及情緒造成顯著影響，私人消費支出錄得自2003年以來首個年度下降。整體投資在商業情緒低迷下亦有所下降。在外部方面，由於全球經濟放緩及美中貿易緊張帶來的額外關稅，香港的貨物出口出現下降。服務出口亦錄得史上最大年度跌幅，因社會事件嚴重削弱入境旅遊。面對內需及轉口需求的縮減，商品及服務的進口亦惡化。從淨出口來看，2019年淨貿易對GDP構成正面貢獻（圖1），因進口總額甚至比出口下降得更快。\n\n鑑於經濟逆風甚大，政府於2019年8月至12月間推行多輪措施，以緩解居民財務負擔、保障就業並支援企業，尤其是小型及中型企業，以及受嚴重衝擊的行業如零售、餐飲、運輸及旅遊。為讓銀行能更支持本地經濟並減輕經濟週期影響，香港金融管理局於10月14日宣布將逆周期資本緩衝比率從2.5%下調至2.0%，為銀行釋放200至300億港元的信貸提供更大彈性，並建立了銀行業界中小企貸款協調機制。9月推出的中小企融資擔保計劃（SFGS）80%擔保產品新措施，允許中小企借款人在現金流減弱時申請暫緩本金還款以即時獲得支持。12月，為支援較少營運經驗的中小企及專業人士，推出了另一款擔保比率高達90%的新融資產品。\n\n# 貨幣條件\n\n2019年，港幣匯率及貨幣市場運作保持順暢有序。港幣匯率全年基本穩定。3月，觸發弱市可兌換承諾，香港金融管理局於7.85港元／美元的匯率下，買入港幣並賣出美元，導致聯繫匯率制度設計下的總結餘下降。港幣跨行拆息率在較長期限保持大致穩定，而短期利率則普遍上升。零售端方面，幾家零售銀行於10月底跟隨美聯儲降息，將最佳貸款利率下調12.5個基點。就貨幣總量而言，2019年銀行貸款總額增加6.7%，高於2018年的4.4%，整年存款亦增長2.9%。\n\n# 通脹\n\n剔除政府一次性紓困措施的影響，2019年的核心通脹率微升至3.0%，高於2018年的2.6%。通脹溫和上升主要由於從五月開始供應受阻，導致豬肉價格高企（圖2）。除基本食品外，全年物價壓力保持適中。特別是消費者物價通脹中的住屋組成項在私人物業租金早前調整後亦出現放緩。更廣義而言，名義工資和商業租金的增長溫和，加上經濟放緩，保持了本地企業成本的平衡。外部方面，隨著全球經濟放緩及主要進口來源國的通脹降低，進口物價通脹有所緩和。\n\n# 勞動市場\n\n2019年上半年勞動市場基本保持韌性，但下半年逐漸承受較大壓力（圖3）。在前兩個季度就業率保持在2.8%的多年最低水平後，季調失業率於第三季度升至2.9%，到第四季度則為3.3%，而涉及消費及旅遊相關行業的失業率尤為顯著提升，部分由於社會事件影響。整體勞動需求亦在年底明顯萎縮，總就業人數及私營部門空缺數目均下跌。零售、住宿及餐飲行業，以及進出口貿易與建築行業的需求下跌尤為明顯。在供應方面，勞動參與率有所降低，部分是受經濟衰退的循環影響。隨著勞動市場壓力增加，名義工資及收入增長顯示放緩跡象。\n\n# 證券市場\n\n2019年本地股市波動劇烈。年初四個月，恆生指數一度反彈，但在五月由於市場擔憂美中貿易緊張局勢再度升級而大幅下跌（圖4）。隨後六月份，主要中央銀行傳達更為寬鬆的貨幣立場，股價回升，但隨著全球經濟增長放緩及本地社會事件，壓力再度升高。年底前，隨著美中就第一階段貿易協議的公布，股價重新獲得部分上升動能，恆生指數全年收於28,190點，全年漲幅為9.1%。同期，日均成交額較去年同期下降約19%。2019年，通過首次公開募股籌得的資金達3142億港元，擴大了股權融資。香港連續第二年在全球首次公開募股籌資金額排名第一。\n\n# 地產市場\n\n2019年前五個月，住宅地產市場表現強勁反彈，但其後漸趨疲弱。年初因對美中貿易緊張局勢短暫擔憂緩解，市場情緒曾一度改善，但之後隨著緊張局勢再度升級、社會事件持續及經濟形勢轉差，市場情緒轉差。整體房價由五月的峰值到十二月跌了約5%，但由於前五個月反彈10%，全年仍錄得5%的增長（圖4）。2019年成交量較去年增加4%，達59,797宗，反映年初交易活躍。房屋負擔能力仍然緊張，房價與收入比率及收入負擔比率分別高達17.9和80.9，遠高於長期平均水平。為協助有即時置業需求的買家，香港按揭證券有限公司（HKMC）於十月中調高完成住宅物業的抵押貸款額度上限定額。另一方面，非住宅物產市場則面臨更大下行壓力，零售商業物業的價格及租金自2008年金融危機以來出現最大跌幅。\n\n# 經濟展望\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n預計2020年香港經濟將面臨嚴峻挑戰，尤其是新型冠狀病毒疫情帶來的中短期風險較大。零售、住宿、餐飲、旅遊和交通等行業，尚未從社會事件引起的中斷中完全復甦，將受到雙重打擊。不過，2020/21財政預算案中推出的逆周期財政措施，包括一次性現金派發及新款SFGS低息貼息貸款（由政府100%擔保）預計能為經濟提供部分支援，尤其是家庭及中小企。在2020年3月16日，香港金融管理局再次將銀行的逆周期資本緩衝比率由2.0%下調至1.0%，使銀行能更有彈性地支援本地經濟，尤其是受到疫情短期衝擊較大的行業和個人。按GDP組成分析，私人消費和投資預計仍會疲弱，因消費者和企業信心脆弱。政府消費則會對經濟增長作出一定貢獻，但公共投資預計將較為遲緩，因部分重大基建項目已基本完成。在外部方面，美中“第一階段”貿易協議短期內對本地經濟略為利好，但由於全球經濟增長放緩及貿易流動受阻，香港對外貿易表現仍將受到拖累。特別是疫情可能導致區域供應鏈斷裂和跨境經濟活動放慢，例如旅遊，從而抑制香港出口。政府預測2020年實質GDP增長介於-1.5%至0.5%，而國際組織和私營分析機構的預測則平均約為-3.3%。\n\n# 通脹與勞動市場\n\n由於經濟低迷、私人住宅租金調整以及進口通脹温和，2020年通脹壓力預計會有所緩和。市場普遍預測2020年整體通脹率約為1.8%，政府則預計整體和核心通脹率分別為1.7%和2.5%。在勞動市場方面，受經濟前景轉差及疫情影響，失業率短期內可能進一步上升，私營分析機構預計2020年約升至4.0%。\n\n# 不確定性與風險\n\n2020年經濟前景低迷，受多種不確定性和風險影響，包括全球經濟放緩、美中貿易關係、內地經濟表現、社會事件持續及新冠疫情延長等。特別是疫情持續時間較長，或引發全球經濟更明顯放緩及資產重新定價，宏觀經濟條件惡化及金融收緊將進一步對本地實體活動造成下行壓力。然而，主要中央銀行採取更大力度的貨幣寬鬆政策，或能對抗疫情帶來的負面經濟影響提供緩衝。\n\n# 銀行業表現\n\n儘管面對全球經濟放緩、美中貿易緊張和本地社會事件，2019年香港銀行業仍展現韌性。資產負債表趨勢穩定，貸款和存款均適度增長。資本和流動性保持堅實，資產質素良好。銀行業績持續盈利，平均資產報酬率穩定。"}
{"en": "# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate and money markets functioned in a smooth and orderly manner in 2019. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained stable throughout the year and strengthened to the strong side of the Convertibility Zone towards the end of the year. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, the Linked Exchange Rate System has shown its resilience to shocks time after time.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability. This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n\n- Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks\n\n- Government-issued notes and coins in circulation the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of the clearing account balances of banks kept with the HKMA\n\n- Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs). When the demand for Hong Kong dollars is greater than the supply and the market exchange rate strengthens to the strong-side CU of HK$7.75 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to sell Hong Kong dollars to banks for US dollars upon request. The Aggregate Balance will then expand to push down Hong Kong dollar interest rates, creating monetary conditions that move the Hong Kong dollar away from the strong-side limit to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if the supply of Hong Kong dollars is greater than demand and the market exchange rate weakens to the weak-side CU of HK$7.85 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to buy Hong Kong dollars from banks upon request. The Aggregate Balance will then contract to drive Hong Kong dollar interest rates up, pushing the Hong Kong dollar away from the weak-side limit to stay within the Convertibility Zone.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2019\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nDespite uncertainties in the external environment and a slowdown in the domestic economy, the Hong Kong dollar remained stable and traded in a smooth and orderly manner in 2019. In the beginning of the year, the widening negative Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads attracted carry trade activities of selling Hong Kong dollars for US dollars, pushing the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate towards the weak-side CU of 7.85 (Chart 1). As the weakening of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate continued, the weak-side CU was eventually triggered eight times in March. Thereafter, the Hong Kong dollar continued to stay near the weak-side CU rate of 7.85. Since late May, the strong Hong Kong dollar demand arising from sizeable initial public offering (IPO) activities, corporates’ demand for dividend payment and the half-year closing had led the Hong Kong dollar to strengthen. While the Hong Kong dollar drifted lower after the half-year mark, it regained momentum from late October and stayed in the strong side of the Convertibility Zone towards the end of the year. This reflected partly equity-related demand including IPOs, and partly the unwinding of short Hong Kong dollar positions due to tightened liquidity near the year end. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market functioned normally throughout 2019.\n\nDue to the triggering of the weak-side CU, the total of the Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding EFBNs declined from HK$1,136.2 billion at the end of 2018 to HK$1,133.0 billion at the end of 2019 (Chart 2). During the year, the HKMA purchased a total of HK$22.1 billion at the request of banks at the weak-side CU of 7.85 in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), leading to a contraction of the Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) from HK$76.4 billion at the end of 2018 to HK$54.3 billion at the end of 2019. The outstanding EFBNs increased slightly from HK$1,059.8 billion to HK$1,078.7 billion during the year, reflecting the issuance of EFBNs to absorb EFBNs’ interest payments according to the established practice. The Monetary Base as a whole remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves. Total Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and Notes at HK$1,133 billion at end-2019.\n\n# Money market\n\nDuring 2019, the Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained largely steady at the longer end, while short-term rates broadly picked up (Chart 3). Short-term rates also experienced more fluctuations driven by IpO-related funding demand and seasonal liquidity needs. The reduction in the Aggregate Balance since April 2018 may have led to a higher sensitivity of the Hong Kong dollar interbank rates to changes in the supply and demand of Hong Kong dollar funding in the local market.\n\nThe Base Rate was adjusted downwards on 1 August, 19 September and 31 October by a total of 75 basis points, from 2.75% at the end of 2018 to 2.00% in early November, as the target range for the US federal funds rate moved downward three times by a total of 75 basis points from 2.25–2.50% to 1.50–1.75% during the year. On 18–26 November and 19–31 December, the Base Rate was set higher than 2.00%, reflecting a marked upward trend of the overnight and one-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs) in the last two months of the year. As such, the Base Rate closed at 2.49% at the end of 2019. The adjustment of the Base Rate was in accordance with the revised formula announced on 26 March 2009, which sets the Base Rate at either 50 basis points above the lower bound of the prevailing target range for the US federal funds rate or the average of the five-day moving averages of the overnight and one-month HIBORs, whichever is the higher. On the retail front, several retail banks lowered their Best Lending Rates by 12.5 basis points following the decrease in the target range for the US federal funds rate in late October.\n\nThe discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points widened during the first two months, broadly tracking the movements of the Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads, with the 12-month Hong Kong dollar forward points reaching about -708 pips in mid-February (Chart 4). Thereafter, along with the narrowing of the negative Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads, the discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points narrowed gradually and turned to premiums towards the end of the year. Overall, Hong Kong’s money markets operated in an orderly manner. Discount Window borrowing decreased to HK$38.3 billion in 2019 from HK$40.2 billion in 2018.\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nThe LERS has contributed significantly to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability for more than three decades and has shown its resilience in multiple regional and global financial crises. Against the backdrop of social incidents happening during the year, a number of unfounded rumours casting doubt on the LERS and financial stability of Hong Kong circulated in the social media. The HKMA acted promptly and vigorously to rebut the rumours and reassure the public through the use of both traditional and social media, reiterating that the LERS would remain in place and Hong Kong would not impose foreign exchange or capital controls. In addition, the HKMA issued a number of articles to help the public understand the LERS operation, the flow of funds and the interest rate outlook. These efforts were effective in maintaining public confidence in the LERS, as evidenced by the orderly functioning of the markets throughout the year. The Government is also firmly committed to the LERS. public confidence in the Government’s commitment and the use of the Hong Kong dollar as a means of payment and storage of value were further reinforced by the stability in the foreign exchange and money markets. In its 2019 Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund reaffirmed its long-standing support for the LERS as an anchor of Hong Kong’s financial stability, and commented that the LERS remained the appropriate exchange rate arrangement for Hong Kong underpinned by Hong Kong’s transparent rules, ample fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy, and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nA robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS. Hong Kong’s banking system is highly liquid and sound, with liquidity positions and capitalisation being well above the minimum international standards. To ensure the resilience of the banking sector, the HKMA has been closely monitoring banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and has maintained its supervisory efforts on corporate, propertyrelated and Mainland-related lending. With a smaller Aggregate Balance relative to previous years, banks have in general strengthened their liquidity management arrangements and have been more proactive in managing their day-to-day funding positions. Furthermore, the HKMA has maintained close dialogue with banks to ensure smooth recycling of liquidity in the market, especially ahead of and during the subscription periods of large IPOs. No settlement gridlocks were noted during the year, with the Discount Window continuing to function effectively and efficiently.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) moved within a range of 109.9–112.1% during 2019, without touching the Upper or Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 111.2% on 31 December (Chart 5). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. In the event of abrupt shocks, the sizeable amount of financial resources of the Exchange Fund, together with Hong Kong’s robust banking system, will provide powerful support to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\n# Other activities\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong. In 2019, the CBC considered issues including an event study on the LERS operations, the relationship between the Aggregate Balance and interest rates in Hong Kong, an improved and more flexible approach to options markets’ views about the LERS, and the impact of future IPOs on HIBORs. Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Research\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMR), formerly the Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research, pursues research studies on topics in monetary policy, banking and finance that are policy relevant. This is reflected in the wide array of topics explored by HKIMR researchers and overseas visitors and in its conferences and events. The HKIMR collaborates with major central banks and policy institutions to jointly organise policy-focused conferences. Its research visiting programmes support research projects on policy issues that are of importance to the HKMA, Hong Kong and the region.\n\nIn 2019, the HKIMR hosted 14 research scholars, published 17 working papers, and held 11 public seminars covering a broad range of economic, monetary and financial issues. It also organised three international conferences:\n\n- The Tenth Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy, titled “China’s Financial Reforms and Economic Transformation”, was held on 10–11 January in Hong Kong, organised jointly by the HKIMR, the Financial Research Institute of the people’s Bank of China and the Research Institute of Finance of the Development Research Centre of the State Council. The conference provided a world-class forum for economic experts from central banks, international institutions, academia and the financial industry to discuss issues related to the risks that Mainland’s financial sector faced in the light of changes introduced by financial reforms and Mainland’s economic development.\n", "zh": "# 貨幣穩定\n\n香港元匯率及貨幣市場在2019年平穩有序地運作。香港元匯率全年保持穩定，年底前升向可兌換區的強側。作為香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石，聯繫匯率制度已多次展現其抗震能力。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的主要目標是貨幣穩定。這被定義為香港貨幣在外匯市場中對美元匯率保持在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的區間內，外部匯率穩定。貨幣系統的結構特點包括貨幣局安排，要求貨幣基礎至少由在匯豐基金持有的美元儲備100%支持，以及貨幣基礎的變動必須由相應的美元儲備變動完全匹配。\n\n貨幣基礎（表一）包括：\n\n- 債券證明，全額支持由三家紙幣發行銀行發行的紙幣\n\n- 政府發行的流通鈔票和硬幣、及銀行結算帳戶餘額匯總，即香港金融管理局（HKMA）持有的結算帳戶餘額\n\n- 由HKMA代表政府發行的匯豐基金票據\n\n香港元匯率的穩定通過自動利率調整機制及HKMA對兌換作業承諾（兌換承諾）來維持。當香港元需求高於供應，且市場匯率升至強側兌換承諾的HK$7.75兌1美元時，HKMA準備應需求向銀行出售美元換取港元。此時，結算餘額擴大，降低利率，並使貨幣條件向區間內移動；反之，當供應高於需求，且匯率跌至弱側兌換承諾HK$7.85兌1美元時，HKMA準備從銀行買入港元，結算餘額縮減，推高利率，使貨幣向區間內移動。\n\n# 2019年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n儘管外部環境存在不確定性，本地經濟放緩，香港元仍在2019年保持穩定，運作平穩有序。年初，負面香港元-美元利差擴大，吸引採取套息交易，導致港元兌美元匯率走向弱側兌換承諾的HK$7.85（圖1）。隨著港元匯率持續走弱，弱側兌換承諾在三月被觸發八次。此後，港元持續接近HK$7.85的弱側兌換承諾匯率。自五月底以來，因IPO活動、企業股息支付需求及半年結業務，港元需求增加，匯率曾升值。半年結後，港元略有走低，從十月下旬開始反彈，年底則回到強側兌換區，反映部分股市需求（包括IPO）及年底收緊流動性所致短期空倉的解套。整體而言，2019年港元貨幣市場運作正常。\n\n由於觸發了弱側兌換承諾，結算餘額（折現窗口前）和未償還EFBNs合計從2018年末的1,136.2億港元下降至2019年末的1,133.0億港元（圖2）。年內，HKMA應銀行請求，以HK$22.1億在弱側兌換承諾HK$7.85時出售港元，導致貨幣基礎從2018年末的76.4億港元縮減至54.3億港元。年內，EFBNs略微增加，從1059.8億港元增至1078.7億港元，反映根據慣例發行EFBNs以支付利息。整體貨幣基礎依然由外匯儲備全面支持。2019年年末，總結算餘額（折現窗口前）及匯豐基金票據合計1,133億港元。\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n2019年，港元銀行間利率在長期利率層面基本保持穩定，而短期利率則較為波動（圖3）。短期利率的波動受到IPO融資需求及季節性流動性需要的影響。自2018年4月起，貨幣基礎的縮減可能使港元銀行間利率對供需變化的敏感度提高。\n\n8月1日、9月19日及10月31日，基準利率合共下調75個基點，由2018年末的2.75%降至11月初的2.00%，期間美國聯邦基金利率目標區間已三次下調75個基點，從2.25–2.50%調整至1.50–1.75%。11月18–26日及12月19–31日，基準利率調高，反映年底近兩個月，港元隔夜拆息及一個月拆息（HIBOR）呈明顯上升趨勢，最終截止2019年末，基準利率定於2.49%。利率調整遵循2009年3月26日公布的修訂公式，即基準利率設於較高值：要麼是美元聯邦基金利率目標區間下限上方50個基點，要麼是隔夜及一個月HIBOR的五日移動平均值的平均值，以較高者為準。零售銀行亦於十月底美國利率調整後，調低主要貸款利率12.5個基點。\n\n港元遠期點數貼現在年初兩個月內擴大，追蹤港元-美元利差變動，2月中旬12個月遠期點約為-708點（圖4）。隨著利差縮小，遠期點數貼現逐步縮窄，年底轉為溢價。整體而言，港元貨幣市場運作有序，折現窗口借款由2018年的402億港元降至383億港元。\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n聯繫匯率制度長期為香港的貨幣與金融穩定作出巨大的貢獻，並在多次區域及全球金融危機中展現韌性。在年內社會事件背景下，社交媒體中流傳一些毫無根據、質疑制度及香港金融穩定的傳言。香港金融管理局迅速、積極反駁傳言，並利用傳統媒體與社交媒體向公眾重申聯繫匯率制度將繼續維持，香港亦不會實施外匯或資本管制。同時，HKMA發布多篇文章，幫助公眾了解制度運作、資金流向及利率前景。這些舉措有效維持了公眾信心，市場運作有序。政府亦堅定支持聯繫匯率制度，外匯及貨幣市場的穩定進一步增強了公眾對政府承諾與港元作為支付和儲存手段的信心。國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）在其2019年與香港的第十四次公告中再次肯定了其長期支持聯繫匯率制度，並認為該制度仍是香港的合適匯率安排，得以依托香港透明的規則、充足的財政與外匯儲備、強大的金融監管、靈活的經濟體系及審慎的財政框架。\n\n穩健的銀行體系對制度的正常運作至關重要。香港銀行系統高度流動及穩健，流動性水平及資本充足率遠高於國際最低標準。為確保銀行業韌性，HKMA密切監察銀行信用、流動性及利率風險管理與壓力測試結果，並持續督導企業、房地產及內地相關放貸情況。在貨幣基礎較以往較少的情況下，銀行普遍強化流動性管理，且更積極管理日常融資狀況。此外，HKMA與銀行保持密切對話，確保在大型IPO認購期及前後市場流動性順暢循環。年內未出現結算受阻情況，折現窗口繼續有效運作。\n\n為提升貨幣局賬戶透明度，自1998年10月起，已將部分匯豐基金資產用於支持貨幣基礎。2019年，匯豐基金的支持比例（即支持資產除以貨幣基礎）在109.9%至112.1%之間波動，未觸及上下觸發水平。至12月31日，支持比例為111.2%（圖5）。在聯繫匯率制度下，儘管部分匯豐基金資產被指定用於支持支持組合，所有匯豐基金資產均可用以支撐港元匯率。遇到突發震盪時，匯豐基金龐大的資金資源及香港銀行體系的韌性將為港元貨幣與金融穩定提供強大支撐。\n\n# 其他活動\n\n香港金融管理局的貨幣局子委員會（CBC）監察並審議香港貨幣金融穩定相關事宜。2019年，CBC討論了有關聯繫匯率制度運作的事件研究、結算餘額與利率的關係、期權市場看法的改進與靈活性，以及未來IPO對HIBOR的影響。這些討論記錄與貨幣局運作報告均於HKMA網站公布。\n\n# 研究\n\n香港金融管理學院（HKIMR），前稱香港貨幣研究所，專注於貨幣政策、銀行與金融相關的政策研究。透過HKIMR研究人員及海外訪客的調研範疇，以及會議和活動，展現其研究多樣性。HKIMR與中央銀行及政策機構合作，共同舉辦政策導向的研討會。其訪問研究計劃支持與HKMA、香港及區域經濟政策相關的重要研究專案。\n\n2019年，HKIMR接待了14位研究學者，出版17篇研究論文，舉辦了11場公共研討會，涵蓋經濟、貨幣與金融廣泛議題。同期，該院還組織了三場國際會議：\n\n- 第十屆「中國經濟國際研討會」，題為“中國金融改革與經濟轉型”，於1月10日至11日在香港舉行，由HKIMR、中國人民銀行金融研究所及國務院發展研究中心金融研究所聯合主辦。會議為中央銀行、國際機構、學術界及金融界的專家提供一個討論中國金融改革與經濟變革風險的國際平臺，充分展現其全球影響力。"}
{"en": "# Banking Stability\n\nThe banking sector in Hong Kong remained sound and stable in 2019, notwithstanding the headwinds brought by the weakening global and local economies. Thanks to the concerted efforts of the industry, the banking sector continued to operate normally amidst the social events. Efforts were taken to ensure that inconvenience caused to the public was kept to a minimum. During the year, the HKMA focused its supervision on the credit and liquidity risk management of authorized institutions. In view of escalating cyber threats and the industry’s growing dependency on technology, the HKMA stepped up the supervision of authorized institutions’ technology risk management. On conduct supervision, the HKMA streamlined its investor protection measures to enhance customer experience while according protection to customers. We also enhanced consumer protection in digital financial services and continued to promote a customer-centric corporate culture.\n\nOn anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT), 2019 marked the conclusion of the Financial Action Task Force’s Fourth Round Mutual Evaluation of Hong Kong’s AML/CFT regime, which was assessed as compliant and effective overall, and earned positive recognition particularly for the banking sector’s good understanding of risks and the HKMA’s risk-based supervisory work in AML/CFT. The HKMA has continued to participate in the public-private partnership for intelligence sharing on fraud and money laundering, and its active support for the adoption of AML/CFT regulatory technology in the banking sector.\n\nOn banking development, the HKMA granted banking licences to eight virtual banks in 2019 and announced a three-phased approach to facilitate the development of green and sustainable banking in Hong Kong. The HKMA has been in close collaboration with the banking industry to optimise supervisory policies and processes and to carry out capacity-building initiatives that facilitate talent development.\n\nMeanwhile, substantial progress was made on the local implementation of international supervisory standards, including capital adequacy standards, disclosure standards, liquidity standards and large exposure standards. The HKMA also continued its work to ensure there would be a credible resolution regime for authorized institutions, including implementing rules on loss-absorbing capacity requirements to enhance the resolvability of authorized institutions.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this objective is contingent upon the financial system being highly resilient and capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their businesses and, in extremis, by failing in a disorderly manner. The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring banks are resilient to shocks and are able to recover their positions in response to crises, ultimately helping to prevent failures. The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks in Hong Kong. It is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs). The Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs).\n\nHowever, the Monetary Authority cannot ensure, nor is the Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework designed to ensure, a zero-risk financial system. Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that, in the event of an AI becoming non-viable, its failure can be managed in an orderly manner. To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong has been established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs. To ensure that the resolution regime in Hong Kong is operational, it is important to lay down resolution legislation and policy standards, undertake resolution planning to remove impediments to AIs’ resolvability and develop the HKMA’s operational capability to resolve a failing AI. In order to carry out these tasks effectively, the HKMA adopts an internationally harmonised and co-ordinated approach.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2019\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nIn 2019, 196 off-site reviews were conducted covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL rating assessment, corporate governance, risk management and fintech strategies. As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance, 26 meetings were held with the boards of directors or board-level committees of AIs. Furthermore, 32 tripartite meetings were held among the HKMA, the AIs and their external auditors.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA conducts regular on-site examinations supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk. A total of 405 on-site examinations and thematic reviews were conducted during the year. Credit risk management remained a key focus of these examinations and reviews. Another major focus was in technology risk and operational risk management. The HKMA also increased the number of on-site examinations and thematic reviews targeted at liquidity and market risk management as well as the implementation of the Basel capital adequacy framework. At the same time, specialist teams performed on-site examinations and thematic reviews of AIs’ activities in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses.\n\nTable 1 contains an overall summary of the HKMA’s supervisory activities in 2019.\n\n# Supervision of credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nBank lending increased moderately in 2019. Total loans grew by 6.7%, compared with 4.4% in 2018. As shown in Table 2, loans for use in Hong Kong and loans for use outside Hong Kong registered growth of 7.7% and 5.8% respectively.\n\nMainland-related lending grew by 7.4% to HK$4,564 billion as at the end of 2019 (Table 3).\n\nThe asset quality of AIs remained healthy. Retail banks’ classified loan ratio edged down from 0.51% at the end of 2018 to 0.48% at the end of 2019, well below the long-run historical average of 2% since 2000. For the banking industry as a whole, the classified loan ratio increased slightly from 0.55% to 0.57%. Specifically in terms of Mainland-related lending, retail banks’ classified loan ratio increased from 0.63% in 2018 to 0.79% in 2019, which was still low by historical standard. For the banking industry as a whole, the ratio increased to 0.75% from 0.55% a year ago.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA devoted increased supervisory efforts in ensuring that AIs continued to adopt prudent credit risk management standards amid the uncertain economic environment. Solvency stress tests were enhanced to incorporate more comprehensive risk coverage and more severe stress assumptions. The results of the enhanced stress tests continued to indicate that banks generally had sufficient capital buffers to withstand extreme shocks. Targeted and thematic examinations were conducted to evaluate the credit risk management practices of AIs in different areas, such as lending to corporates engaged in high-risk business, complex financing arrangements, and collateralised lending to private banking and wealth management customers. Recognising that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) would more likely face greater challenges during economic downturns, the HKMA established a Banking Sector SME Lending Co-ordination Mechanism in October, with a view to encouraging banks to continue to support SMEs’ financing needs to the extent permitted by prudent risk management principles.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nThe resilience of the Hong Kong banking sector to withstand a downturn in the property market has been strengthened significantly by the eight rounds of countercyclical macro-prudential measures introduced by the HKMA since 2009. The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of new residential mortgage loans fell to 53% in December 2019 from 64% in September 2009, before the countercyclical measures were first introduced. The average debt servicing ratio (DSR) of new mortgages also decreased to 36% in December 2019 from 41% in August 2010, when a cap on DSR was first applied (Chart 1).\n\n# Supervision of operational and technology risk\n\nThe HKMA adopts a three-phased approach to implement the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework under the Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative (CFI). phase One assessment, involving all the major banks, was completed in 2018. The remaining AIs covered in the second and third phases have substantially completed the assessment as scheduled. The HKMA has also embarked on a comprehensive review of the CFI to fine-tune the initiative given the experience gained in the past years.\n\nIn October, the HKMA issued a revised Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module on “Risk Management of E-banking”. The revision sought to provide the industry with greater flexibility to meet changing customer expectations on electronic banking services. The HKMA also published a set of high-level principles on the use of artificial intelligence in order to provide guidance for the industry.\n\nSince the social events started in June, the HKMA have maintained close dialogue with the industry to monitor the impact on banking operations and services. Banks were requested to replenish automated teller machines (ATMs) more frequently and repair vandalised facilities as soon as practicable. The HKMA also acted quickly to refute malicious rumours that sought to undermine the public’s confidence in the banking system. Thanks to concerted efforts by the banking industry, the affected bank branches and facilities quickly resumed normal services and the inconvenience caused to the public was kept to a minimum. In view of the rising operational risk posed by the social events, banks were asked to take additional precautionary measures to strengthen their operational resilience.\n\n# Supervision of liquidity and market risk management\n\nDuring the year, a round of thematic reviews was conducted to assess AIs’ capability to cope with liquidity shocks. The reviews focused on the robustness of AIs’ liquidity stress testing programmes and contingency funding management. The HKMA also assessed AIs’ compliance with the regulatory requirements on the calculation of the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) to ensure the prudence and accuracy of the inputs used for the calculation.\n\nAs algorithmic trading gained popularity in the banking industry, the HKMA conducted a round of thematic reviews to evaluate AIs’ risk management practices in this area. Considering that the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) might cease to be published after end-2021, the HKMA reminded AIs to get prepared for the transition to alternative reference rates and conducted a survey to monitor their preparedness for the transition.\n\n# Combating money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF)\n\nThe HKMA carries out risk-based supervision of AIs’ AML/CFT systems. During the year, 18 on-site examinations and 61 off-site reviews were conducted, including targeted thematic reviews on private banking and the governance of the use of new technology. The HKMA shared with the industry the observations and best practices drawn from a thematic review of AIs’ application of risk-based AML/CFT controls for SMEs, in order to assist AIs to adopt appropriate account opening processes and delivery of services for SMEs.\n\n# Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Mutual Evaluation (ME) Report on Hong Kong\n\nA highlight of 2019 for the HKMA and Hong Kong’s overall AML/CFT regime was the publication of the FATF ME Report on Hong Kong in September. The Report represents one of the best overall results to date in the FATF’s fourth-round ME of its member jurisdictions. Hong Kong scored six “Substantial” ratings out of 11 “Immediate Outcomes” in the assessment of the effectiveness of its AML/CFT regime, and a high mark for the technical compliance aspect of the ME.\n\nThe Report favourably assessed the HKMA’s risk-based approach to AML/CFT supervision, noting that the HKMA had a good understanding of ML/TF risks in the banking sector and a reasonable understanding of risks in the stored value facility (SVF) sector. The Report also positively assessed the collective AML/CFT efforts of the banking sector, such as the increased use of data analytics by larger AIs, the fact that the great majority of suspicious transaction reports were filed by AIs, and the sector’s proactive participation in the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce (FMLIT).\n\nThe Report recommended several areas for improvement, including the understanding of some higher-risk areas, such as foreign corruption and tax crimes, and developing sectors such as SVFs. Work has already started to address these recommendations; the HKMA published an updated ML/TF Risk Assessment on the SVF sector in July and has commenced thematic on-site examinations on private banking and the governance of the use of new technology.\n", "zh": "# 金融穩定性\n\n儘管受到全球及本地經濟趨弱帶來的阻力，香港金融管理局於2019年保持銀行業穩健與穩定。多虧行業的共同努力，銀行業在社會事件中仍能正常運作。有關當局採取措施，將對公眾造成的不便減至最低。在今年中，金管局將監管重點放在授權機構的信貸及流動性風險管理上。鑑於網絡威脅不斷升級及行業對科技的依賴日益增長，金管局加強了對授權機構科技風險管理的監督。在操守監管方面，金管局精簡了投資者保障措施，以提升客戶體驗，同時保障客戶權益。亦進一步加強了數碼金融服務的消費者保障，並持續推動以客戶為本的企業文化。\n\n在反洗錢及反恐融資（AML/CFT）方面，2019年標誌著金融行動特別工作組（FATF）對香港反洗錢/反恐融資制度的第四輪相互評估已圓滿結束，整體評為合規及有效，並在銀行業對風險的良好認識及金管局的風險為本監管工作方面獲得積極認可。金管局持續參與公私合夥進行有關詐騙及洗錢的情報分享，並積極支持在銀行業推行AML/CFT的監管科技。\n\n在銀行發展方面，2019年金管局向八家虛擬銀行發放銀行牌照，並宣布採用三階段策略促進香港綠色及可持續銀行的發展。金管局與行業緊密合作，以優化監管政策和流程，並推行人才培育措施，促進人才發展。\n\n此外，在國際監管標準，包括資本充足率標準、披露標準、流動性標準和大額敞口標準的本地實施工作取得顯著進展。金管局亦持續努力，確保授權機構擁有可信的解決方案體系，包括實施吸收損失能力的規則，以提升授權機構的解決能力。\n\n# 目標\n\n金管局的總體目標是促進銀行系統的安全與穩定。實現此目標的前提是金融系統具有高度韌性，能提供香港經濟所需的關鍵金融服務。\n\n銀行能以其業務運作方式，甚至在極端情況下，以失序的方式，影響系統的穩定性。作為監管機構，金管局在保障金融穩定方面扮演關鍵角色，確保銀行具備應對突發事件的韌性，並能在危機中恢復原有水準，從而幫助防止失敗。金管局負責香港銀行的審慎監管，包括授權持牌銀行、有限牌照銀行及存款公司（合稱授權機構，AI），以及部分金融市場基礎設施（FMIs）的指定與監督。\n\n然而，金管局無法確保，也非香港審慎監管體系設計用以保障零風險的金融系統。相反，身為解決方案的主管機構，金管局旨在確保，若某AI變得不可行，其倒閉能用有序方式管理。為此，已在香港建立金融機構的解決方案制度，由金管局作為解決主管部門。為確保香港的解決方案制度能運作，必須制定相應的法律和政策標準，進行解決方案規劃，移除阻礙AIs解決能力的障礙，並提升金管局解決失敗AI的運營能力。為有效執行這些任務，金管局採用國際協調一致的方法。\n\n# 2019年回顧\n\n# 監管活動概覽\n\n2019年共進行196次非現場審查，內容涵蓋CAMEL評級評估、公司治理、風險管理及金融科技策略等範疇。為促進更強的風險治理，金管局與AIs董事會或委員會舉行了26次會議，並與金管局、AIs及其外部審計師進行了32次三方會議。\n\n除非外活動外，金管局亦進行定期的現場檢查，並針對高風險範疇進行專題審查。當年共完成405次現場核查及專題審查，其中信貸風險管理為重點。行業的科技風險與營運風險管理亦是重點範疇，金管局亦增加針對流動性及市場風險管理，以及巴塞爾資本框架落實的現場檢查和專題審查次數。同時，專業團隊亦對證券、投資產品、保險及強制公積金（MPF）相關業務的AIs活動進行核查。\n\n表1概述了2019年金管局的監管活動總結。\n\n# 信貸風險監管\n\n# 信貸增長與資產質量\n\n2019年銀行貸款中等程度增加。總貸款較2018年增長6.7%，較去年4.4%的增幅有所提升。根據表2，本地用途貸款及境外用途貸款分別錄得7.7%及5.8%的增長。\n\n與大陸相關的貸款截至2019年底增長7.4%，達HK$4,564億（表3）。\n\n授權機構的資產質量保持健康。零售銀行的分類貸款比率由2018年底的0.51%略降至2019年底的0.48%，遠低於2000年以來的長期歷史平均2%。整體銀行業的分類貸款比率由0.55%微升至0.57%。就大陸相關貸款而言，零售銀行的分類貸款比率由2018年的0.63%升至2019年的0.79%，仍屬較低水平，銀行業整體亦由0.55%升至0.75%。\n\n年度內，金管局加強監管力度，確保AIs在經濟前景不明下仍維持審慎的信貸風險管理標準。增強了資本充足率壓力測試，納入更全面的風險範疇及更嚴苛的壓力假設。壓力測試結果持續顯示，銀行普遍擁有充足的資本緩衝應對極端震盪。在不同範疇，如高風險行業企業貸款、複雜融資安排，及私行與財富管理客戶的抵押貸款，進行了有針對性和專題的信貸管理實踐評估。意識到中小企（SMEs）在經濟衰退時或更易面對挑戰，金管局於十月成立了銀行業中小企貸款協調機制，鼓勵銀行支持中小企融資需求，前提是嚴格遵守審慎風險管理原則。\n\n# 房屋按揭貸款\n\n自2009年以來，金管局推行的八輪逆周期宏觀審慎措施大大增強了香港銀行業抵禦樓市下行的韌性。新批住宅按揭貸款的平均貸款成數（LTV）由2009年九月的64%降至2019年十二月的53%。新按揭的平均負債服務比率（DSR）亦由2010年八月的41%降至十二月的36%（圖表1）。\n\n# 營運及科技風險監管\n\n金管局採用三階段方法推行網絡韌性評估框架（Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework，CRAF），第一階段涉及主要銀行，於2018年完成。第二及第三階段涵蓋的AIs亦已按計劃大致完成評估。金管局此外展開了對CRAF的全面檢討，以根據過去經驗調整措施。\n\n十月，金管局修訂了關於「電子銀行風險管理」的監管政策手冊（SPM）模組，提升行業在電子銀行服務方面的彈性。亦發布了一套人工智能應用的高層原則，為行業提供指引。\n\n自六月社會事件爆發以來，金管局與行業保持緊密對話，監控事件對銀行運作與服務的影響。銀行被要求更頻繁加添自動櫃員機（ATM）存款金額，並盡快修復破壞的設施。金管局快速駁斥了試圖破壞公眾信心的惡意謠言。在行業共同努力下，受影響的分行和設施迅速恢復正常服務，對公眾的不便減至最低。鑑於社會事件帶來的運作風險增加，銀行亦被要求採取額外預防措施，加強營運韌性。\n\n# 流動性及市場風險管理監管\n\n年度內進行了一輪專題審查，評估AIs應對流動性震盪的能力，重點在於流動性壓力測試及應急資金管理。金管局亦評估AIs遵守流動性覆蓋率（LCR）計算規定的合規性，以確保計算的保守性與準確性。\n\n隨著銀行業對算法交易的興趣增加，金管局亦進行專題審查，評估AIs在此範疇的風險管理實踐。鑑於倫敦銀行間拆借利率（LIBOR）可能於2021年底停止發布，金管局提醒AIs提前準備轉用替代基準利率，並進行調查以監測其準備情況。\n\n# 打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集（ML/TF）\n\n金管局採取風險為本監管模式，對AIs的反洗錢／反恐融資系統進行監督。年內共進行18次現場核查，61次非現場審查，包括針對私行及新技術治理的專題審查。金管局分享對AIs風險管理措施的觀察與最佳實踐，特別是針對中小企的風險管理，協助其完善客戶開戶流程與服務。\n\n# 金融行動特別工作組（FATF）對香港的相互評估（ME）報告\n\n2019年的亮點之一為2019年九月公布的FATF對香港AML/CFT制度的相互評估報告。該報告展現香港在FATF第四輪評估中的整體表現極佳，是至今最佳的成績之一。評估顯示，香港在“立即成果”11項中獲得六項“實質”評級，並在技術合規方面獲得高分。\n\n該報告肯定了金管局以風險為本的AML/CFT監管方式，認為金管局對銀行業的ML/TF風險有良好了解，並對存款額度設施（SVF）行業的風險有合理認識。亦正面評價銀行業在AML/CFT方面的合作努力，例如較大AIs增加數據分析應用、絕大多數可疑交易報告由AIs提交，以及積極參與反詐騙及洗錢情報工作組（FMLIT）。\n\n報告提出數個改進建議，包括增強對某些高風險領域的理解，如跨國貪污及稅務犯罪，並促進SVF行業的發展。為回應建議，金管局於七月公布了最新的ML/TF風險評估報告，並開始就私行業務及新技術应用進行專題現場審查。"}
{"en": "# International Financial Centre\n\nHong Kong is a globally competitive international financial centre. The implementation of the Smart Banking initiatives has been in good progress to further develop Hong Kong as a fintech hub. Capitalising on opportunities arising from the opening up of the Mainland financial markets, much headway has been made to promote financial collaboration in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, especially in easing Hong Kong residents’ cross-border access to financial and banking services in the Area.\n\nAt the same time, much effort has been made to open up new opportunities to further strengthen the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, including infrastructure investment and financing, green finance and private equity funds. The Hong Kong Academy of Finance was set up to enhance Hong Kong’s soft power in a sustainable manner.\n\nIn the central banking and regulatory community, the HKMA plays a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees, which is a clear recognition of Hong Kong’s expertise and commitment to international work.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nTo strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia, the HKMA puts great effort into implementing the seven Smart Banking initiatives that were announced in September 2017, with an aim to facilitate the development and use of fintech in the banking and payment industries. The key progress of these initiatives during the year included:\n\n- expanding the adoption of the Faster Payment System (FPS);\n- facilitating the implementation of phases I and II of the Open Application programming Interface (Open API) Framework in the banking sector;\n- further enhancing fintech research and talent\ndevelopment;\n- stepping up cross-border collaboration in fintech; granting eight virtual bank licences;\n- facilitating the industry’s increasing use of Fintech Supervisory Sandbox (FSS) 2.0 for launching fintech initiatives; and\n- further facilitating the adoption of regulatory technology (Regtech) through the Banking Made Easy initiative.\n\nThe HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO), together with the banking departments of the HKMA, plays a pivotal role in driving the implementation of these initiatives.\n\nHong Kong plays an indispensable role in facilitating international investors’ allocation of renminbi assets, with its unparalleled access to the onshore markets through the Stock Connect and Bond Connect schemes. This was evident by the tripling of the number of registered investors and daily turnover under Bond Connect over the past year. Further enhancements have been introduced to both Bond Connect and Stock Connect, providing more convenience and flexibility for international investors to invest in onshore securities in the Mainland. The HKMA also worked closely with Mainland authorities to explore and implement a series of financial facilitation measures for Hong Kong residents to access financial and banking services across the border in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), including a prospective, two-way wealth management connect scheme. Hong Kong maintains a firm foothold as the global hub for offshore renminbi business. According to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Triennial Survey of Foreign Exchange (FX) and Derivatives Market Turnover, Hong Kong continued to be the largest offshore renminbi FX centre in the world.\n\nContinuous efforts were put into opening up new opportunities to further enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. To promote the development of the fund business in Hong Kong, the HKMA worked closely with the Government and industry to provide a more favourable tax and regulatory environment for fund formation. A number of large-scale events and targeted outreach activities were organised to promote Hong Kong as a hub for green finance, infrastructure investment and financing and corporate treasury centres (CTCs). In an effort to enhance Hong Kong’s soft power, the Hong Kong Academy of Finance (AoF) was set up in June to develop financial leadership and promote research collaboration.\n\nIn the central banking and regulatory community, the HKMA plays a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees. The HKMA chaired the Standing Committee on Supervisory and Regulatory Cooperation (SRC) of the Financial Stability Board (FSB) until 31 August 2019. Currently, the HKMA is chairing the Supervision and Implementation Group (SIG) of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), and the Working Group on Financial Markets (WGFM) established under the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP). The HKMA is also co-chairing the Non-Bank Monitoring Experts Group (NMEG) of the FSB with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure lays a solid foundation for Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre. The four interbank Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) and the Hong Kong Trade Repository (HKTR) achieved 100% system availability in 2019, beating the target of 99.95%. Through its accounts set up with the two Mainland central securities depositories, the CMU facilitates the settlement of transactions conducted under Bond Connect Northbound Trading and the holding of Mainland debt securities on behalf of relevant CMU members.\n\nThe FPS, which serves as an extension of Hong Kong dollar RTGS system to enable the public to make instant retail fund transfers and payments across different banks and stored value facilities (SVFs) on a round-the-clock basis, ran smoothly in its first year of operation. Users’ adoption of the facility had increased steadily, as manifested in the four million registrations and tripling of transaction volumes by the end of 2019. The FPS brings new opportunities to the retail payment industry and promotes fintech innovation.\n\nTo ensure the general safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA has designated and is overseeing a total of six retail payment systems (RPSs) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO). The HKMA also issued two new SVF licences in May, bringing the total number of SVF licensees to 18. SVF licensees continued to launch new products and services actively during the year to diversify customer choices and enhance user experience.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2019\n\n# Hong Kong as a Fintech Hub in Asia\n\n# Smart Banking initiatives\n\nThe seven Smart Banking initiatives were announced by the HKMA in September 2017 with the aim of helping the banking sector achieve higher standards of operation and embrace the enormous opportunities brought about by the convergence of banking and technology. During the year, considerable progress was made in implementing these initiatives and transforming the fintech ecosystem of Hong Kong.\n\n# Faster Payment System\n\nThe launch of the FPS in September 2018 was a major milestone in the financial infrastructure development of Hong Kong in the digital era. The FPS further promotes the adoption of e-payment in Hong Kong by providing efficient and convenient payment services to the general public and corporates. Since the launch of the FPS, the number of participating service providers had increased to 30 banks and 11 SVFs, with the addition of nine banks and one SVF, by the end of 2019.\n\nUsage of the FPS has also grown steadily. As of 31 December 2019, the FPS recorded four million registrations (Chart 1) and processed 44 million transactions involving an aggregate amount of HK$748.5 billion and RMB17 billion. In December 2019, average daily turnover reached 168,000 transactions worth HK$2.4 billion and RMB38 million (Chart 2), as compared with 51,000 transactions during its first full month of operation in October 2018.\n\nFaster payment System recorded: \n- 4 million registrations as of 31 December 2019\n- 44 million transactions as of 31 December 2019\n- 168,000 transactions worth HK$2.4 billion and RMB38 million of average daily turnover in December 2019\n\nThe HKMA works with the industry to extend FPS usage from person-to-person payments to bill payments and other merchant payments. For example, enhancements were made to enable merchants to use a variety of proxy identifiers and accept partial or over-payments via a QR code. A technical specification was developed to facilitate the invocation of a mobile banking or SVF e-wallet mobile application (app) from a business mobile app for FPS payment. This would greatly improve customer experience in making merchant and business payments via the FPS using mobile devices.\n\nThe HKMA also works closely with relevant Government departments to assist them in using the FPS to accept bill payments from the public. From 1 November, bills issued by the Inland Revenue Department, the Rating and Valuation Department and the Water Supplies Department were printed with an FPS QR code so that the public could scan the QR code easily with supporting mobile banking or SVF e-wallet apps to make payment. The HKMA will continue working with various Government departments and public bodies to explore other potential use cases which can make it convenient for the public to make payment via the FPS.\n\nTo raise public awareness of the FPS, the HKMA has developed a new series of education and publicity materials, such as Announcements in the public Interest for broadcast on television and radio, as well as videos and electronic banners for digital platforms. The HKMA also participated in trade fairs to promote the FPS to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and corporates. Various FPS participating banks and SVFs launched promotion campaigns and offered incentives to encourage customers to register with the FPS and to use it for fund transfer and bill payment.\n\nIn addition, the HKMA engaged a number of industry organisations and institutions to provide briefings on the FPS so as to introduce its functionalities and the potential benefits it may bring to different businesses in collecting and making payment.\n\nThe Government has adopted FPS for bill payments on taxes, rates and Government rent and water charges.\n\n# Open Application Programming Interface\n\nThe HKMA continued to facilitate the banking sector’s development and adoption of Open API in accordance with the four-phase approach of the Open API Framework. Under phase I, 20 retail banks opened up over 500 Open API endpoints in January, covering information of banking products and services. Under phase II, the banks opened up in October over 300 APIs to support applications for banking products and services.\n\n# Research and talent development\n\nOn trade finance, a proof-of-concept (PoC) study on linking up eTradeConnect and we.trade was completed in the first quarter of the year. In November, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between the subsidiaries of Hong Kong Interbank Clearing Limited and the Institute of Digital Currency of the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) to conduct a PoC study on linking up eTradeConnect and the PBoC Trade Finance platform to provide firms in both Hong Kong and Mainland China with more convenient trade finance services.\n\nOn Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), the HKMA and the Bank of Thailand embarked on a joint research project named project Inthanon-LionRock to study the application of CBDC to cross-border payments, with a view to facilitating HKD-THB payment-versus-payment (pvp) among banks in Hong Kong and Thailand.\n\nHKMA Executive Director (Financial Infrastructure), Mr Colin Pou (first from left), together with Director-General of the Institute of Digital Currency of the PBoC, Mr Mu Changchun (first from right), witness the signing ceremony of an MoU to conduct a PoC trial on linking up eTradeConnect and the PBoC Trade Finance Platform. The MoU is signed between Chief Executive Officer of the Hong Kong Trade Finance Platform Company Limited, Ms Haster Tang (second from left), and Deputy Director-General of the Institute of Digital Currency of the PBoC and Director of the Shenzhen Fintech Institute, Mr Di Gang (second from right).\n\nOn artificial intelligence (AI), the HKMA carried out a study on the application of AI technology in the Hong Kong banking industry. Key findings of an industry-wide AI survey were published in November, followed by the issuance of the full report, titled “Reshaping Banking with Artificial Intelligence”, in December.\n\nThe report “Reshaping Banking with Artificial Intelligence” is published in December.\n\nA fact sheet is published to highlight the key facts and figures derived from a survey on the use of AI in the Hong Kong banking industry.\n\nIn an effort to enlarge the fintech talent pool, the HKMA continued to run the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme 2.0 in collaboration with its strategic partners to nurture young talent at various stages of their career development. Over 220 students benefited from the programme last year.\n", "zh": "# 國際金融中心\n\n香港是一個具有全球競爭力的國際金融中心。智慧銀行措施的推行進展順利，進一步促使香港成為金融科技樞紐。香港充分利用內地金融市場開放所帶來的機遇，在粵港澳大灣區推動金融合作方面取得了不少進展，特別是在方便香港居民跨境獲取金融及銀行服務方面。\n\n同時，香港亦努力開拓新機遇，以進一步加強金融平台的競爭力，包括基建投資與融資、綠色金融及私募股權基金。香港金融管理局成立了香港金融學院，以以可持續的方式提升香港的軟實力。\n\n在中央銀行和監管界，香港金融管理局在多個區域及國際委員會中扮演領導角色，充分體現香港專業能力和對國際事務的承擔。\n\n# 概覽\n\n為了鞏固香港在亞洲的金融科技樞紐地位，香港金融管理局積極推行2017年9月宣布的七項智慧銀行措施，旨在促進金融科技在銀行和支付行業的發展與應用。今年措施的主要進展包括：\n\n- 擴展快速支付系統（FPS）的使用範圍；\n- 推動銀行業開放應用程式介面（Open API）框架第一、二階段的實施；\n- 進一步提升金融科技研究與人才培育；\n- 加強跨境金融科技合作，並授予八張虛擬銀行牌照；\n- 促進金融科技監管沙盒（FSS）2.0的運用，以啟動更多金融科技項目；\n- 進一步推動行管科技（Regtech）的應用，透過「金融科技推動計劃」提升行業技術能力。\n\n香港金融管理局金融科技推動辦公室（FFO）與金融管理局銀行部門密切合作，在推動這些措施的實施中發揮核心作用。\n\n香港在協助國際投資者配置人民幣資產方面亦扮演重要角色，通過「港股通」及「債券通」方案，其無與倫比的內地市場接入方便了國際資金流動。去年，參與人數和日均交易額均達顯著增長，特別是債券通。針對便利性和靈活性，相關措施不斷完善，為國際投資者提供更多投資選擇。\n\n香港亦與內地當局緊密合作，推行多項便利措施，包括兩地人民幣資金跨境流動的財富管理合作方案。根據國際清算銀行（BIS）跨境外匯和衍生品市場的季度調查，香港仍是全球最大離岸人民幣外匯中心。\n\n持續推動新商機，強化香港金融平台的競爭力，包括與政府和業界合作，提供優惠的稅務和監管環境，以促進基金業發展。多項大型活動和推廣活動亦助力香港成為綠色金融、基建投資及企業財資中心（CTCs）的重鎮。為提升香港的軟實力，金融學院在六月成立，專注於金融領導力與研究合作。\n\n香港金融管理局在國際及區域委員會中亦擔任重要領導角色，包括主持金融穩定理事會（FSB）監管合作委員會、 Basel委員會督導與執行小組（SIG）以及東亞-太平洋中央銀行會議（EMEAP）工作組，並與美國證券交易委員會（SEC）共同主持非銀行監控專家組（NMEG）。\n\n香港的金融基礎設施運作穩健。2019年，四個銀行間實時結算系統（RTGS）、中央交易結算系統（CMU）和香港貿易資料庫（HKTR）達成100%系統正常運行，超越了99.95%的目標。由內地兩家中央證券存管機構開設帳戶，CMU促進了用於「債券通」北向交易和持有內地債券的結算與管理。\n\n快速支付系統（FPS）作為香港元RTGS系統的延伸，讓市民可以全天候即時進行零售資金轉帳與支付。2019年的用戶數量迅速增加，惠及逾四百萬用戶，交易量亦三倍增長。FPS為零售支付行業帶來新機遇，推動金融科技創新。\n\n為保障本地零售支付行業的安全與效率，香港金融管理局已認定並監管六個零售支付系統（RPSs），並在2020年5月發放兩張新的存款及支付工具（SVF）牌照，總數達到18個。各持牌機構持續推出新產品，提供多元服務，豐富用戶選擇。\n\n# 2019回顧\n\n# 香港作為亞洲金融科技樞紐\n\n# 智慧銀行措施\n\n七項智慧銀行措施由香港金融管理局於2017年9月宣布，旨在提升銀行業的運作標準，並迎接銀行與科技融合帶來的巨大機遇。今年，香港在推行和落實這些措施，打造金融科技生態系統方面取得了顯著進展。\n\n# 快速支付系統\n\n2018年9月推出的FPS，成為香港數字時代金融基礎建設的重大里程碑。FPS進一步推廣電子支付的普及，為市民和企業提供便捷、高效的支付服務。截至2019年底，已有30家銀行及11家存款及支付工具（SVF）平台加入，且新增多家機構。\n\nFPS的使用量持續穩步上升。至2019年12月，有逾四百萬用戶登記（見圖1），處理了約4,400萬筆交易，交易總額達7485億港元及170億元人民幣。2019年12月，平均每日交易量達168,000筆，價值24億港元和人民幣3800萬元（見圖2），較2018年10月首個完整月的51,000筆交易大幅提升。\n\n【FPS推動情況：】\n- 2019年12月，註冊人數逾四百萬\n- 交易量達4,400萬筆\n- 日均交易168,000筆，交易額約24億港元及人民幣3.8千萬元\n\n香港金融管理局與業界合作，努力將FPS由個人對個人（P2P）延伸至帳單支付和商戶支付，包括引入多種代理識別碼及接受部分或超額支付的功能，並研發技術規範以便用戶能從商業手機應用程序（APP）快速啟動移動銀行或電子錢包APP，提升整體支付體驗。\n\n此外，政府部門亦協作推動在稅務、差餉、政府租金和水費賬單上加入FPS QR碼，方便市民掃碼支付。未來，政府將與更多公共部門合作，探索其他便利用例。\n\n為提升市民對FPS的認識，香港金融管理局設計了一系列宣傳及教育材料，如在電視和電台播放的公益公告、數碼平台上的影片及電子橫幅，並參加各類展覽，向中小企推廣。多家參與銀行及SVF平台亦推出促銷活動，鼓勵市民註冊使用。\n\n# 開放應用程式介面\n\n金融管理局持續推動銀行業根據「開放API框架」四階段策略，開放數據申請。截至2020年1月，第一階段20家零售銀行已開放超過500個API接口，涵蓋銀行產品和服務信息；第二階段則在十月推出，支持超過300個API，以支援金融申請。\n\n# 研究與人才培育\n\n在貿易金融方面，完成了eTradeConnect與we.trade聯接的概念驗證（PoC）研究。十一月，香港銀聯清算有限公司與中國人民銀行（PBoC）數字貨幣研究所簽署協議，合作進行聯合PoC，促進兩地貿易金融服務的便利化。\n\n在數字貨幣方面，香港金融管理局與泰國銀行展開合作，推動「Inthanon-LionRock」項目，研究數字人民幣在跨境支付中的應用，促進港泰支付對付（pvp）。此外，香港金融管理局亦對銀行業應用人工智能（AI）進行研究，發表了行業意見調查結果，並於年底推出全面報告《用人工智能重塑銀行業》。\n\n為擴大金融科技人才庫，香港金融管理局與合作夥伴一同推行金融科技職業加速計劃2.0，去年超過220名學生獲益，為行業培育新血。"}
{"en": "# Reserves Management\n\nGlobal financial markets performed better than expected in 2019 as the effect of accommodative monetary policies from major central banks outweighed concerns about the global growth slowdown and US-China trade tensions. Global equity markets rebounded following a significant correction in the fourth quarter of 2018, while major government bond yields declined and bond prices went up. Under such a favourable environment, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$262.2 billion in 2019, representing an investment return of 6.6%.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The HKMA, under the delegated authority of the Financial Secretary (FS) and within the terms of the delegation, is responsible to the FS for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(a) to preserve capital;\n(b) to ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(c) to ensure that sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) subject to (a)–(c), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund.\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP). The BP holds highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under Currency Board arrangements. The IP invests primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of its assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA diversifies part of the Exchange Fund’s investments in a prudent and incremental manner into a wider variety of asset classes. This includes emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The cap for the market value of investments under the LTGP is set at the aggregate of one-third of the accumulated surplus of the Exchange Fund and the portion of the Future Fund and placements by subsidiaries of the Exchange Fund linked to the LTGP.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007, holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that have been acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes. This Portfolio is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of its unique nature.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by fiscal reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP, with the major exception of the Future Fund, which links its interest rate to both the IP and the LTGP with reference to the portfolio mix. As at the end of 2019, the portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 40:60.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation. The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents long-term asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark (or strategic) allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and tracking error limit are determined by the FS in consultation with the EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may assume positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nThe HKMA set up the Exchange Fund Investment Office (EFIO) in August 2018 to house its investment and related risk management functions. Staff members of the EFIO directly manage about 71% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, comprising the entire BP and part of the IP. This part of the IP includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 29% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes. The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to realise sustainable returns, draw on diverse and complementary investment styles, and gain their market insights and technical expertise in investment.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is determined primarily by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe growing complexity of the investment environment underlines the importance of risk management. Stringent controls and investment guidelines are in place for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and compliance with guidelines and regulations is closely monitored. As the investment environment has become more complex, risk assessment has been strengthened to support the Exchange Fund’s increased level of investment diversification. Risk-control tools are deployed to assess market risks under both normal and adverse market conditions. Detailed performance attribution analyses are also conducted to identify sources of performance, enabling the HKMA to assess how to make the best use of the investment skills of both internal and external managers.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nThe HKMA is supportive of responsible investment (RI) by weaving environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into the investment process for both public and private market investments of the Exchange Fund.\n\nIn terms of public market investments, the HKMA implements both process-related and investment-related measures. One process-related measure taken by the HKMA is the adoption of the Principles of Responsible Ownership (PRO) issued by the Securities and Futures Commission in 2016, which help investors determine how best to meet their ownership responsibilities in relation to their investments in Hong Kong-listed companies. In managing the Exchange Fund, the HKMA has developed internal guidelines on ESG factors covering the process of selection, appointment and monitoring of external fund managers. The appointed external fund managers for the HKMA’s Hong Kong equities and Mainland active equities portfolios are required to adhere to the pRO in managing the investments on a “comply-or-explain” basis, and external fund managers appointed to manage the HKMA’s portfolios in developed market equities need to adhere to internationally recognised ESG standards. Apart from externally managed funds, ESG factors are also incorporated into the credit risk analysis of the HKMA’s internally managed bond investment.\n\nAs for ESG investments in the public market, the HKMA has invested in green bonds since 2015 as one of the early investors in this market, and participates in the Managed Co-Lending Portfolio Programme, which is run by the International Finance Corporation with a focus on sustainable investments across emerging markets. Going forward, the HKMA will continue to grow its green bond portfolio by either direct investment or investing in green bond funds. The HKMA also plans to construct ESGthemed mandates in equities investment by adopting an ESG equities index as a benchmark for passive portfolios and engaging active equities managers who apply ESG factors in their investment decisions.\n\nWith respect to private market investments, the HKMA examines the ESG policies and practices of general partners as part of its due diligence process. In particular, ESG risk evaluation is conducted as a mandatory part of due diligence in all LTGP investments. For the LTGP, the HKMA invests in projects with sustainable features; for instance, the HKMA has invested in renewables since 2013 in direct and co-investments in the energy sector, as well as green buildings and warehouses with green and sustainable features in its real estate portfolio. Going forward, the HKMA will continue to source projects with sustainable features and include green accreditation as a predominant factor in real estate investment.\n\nThe HKMA will monitor the development of ESG standards closely and assess how these standards can be further integrated into its investment process. The process is facilitated by its collaboration with like-minded investors and relevant international organisations. In particular, being a signatory of the UN-supported principles for Responsible Investment, which is the world’s leading proponent of RI, the HKMA expects to participate in the formulation of ESG best practices and to motivate other investors in adopting RI. Besides, the HKMA is also a member of FCLTGlobal, a not-for-profit organisation that works to encourage a longer-term focus in business and investment decision-making through workshops and research studies. In 2019, the HKMA also became a supporter of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures.\n\nFor more details about the HKMA’s RI policy framework, see the Corporate Social Responsibility chapter.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2019\n\nDespite concerns about the global growth slowdown and US-China trade tensions, global financial markets performed well in 2019 on the back of accommodative monetary policies from major central banks. Following a significant correction in the fourth quarter of 2018, global equity markets rallied in 2019. In the bond markets, major government bond yields declined markedly while bond prices went up in the first three quarters of 2019 as a result of monetary easing. Although bond prices retreated in the fourth quarter amid a slight rebound in yields, the overall gains in the bond markets were still satisfactory in 2019.\n\nIn the currency markets, major currencies performed differently against the US dollar. After declining by 3.8% in the third quarter due to an escalation of US-China trade tensions, the renminbi recovered part of its earlier losses in the fourth quarter given easing trade tensions. Overall, the renminbi depreciated by 1.4% against the US dollar. While the pound fell by 3.2% in the third quarter due to the heightened risk of a no-deal Brexit, it had since rebounded significantly as more clarity on Brexit emerged in the fourth quarter, eventually gaining 4.0% against the US dollar.\n\nThe performances of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2019 are shown in Table 1.\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$262.2 billion in 2019. This comprised gains on bonds of HK$114.5 billion, gains on Hong Kong equities of HK$22.1 billion, gains on other equities of HK$100.7 billion, a negative currency translation effect of HK$13.0 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets, and gains of HK$37.9 billion on other investments held by the investment holding subsidiaries of the Fund. Separately, the Strategic portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$2.5 billion.\n\nThe total assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,206.7 billion at the year end. The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$335.1 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$233.4 billion and real estate at HK$101.7 billion. Outstanding investment commitments reached HK$219.3 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund in 2019, excluding the Strategic portfolio, was 6.6%. Specifically, the IP achieved a rate of return of 9.7%, while the Bp gained 2.5%. The LTGP has recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 12.6% since its inception in 2009.\n", "zh": "儲備管理\n\n2019年，全球金融市場表現優於預期，主要央行採取的寬鬆貨幣政策的效果超過了市場對全球經濟放緩和中美貿易緊張局勢的擔憂。全球股票市場在2018年第四季度出現重大修正後反彈，同時主要政府債券收益率下降，債券價格上升。在這樣有利的環境下，聯儲基金錄得投資收入2622億港元，投資回報率為6.6%。\n\n# 聯儲基金\n\n根據《聯儲基金條例》，聯儲基金的主要目標是幫助影響，無論直接或間接，港幣的匯率價值。該基金亦可用於維持香港貨幣及金融系統的穩定與完整，以協助香港保持作為國際金融中心的地位。金管局在財經司司長的授權下，負責聯儲基金的運用和投資管理，並在授權範圍內履行職責。\n\n# 聯儲基金管理\n\n# 投資目標與資產組合架構\n\n聯儲基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）已制定以下投資目標：\n\n(a) 保持資本；\n(b) 確保整個貨幣基底在任何時候均由高流動性、以美元計價的資產全數支持；\n(c) 確保有足夠的流動性以維持貨幣和金融穩定；以及\n(d) 在(a)至(c)的前提下，實現有助於長期保值的投資回報。\n\n這些目標充分考慮聯儲基金的法定宗旨，並融入基金的資產組合結構與目標資產比例。\n\n一般而言，聯儲基金有兩個主要的投資組合：支持組合（BP）和投資組合（IP）。BP持有高流動性美元資產，以在貨幣局安排下充分支持貨幣基底。IP主要投資於經合組織（OECD）成員國的債券及股票市場，以保護資產的價值和長期購買力。\n\n為更好地管理風險和提升中長期回報，金管局謹慎且逐步將聯儲基金的部分投資分散到更廣泛的資產類別，包括新興市場和內地的債券及股票、私募股權（包括基建投資）和房地產。新興市場及內地的債券和股票由IP持有，而私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合（LTGP）持有。LTGP的市場價值上限，設定為聯儲基金累計盈餘的三分之一與基金子公司的相關配售比例的總和。\n\n此外，於2007年成立的戰略組合持有由政府出資收購的香港交易所及結算所有權股份。由於其特殊性，該組合的投資表現不計入基金整體評估。\n\n# 與聯儲基金的資產配置\n\n聯儲基金會不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定機構的存款。利率一般與IP的表現掛鈎，唯一例外為未來基金，其利率則依賴於IP和LTGP的資產組合比例。至2019年底，未來基金在IP與LTGP間的配比約為40：60。\n\n# 投資過程\n\n聯儲基金的投資流程，以兩種資產配置決策為基礎：策略性資產配置與戰術性資產配置。策略性資產配置，反映在投資基準上，代表長期的資產配置，符合基金的投資目標。以策略配置為指引，透過戰術性調整，追求超越基準的額外回報，故實際配置經常偏離基準配置。實際配置與基準配置之間的偏差，稱為「戰術偏差」。基準及追蹤誤差的範圍由財經司與EFAC協商決定，由金管局在授權下進行戰術決策並設定允許範圍。在允許範圍內，資產管理人可以根據短期市場動向進行調整，以把握市場機會。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局於2018年8月成立了聯儲基金投資辦公室（EFIO），負責投資與相關風險管理工作。EFIO的員工直接管理約71%的聯儲基金投資，包括整個BP和部分IP。該IP部分包括投資於全球固定收益市場及多種衍生品的投資組合，實施宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 外部管理人使用\n\n除了內部管理外，金管局亦聘用外部基金管理人管理約29%的資產，包括所有上市股票投資組合及其他專項資產類別。聘用外部管理人的目的是借用市場上最優的投資專業知識，實現可持續的回報，並獲取多樣且互補的投資風格與市場洞察力。相關支出包括基金管理費、託管費、交易成本及預扣稅等，主要由市場條件決定，可能每年波動。\n\n# 風險管理與合規\n\n隨著投資環境日益複雜，風險管理的重要性亦日益彰顯。對內外管理的投資組合均制定嚴格的控制及投資指引，並密切監察合規情況。隨著環境日趨複雜，風險評估亦已加強，以支援基金的多元化投資策略。通過部署風險控制工具，評估正常及不利市場條件下的市場風險；亦進行詳細的績效歸因分析，以識別績效來源，協助金管局善用內外管理人的投資技能。\n\n# 責任投資\n\n金管局支持負責任投資（RI），在本港及私營市場投資中融入環境、社會及管治（ESG）因素。\n\n在公共市場投資方面，金管局實施多項程序性及投資性措施。例如，採用由證券及期貨事務監察委員會（SFC）於2016年發布的負責任持有原則（PRO），幫助投資者管理其在香港上市公司中的持股責任。在管理聯儲基金時，金管局制定了關於ESG因素的內部指引，涵蓋選擇、委任及監察外部基金管理人。所委任的外部管理人，負責香港股票及大陸主動型股票組合，須遵守PRO的「遵守或解釋」原則，管理發達市場股票投資組合的管理人亦須符合國際認可的ESG標準。除外部管理基金外，ESG因素亦融入金管局內部管理的債券投資的信用風險分析。\n\n關於公共市場的ESG投資，金管局自2015年起投資於綠色債券，成為早期投資者之一，並參與由國際金融公司（IFC）推動的「管理共同貸款投資組合計劃」，聚焦於新興市場的可持續投資。未來，金管局將繼續通過直接投資或投資於綠色債券基金，擴展其綠色債券組合，並計劃制定以ESG為主題的股票投資委託，採用ESG股票指數作為被動投資的基準，並聘用運用ESG因素的主動股票管理人。\n\n針對私募市場投資，金管局審視管理合夥人的ESG政策與實踐，特別是在盡職調查中，ESG風險評估為必備環節。就LTGP而言，金管局投資於具有可持續特徵的項目，例如自2013年起投資於能源行業的可再生能源及綠色建築、倉庫等房地產項目。未來，金管局將持續尋找具有可持續特徵的項目，並將綠色認證作為房地產投資的重要因素。\n\n金管局將密切監察ESG標準的發展，探索如何進一步將其納入投資流程。此過程得益於與理念相近的投資者及相關國際組織的合作。作為聯合國支持的負責任投資原則（PRI）的簽署方，金管局期待參與制定ESG最佳實踐，並鼓勵其他投資者採用RI。此外，金管局亦是非牟利組織FCLTGlobal的成員，該組織致力於通過研討會及研究，推動企業和投資決策的長期導向。2019年，金管局亦成為氣候相關財務披露工作組（TCFD）的支持者。\n\n欲了解金管局的負責任投資政策框架更多詳情，可參閱企業社會責任章節。\n\n# 聯儲基金的績效\n\n# 2019年金融市場\n\n儘管對全球經濟增長放緩和中美貿易緊張的擔憂，2019年在主要央行採取寬鬆貨幣政策的支持下，全球金融市場表現良好。在2018年第四季度大幅修正後，全球股票市場在2019年反彈。在債券市場，主要政府債券收益率顯著下降，債券價格在2019年前三季上升，因貨幣寬鬆措施推動。儘管第四季度收益率略有回升導致債券價格回調整體而言，2019年債市的收益仍令人滿意。\n\n在匯率市場方面，主要貨幣對美元的表現不一。在第三季度因中美貿易緊張升級，下跌了3.8%，但由於貿易緊張局勢緩和，人民幣在第四季度部分反彈，整體對美元貶值1.4%。英鎊因無協議退歐的風險升高，在第三季度下跌3.2%，隨後隨著退歐局勢變得更明朗，在第四季度大幅反彈，最終對美元升值4.0%。\n\n2019年主要貨幣、債券和股票市場的表現見表1。\n\n# 聯儲基金的表現\n\n2019年，聯儲基金錄得投資收入2622億港元。其中，債券收益為1145億港元，香港股票收益為221億港元，其他股票收益為1007億港元，在非港幣資產上的貨幣轉換負面影響約130億港元，以及基金投資控股子公司持有的其他投資所得37.9億港元。此外，戰略組合錄得市值变动250億港元的評估收益。\n\n年終時，聯儲基金總資產達到4.2067萬億港元。LTGP之下的投資市值總計3351億港元，其中私募股權為2334億港元，房地產為1017億港元。未來投資承諾總額達2193億港元。\n\n2019年，聯儲基金（不包括戰略組合）的投資回報率為6.6%。具體而言，IP的回報率為9.7%，BP的回報為2.5%。自2009年成立以來，LTGP的年化內部報酬率已達12.6%。"}
{"en": "# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communication with the community and the market through the traditional media, social media platforms, its website, the Information Centre and various other channels to facilitate public understanding about its policies and operations. Within the institution, conscientious efforts are made to improve the HKMA’s corporate governance by supporting the professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline, enhancing information technology security, and promoting a culture of innovation to cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives and the increasing complexity of work.\n\n# ENGAGING THE COMMUNITY\n\n# Media relations and social media\n\nThe HKMA works closely with the media to enhance transparency and promote public understanding about its policies and work. During the year, 125 open press events were held, comprising 10 press conferences, 12 stand-up interviews and 103 other public functions. A further 25 media interviews were arranged. A total of 466 bilingual press releases were issued and a large number of media enquiries were handled every day.\n\nTo raise awareness of the HKMA’s key functions, the HKMA organised media briefings and educational workshops for local and overseas media as well as key opinion leaders in the community to facilitate understanding on a wide range of topics, such as the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), virtual banking, green finance, and Hong Kong as a competitive international financial centre.\n\nSince July 2018, the HKMA has launched various social media channels to strengthen public education and communication. Five social media channels are currently in operation: Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter and YouTube, reaching out to a total of over 45,000 followers as at end-December 2019. Amid the social incidents in the second half of 2019, the HKMA made use of social media to rebut unfounded rumours regarding banking operations and financial stability, a move which proved to be highly effective in disseminating facts and preventing the rumours from spreading further.\n\n# Public enquiries\n\nThe Public Enquiry Service provides an effective means for the public to better understand the key functions and operations of the HKMA. A total of 9,742 enquiries were handled in 2019, about half of which were related to banking policies and regulations, consumer banking, and notes and coins. Some of the notable enquiries raised were about the Coin Collection programme, banking products and services, banking-related guidelines and circulars, the Faster Payment System (FPS), and monetary and economic statistics.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received since 2016 and Chart 2 provides a breakdown by enquiry nature in 2019.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Eddie Yue, speaks at the Hong Kong Association of Banks Distinguished Speaker Luncheon.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Eddie Yue (left), and HKMA's then Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan, meet with media after the announcement of the appointment of Mr Eddie Yue as the next Chief Executive of the HKMA.\n\n# Publications\n\nApart from the HKMA Annual Report, in 2019 the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report, four issues of the Quarterly Bulletin, and regular updates of the Monthly Statistical Bulletin to provide up-to-date and thematic information and analyses on monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. In addition, the HKMA published 19 inSight articles, covering various topics related to its work. The inSight articles provide a useful channel for the HKMA to elucidate the rationale behind its major new initiatives or policies, and provide timely response to topical issues which are of interest to the public.\n\n# HKMA website\n\nThe HKMA official website (www.hkma.gov.hk) presents more than 40,000 pages of content in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, and is the public access gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It also contains the register of authorized institutions (AIs) and local representative offices and the register of the securities staff of AIs, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the register of stored value facility (SVF) licensees under the payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance. The HKMA official website underwent a major revamp and was relaunched in September with a new design layout, enriched content, an enhanced navigation structure, and more convenient search functions. The revamped website enables users to search information more easily and conveniently based on their own preferences. In particular, the revamped website carries a new section on “Smart Consumers”, where the public can find useful information and smart tips on a wide range of banking and related products or services. This is in line with the HKMA’s long-standing efforts to promote “smart and responsible” use of banking services.\n\nThe HKMA launches its revamped website.\n\nThe revamped HKMA website carries a new section on “Smart Consumers”.\n\nThe HKMA has been opening up financial data and important information published on its website via Open Application Programming Interface (Open API) by phases since 2018. By 2019, the HKMA has opened up 130 sets of Open ApIs on the HKMA’s website as originally planned. The HKMA embraces the development and application of Open API.\n\n# HKMA Information Centre\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre is an important resource introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters. It consists of an exhibition area and a library, and is open to the public six days a week. The exhibition area describes the HKMA’s work and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong. It also contains reading materials and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nThe HKMA completed the last phase of revamp of its Information Centre — the Historical Timeline — during the year. The revamped Historical Timeline, featuring multimedia and digital display panels for visitors to review the major monetary and financial events in Hong Kong and globally in a more interactive manner, was re-opened to the public in October.\n\nThe first section of the Historical Timeline is made up of a multimedia display panel presenting major events from 1842 to 1993.\n\nThe second section of the Historical Timeline is a digital display panel presenting major events from 1993, when the HKMA was established, to the present.\n\nThe Information Centre organises guided tours for visitors. During the year, it received more than 48,000 visitors and hosted over 480 guided tours for schools and other groups (Chart 3). More than 753,000 people have visited the Information Centre since it opened in December 2003.\n\nGuided tours of the Information Centre are organised for schools and other group visitors.\n\nThe library, situated next to the exhibition area, houses more than 26,000 books, journals and other publications for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs and central banking topics. It also maintains the register of AIs and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\n# Public and consumer education\n\nTo reach out to the community and raise public awareness of the HKMA’s work, the HKMA organised a public education seminar for over 400 secondary school students and teachers in 2019. Topics covered in the seminar included an introduction to the work of the HKMA, Hong Kong’s banknotes, the FPS, SVFs, fintech and the Deposit Protection Scheme. More than 60,000 teachers and students have participated in this programme since its launch in 1998.\n\nStudents and teachers from secondary schools in different districts attend the 2019 public education seminar.\n\nThe focus of the HKMA’s consumer education initiatives during the year was on educating the public to protect their “personal digital keys”, a concept introduced to help the public visualise the significance of safeguarding information for accessing their online accounts. The central message was that in the digital world, account login details and personal information related to internet banking and other digital financial services were as important as the keys to their home, and should be well protected. Extensive promotion was arranged across different media, including the TV, radio, mobile applications, social media, and other digital and out-of-home platforms, to highlight smart tips on how to protect personal digital keys.\n\nThe Flagship Campaign on Personal Digital Keys is conducted via extensive cross-media promotion.\n\nSustained initiatives were also carried out to educate the public to be smart and responsible financial consumers. For example, members of the public were urged to stay vigilant of bogus phone calls purportedly from banks, and of investment scams promoted on social media. Issues to note when handling personal credit products, in particular personal loans taken out during the tax season, were also promoted.\n\nTo enhance financial literacy among secondary school students, the HKMA co-organised the “Hong Kong Liberal Studies Financial Literacy Championship” with various stakeholders for the fifth year. Infographics were newly used in the Championship this year to help students better understand sophisticated financial concepts. An online quiz was conducted, attracting 10,450 submissions and culminating in the grand final competition, which was held at the HKMA for the first time. \n\nThe Championship, attracting over 10,000 online submissions, ends with a live competition at the HKMA.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA kicked off the Second phase of its Cross-generation Outreach Educational programme, which was organised jointly with an education institution. The programme comprised bank simulation games, parents’ talks and train-the-trainer workshops, targeting kindergarten pupils, their parents and teachers, as well as young adults. Other initiatives on youth education included producing comic storybooks for primary school students and parents jointly with a professional association, as well as delivering talks to tertiary school students.\n\nThe HKMA continued to support the Investor and Financial Education Council in promoting financial literacy and capacity in Hong Kong, and will explore further collaboration with different stakeholders to maximise the impact of consumer education.\n\nThe Achievement Ceremony for the First Phase of the Crossgeneration Outreach Programme is held alongside the launch of the Second Phase.\n\nKindergarten pupils participate in the bank simulation game.\n\nComic storybooks are produced jointly with a professional association to disseminate smart tips on using banking and financial services to primary school students and their parents.\n\n# OUR PEOPLE\n\nWhile the HKMA is an integral part of the Government, it employs staff on terms different from those of the civil service to attract people with the right experience and expertise. The HKMA recruits, develops and maintains a highly professional workforce to support its policy objectives and respond flexibly to changing work priorities.\n\nThe establishment of the HKMA in 2019 was 1,005. During the year, the HKMA conducted a cross-departmental re-engineering exercise to enhance the efficiency of various work processes and redeploy existing resources to support new initiatives. As a result of this rigorous exercise, the overall establishment of the HKMA in 2020 remains unchanged at 1,005.

{"en": "# Corporate Social Responsibility\n\nThe HKMA is committed to fulfilling its corporate social responsibility, and aims to be a responsible and sustainable organisation. This commitment is manifested in various areas, including promoting a sustainable and environment-friendly marketplace, supporting the wider community, protecting the environment and nurturing a caring workplace.\n\n# MARKETPLACE\n\n# Green and sustainable banking\n\nClimate change is one of the major risks threatening the well-being of mankind and the sustainability of the world economy. The financial sector in which banks operate, being an integral part of the society, will also be impacted and hence should be more proactive in managing climate risks. The HKMA is committed to exploring ways to address this challenge. Against this background, the HKMA unveiled in May a number of measures for promoting the development of green finance in Hong Kong, including the adoption of a three-phased approach to promote green and sustainable banking.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nAs the investment manager of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA believes that the concept of responsible investment (RI) is highly relevant to its investment work. As the HKMA is one of the world’s largest asset owners, it will have a major impact on how fund managers pick assets.\n\n# Our Beliefs\n\nThe HKMA sees RI as an investment approach that takes into account the impact of various environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors on long-term investment returns and their sustainability. The HKMA believes that, by putting an appropriate emphasis on RI and sustainable long-term economic performance, it can better achieve the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund and reduce risks associated with the ESG-related matters of its underlying investments.\n\n# Our Principles\n\nThe HKMA’s guiding principle is that priority will generally be given to ESG investments if the long-term risk-adjusted return is comparable with other investments. Where appropriate, the HKMA adopts in its investment process the following RI principles that underpin its beliefs as a responsible long-term investor:\n\n# Integration\n\nThe HKMA incorporates ESG factors into its investment analysis processes to identify risks and opportunities, as it believes that these factors can materially affect the long-term value of its investments. Specifically, the HKMA has been integrating ESG factors into its investment process for both public and private market investments. For public market investments, the HKMA incorporates ESG factors in its credit risk analysis of bond investment. External managers that share the HKMA’s RI beliefs are selected and appointed. The HKMA communicates its RI beliefs to all its external managers and expects them to align in such a way that the overall sustainable long-term economic performance target is attainable. For private market investments, the ESG policies and practices of the HKMA’s general partners are examined as part of its due diligence process.\n\n# Active ownership\n\nThe HKMA exercises shareholder rights in its public equity holding in a manner that helps safeguard the long-term value of its investments. The HKMA believes that responsible corporate behaviour guided by ESG factors will help create shareholder value in the long term. The HKMA’s asset managers are expected to help the HKMA discharge its ownership responsibilities in the underlying investments by adopting active ownership through exercising voting rights and engaging with the corporates concerned.\n\n# Collaboration\n\nThe HKMA seeks to join hands with like-minded investors and regulators to promote good practices for the long-term management of investments. It participates in and speaks at public events to share views and encourage the investment community to adopt RI.\n\nSee the Reserves Management chapter for more details about the HKMA’s work on RI during the year.\n\n# Promoting financial inclusion\n\nThe HKMA attaches great importance to financial inclusion and has been making significant effort in promoting access to basic banking services by different segments of the society to meet the basic daily needs of the general public and the operational needs of legitimate businesses. In particular, the HKMA has been working closely with the banking industry on the following priority areas:\n\n- Encouraging banks to launch more physical banking facilities and develop digital and innovative channels for the delivery of basic banking services to serve the general public, particularly residents of remote areas and public housing estates, and the elderly;\n\n- Facilitating and monitoring the accessibility of bank accounts to individuals and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs);\n\n- Enhancing the accessibility of banking services to specific customer groups, for example, customers with disabilities and ethnic minorities;\n\n- Facilitating and monitoring the accessibility of bank credit to SMEs; and\n\n- Granting authorization to eight virtual banks, which will play an active role in promoting financial inclusion in delivering their banking services.\n\n# COMMUNITY\n\n# Promoting financial literacy\n\nThe HKMA promotes financial literacy through various channels. Apart from running educational programmes to promote smart and responsible use of banking and financial services by the public, the HKMA features on its revamped official website a new dedicated section on “Smart Consumers”, where the public can find useful information and smart tips on a wide range of banking and related products and services. Social media platforms such as Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube, Instagram and Twitter are used in addition to the HKMA official website and publications to provide up-to-date information on banking and financial affairs.\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre, serving as the HKMA’s major public education and research resource since 2003, introduces the work of the HKMA to the community and promotes public awareness of monetary and banking matters. Educational guided tours are offered daily for group visitors from schools and non-profit making organisations. public education seminars and other activities are also organised for students to enhance their financial knowledge and literacy. In addition, the HKMA works closely with the Investor and Financial Education Council to promote financial literacy in Hong Kong via its financial education platform, The Chin Family.\n\nSee the Corporate Functions chapter for more details about the HKMA’s work on promoting financial literacy during the year. See the Banking Stability chapter for more details about the HKMA’s work on promoting financial inclusion during the year.\n\n# Addressing the needs of special groups \n\n# Accessibility of Hong Kong banknotes\n\nThe 2018 Series of Banknotes retains accessibility features used in the previous series of banknotes to help the visually impaired differentiate between the denominations. These accessibility features include Braille, tactile lines and high-tactility numerals.\n\nTo help the visually impaired differentiate between the denomination of the banknotes, a mobile app, sponsored by the HKMA and developed by the Hong Kong Society for the Blind, uses the phone’s camera to scan the banknote patterns for the denomination. The app is available for download from Apple App Store and Google play Store for free. A note-measuring template sponsored by the HKMA and the three note-issuing banks has also been introduced to measure the length of the note. It can measure both the 2018 Series and the notes currently in circulation. The template is embossed with Braille on one side and symbols on the other. It is freely distributed at voluntary agencies serving the visually impaired community.\n\n# Coin Collection Programme\n\nUnder the Coin Collection programme, the HKMA collaborates with the Hong Kong Council of Social Service to deploy the Coin Carts to collect coins on flag days for non-governmental organisations.\n\n# Accessibility of public information\n\nThe revamped HKMA official website was launched in September. The revamped website has enhanced navigation structure to facilitate easy and convenient search by users based on their own preferences. In particular, the website contains a dedicated webpage “Information in Other Languages” under the “Smart Consumers” section, which provides useful information on banking services in seven languages commonly used by the ethnic minority community, namely Bahasa Indonesia, Hindi, Nepali, Punjabi, Tagalog, Thai and Urdu.\n\nThe HKMA is committed to ensuring that its website conforms to the maximum extent possible to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 Level AA standard, to facilitate barrier-free access to its online information by people with special needs.\n\n# volunteer and charitable activities\n\nThe HKMA supports community services by taking part in volunteer and charitable activities. The Senior Citizen Home Safety Association awarded the Community Engagement Crystal Award to the HKMA for participating in the 2018 Love & Peace of Mind Corporate Engagement Programme.\n\nCharitable events participated in by the HKMA Volunteer Team in 2019\n\n“Yo! Let’s Walk the Road” by the Youth Outreach.\n\nArtists and representatives from the social enterprise, Arts with the Disabled Association Hong Kong, visit the HKMA office, where its artworks are displayed.\n\nHKMA staff members take part actively in Blood Donation Day, Territory-Wide Flag Day, Community Chest’s Green Day, Love Teeth Day, Skip Lunch Day, Dress Casual Day and regular campaigns that collect clothes, toys and other reusable items for donation to charities.\n\nHKMA staff members take part actively in Blood Donation Day, organised by the Hong Kong Red Cross.\n\n# Caring organisation\n\nIn recognition of its commitment to care for the community, the HKMA was accredited with the “10 Years Plus Caring Organisation Logo” by the Hong Kong Council of Social Service for the 13th consecutive year.\n\n# ENVIRONMENT\n\n# Green office measures\n\nThe HKMA has an established environmental policy to protect and preserve the environment. The policy and implementation measures are promulgated among its staff regularly. Green office measures include:\n\n# Paper/Photocopying/Printing\n\n- Encouraging the use of recycled paper and envelopes;\nDistributing electronic copies instead of hard copies of documents;\n- printing on both sides of the paper;\n- Using colour printing and copying only when necessary;\n- Avoiding the use of paper cups; and \n- Using environmentally friendly paper and ink for the HKMA’s Annual Report.\n\n# Electricity\n\n- Switching off PCs, printers, lights, audio-visual systems and other electrical appliances when these devices are not in use. Reactivating the preset power-saving mode installed in most equipment, such as water dispensers, electric punching machines and shredders, after use outside their preset operating hours; and \n- Reviewing regularly the need for additional air-conditioning beyond normal business hours.\n\n# Recycling\n\n- Making good use of recycled bins to collect different categories of waste, including paper, cans, bottles, batteries, CDs and ink cartridges.\n\n# WORKPLACE\n\n# Diversity and inclusion\n\n# Equal Opportunities Policy\n\nThe HKMA is an equal opportunities employer. It believes that everyone should be able to work in an environment free of discrimination, harassment, vilification and victimisation. The equal opportunities policy applies to job advertisements, recruitment, terms and conditions of employment, performance assessment, promotion, transfer, training, dismissal, grievance procedures and general conduct.\n\n# Key statistics on diversity\n\npeople are central to the work of the HKMA. We value the diversity of our workforce, which has a balanced gender representation and a spectrum of different age groups.\n\nFemale representation at the senior management levels, that is, Executive Director and above, made up 31% as of February 2020.\n\n# Human capital key statistics on 1 January 2020\n\n# Quality workplace\n\nTo cater for projected operational needs, the HKMA renovated the offices during the year to create an open layout, increase capacity and allow for more efficient use of space. Breakout areas and ergonomic furniture are part of the new office design. To enhance the staff’s physical health, height-adjustable desks were offered to staff members, allowing them to change their postures easily throughout the day between sitting and standing.\n\nHeight-adjustable desks improve office ergonomics.\n\n# Staff well-being\n\nThe HKMA promotes work-life balance and cares about the health and work safety of the staff. Regular talks on healthy lifestyles, stress management and workplace safety are organised and indoor air quality is monitored. Annual on-site medical check-ups and flu vaccinations are arranged.

{"en": "# The Exchange Fund\n\n- Report of the Director of Audit\n- Exchange Fund Financial Statements\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 187 to 293, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2019, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2019, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards. My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report. I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2019. These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.5, 2.6 and 38.1 to the financial statements.\n\nAs at 31 December 2019, the Group had financial assets totalling HK$3,874,223 million and financial liabilities totalling HK$1,158,686 million valued at fair value.\n\nFor 91% of these financial assets and all these financial liabilities, their fair values were quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 inputs) or were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data (Level 2 inputs).\n\nFor the remaining 9% of these financial assets, their fair values were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data (Level 3 inputs). Such financial assets totalled HK$338,758 million, including mainly unlisted investment funds.\n\nGiven the substantial amount and the estimations involved, valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value was a key audit matter.\n\nThe audit procedures on valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value included:\n\n- obtaining an understanding of the procedures, including relevant controls, for valuing different categories of financial assets and financial liabilities;\n\n- evaluating and testing the controls, including relevant application controls of the computer systems;\n\n- obtaining external confirmations on the valuation, existence, rights and obligations and completeness of the financial assets and financial liabilities;\n\n- where quoted market prices were used, verifying the prices to independent sources;\n\n- where valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions, and verifying the inputs to independent sources; and\n\n- where valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Valuation of investment properties at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.11, 18 and 19 to the financial statements.\n\nThe Group’s investment properties were stated at their fair values, totalling HK$22,481 million as at 31 December 2019. The Group also had interests in twenty two joint ventures totalling HK$44,506 million, whose principal activities were holding overseas investment properties. The fair values of these investment properties, whether held by the Group directly or by joint ventures, were mainly determined based on valuations by independent professional valuers. Such valuations involved significant judgments and estimates, including the valuation methodologies and the assumptions used.\n\nThe audit procedures on valuation of investment properties at fair value included:\n\n- obtaining and reviewing the valuation reports of investment properties held by the Group directly or by joint ventures, and verifying that the fair values were based on the valuations stated in the valuation reports;\n\n- assessing the independence and qualifications of the valuers; and\n\n- evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises all the information included in the 2019 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICpA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. I also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nJohn Chu\nDirector of Audit\n\nAudit Commission \n26th Floor\nImmigration Tower\n7 Gloucester Road\nWanchai, Hong Kong\n\n3 April 2020\n", "zh": "交易基金\n\n- 審計署署長報告\n- 交易基金財務報表\n\n審計署署長報告\n\n獨立審計員致財政司司長的報告\n\n意見\n\n本人證實已審核交易基金及其子公司（「本集團」）列於第187至293頁的財務報表，包括截至2019年12月31日的交易基金及本集團的資產負債表，以及該年度的收支帳、全面收益表、權益變動表及現金流量表，並附有財務報表附註，包括重要會計政策摘要。\n\n依據本人之專業判斷，該等財務報表真實公允反映基金及本集團於2019年12月31日之財務狀況，以及其當年度之財務表现和現金流量，並符合由香港會計師公會（「HKICPA」）頒布的香港財務報告準則（「HKFRSs」），且已按照由行政長官根據《交易基金條例》（第66章）第7條制訂的指令妥善編製。\n\n意見基礎\n\n本人依照由行政長官根據《交易基金條例》第7條制訂的指令及審計署的審計準則進行審核。本人在該等準則下的責任詳見本報告的審計人員對財務報表審核的責任部分。本人與本集團保持獨立，並已遵守該等準則要求履行其他道德責任。我相信，所獲得的審計證據充分且適當，能作為本人意見的基礎。\n\n主要審計事項\n\n主要審計事項是我根據專業判斷，在審核截至2019年12月31日止年度的財務報表時認為最為重要的事項。這些事項在我對整體財務報表的審核中已予以處理，並在形成意見時予以考慮，且我不對這些事項作出獨立意見。\n\n公允價值金融資產與金融負債的估值\n\n參照財務報表附註2.5、2.6及38.1。\n\n截至2019年12月31日，本集團擁有公允價值計算的金融資產總額達港幣38億7422萬3千萬，金融負債則總額港幣11億586萬8千6百六十。\n\n其中91%的金融資產及所有金融負債的公允價值是以活躍市場對相同資產或負債的報價（第1級輸入）或以基於可觀察的市場資料的估值技術推算（第2級輸入）定價。\n\n剩餘9%的金融資產的公允價值則是以非基於可觀察市場資料的估值技術推算（第3級輸入）。該等金融資產總額達港幣3388億758萬，主要包括未上市投資基金。\n\n考量到大額金額及所涉估值，金融資產與負債的公允價值估值成為本次審計的主要事項。\n\n於金融資產與負債的估值過程中所進行的審計程序包括：\n\n- 了解不同類別金融資產及負債估值程序及相關內部控制措施；\n- 評估及測試有關控制，包括電腦系統的應用控制；\n- 取得外部確認函證金融資產及負債的存在權利義務及完整性；\n- 使用市價報價時，比對獨立資料來源；\n- 使用可觀察市場資料的估值技術時，評估估值方法的適切性及合理性，並核對輸入資料的可靠性；\n- 使用非基於可觀察市場資料的估值技術時，評估估值方法的適切性及所用假設與輸入的合理性。\n\n投資物業的公允價值估值\n\n參照財務報表附註2.11、18及19。\n\n本集團的投資物業在2019年12月31日的帳面價值為港幣224億8100萬。集團亦持有二十二個合營企業，總額港幣445億0606萬，其主要業務是持有海外投資物業。這些投資物業的公允價值主要由獨立專業估價師評估得出。評估涉及重要判斷和估算，包括選用的估值方法和假設。\n\n審核投資物業公允價值的程序包括：\n\n- 取得並審閱集團直接持有或合營企業持有的投資物業估價報告，驗證公允價值是否基於報告中的評價結果；\n- 評估估價師的獨立性與資格；\n- 評估估值方法的適切性及假設與輸入的合理性。\n\n其他資料\n\n貨幣當局負責其他資料。所謂其他資料指除財務報表及本人審計報告外的2019年香港金融管理局年度報告內所有內容。\n\n本人對此等其他資料的意見不亦涵蓋其中，亦不表示任何保證或確證。\n\n在審核財務報表時，本人責任是閱讀該等其他資料，並在過程中考慮其是否與財務報表或本人在審計中獲得的資料有重大矛盾，或其他明顯的虛假陳述。如本人認為該等資料存在重大錯誤，則須予以披露，本身並無此等情況。\n\n貨幣當局與交易基金顧問委員會審計小組就財務報表的責任\n\n貨幣當局負責根據香港會計師公會頒布的香港財務報告準則和由行政長官根據《交易基金條例》第7條制訂的指令編製公正反映財務狀況的財務報表，以及必要的內部控制措施，以確保財務報表不存在重大錯誤（不論是由欺詐或疏忽所致）。\n\n在編製財務報表時，貨幣當局亦須評估本集團能否持續營運，並在適用情況下披露相關持續經營事項及使用持續經營的會計基礎。\n\n交易基金顧問委員會的審計小組負責監督集團的財務報告流程。\n\n審計員對財務報表的審核責任\n\n本人旨在合理確信整體財務報表是否不存在重大錯誤（不論是由欺詐或疏忽所致），並出具包含本人意見的審計報告。合理確信屬較高的保證水平，但並不保證根據審計署審計準則進行的審計能100%發現所有已存在的重大錯誤。錯誤可能來自欺詐或疏忽，若單獨或合計起來，合理預期會影響用戶基於財務報表作出的經濟決策，即屬重大。\n\n作為符合審計署審計準則的審計一部分，我會運用專業判斷並保持專業懷疑，並：\n\n- 識別與評估財務報表存在重大錯誤的風險，設計並執行應對該等風險的審計程序，並取得充分適當的審計證據以支持意見。如果涉及欺詐的重大錯誤，風險較來自疏忽的更高，因欺詐可能伴隨串謀、偽造、故意遺漏、偽證或內部控制的超越；\n- 了解與審計相關的內部控制，設計適當的審計程序，但非為了評價集團內部控制的有效性；\n- 評估貨幣當局採用的會計政策的適切性、會計估計的合理性及披露內容；\n- 進行適當性評估，並根據所獲證據判斷貨幣當局是否以持續經營作為假設，若存在重大不確定性，亦須在審計意見中作出重點說明。如該不確定性可能對集團持續經營造成重大疑慮，我須指出該等披露，若披露不足，則修正意見。本意見基於審計截至報告日之證據，但未來事件或條件可能導致集團終止持續經營；\n\n- 評估財務報表的整體呈現、結構和內容，包括披露內容，並確定財務報表是否合理反映交易和重大事件；並取得足夠且適當的審計證據，以就集團內的實體或業務活動的財務資訊表達意見。我負責指導、監督及執行整個集團審計工作，並對我的審計意見負完全責任。\n\n我會就計畫的審計範圍、時間安排及審計發現（包括重要內部控制缺失）與交易基金顧問委員會進行溝通。\n\n我亦會向交易基金顧問委員會提供一份聲明，證明我已符合相關的道德規範，並就可能合理影響我獨立性的所有關係和事宜作出披露，若適用，亦包括相關保障措施。\n\n根據與審計小組通訊的內容，我會判斷哪些事項在當期財務報表的審計中最為重要，因此構成主要審計事項，除非法律或規例另有規定，否則我會在審計報告中描述這些事項。\n\n朱志雄\n審計署署長\n\n審計署\n入境事務大樓26樓\n告士打道7號\n灣仔，香港\n\n2020年4月3日"}

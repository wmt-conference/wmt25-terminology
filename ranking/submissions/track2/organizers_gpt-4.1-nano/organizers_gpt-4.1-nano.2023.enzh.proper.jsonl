{"en": "# Resilience in the face of adversity\n\nReverberations from slowing global economic growth amid a “high for longer” interest rate environment and intensifying geopolitical tensions — not just stemming from the RussiaUkraine war and China-US tensions but also the outbreak of conflict in the Middle East — were the key themes for the financial markets in 2023. The March banking turmoil in the US and Europe, the most significant system-wide banking stress since the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, weighed further on market sentiment. Major economies grappled with the harsh realities of tightened monetary conditions and greater uncertainty over the inflationary path and interest rate outlook. Adding to the uncertainty was the pace of Mainland China’s economic recovery, which was slower than general market expectations.\n\nWith volatility and unpredictability becoming the “new normal” in financial markets, Hong Kong has again demonstrated its well-known ability to adapt, showing remarkable resilience. Since the city’s full-fledged post-COVID reopening last year, much work has been done to attract people back to our dynamic city and reconnect them with Hong Kong. The HKMA has contributed by hosting a series of large-scale international events such as the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit and conferences with the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), which showcased our vibrant city and helped send the message worldwide that Hong Kong, as a major international financial centre (IFC), is open for business and remains the centre of action and innovation. There are clear signs of gradual recovery, driven by an encouraging revival of inbound tourism and improved private consumption, also supported by a resilient labour market and the various support measures rolled out by the Government. For 2023 as a whole, Hong Kong’s gross domestic product growth bounced back to 3.2% from negative territory in 2022.\n\nThe HKMA entered its fourth decade in 2023. The past 30 years have seen the dynamics of the economy and the financial markets change drastically, with technology driving advances beyond anyone’s wildest imagination. The invaluable experience and wisdom gained over the past three decades have enabled us to face the future with confidence. Despite macroeconomic headwinds and an uncertain external environment, the HKMA will continue to uphold its mandate of safeguarding monetary and banking stability in Hong Kong, and will actively pursue developmental opportunities to anchor that stability and cement the city’s status as a leading IFC.\n\nFormer and current Financial Secretaries of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Chief Executives of HKMA at a gathering to celebrate the HKMA’s 30th anniversary: (from left) Mr Joseph Yam, Mr Henry Tang, Mr Donald Tsang, Mr Paul Chan, Mr Eddie Yue, Mr Antony Leung, Mr John Tsang, and Mr Norman Chan\n\n# LERS — Weathering the storms\n\nLast year marked the 40th anniversary of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), a staunch pillar supporting Hong Kong’s strong and stable monetary and financial systems. Four decades of transparent and effective operation have nurtured confidence in the LERS and its credibility in the market. Throughout the year, the Hong Kong dollar stayed within the Convertibility Zone and the Hong Kong dollar market operated smoothly, reflecting the strong market confidence in the LERS, a confidence also shared and expressed by the International Monetary Fund and global market players.\n\nBehind this confidence lie the HKMA’s proactive efforts in public and market engagements, along with effective surveillance. We spared no effort during the year in communicating with key stakeholders to foster a clear understanding of the functioning of the LERS, which is all the more important in times of volatility, be it stemming from economic stress or political uncertainties. We also strengthened surveillance of our monetary system, leveraging the use of datasets from the trade repository and expanded granular data from banks, as well as advanced data analytics and artificial intelligence, to enhance our capability, enabling more timely and comprehensive analysis of financial stability and macro-prudential surveillance.\n\n# Banking system — A major source of stability\n\nDespite a multitude of challenges including the high-interestrate environment, persistent geopolitical tensions and a challenging credit landscape, Hong Kong’s banking system remained stable throughout the year, underpinned by strong capital and liquidity buffers.\n\nAs at the end of 2023, the consolidated total capital ratio of local banks stood at 21.1%, well above the international minimum requirement of 8%. The Liquidity Coverage Ratio of large banks edged up to 178.6% as of the fourth quarter of 2023, likewise well above the statutory minimum requirement of 100%. While the classified loan ratio increased slightly from 1.40% at the end of 2022 to 1.56% at the end of 2023, it remained below the long-term historical average of 2.0%. The increase was mainly driven by exposures to Mainland privately-owned enterprise (POE) property developers; but such exposure levels were generally well-contained as a result of banks’ prudent credit risk management over the years, and the overall asset quality of the banking sector remained sound.\n\nWhat caught most market players by surprise in 2023 was unquestionably the banking turmoil in the US spilling over to Europe, which created a level of system-wide banking stress unseen since the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. The HKMA remained on high alert as the situation unfolded and took a number of precautionary actions to limit any potential adverse spillover effects on confidence in the local banking and financial systems. This, coupled with the strong capital and liquidity buffers maintained by banks in Hong Kong, meant that our banking sector was largely unaffected by the turmoil, remaining resilient even as the global financial markets were roiled. In the aftermath of this episode, the HKMA conducted a comprehensive internal review with a view to drawing out lessons for the local banking sector and strengthening the HKMA’s supervisory effectiveness and agility to handle a banking crisis should one occur.\n\nWhile prudent credit risk management is important, we have always reiterated our supervisory expectation for banks to be mindful of the need to support the real economy. As the orderly exit from the banking sector’s Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme commenced in July 2023 with the economic effects of COVID-19 receding, the HKMA worked closely with banks to ensure a gradual and smooth transition to normal loan repayment with flexibility for those borrowers who continued to be under pressure. Earlier this year, recognising that some small and medium-sized enterprises are still facing challenges in their operations despite the end of the pandemic, nine new measures were rolled out to further assist them in obtaining financing from banks.\n\nHaving reviewed the risks associated with the local property market in the context of banks’ property lending, the HKMA announced in July 2023 the first relaxation of the countercyclical macroprudential measures for residential properties since their introduction in 2009. This relaxation increased the loan-to-value ratio cap for most residential mortgage loans as well as for financing for property development and investment. It was later followed by suspension of the interest rate stress testing requirement in early 2024.\n\nThe HKMA’s supervision of financial institutions has been moving with the times. With recent years having seen a sharp global increase in fraud cases, we have considerably stepped up our efforts to counter new fraud tactics by introducing a holistic set of measures to protect bank customers. These include enhancing information sharing between banks and with law enforcement agencies; strengthening the monitoring of suspicious transactions (including implementation of real-time fraud monitoring and tightened payment card authentication); empowering customers to have more controls on their payment cards; and educating customers and raising public awareness of frauds with the launch of the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter, as well as a pre-transaction alert mechanism which warns users if a higher-risk Faster Payment System (FPS) transaction is spotted.\n\nIn light of a proliferation of innovative and digital banking products and services, the HKMA has worked with the banking industry to step up consumer and investor protection more broadly and enhance the banks’ operational and cyber resilience, as well as their collective defences against systemic cyber events. At the same time, all major banks have considerably strengthened their capabilities to respond to, and recover from, destructive ransomware attacks. The HKMA together with the industry has also pursued various consumer data infrastructure projects, such as the “Credit Data Smart” pilot programme to enhance consumer credit reference services, and taken forward a cross-boundary credit reference initiative to facilitate crossboundary financing activities by corporates.\n\nFintech and digitalisation can bring about enormous opportunities when the risk is properly managed. Leveraging earlier success in facilitating the uptake of Regtech, the HKMA, with the support of the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Insurance Authority, published a new Fintech Promotion Roadmap in August 2023 to promote further development of fintech by financial institutions in five focus areas — Wealthtech, Insurtech, Greentech, artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology. We anticipate local regulators continuing to collaborate and work closely together with their industry sectors in the coming years in order for the Hong Kong financial industry as a whole to keep abreast and reap the benefits of dynamic fintech development.\n\n# Hong Kong as an IFC — The centre of action and innovation\n\nIn 2023, we fully emerged from the pandemic. Hong Kong was not only back in business but its position as one of the world’s leading IFCs was further underscored by the return of global investors and our strengthened global network. Domestically, we took the opportunity of the 30th anniversary of the HKMA’s establishment to host a series of large-scale, international events with top-level participation from the global financial and banking community to demonstrate Hong Kong’s vibrancy and to send a clear message that Hong Kong as an IFC remained relevant and indispensable to global investors and financial institutions seeking growth and innovation. Of particular note was the return of the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit, held in November, which attracted to our city more than 350 international and regional leaders from some 160 global financial institutions. Other high-powered events hosted in Hong Kong included a meeting of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) and two HKMA-BIS Conferences which were among the largest gatherings of central bank governors and banking supervisors of the year. These events attest to the global financial sector’s commitment to and confidence in Hong Kong.\n\nExternally, 2023 was also a year in which Hong Kong proactively reached out to strengthen its connections with traditional markets including the US and Europe, as well as new destinations such as those in the Middle East. We met with peer regulators and top management of global financial institutions in these markets to both apprise and update them on the opportunities in Hong Kong and the Mainland, while seeking out new collaboration opportunities for Hong Kong.\n\nTo complement these engagement efforts, we actively contributed to the work of international and regional forums by taking up certain leadership roles. During the year, I accepted invitations to chair the BIS Meeting of Governors from Major Emerging Market Economies and to co-chair the Financial Stability Board (FSB)’s Regional Consultative Group for Asia. My colleagues are also chairing or co-chairing a number of other important groupings under the Basel Committee, the Financial Action Task Force, and the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks, to name a few. The HKMA’s leadership at many regional and international forums is a recognition of Hong Kong’s expertise and contribution to international central banking and regulatory efforts in the pursuit of global monetary and financial stability, as well as Hong Kong’s importance as an IFC.\n\nTo build on the above accomplishments, we must position ourselves as a forward-looking IFC, staying ahead of the curve to ensure our ongoing competitiveness. We have identified three long-term trends in the coming years that will shape our future: namely the continued opening-up of the Mainland, the development of green and sustainable finance and the deployment of fintech. We will continue to support the development of our financial markets to capture the opportunities from these long-term trends while positioning our financial platform to provide leading services to attract more businesses to Hong Kong.

{"en": "# Highlights of 2023\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nDespite a challenging external environment, the Hong Kong economy stages a positive growth in 2023, driven by revivals in inbound tourism and domestic demand. The labour market continues to improve alongside the economic recovery, while inflation remains moderate. Economic activities for 2024 are expected to recover further at a moderate pace, although the outlook is clouded by multiple external uncertainties.\n\nThe banking sector in Hong Kong remains sound in 2023, supported by strong capital and liquidity buffers. Asset quality remains at a healthy level.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nAmid market expectations of a “high for longer” US policy rate, the Hong Kong dollar mostly trades on the weak side of the Convertibility Zone in 2023, with the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking being triggered eight times between mid-February and early May. The Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets remain stable, and continue to trade in a smooth and orderly manner.\n\n2023 marks the 40th anniversary of the Linked Exchange Rate System. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, the Linked Exchange Rate System has helped Hong Kong weather a succession of shocks and crises in the past four decades, demonstrating the system’s resilience and robustness.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA responds swiftly to the March banking turmoil in the US and Europe — from managing the ripple effects to completing an internal review drawing lessons for the local banking sector, while maintaining its focus on the credit, liquidity and market risk management of banks. In light of escalating cyber threats and increasing use of technology services provided by third parties, the HKMA also works closely with banks to enhance their operational and cyber resilience.\n\nThe HKMA enhances consumer protection on payment cards, and through further revision of the Code of Banking Practice as well as the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter. The HKMA works with fellow regulators on a balanced regulatory regime for virtual asset-related activities, streamlines the selling process for sophisticated professional investors, introduces enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Pilot Scheme, and commences supervision of trust business. A pilot programme on consumer credit reference services under “Credit Data Smart” is also launched.\n\nThe HKMA’s efforts in anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism reflect a commitment to targeting the highest threats under a risk-based approach. To address increasing digital fraud, the HKMA has strengthened ecosystem collaboration through the launch of real-time fraud monitoring, enhanced information sharing between banks and with law enforcement agencies, intensified public education, and launched a new pre-transaction alert mechanism when using the Faster Payment System. In parallel, supervisory technology capabilities have been advanced through the Macro Analytics pilot scheme.\n\nThe HKMA makes good progress on implementing international supervisory standards locally, including those on capital adequacy and disclosure, and makes notable efforts in enhancing capacity building in the banking sector.\n\nThe HKMA also advances its work to ensure a credible resolution regime, including developing a new resolution standard on accessing critical financial market infrastructures, and completing a review on the implementation of loss-absorbing capacity policy standards.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\nThe successful conclusion of the second Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit and the HKMA-BIS High-Level Conference demonstrates the global financial sector’s commitment to and confidence in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA works closely with its Mainland and Hong Kong counterparts to deepen and widen the mutual access between the Hong Kong and Mainland financial markets. This includes enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Scheme, designation of additional market makers for Southbound Trading under Bond Connect, the successful launch of Northbound Trading of Swap Connect, and the roll-out of the HKD-RMB Dual Counter Model and the Dual Counter Market Making Programme, all of which are effective in solidifying Hong Kong’s status as a global hub for offshore renminbi business.\n\nOn strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, notable progress is made in areas including bond issuance, asset and wealth management, green and sustainable finance, and corporate treasury centres.\n\nThe HKMA continues to make significant progress on various fronts of the “Fintech 2025” strategy. Project mBridge enters the Minimum Viable Product development phase, Phase 1 of the e-HKD Pilot Programme is completed, and Commercial Data Interchange sees increasing usage and the successful linkage with Government data source. Moreover, a new Fintech Promotion Roadmap is announced to further develop Wealthtech, Insurtech, Greentech, artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology in the banking sector. Meanwhile, the Faster Payment System marks its fifth anniversary and continues to see expanded adoption and enhancements including new functionalities like the linkage with Thailand’s PromptPay for cross-border QR payment. Significant progress is also made in relation to developing a regulatory regime for stablecoin issuers, with a public consultation paper published for gathering views on the legislative proposal.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\nDespite a volatile and challenging investment environment, the Exchange Fund manages to achieve a decent investment income of HK$226.0 billion, representing an investment return of 5.5%.\n\nThe HKMA continues its efforts on asset diversification and responsible investing.

{"en": "# Priorities for 2024 and Beyond\n\nEntering 2024, the Hong Kong economy is expected to continue to recover at a moderate pace, riding on the ongoing revival of inbound tourism, public infrastructure projects and stable private consumption. However, the external environment is fraught with risks and uncertainties, especially those relating to the future US policy rate path, the global growth prospects, and the evolving geopolitical tensions. That said, Hong Kong’s financial system remains well-positioned to weather adverse shocks given its resilience and ample buffers built up over the years.\n\nThe HKMA attaches great importance to safeguarding Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. Looking ahead, we will stay vigilant in the face of the uncertain macroeconomic environment, seeking to promptly identify emerging risks and respond to them in an agile manner. At the same time, we will seek opportunities and create policy headroom to help further enhance Hong Kong’s status as a leading international financial centre. In managing the Exchange Fund in this challenging investment environment, we will continue to invest prudently, while remaining flexible, taking defensive measures as appropriate, and maintaining a high degree of liquidity.\n\n# Stability and integrity of the financial system\n\nThe global economic uncertainties of recent years look set to continue in 2024. The HKMA will keep abreast of latest developments and stay vigilant against potential risks, with the aim of upholding the resilience and stability of the financial system, which are essential for the ongoing provision of critical financial services that support the functioning of the Hong Kong economy.\n\n# Staying vigilant against potential risks\n\nLooking into 2024, global financial markets could experience volatility as a result of uncertainties surrounding the US monetary policy outlook, evolving geopolitical risks, and an uneven global economic recovery. 2024 is also a key election year as many major elections are scheduled to be held across the world. The outcome of these elections could further increase market uncertainties. Nevertheless, Hong Kong’s financial system is well-positioned to withstand adverse shocks given its resilience and buffers built up over the years. The HKMA also has the capability, the resources and the commitment to safeguard Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nThe HKMA will continue its efforts to closely monitor any risks and vulnerabilities arising in the domestic and external environments, and will deploy appropriate measures where necessary to maintain Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. We will also conduct research into issues affecting the Hong Kong economy, assessing and addressing any potential risks associated with these issues.\n\n# Maintaining banking stability\n\nIn 2023, new geopolitical tensions across the world broke out while others remained unresolved, contributing to political uncertainty and instability that looks set to continue into 2024. Economic pressures in the form of high interest rates were a feature of the global landscape, and rates remain high entering 2024. Within the banking sector, the continued drive towards digitalisation and the implementation of new technology, including artificial intelligence, have brought many advantages but are also posing new operational and cyber security risks as well as supervisory challenges. In such a volatile political, economic and technological landscape, the HKMA strives to ensure banks’ ability to withstand shocks through its ongoing supervisory efforts. At the same time, we will continue to enhance and refine our banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account technological developments, changes in customer expectations, as well as international standards and best practices.\n\n# A risk-based supervisory focus\n\n# Credit, liquidity and market risks\n\nIn light of the increasingly challenging macroeconomic landscape, a special focus of the HKMA will be on monitoring the asset quality of authorized institutions (AIs) and assessing the effectiveness of their credit risk management and controls, particularly with respect to loan classification and provisioning practices and problem loans management. We will also maintain close dialogue with the banking and commercial sectors with a view to ensuring that AIs are striking an appropriate balance between undertaking prudent credit risk management and fulfilling their financial intermediation function throughout economic cycles. In particular, we will follow up with banks through the Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism on the nine new measures rolled out in March 2024 to assist small and medium-sized enterprises in obtaining financing from banks.\n\nUncertainties in the global economic outlook as well as elevated geopolitical tensions may increase the volatility of both asset prices and cross-border fund flows. The HKMA will make vigilance a priority, and will continue to effectively supervise the liquidity and market risk management of AIs.\n\n# Follow-up actions on lessons drawn from the 2023 banking turmoil\n\nThe HKMA will implement the follow-up actions identified in the internal review that it undertook in response to the 2023 banking turmoil in the US and Europe. These are actions that will further strengthen supervisory effectiveness and enhance its ability to handle a banking crisis should one arise. They include enhancing the risk capture of AIs’ interest rate risk in the banking book in the context of the HKMA’s supervisory review process, improving the preparedness of AIs for dealing with liquidity stresses given the continuing digitalisation of banking services, streamlining the HKMA’s crisis management processes, and further enhancing interagency and cross-border supervisory co-ordination.\n\n# Operational and technology risk\n\nThe HKMA will continue to monitor AIs’ progress towards achieving full compliance with the HKMA Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module OR-2 on “Operational Resilience”, and assess and benchmark banks’ tolerance limits for plausible disruptions, with a view to enhancing the overall resilience of the banking system. With respect to cyber risk, we will oversee a new round of self-assessments by AIs under the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 and monitor AIs’ implementation of a secure tertiary data backup to enhance their data recovery capabilities if faced with destructive cyber attacks.\n\nGiven the accelerating pace of digitalisation in banking operations, the HKMA will keep a close watch on emerging risks arising from the use of advanced technologies such as generative artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology. We will also collaborate with banks and other relevant stakeholders in operating an agile and pre-emptive mechanism to counter the growing trend of digital fraud.\n\n# Combatting money laundering and terrorist financing\n\nIn 2024, to uphold the integrity of the banking system and build customer confidence, the HKMA will target high-risk areas and prioritise risk-based regulatory updates, including issuing guidance to support an effective, risk-based implementation of changes to requirements for politically exposed persons, and supporting the implementation of the regulatory regime for stablecoin issuers. We will also issue guidance to help AIs optimise their transaction monitoring systems and to promote the responsible use of artificial intelligence, and focus on controls targeting high-end money laundering through our thematic work. To strengthen the ecosystem response to digital fraud and reduce losses to victims, we will further consult the public and the industry on a proposal to expand the scope of bank-to-bank information sharing from corporate accounts to personal accounts and, based on the feedback received, pursue necessary legislative amendments. We will move to a full build of Macro Analytics 3.0 by pooling data relevant to anti-money laundering across multiple banks and interfacing this with existing ecosystem fraud analysis. This will deliver more rapid cross-bank responses and further enhance our datadriven anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism supervision, enabling us to take quicker, more decisive action against systemic money laundering and terrorist financing risks.\n\n# Wealth management and Mandatory Provident Fundrelated businesses\n\nIn 2024, the HKMA will step up both its on-site examinations and off-site surveillance of AIs’ conduct in relation to wealth management and the selling of securities, investment products, and insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses. More specifically, we will focus on Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) business, digital distribution and advisory platforms, virtual asset (VA)-related products, long term insurance products and premium financing activities, taking into account the latest market developments as well as evolving international standards.\n\nThe HKMA will communicate closely with fellow regulators and the banking industry to provide guidance on regulatory standards in relation to the sale of investment, insurance and MPF products as appropriate. In particular, to support the sustainable and responsible development of the VA sector, we will continue to work with the Government and fellow regulators to ensure that the regulatory regime in place for the VA sector is robust, comprehensive and well-balanced.\n\nThe HKMA will facilitate and monitor the industry’s implementation of enhancements to Cross-boundary WMC, and continue to engage with the industry and relevant regulatory authorities in order to further enhance the scheme. We will also continue to work with fellow regulators and the industry to streamline the selling process for investment products, and will consolidate and clarify guidance, as appropriate, to facilitate industry compliance. In addition to trust business, we will also commence the supervision of new Type 13 regulated activity under the Securities and Futures Ordinance for AIs providing depositary services for collective investment schemes authorised by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), which will come into operation on 2 October 2024.\n\n# Oversight of financial market infrastructures\n\nThe HKMA aims to promote the safety and efficiency of the financial market infrastructures (FMIs) under its oversight in accordance with the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO), the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMI) and the various guidance issued by the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI). We will continue to participate in the CPMI-IOSCO1 PFMI implementation monitoring and assessment exercise, and in other international working groups to discuss the implementation of new and innovative FMI-related initiatives. We will also participate in the work of international standard-setting bodies, and will review and strengthen our oversight requirements as appropriate to reflect the latest international practices as well as market and technology developments.\n\n# Policy development\n\nThe HKMA will continue to strengthen and refine its banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account international standards and best practices.\n\n# Implementation of Basel standards in Hong Kong\n\nThe proposed amendments to the Banking (Capital) Rules (BCR) and the Banking (Disclosure) Rules (BDR) for implementing the Basel III final reform package (Final Package) are expected to take effect on 1 January 2025 following the passage of the amended Rules in the Legislative Council. In 2024, the HKMA will continue to prepare the supporting guidance, banking returns and standard disclosure templates and tables needed to facilitate the application of the Rules. In particular, we plan to:\n- consult the industry in the second quarter of 2024 on the revisions to the SPM module CA-B-3 on “Countercyclical Capital Buffer (CCyB)–Geographic Allocation of Private Sector Credit Exposures” and Return MA(BS)25 “Quarterly reporting on the Countercyclical Capital Buffer”, reflecting the consequential changes arising from the implementation of the Final Package and the revised Return of International Banking Statistics; and\n- finalise the package for effecting the reporting-only requirement for the new standards on market and credit valuation adjustment risks, which starts on 1 July 2024.\n\nThose parts of the proposed amendments to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules (BELR) and the Banking (Liquidity) Rules (BLR) that are largely consequential to the implementation of the Final Package under the amended BCR are also targeted to take effect on 1 January 2025. The HKMA plans to finalise the proposed consequential amendments to the related regulatory returns in 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, with a new standard on the prudential treatment of banks’ crypto-asset exposures and subsequent targeted revisions to the standard having been issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December 2022 and December 2023 respectively, local implementation of the standard is planned for 2025. The HKMA will examine the need for potential legislative amendments to various sets of rules, including the BCR, the BDR, the BELR and the BLR, and conduct the statutory consultation on the necessary rule amendments in the first half of 2025.\n\n# Other supervisory policies and risk management guidelines\n\nThe HKMA plans to update a number of SPM modules in response to lessons learned from the banking turmoil in the US and Europe of March 2023, as well as developments in regulatory requirements and international standards. These modules include:\n", "zh": "# 2024年及其以後的優先事項\n\n邁向2024年，香港經濟預計將在 inbound 旅遊業、公共基建項目和私營消費穩步復甦的帶動下，持續適度復甦。然而，外部環境充滿風險與不確定性，尤其是有關未來美國政策利率走勢、全球經濟增長前景及地緣政治局勢的演變。儘管如此，鑑於經濟韌性與多年累積的充裕緩衝，香港的金融體系仍能較好地應對逆境衝擊。\n\n金管局高度重視維護香港的貨幣金融穩定。展望未來，我們將保持警覺，密切關注宏觀經濟環境中的新興風險，並迅速作出靈活反應。同時，我們將積極把握機遇，為政策創造空間，進一步鞏固香港作為國際金融中心的地位。在管理外匯基金時，面對挑戰重重的投資環境，我們將持續謹慎投資，同時保持彈性，採取防禦措施，並維持高流動性水平。\n\n# 金融體系的穩健與誠信\n\n近年來的全球經濟不確定性預計將在2024年持續。金管局將密切關注最新發展趨勢，保持警覺，防範潛在風險，並致力於維護金融體系的韌性與穩定，這是持續提供關鍵金融服務支持香港經濟正常運作的基石。\n\n# 持續警覺潛在風險\n\n展望2024年，受美國貨幣政策前景不明、地緣政治風險演變及全球經濟復甦不均的影響，全球金融市場可能出現波動。2024年也是多個重點選舉年的關鍵年份，全球多個主要國家的選舉結果或將進一步增加市場不確定性。儘管如此，鑑於香港的韌性和多年的緩衝積累，香港的金融系統有能力應對不利震盪。金管局擁有相應的能力、資源與承諾，保障香港的貨幣金融穩定。\n\n我們將持續努力密切監察國內外環境中的風險與脆弱性，在必要時採取適當措施，確保香港的貨幣金融穩定。同時，我們也會進行相關經濟研究，評估並應對潛在的風險。\n\n# 維持銀行業穩定\n\n2023年，全球新一輪地緣政治緊張局勢爆發，其他局勢仍未解決，導致政治不確定與動盪，這一趨勢預計將持續到2024年。高企的利率成為全球經濟的特徵，截至2024年，利率仍維持在較高水平。在銀行業方面，不斷推動數碼轉型與新技術（包括人工智能）的落實，帶來諸多優勢，但同時也呈現新的營運和網絡安全風險，以及監管挑戰。在此動盪的政治、經濟和科技格局下，金管局努力確保銀行具備抗震能力，通過持續的監管工作來達成。此外，我們將不斷完善銀行監管架構與政策，並且考慮技術發展、客戶期待的變化，以及國際標準與最佳實踐。\n\n# 以風險為本的監管重點\n\n# 信貸、流動性及市場風險\n\n鑑於宏觀經濟形勢日益嚴峻，金管局將特別關注認可機構（AIs）的資產質素，評估其信貸風險管理與控制的成效，尤其是貸款分類、撥備及問題貸款管理。我们也將與銀行及商業界保持密切對話，確保AIs在經濟週期內在審慎信貸管理與履行金融中介職能之間取得適當平衡。特別是，我們將通過銀行業中小企貸款協調機制，跟進2024年3月推出的九項新措施，協助中小企獲得銀行融資。\n\n全球經濟前景的不確定性及地緣政治緊張局勢升高，可能導致資產價格與跨境資金流的波動加劇。金管局將優先保持警惕，並繼續有效監督AIs的流動性及市場風險管理。\n\n# 追蹤2023年銀行危機經驗的後續措施\n\n金管局將實施在內部審查中識別的後續措施，以強化監管效能，應對2023年美國與歐洲銀行危機時的挑戰，並為可能出現的銀行危機做好準備。這包括提升銀行帳內利率風險監管、改善面對數碼化銀行服務背景下的流動性壓力準備、精簡危機管理流程、以及加強跨機構與跨境監管合作。\n\n# 營運與科技風險\n\n我們將持續監測AIs在全面落實《監管政策手冊》（SPM）模組OR-2“運作韌性”的進展，並評估銀行對潛在中斷的容忍度，以提升整體韌性。在網絡風險方面，將推行新一輪由AIs自我評估的《網絡韌性評估框架2.0》，並監控AIs實施安全的三重數據備份，以在面臨破壞性網絡攻擊時，提升數據恢復能力。\n\n隨著銀行運營數碼化步伐加快，金管局將密切關注由先進技術（如生成式人工智能和分布式帳本技術）帶來的新興風險，同時與銀行及相關持份者協作，建立敏捷且前瞻性的機制，以應對日益增長的數碼欺詐風險。\n\n# 打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集\n\n2024年，為確保銀行體系誠信與增強客戶信心，金管局將聚焦高風險領域，並優先推動以風險為本的監管措施，包括發布指南以支持針對政治人物（PEPs）規定的修改及實施穩定幣發行人監管制度。此外，我們將協助AIs優化交易監控系統，推動負責任的人工智能應用，並加強高端洗錢控制措施，特別是透過主題性工作提升反洗錢生態圈。在加強數碼欺詐風險的系統性應對方面，我們將進一步徵求公眾及行業意見，擬擴大銀行間資料分享範圍至個人帳戶，並根據反饋推動立法修訂。同時，我們將推動整合跨銀行資料，運用Macro Analytics 3.0，加強反洗錢和反恐怖融資目標的資料驅動監管，提升應對系統性洗錢及恐怖分子資金流動的反應速度與決策能力。\n\n# 財富管理及強制性公積金相關業務\n\n2024年，金管局將加強對AIs在財富管理、證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（MPF）相關業務的現場審核與非現場監控。特別是，將關注跨境理財通（Cross-boundary WMC）、數碼分銷與諮詢平台、虛擬資產（VA）產品、長期保險及保費融資業務，並根據市場最新動態與國際標準調整監管措施。\n\n金管局將與同行監管機構密切溝通，發布有關投資、保險及MPF產品銷售的監管指引，特別是支援VA產業的可持續與負責任發展。我們亦將推動和監察跨境WMC的提升計劃，並與行業及相關監管單位協作，進一步優化相關流程。除了信託業務外，我們亦會開始監管根據證券及期貨條例第13類受規管活動提供存放服務的認可機構，該規定於2024年10月2日生效。\n\n# 監管金融市場基建\n\n我們將致力於推動金融市場基建（FMIs）的安全與效率，按照《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（PSSVFO）、《金融市場基建原則》（PFMI）及支付及金融基建委員會（CPMI）發布的指引進行監管。我們將持續參與CPMI–IOSCO PFMI落實監測與評估，並加入其他國際工作組，討論新型創新金融市場基建倡議的實施。此外，我們將配合國際標準制定機構的工作內容，重新評估並加強監管要求，以反映最新的國際實踐及市場與技術變化。\n\n# 政策制定\n\n金管局將繼續強化和完善其銀行監管和政策框架，並結合國際標準與最佳實踐進行調整。\n\n# 實施巴塞爾標準於香港\n\n預計於2025年1月1日實施的巴塞爾III最終改革方案（Final Package）修訂《銀行業（資本）規則》（BCR）與《銀行業（披露）規則》（BDR），已經立法會通過，屆時將正式生效。2024年，我們將準備相應指南、銀行申報表及標準披露模板，以支持規則的落實。特別是，我們計劃：\n- 在2024年第二季度，向行業咨詢《監管政策手冊》（SPM）模組CA-B-3“逆周期資本緩衝（CCyB）——私營部門信貸敞口的地理配置”及《申報表》MA(BS)25“逆周期資本緩衝季度報告”的修訂方案，反映Final Package與國際銀行統計申報表修訂帶來的變化；\n- 最終確定新標準在市場及信用估值調整風險方面的申報規定，該規定自2024年7月1日開始。\n\n與此同時，與Final Package的落實基本相關的《銀行業（風險承擔限度）》規則（BELR）和《銀行業（流動性）》規則（BLR）的修訂內容，有望於2025年一月一日正式生效。金管局計劃在2024年完成相關申報表的修訂。\n\n另外，考慮到2022年12月和2023年12月，巴塞爾委員會分別發布了關於銀行加密資產敞口的審慎標準和相關修訂，我們預計2025年將在本地實施相關標準。屆時，我們將評估可能的立法修訂需求，包括《銀行業（資本）規則》、《銀行業（披露）》規則、《銀行業（資本）緩衝》規則及《銀行業（流動性）》規則，並在2025年上半年展開必要的立法咨詢。\n\n# 其他監管政策與風險管理指南\n\n基於2023年3月美國及歐洲銀行危機經驗及其他監管國際標準的最新發展，金管局將更新多個《監管政策手冊》模組，以鞏固監管成效並適應新形勢，內容包括："}
{"en": "# About the HKMA\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is Hong Kong’s central banking institution. The HKMA has four main functions:\n- maintaining currency stability within the framework of the Linked Exchange Rate System;\n- promoting the stability and integrity of the financial system, including the banking system;\n- helping to maintain Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre, including the maintenance and development of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure; and\n- managing the Exchange Fund.\n\n# HKMA’s legal mandate\n\nThe HKMA was established on 1 April 1993 after the Legislative Council passed amendments to the Exchange Fund Ordinance in 1992 empowering the Financial Secretary to appoint a Monetary Authority.\n\nThe powers, functions and responsibilities of the Monetary Authority are set out in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the Banking Ordinance, the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance, the Deposit Protection Scheme Ordinance, the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, and other relevant Ordinances. The division of functions and responsibilities in monetary and financial affairs between the Financial Secretary and the Monetary Authority is set out in an exchange of letters dated 25 June 2003. The exchange of letters discloses delegations made by the Financial Secretary to the Monetary Authority. The letters are public documents and can be found on the HKMA website.\n\nThe Exchange Fund Ordinance establishes the Exchange Fund under the control of the Financial Secretary. According to the Ordinance, the Fund shall be used primarily for affecting the exchange value of the Hong Kong dollar. It may also be used (whilst having regard to its primary purpose) for maintaining the stability and integrity of the monetary and financial systems of Hong Kong, with a view to maintaining Hong Kong as an international financial centre.\n\nThe Monetary Authority is appointed under the Exchange Fund Ordinance to assist the Financial Secretary in performing his functions under the Exchange Fund Ordinance and to perform such other functions as are assigned by other Ordinances or by the Financial Secretary. The office of the Monetary Authority is known as the HKMA, and the Monetary Authority is the Chief Executive of the HKMA.\n\nThe Banking Ordinance provides the Monetary Authority with the responsibility and powers for regulating and supervising banking business and the business of taking deposits. Under the Ordinance, the Monetary Authority is responsible for the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong.\n\nThe Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance provides that the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for banking sector entities. The Monetary Authority is vested with a range of powers to effect the orderly resolution of a non-viable banking sector entity (the failure of which could pose systemic risk). The purpose is to maintain financial stability, while seeking to protect public funds.\n\nThe Securities and Futures Ordinance and the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Ordinance provide certain powers to the Monetary Authority regarding the securities and mandatory provident fund businesses of banks.\n\nThe Monetary Authority has been delegated with powers of inspection and investigation by the Insurance Authority under the Insurance Ordinance in relation to the insurance related businesses of banks.\n\nThe Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance empowers the Monetary Authority to supervise banks’ compliance with the customer due diligence and record-keeping requirements under the Ordinance.\n\nThe Deposit Protection Scheme Ordinance confers responsibility on the Monetary Authority to assist in the operation of the Deposit Protection Scheme and to trigger payment of compensation from the Deposit Protection Scheme Fund to depositors of a failed licensed bank.\n\nThe Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance provides a statutory regime for the Monetary Authority to designate and oversee certain significant clearing and settlement systems and retail payment systems operating in Hong Kong. It also empowers the Monetary Authority to administer a licensing regime for electronic and physical “facilities”, which are used to store monetary value and which meet the criteria specified in the Ordinance.", "zh": "關於金管局\n\n香港金融管理局是香港的中央銀行機構。金管局主要具有四項職能：\n- 在聯繫匯率制度框架下維持貨幣穩定；\n- 促進金融體系，包括銀行體系的穩定與完整；\n- 協助維持香港作為國際金融中心的地位，包括維護和發展香港的金融基建；\n- 管理外匯基金。\n\n金管局的法律授權\n\n金管局於1993年4月1日成立，此前立法會於1992年通過修改《外匯基金條例》，授權財政司司長委任貨幣當局。\n\n貨幣當局的權力、職能和責任在《外匯基金條例》、《銀行業條例》、《金融機構（破產程序）條例》、《存款保障計劃條例》、《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》及其他相關法例中規定。財政司司長與貨幣當局之間在金融及貨幣事務的職能分工，詳見2003年6月25日的信件交換。該信件披露了財政司司長授權於貨幣當局的委任。這些信件為公開文件，可在金管局網站查閱。\n\n《外匯基金條例》設立由財政司司長控制的外匯基金。根據該條例，該基金主要用於影響港幣的匯率價值，也可在注重其主要用途的前提下，用於維持香港貨幣及金融系統的穩定與完整，以促進香港作為國際金融中心之地位。\n\n貨幣當局由《外匯基金條例》委任，以協助財政司司長履行其根據該條例的職責，並執行其他由其他法例或財政司司長委派的職能。貨幣當局的辦公室稱為金管局，貨幣當局即為金管局的行政長官。\n\n《銀行業條例》授予貨幣當局規管和監督銀行業務及存款業務的責任與權力。根據該條例，貨幣當局負責對持牌銀行、限制牌照銀行和存款經營公司在香港的授權。\n\n《金融機構（破產程序）條例》規定貨幣當局為銀行業行業實體的破產處理機關。貨幣當局擁有一系列權力，以有序解決無法存續的銀行行業實體（其失敗可能造成系統性風險）。其目的是維護金融穩定，同時保護公共資金。\n\n《證券及期貨條例》和《強制性公積金計劃條例》為貨幣當局在證券和強制性公積金業務方面提供特定權力。\n\n貨幣當局已獲得保險業監管局根據《保險業條例》的監管授權，用於檢查和調查銀行相關保險業務的權力。\n\n《反洗錢及打擊恐怖分子資金籌集條例》授權貨幣當局監督銀行在該條例下的客戶盡職審查和記錄保存要求的合規情況。\n\n《存款保障計劃條例》賦予貨幣當局協助運作存款保障計劃的責任，並在保險機構倒閉時啟動存款保障基金向存款人支付賠償。\n\n《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》為貨幣當局提供法定制度，以指定和監管在香港運作的某些重要結算及交收系統以及零售支付系統。此外，也授權貨幣當局管理電子及實體“設施”的牌照制度，這些“設施”用於儲存貨幣值且符合條例中規定的標準。"}
{"en": "# Corporate Governance\n\nAs Hong Kong’s central banking institution, the HKMA is committed to high standards of corporate governance, as good governance is crucial in maintaining and safeguarding the trust and confidence of the public in the HKMA to fulfil its statutory mandate.\n\nTo achieve its commitment to good corporate governance, the HKMA:\n- puts in place a well-defined governance structure with a high degree of accountability;\n- exercises robust controls to manage risks and ensure that staff behaviours at all levels and its day-to-day operations are consistent with specified standards; and\n- pursues a policy of high transparency and accessibility, and keeps close contacts with stakeholders.\n\n# The HKMA and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government\n\nThe HKMA is an integral part of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government, but is able to employ staff on terms different from those of the civil service in order to attract personnel of the right experience and expertise. The Chief Executive of the HKMA and his staff are public officers. In its day-to-day work, the HKMA operates with a high degree of autonomy within the relevant statutory powers conferred upon, or delegated to, the Monetary Authority.\n\nThe Financial Secretary is responsible for determining the monetary policy objective and the structure of the monetary system of Hong Kong: a letter from the Financial Secretary to the Monetary Authority dated 25 June 2003 specifies that these should be currency stability defined as a stable exchange value at around HK$7.80 to one US dollar maintained by Currency Board arrangements. The Monetary Authority is on his own responsible for achieving the monetary policy objective, including determining the strategy, instruments and operational means for doing so. The Monetary Authority also has responsibilities in relation to the maintenance of the stability and integrity of the monetary system of Hong Kong.\n\nThe Financial Secretary, assisted by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, has responsibility for policies for maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s financial system and the status of Hong Kong as an international financial centre. In support of these policies, the Monetary Authority’s responsibilities include:\n- promoting the general stability and effective working of the banking system;\n- promoting the development of the debt market, in co-operation with other relevant bodies;\n- matters relating to the issuance and circulation of legal tender notes and coins;\n- promoting the safety and efficiency of the financial infrastructure through the development of payment, clearing and settlement systems and, where appropriate, the operation of these systems; and\n- seeking to promote, in co-operation with other relevant bodies, confidence in Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems, and market development initiatives to help strengthen the international competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial services.\n\nThe Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary. The Monetary Authority, under delegation from the Financial Secretary, is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the use of the Exchange Fund, and for the investment management of the Fund.\n\n# Accountability and transparency\n\nThe autonomy given to the HKMA in its day-to-day operations, and in the methods it uses to pursue policy objectives determined by the Government, is complemented by a high degree of accountability and transparency.\n\nThe HKMA serves Hong Kong by promoting monetary and banking stability, by managing the official reserves effectively, and by developing and overseeing a robust and diverse financial infrastructure. These processes help to strengthen Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre and to foster Hong Kong’s economic well-being.\n\nThe HKMA must have the confidence of the community if it is to perform its duties well. The HKMA therefore takes seriously the duty of explaining its policies and work to the general public and makes every effort to address any concerns within the community relevant to the HKMA’s responsibilities. In particular, the HKMA makes timely clarifications on misinformation and rumours about the HKMA’s policies via traditional and social media.\n\nThe HKMA is accountable to the people of Hong Kong through the Financial Secretary, who appoints the Monetary Authority, and through the laws passed by the Legislative Council that set out the Monetary Authority’s powers and responsibilities. The HKMA also recognises a broader responsibility to promote a better understanding of its roles and objectives and to keep itself informed of community concerns. In its day-to-day operations and in its wider contacts with the community, the HKMA pursues a policy of transparency and accessibility. This policy has two main objectives:\n- to keep the financial industry and the public as fully informed about the work of the HKMA as possible, subject to considerations of market sensitivity, commercial confidentiality and statutory restrictions on disclosure of confidential information; and\n- to ensure that the HKMA is in touch with, and responsive to, the community it serves.\n\nThe HKMA seeks to follow international best practices in its transparency arrangements. It maintains extensive relations with the mass media and produces a range of regular and special publications in both English and Chinese. The HKMA’s bilingual website (www.hkma.gov.hk) carries a large number of HKMA publications, press releases, speeches and presentations, in addition to dedicated sections on research, statistics, regulatory resources, consumer information and other topics. Social media platforms are also used to communicate with the public more efficiently in the digital era. The HKMA maintains an Information Centre at its offices, consisting of a library and an exhibition area, which is open to the public six days a week. Further information on the HKMA’s work on public communications and engagement is contained in the Corporate Functions chapter on pages 185 to 193.\n\nOver the years, the HKMA has progressively increased the detail and frequency of its disclosure of information on the Exchange Fund and Currency Board Accounts. Since 1999, the HKMA has participated in the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard project for central banks. The HKMA publishes records of meetings of the Currency Board Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee and the reports on Currency Board operations. The supervisory policies and guidelines on banking have been published on the HKMA website since 1996.\n\nThe relations between the HKMA and the Legislative Council play an important part in promoting accountability and transparency. There is a formal commitment from the Chief Executive of the HKMA to appear before the Panel on Financial Affairs of the Legislative Council three times a year to brief Members and to answer questions on the HKMA’s work. Representatives from the HKMA attend Legislative Council panel and committee meetings from time to time to explain and discuss particular issues and to assist Members in their scrutiny of draft legislation.\n\n# Controls\n\nThe HKMA adopts robust internal and external control mechanisms to ensure that it upholds a high standard of staff conduct, prudent risk management as well as appropriate checks and balances. Internal and external audit functions provide independent assessment on the adequacy and effectiveness of the control mechanisms.\n\n# Code of Conduct\n\nA Code of Conduct, which provides guidance to staff on their ethical and legal responsibilities, is in place to ensure that staff behaviours are consistent with specified standards at all levels.\n\n# Internal controls\n\n# Operational controls\n\nAll departments and divisions have ownership and responsibility to identify and assess risks of their operational processes and put in place appropriate controls for ensuring proper day-to-day operations of the HKMA.

{"en": "# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nDespite a challenging external environment, the Hong Kong economy staged a positive growth in 2023, thanks to the revivals in inbound tourism and domestic demand. The labour market continued to improve alongside the economic recovery, while inflation remained moderate. Asset markets remained soft amid tightened financial conditions and weak market sentiment. Economic activities for 2024 are expected to recover further at a moderate pace, although the outlook is clouded by multiple external uncertainties.\n\n# The economy in review\n\n# Real activities\n\nHaving navigated through the severe challenges posed by the pandemic in the previous year, the Hong Kong economy grew steadily by 3.2% in 2023 (Table 1 and Chart 1). Domestically, private consumption recovered notably on the back of improved labour market conditions and various support initiatives introduced by the Government, such as the Consumption Voucher Scheme and a series of promotional campaigns. Despite tightened financial conditions, overall investment expenditure registered significant growth against a low base of comparison from the previous year. Externally, Hong Kong’s exports of services rebounded, due mainly to the robust revival of inbound tourism. However, their positive impact on growth was more than offset by the strong recovery in outbound tourism, which was measured as imports of services. On the other hand, exports of goods remained lacklustre amid weak external demand, and put a drag on Hong Kong’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth.\n\nChart 1 Real GDP growth by contribution\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\nTable 1 Real GDP growth by expenditure component (period-over-period)\nNote: The seasonally-adjusted quarter-on-quarter rates of change in the gross domestic fixed capital formation are not available.\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\n# Inflation\n\nLocal inflation remained moderate in 2023 as external price pressures gradually eased, while domestic cost pressures remained broadly in check despite rising slightly as the economy recovered (Chart 2)1. For 2023 as a whole, the underlying and headline inflation rates were 1.7% and 2.1% respectively.\n\n# Labour market\n\nLabour market conditions improved further in 2023, with the unemployment rate falling to a decade-low level of 2.8% in July and hovering at a low level for the remaining months of the year2 (Chart 3). Both labour demand and labour supply increased, as reflected respectively by the pick-up in total employment (Chart 3) and in the labour force. In view of Hong Kong’s manpower shortages, the Government rolled out various labour importation schemes3 and talent attraction initiatives4 in 2023. Meanwhile, with tight labour market conditions, the year-on-year growth rates of nominal wages and of labour earnings increased gradually towards their pre-pandemic levels.\n\nChart 2 Underlying consumer price inflation\n\nChart 3 Labour market conditions\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\n# Stock market\n\nAfter stabilising in early 2023, the local stock market turned sluggish in the second half. Extending its rebound in late 2022, the Hang Seng Index rose to a year-high daily close of 22,689 on 27 January 2023. It then retreated and dropped further to low levels by December (Chart 4), reflecting weak market sentiment due to the banking sector problems in the US and Switzerland in March, as well as weaker global economic prospects and tightened financial conditions in the second half. The Hang Seng Index closed the year at 17,047, down notably by 13.8% from the end of 2022, and marking the fourth consecutive year of decline.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market experienced a rebound in the first four months of 2023 on the back of the resumption of normalcy in the Mainland and Hong Kong, but softened subsequently alongside rising mortgage rates5 and weak market sentiment. Overall, housing prices dropped by 6.9% year on year in 2023, while housing transactions further declined by 4.5% to a record-low of 43,002 units. Housing affordability remained stretched despite improving slightly along with the downward adjustment of housing prices. Similarly, the non-residential property markets continued to face headwinds, with prices of offices, retail premises and flatted factories softened further. The rentals for offices remained under pressure due to high vacancy rates amid the increasing prevalence of work-from-home arrangements and large supply. On the other hand, the rentals for retail premises increased in 2023 with the revival of inbound tourism and the improvement in private consumption.\n\nChart 4 Asset prices\nSources: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited\n\n# Outlook for the economy\n\n# Economic environment\n\nIn 2024, the Hong Kong economy is expected to continue its recovery at a moderate pace. Inbound tourism is set to expand further alongside the continuous improvement in handling capacity and the Government’s effort to promote mega events, while local consumption activities should be supported by a steady labour market. The various infrastructure projects to be taken forward by the Government will also lend support to the economy. Meanwhile, Hong Kong’s exports of goods will likely stabilise alongside the expected upturn in the global technology cycle. The Government forecasts real GDP to grow steadily by 2.5% –3.5% in 20246. However, the outlook is clouded by multiple risks and uncertainties, including those stemming from the US policy rate path, the pace of technology cycle recovery, the prospects for global economic growth, and evolving geopolitical tensions.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nLocal inflation is expected to remain mild in 2024, with softened external price pressures helping to offset the upward pressures on domestic costs amid further economic recovery and rising housing rentals. Market consensus forecasts a headline inflation rate of 2.1% in 2024, while the Government projects the headline and underlying inflation rates to be 2.4% and 1.7% respectively. On the other hand, the labour market is expected to be supported by the ongoing economic recovery, while the various labour importation and talent attraction schemes will continue to help alleviate manpower shortages across different industries.\n\n# Performance of the banking sector\n\nIn 2023, the Hong Kong banking sector faced a number of challenges including a high interest rate environment, heightened volatility in global financial markets caused by the March banking turmoil in the US and Europe, and a slowerthan-expected economic recovery in the Mainland and Hong Kong. Despite these multiple headwinds, the Hong Kong banking sector remained sound and continued to be supported by strong capital and liquidity buffers. The asset quality of the banking sector remained healthy despite an increase in the classified loan ratio. The profitability of banks improved notably, driven by higher net interest income.\n\n# Asset quality\n\nThe classified loan ratio of the banking sector rose to 1.56% at the end of 2023 from 1.40% at the end of 2022, with the overdue and rescheduled loan ratio increasing to 1.24% from 0.85% during the same period (Chart 5). The classified loan ratio for Mainland-related lending also rose to 2.58% at the end of 2023 from 2.26% a year before. The increase in the classified loan ratio was mainly due to downgrades of exposures to Mainland property developers. Nevertheless, the provisions set aside by banks remained sufficient. The provision coverage ratio (i.e.  total provisions to classified loans) stood at 75% at the end of 2023. If the market value of collateral held against the classified loans is taken into account, the adjusted provision coverage ratio would reach around 145%. Meanwhile, the delinquency ratios of residential mortgage lending and credit card lending remained low, at 0.08% and 0.30% respectively, at the end of 2023 (Chart 6).\n\nChart 5 Asset quality of the banking sector\nNote: Figures cover Hong Kong offices, overseas branches and major overseas subsidiaries.\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 6 Delinquency ratios of residential mortgage lending and credit card lending\nSource: HKMA\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe banking sector recorded notable profit growth in 2023. The aggregate pre-tax operating profit of retail banks increased by 62.1% in the year, while the post-tax return on average assets rose to 0.89% from 0.57% during the same period (Chart 7). The improvement in profit was predominantly the result of an increase in net interest income (+30%), coupled with a significant gain in investments held for trading in 2023 as compared to a mild loss in the previous year. This was partly offset by an increase in loan impairment charges (+28%), as specific provisions were set aside for new classified loans. Against the backdrop of rising interest rates, the net interest margin of retail banks widened to 1.68% in 2023 from 1.31% a year before (Chart 8). Meanwhile, retail banks’ cost-to-income ratio fell to 38.8% in 2023 from 48.0% in 2022 (Chart 9).\n\nChart 7 Retail banks’ performance\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 8 Retail banks’ net interest margin\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 9 Retail banks’ cost-to-income ratio\nSource: HKMA\n\n# Balance sheet trends\n\nThe banking sector’s balance sheet grew by 0.9% in 2023, as growths in negotiable debt instruments held (+8.6%) and interbank lending (+4.4%) were mostly offset by a decline in total loans. Given the subdued loan demand amid higher borrowing costs and a weakened global economic outlook, total loans decreased by 3.6% in 2023. Of the total loans, loans for use in Hong Kong remained broadly stable (-0.4%), while loans for use outside Hong Kong and trade finance decreased by 10.4% and 13.1% respectively. Mainlandrelated lending fell by 6.6% in 2023.\n\nOn the liability side, total deposits rose by 5.1% in 2023, compared with a growth of 1.7% in 2022. As total loans declined while total deposits grew, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio decreased to 62.8% at the end of 2023 from 68.5% a year before (Chart 10).\n\n# Capital adequacy\n\nThe banking sector remained well capitalised in 2023. The consolidated total capital ratio of locally incorporated authorized institutions (AIs) stood at 21.1% at the end of 2023, compared with 20.1% a year before. The Tier 1 capital ratio was 18.9% (Chart 11). Both ratios were well above their respective international minimum requirements. The Basel III leverage ratio was 7.9% at the end of 2023 (Chart 12).\n\nChart 10 Loans and deposits of the banking sector\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 11 Consolidated capital ratios of locally incorporated AIs\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 12 Consolidated leverage ratio of locally incorporated AIs\nSource: HKMA\n\n# Liquidity conditions\n\nThe banking sector continued to maintain a strong liquidity position. The quarterly average Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) of category 1 institutions was 178.6% in the fourth quarter of 2023, and the quarterly average Liquidity Maintenance Ratio (LMR) of category 2 institutions was 65.7% (Chart 13). The main source of funding for the banking sector continued to be customer deposits. The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) of category 1 institutions and the Core Funding Ratio (CFR) of category 2A institutions were 144.4% and 169.4% respectively at the end of 2023 (Chart 14). All four ratios were well above the statutory minimum requirements.\n\nChart 13 Liquidity ratios of designated AIs\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 14 Funding ratios of designated AIs\nSource: HKMA\n", "zh": "# 經濟及金融環境\n\n儘管外部環境充滿挑戰，2023年香港經濟仍取得正面增長，主要得益於入境旅遊和內需的復甦。隨著經濟回升，勞動市場繼續改善，而通脹率則保持適中。在資產市場方面，由於金融條件收緊和市場情緒低迷，市況仍較趨軟。展望2024年，經濟活動預計將以溫和速度進一步復甦，然而多重外部不確定因素仍使前景布滿陰影。\n\n# 回顧經濟\n\n# 實體活動\n\n經歷上年度疫情帶來的嚴峻挑戰後，2023年香港經濟穩定增長3.2%（表1及圖1）。內需方面，由於勞動市場條件改善及政府推出的多項支援措施，如消費券計劃及一系列促銷活動，私人消費顯著回升。儘管金融狀況收緊，但整體投資支出仍能在基數較低的情況下錄得較大增長。對外方面，香港的服務出口反彈，主要受入境旅遊強勁復甦推動。然而，出口的正面貢獻被由出境旅遊回復帶來的服務進口的增加所抵消。另一方面，由於外需疲軟，貨物出口表現平平，拖累香港的國內生產總值（GDP）增長。\n\n圖1 實質GDP按貢獻程度划分的增長\n資料來源：統計處\n\n表1 按支出組成劃分的實質GDP增長（比較期）\n註：未提供季節調整後的環比變動率。\n資料來源：統計處\n\n# 通脹\n\n2023年，香港的本地通脹保持適中，外部價格壓力逐步緩解，而盡管經濟復甦帶動成本上升，本地成本壓力仍大致受到控制（圖2）1。全年看，基本與整體通脹率分別為1.7%和2.1%。\n\n# 勞動市場\n\n2023年，勞動市場進一步改善，失業率在7月降至10年最低的2.8%，年底前一直保持在較低水平2（圖3）。勞動需求與供應同步增加，反映在就業人數（圖3）和勞動力數量的提升上。鑑於香港人力短缺，政府推出多項輸入勞工方案3和人才引進措施4。受到緊俏的勞動市場影響，名義工資與勞動收入的年增率逐步回升，接近疫情前水平。\n\n圖2 消費者物價通脹（基本）\n\n圖3 勞動市場狀況\n資料來源：統計處\n\n# 股票市況\n\n2023年初市場震盪後，香港股市在下半年轉趨低迷。在2022年末的反彈基礎上，恆生指數於2023年1月27日達到年內高點22,689點，但隨後回落，至12月進一步下跌（圖4），反映由於美國和瑞士銀行業危機（3月）及全球經濟前景疲弱、金融條件收緊所帶來的市場情緒低迷。恆指全年收於17,047點，較2022年末下跌13.8%，連續第四年下滑。\n\n# 物業市場\n\n2023年首四個月，香港住宅物業市場在內地及香港恢復常態的背景下出現反彈，但隨著按揭利率上升5及市況低迷，逐步轉弱。整體而言，2023年房價同比下跌6.9%，成交量進一步下滑4.5%，創新低達43,002宗。儘管房價有所下調，居住負擔能力仍然偏緊。非住宅物業市場亦持續遇阻，商用、零售及工廠物業價格進一步下跌。由於空置率高企及「在家工作」普及，商用物業租金仍承壓，而隨著入境旅遊回暖和私人消費改善，零售物業租金在2023年則上升。\n\n圖4 資產價格\n資料來源：評定及估價署及香港交易所\n\n# 經濟展望\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n展望2024年，香港經濟預計將以溫和步伐持續復甦。入境旅遊有望進一步擴展，配合處理能力的持續提升及政府推動大型活動的努力，內需亦將獲得勞動市場的支撐。基建工程等多項重大項目亦將為經濟提供援助。同時，隨著全球科技週期的預期復甦，香港商品出口料將穩定，經濟增長預計在2.5%至3.5%之間，政府預測2024年實質GDP將穩步增長（參考6）。不過，前景仍受多重風險和不確定性影響，包括美國政策利率走向、科技週期復甦速度、全球經濟增長前景與地緣政治緊張局勢不斷演變。\n\n# 通脹與勞動市場\n\n2024年，香港本地通脹預計將保持溫和，外部價格壓力的緩解有助於抵消內部成本上升，經濟進一步復甦和房租上漲亦將提供支援。市場普遍預測2024年的整體通脹率為2.1%，政府則預測頭條與基本通脹率分別為2.4%及1.7%。勞動市場則預期持續受到經濟復甦的支撐，多項輸入勞工和人才引進計劃將繼續幫助緩解行業間的人手短缺。\n\n# 銀行業表現\n\n2023年，香港銀行業面對諸多挑戰，包括高利率環境、由美國及歐洲銀行業危機（3月）引發的金融市場波動，以及內地及香港經濟復甦放緩。儘管如此，銀行業仍保持穩健，資本及流動性充足。雖然不良貸款比率有所上升，但資產質素依然健康，盈利亦因淨利息收入增加而大幅改善。\n\n# 資產質素\n\n2023年底，銀行業的不良貸款比率升至1.56%，較2022年末的1.40%有所上升，而逾期及經重組貸款比率由0.85%升至1.24%（圖5）。與內地相關貸款的比率亦由2.26%升至2.58%。不良貸款比率的上升主要由於調降內地房地產開發商的曝險級別，然而，銀行仍為此撥備充足，撥備覆蓋率（總撥備與不良貸款之比）為75%。若以抵押品市值調整，修正後的撥備覆蓋率可達約145%。此外，住宅按揭及信用卡的拖欠率保持低位，分別為0.08%及0.30%（圖6）。\n\n圖5 銀行業資產質素\n註：數據涵蓋香港辦事處、海外分行及主要海外附属公司。\n資料來源：香港金融管理局\n\n圖6 住宅按揭及信用卡拖欠率\n資料來源：香港金融管理局\n\n# 盈利趨勢\n\n2023年銀行業盈利顯著提升。零售銀行的稅前年營運利潤合計同比增長62.1%，稅後平均資產回報率升至0.89%，前年度為0.57%（圖7）。盈利改善主要由於淨利息收入提升30%，以及2023年交易持有投資的利得大幅增加，而去年則出現輕微虧損。這部分由於新不良貸款設立撥備所致。在利率上升背景下，零售銀行的淨息差由去年1.31%擴大至1.68%（圖8），同時，成本收入比由2022年的48.0%下降至38.8%（圖9）。\n\n圖7 零售銀行表現\n資料來源：香港金融管理局\n\n圖8 零售銀行淨息差\n資料來源：香港金融管理局\n\n圖9 零售銀行成本收益比\n資料來源：香港金融管理局\n\n# 資產負債表趨勢\n\n2023年，銀行業資產負債表增長0.9%，其中可轉讓債務工具（增長8.6%）和銀行同業借款（增長4.4%）的增加大致被貸款總額的下降抵消。由於貸款需求偏弱，加上利率上升及全球經濟前景黯淡，2023年貸款總額跌3.6%。其中，用於香港的貸款基本持平，下降0.4%，而用於境外及貿易融資的貸款分別下跌10.4%和13.1%。內地相關貸款則減少6.6%。\n\n在負債端，2023年存款總額增長5.1%，較2022年的1.7%顯著加快。由於貸款收縮而存款增加，整體貸存比由去年末的68.5%降至62.8%（圖10）。\n\n# 資本充足率\n\n2023年，銀行業資本狀況良好。本地認可機構（AIs）合併資本充足率為21.1%，較去年20.1%上升，第一級資本比率為18.9%（圖11），均遠高於國際最低標準。巴塞爾III杠桿比率在2023年末為7.9%（圖12）。\n\n圖10 銀行業貸款與存款\n資料來源：香港金融管理局\n\n圖11 本地認可機構的合併資本比率\n資料來源：香港金融管理局\n\n圖12 本地認可機構的合併杠桿比率\n資料來源：香港金融管理局\n\n# 流動性狀況\n\n銀行業持續維持強健的流動性。2023年第4季度，第一類機構的季平均流動性覆蓋比率（LCR）為178.6%，第二類機構的季平均流動性維持比率（LMR）為65.7%（圖13）。銀行行業的主要融資來源仍為客戶存款。2023年底，第一類機構的淨穩定資金比率（NSFR）為144.4%，第二類A機構的核心融資比率（CFR）為169.4%，均遠高於法定最低要求（圖14）。\n\n圖13 指定AIs的流動性比率\n資料來源：香港金融管理局\n\n圖14 指定AIs的融資比率\n資料來源：香港金融管理局"}
{"en": "# Monetary Stability\n\nIn 2023, amid market expectations of a “high for longer” US policy rate, the Hong Kong dollar mostly traded on the weak side of the Convertibility Zone, with the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking being triggered eight times between mid-February and early May.  The Hong Kong dollar had regained some momentum since May and traded around the central parity rate of 7.8 at year end.  Under the Linked Exchange Rate System, which marked its 40th anniversary in 2023, the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates generally track their US dollar counterparts, while also being affected by local supply and demand.  Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets remained stable and traded in a smooth and orderly manner.  As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, the Linked Exchange Rate System has shown its strength and resilience to various external shocks time after time.\n\n# Objectives\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability.  This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1.  The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n- Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks;\n- Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation;\n- The Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of clearing account balances kept with the HKMA; and\n- Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs).  With the HKMA standing ready to sell (or buy) Hong Kong dollars to (or from) banks in exchange for US dollars upon request at HK$7.75 (or HK$7.85) per US dollar when the strong-side (or weak-side) CU is triggered, the Aggregate Balance will expand (or contract) to push down (or up) Hong Kong dollar interest rates, helping move the Hong Kong dollar back to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85.\n\n# Review of 2023\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nAmid the market expectation of a “high for longer” US policy rate, the Hong Kong dollar remained soft and mostly traded on the weak side of the Convertibility Zone throughout 2023.  The weak-side CU was triggered eight times from mid-February to early May.  The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate regained some strength during early May to July, partly driven by dividend payment-related demand from listed companies and half-year-end funding needs by corporates. Thereafter, the Hong Kong dollar was mainly driven by the changes in local funding demands, such as buying flows through the Southbound Stock Connect, and traded around the central parity rate of 7.8 at year end (Chart 1).  Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market continued to function normally throughout 2023.\n\nChart 1 Market exchange rate in 2023\n\nFrom February to May, the HKMA purchased a total of HK$51.5 billion at the weak-side CU at the request of banks in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS).  Reflecting the triggering of the weak-side CU, the Aggregate Balance decreased from HK$96.3 billion at the end of 2022 to HK$45.0 billion at the end of 2023. Meanwhile, the outstanding EFBNs increased slightly from HK$1,200.4 billion to HK$1,245.5 billion during the year. The total of the Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs therefore declined from HK$1,296.7 billion at the end of 2022 to HK$1,290.4 billion at the end of 2023 (Chart 2). The Monetary Base as a whole remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\nChart 2 Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding Exchange Fund papers in 2023\n\n# Money market\n\nUnder the LERS, the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs) generally track their US dollar counterparts.  As the US continued to raise interest rates in the first seven months of 2023, the HIBORs generally rose (Chart 3).  For the year as a whole, the overnight, 1-month and 3-month HIBORs increased respectively by 286, 92 and 16 basis points to 6.09%, 5.27% and 5.15% at year end.\n\nFollowing the increases in the target range for the US federal funds rate, the Base Rate was adjusted upwards four times by a total of one percentage point (i.e. 100 basis points) from 4.75% to 5.75%.1 On the retail front, following the US policy rate hikes, many banks raised their Best Lending Rates by 12.5 basis points in early May and another 12.5 basis points in late July.  Some banks also increased the cap on HIBOR-based mortgage rates of newly approved mortgage loans during the year, and the average interest rate of new mortgage loans rose from 3.35% in 2022 to 4.13% in December 2023.  Overall, Hong Kong’s money markets continued to function normally.  Discount Window borrowing increased to HK$38.8 billion in 2023 from HK$8.4 billion in 2022 and no abnormality was noted in the relevant usage.\n\nChart 3 Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates in 2023\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nThe LERS has been a strong anchor of Hong Kong’s financial system for four decades and has shown its strength and resilience to challenges.  Despite lingering uncertainties surrounding the US interest rate path and global economic recovery, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to function in an orderly manner, reflecting the robustness of the LERS.  The Government is firmly committed to the LERS.  In its 2023 External Sector Report, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) once again reiterated that the credibility of the LERS has been ensured by a transparent set of rules, large fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nA robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS.  Hong Kong’s banking sector continued to operate smoothly with liquidity positions and capitalisation faring very well by international standards.  To ensure the resilience of the banking sector, the HKMA has been closely monitoring banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress testing results, and has maintained its supervisory efforts on bank lending.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of the Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) rose from 110.12% at the end of 2022 to a high of 112.71% on 4 May 2023, surpassing the Upper Trigger Level of 112.5% (Chart 4).  This largely reflected the contraction in the Aggregate Balance as a result of the triggering of the weak-side CU in the first half of the year2. In accordance with the arrangement approved by the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee and as a result of the redemption of Certificates of Indebtedness, assets were transferred out of the Backing Portfolio to the Investment Portfolio to reduce the Backing Ratio to around 109.97% on 8 May.  Thereafter, the Backing Ratio rose steadily to close at 110.73% on 31 December.  Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate.  The ample financial resources of the Exchange Fund, together with the sound banking system, provide a powerful backstop to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nChart 4 Daily movement of the Backing Ratio in 2023\n\n# Currency Board Sub-Committee\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong.  In 2023, the CBC considered issues including the May 2022 stablecoin market crash, the transmission of Federal Reserve’s dollar liquidity backstop measures to banks in Hong Kong, and the recent movements in the Hong Kong dollar interest rates.  Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Notes and coins\n\nThe below table summarises the value of the notes and coins in circulation at the end of 2023:\n\nChart 5 Banknotes in circulation by note-issuing banks at the end of 2023\n\nChart 6 Distribution of banknotes in circulation at the end of 2023\n\nChart 7 Banknotes in circulation at the end of 2023\n\nChart 8 Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation at the end of 2023\n\nChart 9 Breakdown of Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation at the end of 2023\n\n# Hong Kong banknotes\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA continued to organise seminars on the design and security features of Hong Kong banknotes for bank tellers, cashiers from retail establishments and students to help enhance their knowledge and skills in authenticating banknotes.  During 2023, 15 seminars were arranged for around 3,000 participants.\n\n# Coin Collection Programme\n\nThe Coin Collection Programme continued to be well received by the public.  More information about the Programme can be found in the Sustainable HKMA chapter of the Sustainability Report 2023.\n\n# Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\n\nThe EFBN Programme operated smoothly.  At the end of 2023, the nominal amount of outstanding Exchange Fund papers stood at around HK$1,255.4 billion (Table 2).\n\nTable 2 Outstanding issues of EFBNs\n\n# Monetary research\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMR)3, the research arm of the Hong Kong Academy of Finance, published 20 working papers and held 17 seminars/ webinars on monetary and financial research topics that are of strategic importance to Hong Kong and the region. The HKIMR also published six eJournals on the Social Science Research Network (SSRN) to disseminate research outputs to SSRN’s global research community.  Moreover, to provide the public with a high-level, non-technical summary of the recently published working papers, the HKIMR published two issues of Insights from Monetary Research.\n\nApart from its research activities, the HKIMR organised four international events, one roundtable and four seminars/ webinars with academia, global central banks and international financial institutions to promote dialogue and exchange on economic and financial issues:\n\n# 9 Mar\n\nA seminar on China’s Rebound: Recent Developments and Outlook by Dr Steven Alan Barnett, Senior Resident Representative in China of the IMF, and Dr Phakawa Jeasakul, Resident Representative for People’s Republic of China – Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) of the IMF, was held. Dr Barnett shared his views on the latest developments in the Chinese economy, as well as short- and medium-term issues that need to be addressed. More than 100 participants attended the seminar.\n\n# 17 Apr\n\nA seminar on Navigating Through a Challenging World was held. Four experts from the IMF shared their views on the analytical chapters of the most recent issues of World Economic Outlook and Global Financial Stability Report by the IMF. Over 50 participants attended the seminar.\n\n# 25 Apr\n\nA seminar with the presentation of the IMF’s April 2023 Global Financial Stability Report titled Safeguarding Global Financial Stability amid High Inflation and Interest Rates by Dr Jason Wu, Assistant Director, and Mr Thomas Pointek, Senior Financial Sector Expert, of the IMF’s Monetary and Capital Markets Department was held. More than 80 participants attended the seminar.\n\n# 2 May\n\nA fireside chat on Asia in a Challenging World was hosted between Mr Krishna Srinivasan, Director of the Asia and Pacific Department of the IMF, and Mr Eddie Yue, Chief Executive of the HKMA. Mr Srinivasan outlined the key messages of the recent IMF Regional Economic Outlook report for Asia and shared his views on the key drivers and risks of the global and regional economy. In addition, the dialogue covered many important issues concerning the regional economy and the evolution of the international monetary system. Around 120 participants attended the event.\n", "zh": "# 貨幣穩定\n\n2023年，在市場預期“高企持續”美國政策利率的背景下，香港美元大多在可兌換區的偏弱一側交易，弱方兌換承擔在2月中旬至5月初觸發了八次。自5月份以來，港元逐漸恢復一些動力，年底的匯率約在7.8的中間水平。在慣例已逾四十年的聯匯制度下，香港銀行同業拆息（H 波息）通常追蹤美元的走勢，同時也受到本地供求的影響。整體而言，港元的外匯及貨幣市場保持穩定，交易平穩有序。作為香港貨幣金融穩定的基石，聯匯制度凸顯其強韌性與抗壓能力，屢次應對外來衝擊。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的主要目標是貨幣穩定。這指的是港幣在外匯市場上的匯率，在對美元的匯率區間內，維持在7.75至7.85港元對1美元的範圍內。貨幣制度的結構由貨幣局安排構成，要求貨幣基礎至少由外匯基金持有的美元儲備全數支持，並且貨幣基礎的變動須與美元儲備的變動完全匹配。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n- 負債證明書，為三家發鈔銀行發行的鈔票提供全額支持；\n- 政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣；\n- 總結餘，即與金管局在結算帳戶中保持的總清算餘額；\n- 由金管局代表政府發行的外匯基金票據（EFBNs）。\n\n港幣匯率的穩定，通過自動利率調整機制和金管局堅定履行兌換承擔（CU）的承諾來維持。當觸發強方（或弱方）兌換承擔時，金管局隨時準備按7.75港元（或7.85港元）兌換美元，出售（或買入）港元，這將擴大（或收縮）總結餘，從而降低（或提高）港幣利率，幫助港幣回歸在7.75至7.85的兌換區域內。\n\n# 2023年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n2023年，市場預期“高企持續”美國政策利率，港元整體偏軟，主要在可兌換區的偏弱一側交易。弱方兌換承擔在2月中旬至5月初被觸發八次。自5月至7月初，港元匯率略為回升，部分由上市企業的股息支付需求及半年結資金需求推動。此後，港元主要受到本地資金需求變化的影響，如南向通的買入流動，並在年末以7.8的中間水平交易（圖1）。整體而言，2023年，港元外匯市場持續正常運作。\n\n圖1 2023年市場匯率\n\n由2月至5月，金管局應銀行要求，以慣例已逾四十年的聯匯制度（LERS）在弱方兌換承擔下共購買港幣合計約515億港元。反映弱方兌換承擔被觸發，結算餘額由2022年末的963億港元縮減至2023年末的450億港元。同時，外匯基金票據（EFBNs）剩餘量在年內略增，從1200.4億港元升至1245.5億港元。因此，總結餘與外匯基金票據的合計由1229.7億港元微降至1290.4億港元（圖2）。貨幣基礎整體仍由外匯儲備全額支持。\n\n圖2 剩餘結算餘額（折前貼現窗）與2023年外匯基金票據存量\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n根據LERS，香港銀行同業拆息（HIBOR）一般跟蹤美元的走勢。在2023年前七個月，美國持續升息，HIBOR普遍上升（圖3）。全年來看，隔夜、1個月和3個月HIBOR分別上升286、92和16個基點，年底分別為6.09%、5.27%和5.15%。\n\n隨著美國聯邦基金利率目標區間調高，貨幣基準利率（Base Rate）調整四次，總升幅為100個基點（即1%），由4.75%升至5.75%。在零售方面，隨著美國政策利率升高，許多銀行在5月初提高其最優惠貸款利率12.5個基本點，7月底再提升同樣數值。部分銀行亦上調新批核按揭貸款的H波息封頂利率，2023年新按揭貸款的平均利率由2022年的3.35%升至12月的4.13%。整體而言，香港的貨幣市場持續正常運作，折扣窗口借款由2022年的84億港元增加至38.8億港元，並未發現異常情況。\n\n圖3 2023年香港銀行同業拆息\n\n# 聯匯制度\n\n聯匯制度自成立以來，一直是香港金融體系的堅實支柱，展現出其應對挑戰的韌性。儘管外圍美元利率路徑不明確及全球經濟復甦前景仍存疑問，港元的外匯及貨幣市場仍有序運作，彰顯聯匯制度的穩健和韌性。政府堅守聯匯制度立場，並在2023年《外部部門報告》中，國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）再次重申，聯匯制度的信譽由透明的規則、大量的財政及外匯儲備、強健的金融監管及監督、彈性的經濟體系與審慎的財政框架所保障。\n\n穩健的銀行系統對聯匯制度的正常運作至關重要。香港的銀行行業繼續高效運行，流動性充足，資本水平符合國際標準。為保證銀行體系的韌性，金管局密切監測銀行的信用、流動性及利率風險管理及壓力測試成效，並保持對銀行放貸的監管力道。\n\n為提高貨幣局帳戶的透明度，自1998年10月起，貨幣局資產的一部分專門用於支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（定義為支持資產除以貨幣基礎）由2022年末的110.12%升至2023年5月4日的112.71%，超過112.5%的上觸發水平（圖4）。此主要反映上半年弱方兌換承擔觸發導致結算餘額收縮。根據外匯基金諮詢委員會同意的安排，並且由於負債證明書贖回，資產由支持資產轉出至投資組合，令支持比率於5月8日降至約109.97%，之後逐步回升至12月31日的110.73%。在LERS下，雖然有部分外匯基金資產指定用於支持組合，但所有外匯基金資產皆可用於支持港元匯率，外匯基金充裕的財政資源聯同穩健的銀行系統，為香港的貨幣金融穩定提供有力支撐。\n\n圖4 2023年貨幣局支持比率每日走勢\n\n# 貨幣局分會\n\n貨幣局諮詢委員會的貨幣局分會（CBC）監督並檢討有關香港貨幣金融穩定的事宜。2023年，CBC討論了包括2022年5月穩定幣市場崩盤、美國聯儲的美元流動性支援措施傳導至香港銀行、以及近期港元利率的變動等問題。這些討論記錄及貨幣局運作報告均在金管局網站公布。\n\n# 鈔票與硬幣\n\n以下表格摘要了2023年末流通的鈔票與硬幣的數值：\n\n圖5 2023年由發鈔銀行發行的流通鈔票\n\n圖6 2023年流通鈔票的分佈情況\n\n圖7 2023年流通的鈔票總量\n\n圖8 2023年由政府發行的流通貨幣\n\n圖9 2023年政府發行貨幣的詳細分佈\n\n# 香港鈔票\n\n本年度，金管局持續舉辦有關香港鈔票設計與防偽特色的研討會，邀請銀行櫃員、零售機構收銀員和學生參加，以提升他們識別鈔票真偽的知識與技能。2023年，共安排15場研討會，約有3,000名參與者。\n\n# 硬幣收集計劃\n\n硬幣收集計劃受到公眾熱烈歡迎。有關詳情可參閱2023年《可持續發展的金管局》部分的可持續發展報告。\n\n# 外匯基金票據\n\nEFBN計劃運作暢順。截至2023年末，外匯基金票據的票面價值約為1,2554億港元（見表2）。\n\n表2 外匯基金票據剩餘發行數量\n\n# 貨幣研究\n\n香港金融學院的貨幣及金融研究中心（HKIMR）出版了20篇專題研究論文，並舉辦了17場有關貨幣與金融議題的研討會和網絡研討會，這些議題對香港及區域具有策略性重要性。HKIMR還在社會科學研究網絡（SSRN）發布了六份電子期刊，推廣研究成果。此外，HKIMR為讓公眾了解近期研究論文的高層次非專業摘要，還出版了兩期《貨幣研究觀點》。\n\n除研究活動外，HKIMR還舉辦了四個國際活動、一場圓桌會議以及四場研討會或網絡研討會，與學術界、全球央行及國際金融機構進行對話，促進經濟金融議題的交流：\n\n# 3月9日\n\n舉行“中國經濟復甦：近期發展與展望”研討會，邀請國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）駐華首席代表史蒂文·艾倫·巴內特博士（IMF China Senior Resident Representative）及IMF駐港特派代表捷薩沙·佩贊奧（IMF HK Resident Representative）分享看法。巴內特博士就中國經濟的最新進展及短中期需解決的問題表達了意見。超過100人參加。\n\n# 4月17日\n\n舉辦“穿越挑戰世界”研討會，IMF四位專家交流最新《世界經濟展望》和《全球金融穩定報告》的分析章節。逾50人出席。\n\n# 4月25日\n\n由IMF貨幣及資本市場部助理主管吳ジェ森（Dr. Jason Wu）及高級金融部專家Thomas Pointek（Mr. Thomas Pointek）主持介紹2023年4月IMF《全球金融穩定報告》——題為“高通膨與利率背景下的全球金融穩定”專題。80餘人參加。\n\n# 5月2日\n\n由IMF亞太地區部主管克里希納·斯里尼瓦桑先生（Mr. Krishna Srinivasan）與金管局行政總裁余偉文先生（Mr. Eddie Yue）對話，歡迎在「亞洲在挑戰性世界中的角色」座談中交流。斯里尼瓦桑概述IMF最新《亞洲區域經濟展望》報告的主要內容，並分析全球及區域經濟的主要動力和風險。討論涵蓋地區經濟及國際貨幣體系演變等多個重要議題。約120人參加。"}
{"en": "# Banking Stability\n\nThe banking sector in Hong Kong remained strong and resilient in 2023 despite multiple headwinds, including the March banking turmoil in the US and Europe, a high interest rate environment and geopolitical tensions. The HKMA responded swiftly to the March banking turmoil — from managing the ripple effects to completing an internal review (covering such areas as the supervisory processes and resolution framework) drawing lessons for the local banking sector, while maintaining its focus on the credit, liquidity and market risk management of authorized institutions. In light of escalating cyber threats and the increasing use of technology services provided by third parties, the HKMA also worked closely with authorized institutions to enhance their operational and cyber resilience.\n\nThe HKMA enhanced consumer protection in respect of payment cards, and through further revision of the Code of Banking Practice as well as the launch of the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter. The HKMA worked with fellow regulators on a balanced regulatory regime for virtual asset-related activities, streamlined the selling process for sophisticated professional investors, introduced enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Pilot Scheme, and commenced supervision of trust business. A pilot programme was launched to prepare for provision of consumer credit reference services under “Credit Data Smart”.\n\nThe HKMA’s efforts in anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) reflect a commitment to targeting the highest threats under a risk-based approach. To address increasing digital fraud, the HKMA has strengthened ecosystem collaboration through the launch of real-time fraud monitoring and expanding the scope of public-private information-sharing partnerships, including the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce. The launch of a ground-breaking platform to facilitate bank-to-bank information sharing will help address the risk of mule account networks, while the HKMA also worked closely with the industry to take concerted action to handle increasing fraud-related banking complaints and raise public awareness about different scams, including a pre-transaction alert mechanism when using the Faster Payment System. In parallel, supervisory technology capabilities were also advanced through the Macro Analytics pilot scheme.\n\nGood progress was made on implementing international supervisory standards locally, including those on capital adequacy and disclosure. Notable efforts were also made in enhancing capacity building in the banking sector, attracting and nurturing future talents and upskilling existing practitioners. In addition, the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board completed a public consultation on proposed enhancements to the Deposit Protection Scheme.\n\nThe HKMA continued to advance its work to ensure a credible resolution regime. A new resolution standard related to accessing critical financial market infrastructures was developed and a review on experiences of implementing loss-absorbing capacity policy standards was completed. Significant progress was made in resolution planning with banks to address early termination risk and operational continuity in resolution. The HKMA also continued to be active in international policy initiatives and regional co-operation on resolution.\n\n# Objectives\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this objective is contingent upon a highly resilient financial system that is capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their businesses and, in extreme cases, by failing in a disorderly manner. The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring that banks are resilient to shocks and able to recover their positions in response to crises, ultimately helping to prevent failures. The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks and is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs).\n\nThe Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework is not designed to ensure a zero-risk financial system. Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that, in the event of an AI becoming non-viable, its failure can be managed in an orderly manner. To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong has been established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs, among other types of institutions. To operationalise the resolution regime in Hong Kong, it is important to lay down resolution rules and policy standards, undertake resolution planning to remove impediments to AIs’ resolvability and develop the HKMA’s operational capability to resolve a failing AI. In order to carry out these tasks effectively, the HKMA adopts an internationally harmonised and co-ordinated approach.\n\nThe Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs). In overseeing FMIs, the HKMA aims to promote their general safety and efficiency, limit systemic risk and foster transparency. Making FMIs more resilient to financial crises protects the monetary and financial systems in Hong Kong from possible destabilising effects arising from disruption to the FMIs.\n\n# Review of 2023\n\n# Licensing\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA granted one banking licence and one restricted bank licence to two banks incorporated outside Hong Kong. The HKMA also granted money broker approval to four foreign trading platform operators and revoked another approval granted to one money broker. The HKMA revoked authorizations of five licensed banks during the year.\n\nMore information about the AIs and local representative offices in Hong Kong can be found in the Annex and Tables D to F on pages 313 to 316 and 322 to 325 respectively.\n\n# Review of three-tier banking system\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA conducted a comprehensive review on the three-tier banking system in order to simplify the structure of Hong Kong’s banking system. The review found that the three-tier system has become more complex than necessary to achieve the original aim to strike a balance between flexibility of entry into the banking system and protection of small depositors. Subsequently, the HKMA commenced a three-month consultation in June on a proposal to simplify the three-tier banking system into two tiers by merging deposit-taking companies into the restricted licence bank sector, thereby forming a new second tier of Hong Kong’s banking system. Respondents were generally supportive of the proposal.\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA conducted 177 off-site reviews covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL rating assessment1, corporate governance and risk management. As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance, 38 meetings were held with the boards of directors, independent non-executive directors or board-level committees of AIs. Furthermore, 38 tripartite meetings were held among the HKMA, AIs and their external auditors.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA conducted regular on-site examinations on a wide range of AIs’ activities. Credit risk management was a key focus given the challenging credit risk landscape amid a high interest rate environment and debt defaults by some Mainland property developers. The management of operational risk and technology risk was another major focus as the adoption of technology by AIs gathered further momentum. The HKMA also stepped up its supervisory work on climate risk management and rolled out a new round of thematic examinations focused on climaterelated risk governance, and a series of consultative sessions to provide supervisory guidance to AIs.\n\nThe banking turmoil in the US and Europe that started in March 2023 was the most significant system-wide banking stress since the Great Financial Crisis of 2008 in terms of scale and scope. The HKMA stayed on high alert as the turmoil unfolded and took a number of precautionary actions to ensure that any potential fallout would not undermine confidence in the local banking and financial system. After the episode, the HKMA conducted an internal review exercise having regard to the observations and experience gained from the turmoil. Based on this exercise, the HKMA developed a detailed action plan to incorporate lessons learnt with a view to strengthening its supervisory effectiveness and augmenting its ability to handle a banking crisis if one did occur. See Liquidity and market risks on page 95 for more details on the HKMA’s work in this respect.\n\nOn conduct supervision, the HKMA carried out on-site examinations in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses as well as consumer protection matters, supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk or new initiatives.\n\nTable 1 contains a summary of the HKMA’s supervisory activities in 2023.\n\nTable 1 Summary of supervisory activities\n\n# Credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nTotal loans decreased by 3.6% in 2023, compared with a decline of 3.0% in 2022. Table 2 shows the breakdown of growth in loans and advances. Mainland-related lending decreased by 6.6% to HK$4,226 billion in 2023 (Table 3).\n\nTable 2 Growth in loans and advances\n\nTable 3 Growth in Mainland-related lending\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA intensified supervisory efforts in monitoring AIs’ asset quality and assessing their credit risk management practices given the high interest rate environment and continued weakness in the Mainland property market. The asset quality of the banking sector deteriorated during the year but remained manageable. The classified loan ratio of the banking sector was 1.56% at the end of 2023, up from 1.40% at the end of 2022. The classified loan ratio for Mainland-related lending increased to 2.58% from 2.26% at the end of 2022.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA conducted targeted and thematic examinations to evaluate AIs’ credit risk management focusing on exposures to vulnerable sectors, premium financing, oversight of credit risks at operations outside Hong Kong and exposures to non-bank financial institutions.\n\n# Alleviating cash flow pressure faced by bank customers\n\nThe HKMA and the Banking Sector Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) Lending Coordination Mechanism announced in July the commencement of an orderly exit from the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme. The Scheme was introduced in May 2020 to tide eligible corporates over the pandemic. Taking into account the views of the commercial sectors, the partial principal repayment options were enhanced to assist corporates’ gradual return to normal repayment. Where sectors or individual borrowers were still facing challenges despite the end of the pandemic, banks continued to offer principal moratorium or other suitable credit relief measures on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe HKMA also encouraged banks to be sympathetic in handling the funding needs of corporates which had not participated in the Scheme but were facing cash flow pressures due to individual circumstances. The HKMA reminded banks to follow the “Hong Kong Approach to Corporate Difficulties” guidelines in dealing with corporates encountering repayment problems, so that individual banks would act collaboratively in the common interest of the lenders involved.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nThe successive rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures introduced by the HKMA since 2009 have strengthened banks’ risk management of their property mortgage lending business and the banking sector’s capacity to cope with challenges arising from a sharp correction in property prices. The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of new residential mortgage loans approved in 2023 stood at 57%, compared with 64% in September 2009 before the countercyclical measures were first introduced (Chart 1). The average debt servicing ratio (DSR) of new mortgages stayed low at 40% in 2023, compared with 41% in August 2010 when a cap on DSR was first applied.\n\nOn 7 July, the HKMA adjusted the countercyclical macroprudential measures after taking into account factors such as property prices, transaction volumes and the local and external economic environment. This was the first time the countercyclical macroprudential measures for residential properties were relaxed since their introduction in 2009. The adjustments included increasing the maximum LTV ratios for residential properties and commercial properties, as well as for mortgage loans assessed based on the net worth of mortgage applicants. In addition, the requirements to lower the applicable maximum LTV ratio and DSR limit by ten percentage points for mortgage applicants with incomes derived mainly from places outside of Hong Kong were lifted. The HKMA also removed the requirement to apply a five-percentage-point reduction on applicable DSR limits when mortgage applicants’ total mortgage finance exceeded the HKMA’s normal permissible LTV ceilings by 20 percentage points.\n\nChart 1 Average LTV ratio and DSR of new residential mortgage loans approved\n", "zh": "# 銀行業穩定性\n\n儘管面臨多重阻力，包括2023年3月美國及歐洲銀行危機、利率居高不下及地緣政治緊張局勢，香港的銀行業在2023年仍保持強健與韌性。金管局迅速應對3月銀行危機 — 從管理餘波到完成內部檢討（涵蓋監管流程和解決框架等範疇），汲取經驗以優化本地銀行業，同時持續關注認可機構的信貸、流動性與市場風險管理。在日益嚴峻的網絡威脅和第三方科技服務的普及背景下，金管局亦與認可機構緊密合作，強化其營運和網絡韌性。\n\n金管局加強了支付卡相關的保障措施，並通過進一步修訂《銀行營運守則》及推出《保障消費者防騙約章》，提升消費者保障。同時，金管局與其他監管機構合作，制定針對虛擬資產相關活動的平衡監管制度，簡化專業投資者銷售流程，推出跨境理財通試點方案的增強措施，並展開信託業務的監管工作。為準備推出“信資通”，進行了一項先導計劃以提供消費者信貸資料服務。\n\n在反洗錢及打擊恐怖分子資金籌集（AML/CFT）方面，金管局秉持風險為本的方法，積極應對不斷升級的數碼詐騙威脅。其透過推出即時詐騙監測、擴展公私合作信息共享範圍，包括反詐騙及洗錢情報工作小組，並推出促進銀行間信息共享的創新平台，以應對“人頭戶”網絡的風險。同時，金管局亦與業界密切合作，積極應對有關銀行欺詐投訴的上升趨勢，提高大眾對不同詐騙手法的認識，並在使用轉數快時引入交易前警示機制。此外，配合宏觀分析的先導計劃，技術能力取得進一步提升。\n\n在本地落實國際監管標準方面取得良好進展，包括資本充足與資訊披露標準。亦加強銀行業的能力建設，吸引並培育未來人才，提升現有從業員素質。再者，香港存款保障委員會完成《存款保障計劃》修訂的公眾諮詢。\n\n金管局繼續推動具公信力的危機處理制度。制定了新的關鍵金融市場基建接入標準，完成針對吸收虧損能力政策標準實施經驗的檢討。在 resolution 計劃方面，與銀行合作應對提前結束風險和確保解決時的營運連續性取得顯著進展。金管局亦積極參與國際政策倡議及區域合作，以推動解決措施的落實。\n\n# 目標\n\n金管局的總體目標是促進銀行體系的安全與穩定。實現此一目標，須依賴高度韌性的金融系統，能提供香港經濟所需的核心金融服務。\n\n銀行可通過經營模式影響系統穩定性，甚至在極端情況下導致不規則失敗。作為監管機構，金管局扮演保護金融穩定的重要角色，確保銀行具備抵禦震盪的韌性，並在危機中能夠恢復運作，從而降低失敗風險。金管局負責銀行的審慎監管，並負責授權香港的持牌銀行、受限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司，統稱認可機構（AIs）。\n\n香港的審慎監管制度並非旨在保證零風險的金融系統，而是由resolution機制確保若某家認可機構變得不可行，其倒閉能有序進行。為此，香港已建立金融機構的解決制度，由金管局負責解決認可機構等各類機構。為推行此制度，需制定解決規則與政策標準、策劃解決方案以消除認可機構的可解決障礙，以及提升金管局的解決能力。為了有效執行這些任務，金管局採用國際協調一致的方法。\n\n金管局亦負責指定和監管部分金融市場基建（FMIs），旨在促進其安全與效率，限制系統性風險，並提升透明度。提升FMIs的韌性，有助於保護香港貨幣及金融系統免受由其中斷引發的潛在破壞性影響。\n\n# 2023年回顧\n\n# 發牌情況\n\n年內，金管局授予兩家銀行一個銀行牌照和一個受限制銀行牌照，這兩家銀行均為在香港以外成立的機構。此外，金管局批准四家境外交易平台營運商成為支付資金經紀人，並撤銷另一家經營者的資格認可。年內，金管局撤銷了五家持牌銀行的授權。\n\n有關香港認可機構（AIs）及本地代表辦事處的更多資料，請參閱附件及第D至F表格（第313至316和第322至325頁）。\n\n# 三級銀行制度的回顧\n\n2023年，金管局對香港的三級銀行制度進行了全面評估，旨在簡化該體系的結構。結果顯示，三級體系已變得過於複雜，不符合最初平衡銀行體系的彈性和保護小額存款人的目標。隨後，金管局於6月推出為期三個月的咨詢，建議將存款受限制公司合併入受限制牌照銀行範疇，形成香港銀行體系的第二層。大多數回應意見支持此提案。\n\n# 監管活動回顧\n\n2023年，金管局進行了177次非現場審查，內容涵蓋CAMEL評級、公司治理與風險管理等多方面。為增強風險治理能力，與認可機構董事、獨立非執行董事或委員會召開了38次會議，並與認可機構及其外部審計師進行了38次三方會議。\n\n除了非現場審查外，金管局還定期對認可機構的不同業務進行現場檢查。由於高利率環境及部分內地房地產商拖欠債項，信貸風險管理成為重點。運營風險和科技風險的管理亦備受關注，隨著AIs推動科技應用進一步加快。金管局亦加強氣候風險管理的監管工作，推出新一輪有關氣候風險治理的專題檢查，並進行多場咨詢，提供監管指引。\n\n2023年3月開始的美國及歐洲銀行危機，是自2008年全球金融危機以來規模與範圍最廣的系統性銀行壓力測試。金管局保持高度警覺，採取多項預防措施，防止任何潛在餘波削弱本地銀行及金融系統的信心。危機過後，金管局展開內部檢討，根據經驗與觀察，制定詳細行動計劃，以提升監管效能並強化應對銀行危機的能力。更多內容，參見第95頁的“流動性與市場風險”。\n\n在操守監管方面，金管局對證券、投資產品、保險及強積金（MPF）相關業務進行了現場檢查，並補充專題審查涉及高風險領域或新措施。\n\n表1總結了2023年的監管活動概況。\n\n# 表1 監管活動概要\n\n# 信貸風險\n\n# 信貸增長與資產質素\n\n2023年，總貸款比2022年減少3.6%，而2022年則減少3.0%。見表2，列出貸款與各項預付款項的增長細節。內地相關貸款在2023年減少6.6%，至HK$4,226億（見表3）。\n\n表2 贷款与预付款项增长\n\n表3 內地相關貸款增長\n\n2023年，金管局強化監督認可機構的資產質素，評估其信貸風險管理實務，特別是在高利率和內地房地產市場持續疲弱的背景下。整體資產質素在年內有所惡化，但仍能控制。2023年底，銀行業的分類貸款比例為1.56%，較2022年底的1.40%有所上升。內地相關貸款的分類貸款比例由2.26%升至2.58%。\n\n年內，金管局針對容易受影響行業、保險融資、境外經營的信貸風險以及非銀行金融機構進行針對性和專題審查。\n\n# 緩解銀行客戶現金流壓力\n\n金管局與銀行業中小企業（SME）貸款協調機制於7月宣布有序退出“預先批核還息不還本計劃”。該計劃於2020年5月推出，旨在幫助符合資格的企業渡過疫情難關。考慮到商界的意見，此措施在部分本金償還方式上增強，協助企業逐步恢復正常還款。即使疫情已過，部分行業或個別借款人仍面臨困難，銀行亦將案例為本提供本金展延或其他適合的信貸緩解措施。\n\n金管局亦鼓勵銀行對未參與該計劃但因個別情況面臨現金流壓力的企業，展現同理心，提供適當協助。金管局提醒銀行在處理遇到還款困難的企業時，須遵循《香港企業困難應對指引》，促使各銀行攜手合作，共同保障放款人的利益。\n\n# 房地產按揭貸款\n\n自2009年起，金管局推出的一系列逆周期宏觀審慎措施，強化銀行的房地產按揭風險管理與應對房價急劇調整帶來的挑戰。2023年，新批住宅按揭的平均按揭成數（LTV）為57%，較2009年9月首次實施這些措施前的64%有所降低（見圖1）。新按揭的平均負債服務比率（DSR）為40%，較2010年8月首次上限41%略低。\n\n7月7日，金管局調整宏觀審慎措施，考慮房價、成交量及內外經濟環境等因素，使房地產逆周期措施首次放寬。調整內容包括提高住宅和商用房的最大LTV，上調根據借款人淨值評估的按揭貸款成數，以及取消對外地收入借款者LTV和DSR上限額外降10%的限制。此外，亦取消按揭申請人收入主要來自香港以外地區的借款人申請時，降低最大LTV和DSR上限10%的要求。"}
{"en": "# International Financial Centre\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA utilised a multi-pronged approach to achieve notable progress in consolidating Hong Kong’s status as a globally competitive international financial centre.\n\nThe success of two major events, namely the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit and the HKMA-BIS High-Level Conference, had reinforced Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre and created positive ripple effects.\n\nThe HKMA, together with its Mainland and Hong Kong counterparts, made concerted efforts to deepen and widen the mutual access between the financial markets of Hong Kong and the Mainland. This included enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Scheme in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, the designation of additional market makers for Southbound Trading under Bond Connect, the successful launch of Northbound Trading of Swap Connect, and the roll-out of the HKD-RMB Dual Counter Model and the Dual Counter Market Making Programme. These initiatives were effective in strengthening Hong Kong’s gateway position and reinforcing the city’s status as a global hub for offshore renminbi business.\n\nThe HKMA also made good progress in strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, in areas including bond issuance, asset and wealth management, green and sustainable finance, and corporate treasury centres. To promote Hong Kong’s financial services, the HKMA stepped up its market outreach activities to overseas and Mainland stakeholders to keep them well informed about the opportunities in Hong Kong’s financial market and its resilience.\n\nSignificant progress has been made on all fronts of the HKMA’s “Fintech 2025” strategy, including in areas such as promoting fintech adoption, Central Bank Digital Currency, data infrastructure, talent development, and policies and funding support.\n\nThe Faster Payment System (FPS) marked its fifth anniversary in September. The number of registrations has grown steadily, and had reached 13.6 million at the end of 2023. The average daily turnover for the year rose to 1.25 million real-time transactions. FPS x PromptPay link for cross-border QR payment between Hong Kong and Thailand was jointly launched with the Bank of Thailand in December, providing a fast, secure and easily accessible cross-border retail payment service for people travelling between the two places.\n\nAs an active member of many international and regional central banking and regulatory forums, the HKMA continued to contribute to global efforts to maintain financial stability and promote financial market developments.\n\n# Overview\n\nThroughout the year, the HKMA continued making proactive efforts to strengthen Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre. In November, it organised the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit for the second year. This three-day event brought together prominent financial leaders from around the world to share their unique perspectives under the theme of “Living with Complexity”. With over 350 participants from 160 international financial institutions attending, the summit clearly showed the global financial sector’s commitment to and confidence in Hong Kong. In the same month, the HKMA and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) co-hosted the HKMA-BIS High Level Conference, which attracted more than 300 participants, including over 20 current and former central bank governors. The conference highlighted the HKMA’s close collaboration with the BIS as well as with the international central banking community.\n\nThe expansion of and enhancements made to the MainlandHong Kong Connect schemes have reinforced Hong Kong’s role as the bridge between the Mainland and international financial markets. A series of enhancements to the Crossboundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) scheme were introduced to facilitate cross-boundary retail investment in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA). Riding on the smooth operations of Southbound Bond Connect, the HKMA designated nine additional market makers to improve secondary liquidity and meet investor demand. Northbound Trading of Swap Connect was successfully launched in the year, enabling global investors to better manage the interest rate risks associated with their Mainland fixed income portfolio via Hong Kong.\n\nHong Kong’s offshore renminbi businesses saw robust growth during the year. The HKMA collaborated with the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) to launch the HKD-RMB Dual Counter Model and the Dual Counter Market Making Programme in June. This helped develop a more diverse range of renminbi-denominated products in Hong Kong by facilitating the issuance and trading of renminbidenominated stocks in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA continued to work on strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. In particular, to enhance Hong Kong’s appeal as a preferred fund management centre, the HKMA worked closely with the Government and the financial industry to provide a more facilitative tax and regulatory environment. Significant progress was also made in promoting innovation in Hong Kong’s bond market, and consolidating Hong Kong’s position as a regional green and sustainable finance hub. At the same time, the HKMA stepped up its market outreach activities to promote Hong Kong’s financial services to overseas and Mainland stakeholders.\n\nBoth the Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO) and the banking departments of the HKMA continued to implement the “Fintech 2025” strategy1 to promote wide adoption of financial technology (fintech) and strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia. Key initiatives implemented during the year included:\n- promoting further adoption in the tech focus areas of Wealthtech, Insurtech, Greentech, artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology (DLT);\n- advancing the work on wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) to improve cross-border payments;\n- progressing further in the study on the prospect of introducing a retail CBDC in Hong Kong, i.e. an e-HKD;\n- stepping up efforts to develop Commercial Data Interchange (CDI);\n- enhancing talent development;\n- nurturing the fintech ecosystem through funding and policies;\n- strengthening cross-border collaboration in fintech; and\n- expanding the adoption of the FPS.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure is vital for maintaining the city’s position as a leading international financial centre. In 2023, the four interbank Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) and the Hong Kong Trade Repository (HKTR) achieved 100%2 system availability, outperforming the target of 99.95%. The debt securities settlement service, including the Northbound and Southbound Bond Connect linkage service, continued to operate smoothly.\n\nAdoption of the FPS continued to increase in 2023, marking the significant milestone of the FPS reaching its fifth anniversary. The number of registrations for the FPS and the FPS turnover have grown steadily over the past five years, with the number of registrations growing to 13.6 million at the end of 2023 and the average daily turnover for the year rising by 33% from 2022. The increased use of the FPS for settling Government bills, making merchant payments, and topping up Stored Value Facility (SVF) e-wallets or bank accounts, were key drivers for the continued rise in the transaction volume, on top of steady growth in person-toperson and business payments.\n\nTo ensure the safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA oversees six designated retail payment systems (RPSs) and supervises 17 licensed SVFs (four of which are SVFs issued by licensed banks) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO). During the year, the HKMA also continued to facilitate the smooth implementation of the Government’s Consumption Voucher Scheme, helping to co-ordinate the relevant Government parties and the SVF licensees appointed for the scheme, and facilitate dialogue and co-operation between them.\n\nOn 27 December, the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau and the HKMA jointly issued a public consultation paper on regulation for stablecoin issuers. The HKMA subsequently introduced a sandbox arrangement on 12 March 2024 for institutions planning to issue fiat-referenced stablecoins in Hong Kong. At the same time, the HKMA has been actively participating in the work of international bodies in relation to crypto-asset activities, and monitoring the development of the market closely.\n\nInternationally, the HKMA has remained an active member of the central banking community and continued to play a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees. Currently, the HKMA co-chairs the Policy and Standards Group of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), as well as the Regional Consultative Group for Asia, the Non-Bank Monitoring Experts Group (until June) and the Financial Innovation Network of the Financial Stability Board (FSB). The HKMA also chairs the BIS’ Meeting of Governors from Major Emerging Market Economies (EMEs). Between 2018 and 2023, the HKMA served consecutive terms as the chair of the Working Group on Financial Markets established under the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP)3.\n\nThe HKMA also held bilateral meetings with the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates and the Saudi Central Bank in May and July respectively to promote investment and financial market connectivity between the Middle East and Asia. The sixth Hong Kong-Switzerland Financial Dialogue was held in Bern, Switzerland on 25 September, and the discussion covered topics on regional and domestic outlook and policy challenges, latest development, and potential collaboration in the areas of sustainable finance, fintech, and market connectivity.\n\n# A glance at the HKMA’s initiatives in 2023 in strengthening Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre\n\n# Strengthen connections with the world\n\n- Hosted series of international events: Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit, HKMA-BIS High-Level Conference and HKMA-BIS Joint Conference and Basel Committee meeting\n- Active participation in international central banking and regulatory forums\n- Stepped up market outreach to overseas and Mainland stakeholders to promote Hong Kong’s financial services and laid solid foundation for collaboration with Middle East\n\n# Enhance financial platform competitiveness\n\n- Promoted bond market innovation by assisting the Government to issue the world’s first tokenised government green bond\n- Supported dim sum bond issuances by Shenzhen and Hainan governments in Hong Kong\n- Signed Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the National Development and Reform Commission to support cross-border financing by Chinese enterprises in Hong Kong\n- Enhanced tax concession regimes for family offices and asset and wealth management industries\n- Continued raising Hong Kong’s value proposition as a Corporate Treasury Centre (CTC) hub and financing hub for infrastructure investments\n- Continued the development of Hong Kong’s treasury market and over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market\n- Consolidation of Hong Kong’s position as a regional green and sustainable finance hub\n\n# Ensure the reliability and efficiency of Hong Kong’s critical financial infrastructure\n\n- Continued to ensure the safe and efficient operation of the RTGS systems, CMU and the HKTR\n- Progressed with the upgrade of the CMU’s operational capacity and product offerings to develop the system into a major international central securities depository\n\n# Nurture future finance leaders and strengthen applied research capabilities\n\n- Continued the leadership development and research efforts by the Hong Kong Academy of Finance (AoF)\n\n# Deepen connectivity between the financial markets of Hong Kong and the Mainland and enhance Hong Kong’s role as an offshore renminbi business hub\n\n- Successful launch of Northbound Trading of Swap Connect\n- Enhancements to Cross-Boundary WMC\n- Designation of additional market makers for Southbound Trading under Bond Connect\n- Rollout of HKD-RMB Dual Counter Model and Dual Counter Market Making Programme\n- Good progress on initiatives to support corporates’ business operations and the livelihoods of residents in the GBA, e.g. enhanced cross-boundary fund flow management for GBA corporates, facilitative measures for Hong Kong residents on property purchases in GBA’s Mainland cities\n- Deepened exchanges between Mainland agencies and financial industry in Hong Kong to identify business opportunities\n\n# Reinforce Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia\n\n- Continued implementation of the “Fintech 2025” Strategy:\n    -

{"en": "# Reserves Management\n\nThe investment environment in 2023 was volatile and challenging. Although some banks in the US and Europe experienced liquidity issues at the beginning of the year, the associated risks did not spread across the financial markets. While levels of inflation in major developed economies have declined from their peak in 2023, they have remained above the targets set by major central banks. Following an aggressive rate hike cycle, the US Federal Reserve has paused hiking rate since the third quarter, and indicated that the policy rate was likely at or near its peak. This, coupled with a resilient US economy, has made investor sentiment more optimistic. However, ongoing geopolitical tensions, such as the Russia-Ukraine war and the outbreak of conflict in the Middle East during the year, added turbulence and uncertainties to the investment market. In this complicated and dynamic investment environment, the investment performance of the Exchange Fund experienced some ups and downs. Despite this, the Exchange Fund managed to achieve a decent investment return. In 2023, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$226.0 billion, representing an investment return of 5.5%.\n\n# The Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems in order to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The HKMA, under the delegated authority of the Financial Secretary and within the terms of the delegation, is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# Management of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(i) To preserve capital;\n(ii) To ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(iii) To ensure that sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(iv) Subject to (i)–(iii), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Exchange Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 Portfolio segregation of the Exchange Fund\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP). The BP holds highly liquid US dollardenominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base, as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The IP invests primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member economies of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, with a view to preserving the value and long-term purchasing power of its assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA diversifies part of the Exchange Fund’s investments in a prudent and incremental manner into a wider variety of asset classes. These include emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The target asset allocation of the LTGP is determined concurrently with that of other asset classes, subject to prudent risk management principles and portfolio diversification strategy.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007, holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that have been acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes. Due to its unique nature, the Strategic Portfolio is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by the Fiscal Reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP1. A major exception is the Future Fund2, which links its interest rate to the return of both the IP and the LTGP in accordance with the portfolio mix. The portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 35:65 in 2023.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: strategic asset allocation and tactical asset allocation. Strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents long-term asset allocation based on the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark (or strategic) allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and tracking error3 limit are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with the EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may assume positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nThe HKMA’s Exchange Fund Investment Office houses the Exchange Fund’s investment and related risk management functions. Exchange Fund Investment Office staff members directly manage about 71% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, comprising the entire BP and part of the IP. The part of the IP managed internally includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 29% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes. The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to realise sustainable returns, while also drawing on diverse and complementary investment styles and taking advantage of external market insights and technical expertise in investment.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is determined primarily by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nAs the investment environment becomes more complex, good risk management is increasingly important. The HKMA sets stringent controls and investment guidelines for both its internally and externally managed portfolios, and ensures that a proper risk monitoring and compliance system is in place. Three lines of defence are in place to implement effective risk management and governance of investment-related activities. Key risk categories (including credit, market, liquidity and operational risks) are regularly monitored. The risk management process provides a robust framework that supports the HKMA’s strategic planning and investment diversification efforts.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nThe HKMA believes that an appropriate emphasis on responsible investment and sustainable long-term economic performance can help better achieve the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund, as well as reduce risks associated with environmental, social and governance (ESG)-related matters of its underlying investments. To embrace responsible investment practices, the HKMA has integrated ESG factors into the investment processes of the Exchange Fund, with the guiding principle that priority will generally be given to ESG investments if their long-term risk-adjusted returns are comparable with other investments. For more details about the HKMA’s responsible investment work, see the Responsible Investment chapter of the Sustainability Report 2023.\n\n# Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\n# The financial markets in 2023\n\nThe investment environment in 2023 was volatile and challenging.\n\nGlobal equities were generally on an upward trend in 2023. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose by 24% during the year, especially in the fourth quarter as markets began to anticipate sooner-than-expected rate cuts.\n\nIn the bond markets, yields remained high, with the 10-year US Treasury yield surging above 5% at one point to reach its highest level since 2007. However, as market expectations of central banks’ monetary policies shifted, bond yields retreated towards the end of the year alongside a gradual increase in bond prices.\n\nIn the currency markets, the US dollar recorded a mixed performance against major currencies. Among these, the pound sterling and the euro appreciated against the US dollar, while the yen and the renminbi depreciated.\n\nThe performance of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2023 is shown in Table 1.\n\nTable 1 2023 market returns\n\n# Reserves Management\n\n# Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$226.0 billion in 2023. This comprised gains on bonds of HK$144.7 billion, gains on equities of HK$58.1 billion (with gains of HK$73.6 billion from foreign equities, and losses of HK$15.5 billion from Hong Kong equities), a negative currency translation effect of HK$0.5 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets, and gains of HK$23.7 billion on other investments held by the investment-holding subsidiaries of the Fund. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation loss of HK$4.8 billion.\n\nTotal assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,016.5 billion at the end of the year. The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$517.3 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$411.9 billion and real estate HK$105.4 billion. Outstanding investment commitments of the LTGP amounted to HK$291.1 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund in 2023, excluding the Strategic Portfolio, was 5.5%. The returns of the IP and the BP were 6.4% and 5.0% respectively. The LTGP has recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 11.8% since its inception in 2009.\n\nThe annual returns of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2023 are set out in Chart 1. Table 2 shows the 2023 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over several different time horizons. The average return was 1.6% during 2021–2023, 3.3% during 2019–2023, 2.7% during 2014–2023 and 4.5% since 1994.

To date, more than 66,000 people have participated in the public education programme. In 2023, a webinar was organised for over 1,200 students and teachers from 58 secondary schools. The webinar topics included an overview of the HKMA’s work, the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, protection of personal digital keys, the Deposit Protection Scheme, green finance, and career opportunities in the banking industry.\n\nThe HKMA educates and engages the public on how to be smart and responsible financial consumers. In light of the rise in phishing scams and credit card fraud, the HKMA continued its efforts across different media to remind the public to stay vigilant. A brand new awareness campaign was rolled out following the launch of the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter, emphasising that banks and major merchants have committed not to send hyperlinks via instant electronic messages soliciting personal and credit card information. The HKMA also passed on smart tips on credit cards, personal loans, online shopping, banking services and different payment options (including “Buy Now, Pay Later” products) via radio and social media channels.\n\nA new video and animations with cannibal plant and animal trap are produced with the theme “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!”\n\nCross-media publicity is produced reminding members of the public not to click on suspicious links\n\nAnimated video to promote e-laisees\n\nIn support of the environment, and drawing on technological advances in financial services, the HKMA encouraged members of the public to give out electronic lai sees (e-laisees) and to consider using good-as-new banknotes for physical lai sees over the Chinese New Year through social media and radio promotions.\n\nThe HKMA also seeks to enhance public understanding of the financial industry and raise young people’s interest in pursuing a career in the industry, thus enlarging Hong Kong’s talent pool for the financial industry. Following positive feedback for its earlier video series “Four Faces of Talents in Central”, the HKMA launched a new video series titled “Financial Special Forces: Unleashing New Horizons” that featured four growth areas in the financial industry: data science, fintech, green and sustainable finance, and wealth management. The video series utilised computer graphics and animation to show seasoned market practitioners supervising young talents as they managed daily work challenges, providing a light-touch introduction to career opportunities and prospects within the industry.\n\nA video series “Financial Special Forces: Unleashing New Horizons” is produced to keep the younger generation abreast of career opportunities in finance\n\nMentors from different areas sharing their expertise and experience with students\n\nTo enhance financial literacy among secondary school students, the HKMA worked with other stakeholders to co-organise the “Hong Kong Financial Literacy Championship” for the ninth consecutive year. Under the theme of digital and sustainable economy, the event helped students learn more about money management, green and sustainability, the current state of the financial market and career opportunities. It also included an online quiz that received around 20,000 submissions, mentoring by experienced practitioners from diverse areas, and design thinking challenge.\n\n# $mart Money Management 321\n\nThe HKMA launched its first financial education board game called “$mart Money Management 321”, which is jointly designed and developed with a social enterprise specialising in board game production. The board game was designed to help primary school students learn about different payment methods, money management concepts, fintech and cybersecurity in a simulated setting.\n\nThe HKMA took a booth at the Hong Kong Book Fair 2023 to promote the board game, which was one of the best-selling items at the Fair. In addition, the HKMA organised a series of free promotional activities, which included workshops in community centres, trials for students in primary schools, and train-the-trainer workshops for primary school teachers and social workers at non-governmental organisations, as well as running a “$mart Money Management Experiential Centre” at PMQ during the festive season.\n\nThe HKMA’s first financial education board game, “$mart Money Management 321”, and the “$mart Money Management Experiential Centre” receive several international design awards\n\nFollowing its launch at the Hong Kong Book Fair, the board game is promoted through train-the-trainer workshops, student trial sessions and an experiential centre at PMQ\n\nThe HKMA also collaborated with different stakeholders in a number of community engagement programmes. One of these was the second phase of a cross-generation outreach educational programme, organised jointly with an educational institution. It included a bank simulation game along with talks targeting kindergarten students, their parents and teachers, and young adults.\n\nThe HKMA continued to support the work of the Investor and Financial Education Council in promoting financial literacy and financial capacity in Hong Kong. It will explore further collaboration with different stakeholders to maximise the impact of its community engagement work.\n\n# Financial disclosure\n\nTo maintain a high level of transparency, the HKMA adopts international standards in financial disclosure insofar as they are applicable to central banking operations. These include the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and other applicable reporting requirements, such as the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard. The Finance Division works with external auditors and other accounting professionals to prepare and present the Exchange Fund’s financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards. The HKMA also provides detailed disclosures and thorough analyses of a wide range of expense items and budgetary information in its Annual Report.\n\n# Accountability and controls\n\n# Risk management\n\nOne of the HKMA’s most important tasks is to manage risks to the monetary and banking systems.

{"en": "# The Exchange Fund\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 211 to 311, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2023, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including material accounting policy information.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2023, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards. My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report. I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises all the information included in the 2023 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. I also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and\n- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nProf. LAM Chi Yuen Nelson\nDirector of Audit\n\n# 1 PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES\n\nThe Monetary Authority, under delegated authority from the Financial Secretary as Controller of the Exchange Fund (the Fund), manages the Fund in accordance with the provisions of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66). The principal activities of the Fund are safeguarding the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong and maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems.\n\nThe assets of the Fund are managed as four portfolios: the Backing Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio and the Strategic Portfolio. The assets of the Backing Portfolio fully match the Monetary Base, under Hong Kong’s Currency Board system. The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The Long-Term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments. The Strategic Portfolio holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited acquired by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government for the account of the Fund for strategic purposes. Operating segment information is set out in note 31.\n\n# 2 MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n# 2.1 Statement of compliance\n\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRSs), which is a collective term that includes all applicable individual HKFRSs, Hong Kong Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), and accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong. Material accounting policies adopted by the Fund and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) is set out below.\n\nThe HKICPA has issued certain new or revised HKFRSs that are first effective or available for early adoption for the current accounting period of the Group. Note 3 provides information on the changes, if any, in accounting policies resulting from initial application of these developments to the extent that they are relevant to the Group for the current and prior accounting periods reflected in these financial statements.\n\n# 2.2 Basis of preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe Group financial statements include the financial statements of the Group as well as the Group’s interests in associates and joint ventures. The principal activities of the principal subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are shown in notes 16 and 17.\n\nThe measurement basis used in the preparation of the financial statements is historical cost except for the following assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value:\n- derivative financial instruments (note 2.6);\n- financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value through income and expenditure account (note 2.6);\n- financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (note 2.6);\n- gold (note 2.10); and\n- investment properties (note 2.11).\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with HKFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nJudgements made by management in the application of HKFRSs that have significant effect on the financial statements and major sources of estimation uncertainty are disclosed in note 2.18.\n\nCertain comparative figures have been restated to conform to the current year presentation of the Group financial statements.\n\n# 2.3 Subsidiaries and non-controlling interests\n\nA subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. When assessing whether the Group has power, only substantive rights (held by the Group and other parties) are considered.\n", "zh": "外匯基金\n\n審計署署長報告\n\n獨立核數師報告 致財經司長\n\n意見\n\n本人已審核外匯基金及其附屬公司（「本集團」）列於第211至311頁的財務報表，包括截至2023年12月31日的外匯基金及本集團的資產負債表，以及當年結束的收支帳、全面收益表、權益變動表和現金流量表及財務報表附註，包括重大會計政策資料。\n\n本人認為，該等財務報表在所有重大方面均真實公平地反映基金及本集團截至2023年12月31日的財務狀況，以及當年之財務業績及現金流量，並符合由香港會計師公會（「HKICPA」）頒布的香港財務報告準則（「HKFRSs」），已按創辦委員會（在《匯豐條例》（第66章）第7條下由行政長官作出指令）之規定妥善編製。\n\n意見的根據\n\n本人依據《匯豐條例》（第66章）第7條下行政長官的指令及審計署的審計準則進行審計。本人在該等準則下的責任，詳見本人報告的審計責任部分。我在審計期間，與本集團保持獨立，並已履行其他屬於該等準則的道德責任。我相信，我取得的審計證據充分適當，能作為我意見的基礎。\n\n主要審計事項\n\n主要審計事項是指，在我專業判斷中，在2023年結束的年度財務報表審計中最具重要性的事項。這些事項是在整體財務報表審計的背景下進行處理，並在形成意見時考慮，我不會就這些事項發表獨立意見。\n\n其他資料\n\n貨幣管理局負責其他資料。其他資料包括除財務報表及本人審計報告外的2023年年報全部資料。\n\n本人對財務報表的意見不涵蓋其他資料，亦不就該等資料發表任何形式的保證結論。\n\n在審計過程中，本人有責任閱讀其他資料，並在此過程中考慮該等資料是否與財務報表或本人在審計中獲取的知識存在重大不符或貌似重大錯誤。如本人根據所作工作，認為該等資料存在重大錯誤，則須作出報告。本人於此方面沒有任何事項需要披露。\n\n貨幣管理局與外匯基金諮詢委員會的審核委員會在財務報表中的責任\n\n貨幣管理局負責根據HKFRSs及由香港會計師公會（HKICPA）頒布的指令，妥善編製能真實反映基金及本集團財務狀況的財務報表，並負責建立合理的內部控制制度，以確保財務報表不存重大錯漏，不論是由欺詐或疏忽所致。\n\n貨幣管理局在編制財務報表時，負責評估本集團能否繼續營運，披露有關營運能力的事項（如適用），並採用持續經營的會計基礎。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會的審核委員會負責監督本集團的財務匯報流程。\n\n核數師對財務報表審計的責任\n\n本人旨在取得合理保證，確定整體財務報表不存在因欺詐或疏忽引起的重大錯漏，並出具包含本人意見的核數報告。合理保證是較高層次的保證，但不保證所有存在的重大錯漏都能被發現。重大錯漏可能由欺詐或疏忽引起，若單獨或合併，合理可能影響用戶據此作出的經濟決策。\n\n本人依據審計署的審計準則，行使專業判斷，保持專業懷疑，並：\n\n- 認定及評估財務報表存重大錯漏的風險，設計並執行針對這些風險的審計程序，並取得充分適當的審計證據，作為意見的基礎。由欺詐導致的重大錯漏的風險高於疏忽，因欺詐可能涉及串謀、偽造、蓄意遺漏、不實陳述或內部監控的濫用；\n- 了解相關內部控制制度，以設計適合情況的審計程序，但不就本集團內部控制的有效性作出意見；\n- 評估貨幣管理局所採用的會計政策的適當性，以及其所作會計估算和相關披露的合理性；\n- 對貨幣管理局持續經營的會計基礎之適當性作出結論，並根據取得的審計證據，判斷是否存在可能對本集團持續經營能力構成重大不確定性的事件或條件。如我認為存在重大不確定性，須在審計報告中指出相關披露；若披露不足，則應調整意見。本人所作結論基於截至報告日的審計證據，但未來事件或條件可能使本集團停止為持續經營；\n- 評估財務報表的整體呈現、結構及內容，包括披露，並確保財務報表能充分反映相關交易及事件，達到公平披露的效果；以及\n- 取得足夠及適當的審計證據，以對本集團內部或業務活動的財務資料發表意見。本人負責指揮、監督和執行本集團的審計工作，並對我的審計意見保持全權負責。\n\n本人會與外匯基金諮詢委員會的審核委員會溝通，包括審計範圍、時間安排以及任何重大審計發現，包括我在審計中發現的內部控制重大缺陷。\n\n本人亦會向外匯基金諮詢委員會的審核委員會提供聲明，證明本人已遵守有關獨立性之相關道德要求，並向其披露所有可能合理影響本人獨立性的關係及其他事宜，並於適用時，提出相應保障措施。\n\n根據與審核委員會的溝通內容，我會判斷在本期財務報表審計中最為重要的事項，因此列為主要審計事項。除法律或規例禁止公開披露此事項外，否則會在我的核數報告中說明。極少數情況下，亦會因認為披露可能引致的負面後果遠超公眾利益而不披露。\n\n林志遠教授核數署長"}

{"en": "# Chief Executive’s Statement\n\nIn 2017, the global economy and financial markets performed much better than expected: the real economy saw steady growth; inflation remained subdued; the three interest rate hikes and the reduction in the balance sheet by the US Federal Reserve during the year did not result in capital outflows from emerging market economies or a strengthening of the US dollar. Amid bullish sentiment, global stock markets, including the three major US stock indices, kept hitting new highs. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index surged by 34%. The Hang Seng Index gained nearly 8,000 points (or 36%) in 2017 and surpassed the 30,000-point level to reach an all-time high in January 2018.\n\nMany investors were filled with optimism, even exuberance, in such a favourable environment. However, this was until early February this year when the latest data showed a higher than expected wage increase in the US, prompting investors to reappraise inflation risks and triggering significant corrections to global stock markets. The Dow Jones Index fell more than 1,000 points in two days during the second week of February, and the Hang Seng Index dropped more than 3,000 points in the same week. The 10-year US Treasury yield surged to as high as 2.95%. The swift reversal of fund flows indicated that the record high market valuation was not built on a solid foundation. It also reminded us of the importance of a sound and robust financial system for Hong Kong to meet the challenges brought by asset market volatility and capital outflows.\n\n# Banking system resilience boosted by precautionary measures\n\nAs the saying goes, “prevention is better than cure”. The HKMA implemented further risk mitigation measures in 2017 to safeguard the stability of Hong Kong’s banking and financial systems. In May, we introduced the eighth round of countercyclical measures for banks’ mortgage loans and strengthened banks’ credit risk management on lending to property developers, with the aim of enhancing the banking system’s resilience to shocks arising from any downturn in the property market. With the several rounds of measures, the average loan-to-value ratio of new residential mortgage loans fell to 49% at the end of 2017 from 64% in September 2009, while the average debt servicing ratio also declined to 35% from 41% in August 2010.\n\nIn 2017, we established the Resolution Office to implement international standards on the resolution of non-viable financial institutions that are considered “too big to fail”. This will help prevent a recurrence of a global financial crisis similar to the one in 2008 where public money was used to save failing financial institutions, and will minimise the impact of their closures on the financial system, the economy and the community at large.\n\nRobust risk management is the cornerstone of steady and sustainable development of the banking sector. The liquidity ratio and capital adequacy ratio of Hong Kong’s banking system are well above the applicable statutory requirements and among the highest in the world. This undoubtedly reflects the high resilience of Hong Kong’s banking system. Indeed, the banking sector registered strong growth in 2017, with total loans increasing by 16%, while the asset quality also held up well. The classified loan ratio of retail banks fell to 0.54% from 0.72% in 2016, well below the long-term average of 2.2% since 2000. The banking industry’s overall return on equity (based on pre-tax operating profits) reached 11.74% in 2017, a very healthy level compared with other international financial centres.\n\n# Sound banking the key to long-term financial stability\n\nThe 2008 global financial crisis revealed the limitations of relying solely on rules and regulations to restrain the financial industry from pursuing profitability without regard to their primary responsibilities. In light of this, the HKMA has stepped up the promotion of “sound banking” practices in recent years, encouraging banks to develop and pursue good corporate culture and values. In particular, to address the issue of bank staff pursuing short-term profits at the expense of the long-term interests of their customers or banks, we are encouraging banks to put in place appropriate incentive systems that are in line with their corporate culture and values. As part of this campaign, we arranged the inaugural Annual Conference for Independent Non-Executive Directors (INEDs) in March 2017 to highlight the importance of establishing a good banking culture and to empower the INEDs to perform their oversight and monitoring roles more effectively.\n\nWith the support of the banking industry, 2017 was a successful year for the HKMA in the advancement of financial inclusion. Six physical bank branches and three mobile branches began operating in remote areas. The Hong Kong Association of Banks worked out an arrangement with EPS and a convenience store chain to launch a pilot scheme allowing the elderly to withdraw cash from the stores in remote areas without the need to make purchases. Hongkong Post is also launching this year a cash withdrawal service for the elderly at seven Post Offices mainly on outlying islands and in the New Territories. Regarding account opening, the HKMA last year set up a webpage and an email account with a dedicated team to follow up public enquiries or complaints relating to the opening of bank accounts. Thanks to the concerted efforts of various stakeholders, there has been a significant improvement in customer experience in opening individual and corporate bank accounts.\n\n# Fintech a game changer for the banking industry\n\nIn an era of rapid technological advancement, fintech has been gradually integrated into our daily lives. In this ever changing technological environment, banks must embrace new developments and pursue innovation in their application of fintech. With the new era of Smart Banking, the HKMA launched seven initiatives in September (see page 106 for details) promoting the adoption of fintech in banking to improve the quality of banking products and services for customers. While these initiatives are independent of one another, they are complementary and will be a game changer for the future landscape of payment and banking services in Hong Kong. Customers will not only enjoy more convenient, efficient and secure payment and banking services, they will also have more choices and greater control over their financial transactions. Fintech will be the key to banks’ future business success, and moving into the new era of Smart Banking will be a great opportunity for the banks to upgrade and transform themselves.\n\n# Enormous opportunities created by the Belt and Road and the Bay Area Initiatives\n\nWith competition among international financial centres becoming more intense, a diversified financial industry is of paramount importance to Hong Kong. In 2017, the HKMA stepped up its work on enhancing Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre. Given Hong Kong’s unparalleled advantage of “having the Mainland as our hinterland while maintaining an international outlook”, the Belt and Road Initiative and the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Bay Area (Bay Area) will offer enormous opportunities for the financial and banking sectors and give new impetus to the economic growth of Hong Kong. The HKMA Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office, which was established in response to the Belt and Road Initiative, saw the number of its partners grow to around 90 since launch, laying a solid foundation for promoting Hong Kong as a financing hub for infrastructure investments. The issuance of the first Belt and Road bond in Hong Kong by the China Development Bank in 2017 highlighted the pivotal role Hong Kong can play in facilitating the financing of these infrastructure projects.\n\nIn addition to infrastructure financing, we are actively involved in the development of Hong Kong as a hub for corporate treasury centres, private equity funds and Asian derivatives businesses, by attracting multinational corporations and major financial institutions to manage their funds, assets and various financial risks in the city. These initiatives will further consolidate and upgrade Hong Kong’s financial and related professional services sectors. The HKMA also maintains close dialogue with the relevant authorities responsible for the development of the Bay Area to strengthen collaboration with a view to contributing to the financial development of the area as a world-class city cluster.\n\nOver the years, Hong Kong’s financial industry has been developing under the theme of “leveraging Hong Kong’s advantages, meeting the country’s needs”. With the introduction of the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect in 2014, the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect in 2016 and the Northbound Trading of Bond Connect in July last year, the mutual market access between the Mainland and the rest of the world through Hong Kong’s financial platform has been expanded from stock markets to bond markets. This underscores Hong Kong’s unique role as a financial intermediary in facilitating global investors’ access to the Mainland’s financial markets. In 2017, Hong Kong maintained its position as the leading global hub for offshore renminbi business. Average daily turnover of the renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement system stood at RMB900 billion. In addition, according to SWIFT statistics, more than 70% of global renminbi payment transactions were handled through Hong Kong during the year. The offshore renminbi market continued to operate smoothly and develop steadily.\n\n# Nurturing talent to strengthen the soft power of the banking industry\n\nWith the continuing growth of the financial industry, nurturing talent is crucial to its sustainable development. The HKMA attaches great importance to the soft power of the banking industry, and we have been encouraging and supporting ongoing capacity building of banking practitioners. Following the introduction of two modules on anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism and cybersecurity under the Enhanced Competency Framework, we expanded its coverage last year by including retail wealth management and treasury management to enhance the level of core competence of banking practitioners through continuing professional development. The HKMA is also committed to nurturing young talent for the banking industry. In 2017, we launched the Pilot Apprenticeship Programme for Private Wealth Management and the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme in collaboration with the industry. Given the overwhelming response, the coverage of these programmes will be further expanded in the future.\n\n# Prudent investment strategy achieving a reasonable and stable return over the medium to long term\n\nOn the back of strong global economic growth, the Exchange Fund achieved a record high investment income of HK$264 billion last year with gains across the board, including equities, bonds and foreign exchange. The overall investment return was 7.4%. The Investment Portfolio achieved a rate of return of 12.1%, while the Backing Portfolio gained 1.8%. The Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP)’s annualised internal rate of return since its inception in 2009 reached as high as 13.7%. While the investment performance last year was satisfactory, the increasingly complex investment environment requires the HKMA to continue its prudent management of the Exchange Fund. We will remain agile and nimble, monitor market developments closely and deploy defensive measures as and when appropriate. Investments under the LTGP will also be further expanded. As always, the investment principle of “capital preservation first, long-term growth next” within acceptable risk levels will be adhered to when managing the wealth for the people of Hong Kong.\n\nWhile the global real economy is extending last year’s growth momentum, uncertainties and risks still abound in 2018. These include a faster-than-expected pace of US interest rate hikes in case inflation picks up, escalating trade frictions and a deteriorating geopolitical landscape. Should these downside risks materialise, they will have significant and widespread implications for global financial markets, and knock-on effects for Hong Kong’s fund flows, asset prices and real economy. It is therefore advisable that we should all manage the risks prudently.\n\nIn the coming months, it is likely Hong Kong dollar interest rate movements will remain in the spotlight. The US Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times since December 2015. With widening spreads between Hong Kong dollar interest rates and their US dollar counterparts, there is a greater incentive for funds to flow from the Hong Kong dollar into the US dollar. The Hong Kong dollar has been under weakening pressure recently and the 7.85 weak-side Convertibility Undertaking (CU) has been triggered. As we have repeatedly stated, when the 7.85 weak-side CU is triggered, the HKMA will act as a “super money changer” by buying Hong Kong dollars and selling US dollars in the market to ensure that the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate will not weaken beyond the 7.85 level. Such operations are normal and in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System. This should not cause any concern. Indeed, the Exchange Fund currently holds more than HK$4 trillion worth of assets, of which the Hong Kong dollar Monetary Base amounts to about HK$1.7 trillion, providing a strong buffer in the event of fund outflows. Over the years, the HKMA has put in place various lines of defence to safeguard the stability of the banking and financial systems. From a positive perspective, capital outflows will lead to a gradual increase in Hong Kong dollar interest rates, which will be conducive to the normalisation of the interest rate environment in Hong Kong and hence the sustainable development of the local economy and asset markets. During this process, the HKMA will stay vigilant and make every effort to maintain monetary and banking stability in Hong Kong.\n", "zh": "行政長官的聲明\n\n2017年，全球經濟和金融市場的表現遠超預期：實體經濟保持穩健增長，通脹率保持低迷；美國聯邦儲備局在年內進行了三次加息並縮減資產負債表，但未引發資金外流或美元走強。在樂觀情緒帶動下，全球股市，包括美國三大股指，持續創下新高。摩根士丹利國際成熟市場指數暴升34%。恒生指數在2017年累積升近8,000點（或36%），並於2018年1月突破30,000點大關，創下歷史新高。\n\n許多投資者在這樣的有利環境中充滿樂觀，甚至陶醉。然而，這一切直到今年2月初，最新數據顯示美國薪酬上升超出預期，促使投資者重新評估通脹風險，引發全球股市大幅修正。2月第二週，道瓊斯指數兩天內下跌逾1,000點，恒生指數同期則下跌逾3,000點。10年期美國國債收益率升至2.95%。資金流動的快速逆轉显示，市場的歷史高估值並非建立在堅實的基礎上，也提醒我們，香港穩健的金融體系對於應對資產市場波動和資金外流所帶來的挑戰至關重要。\n\n# 提振銀行系統韌性之預防措施\n\n如俗話所說，“防範勝於治療”。香港金融管理局（HKMA）在2017年進一步實施風險緩解措施，以維護香港金融系統的穩定。今年5月，我們推出了第八輪逆周期措施，並強化銀行對房地產開發商的信貸風險管理，旨在提升銀行系統應對房地產市場 any 任何下行風險的韌性。通過多輪措施，2017年末，新批住宅按揭貸款的平均貸款成價比（LTV）降至49%，較2009年9月的64%有所降低；平均負擔率亦從2010年8月的41%下降至35%。\n\n2017年，我們成立了“解決辦公室”，實施國際標準，處理被認為“過大而不能倒”的非經濟性金融機構的清算事宜。這將有助於防止2008年類似的全球金融危機再次發生——當時國家資金被用於挽救陷入困境的金融機構，同時將盡量減低其倒閉對金融體系、經濟與社區的影響。\n\n穩健的風險管理是銀行業穩定與可持續發展的基石。香港銀行體系的流動比率與資本充足率皆遠高於法定標準，並位居世界之冠，充分體現香港銀行系統的高韌性。實際上，2017年銀行業整體表現強勁，貸款總額增長16%，資產質素亦保持良好。零售銀行的分類貸款比率由2016年的0.72%降低至0.54%，遠低於2000年以來的長期平均約2.2%。行業的整體股本回報率（稅前營運利潤基礎）達11.74%，呈現健康水平，對比其他國際金融中心亦屬佼佼者。\n\n# 健全銀行業是長期金融穩定的關鍵\n\n2008年全球金融危機揭示了單純依賴規則法律限制金融業追求盈利而忽視其核心責任的局限性。鑑此，香港金融管理局近年來加大了推動“健全銀行”實踐的力度，鼓勵銀行建立良好的企業文化和價值觀。特別是為了應對銀行員工追逐短期利益，犧牲長遠客戶或銀行利益問題，我們倡導銀行建立與企業文化相符的激勵制度。為此，我們於2017年3月召開了首屆獨立非執行董事（INED）年會，強調建立良好銀行文化的重要性，並授權INED更有效履行監督和監控職責。\n\n在銀行業界的支持下，2017年香港金融管理局在推動金融包容方面取得成功。六間實體分行及三個流動分行在偏遠地區開業。香港銀行協會與經濟及便利店合作，推出試點計劃，讓長者可在偏遠地區的便利店提款，毋須購物。香港郵政今年亦在偏遠離島和新界多個郵局啟動現金提取服務。關於開戶事宜，去年我們設立了專門專頁和電子郵箱，專責跟進公眾查詢或投訴。多方共同努力下，個人及企業銀行戶口開戶的客戶體驗有了顯著改善。\n\n# 金融科技引領行業革新\n\n在科技迅速推進的時代，金融科技逐漸融入我們的日常生活。在這不斷變化的科技環境中，銀行必須擁抱新趨勢，推動創新。隨著“智能銀行”時代的到來，香港金融管理局於九月推出七項倡議（詳見第106頁），促進金融科技在銀行業的應用，以提升銀行產品與服務的質素。這些倡議雖彼此獨立，但相輔相成，將成為香港支付與銀行服務未來格局的轉折點。客戶不僅將享受到更方便、更高效且安全的支付與銀行服務，還會有更多選擇並加強對其金融交易的掌控。金融科技將成為銀行未來業務成功的關鍵，邁入“智能銀行”新時代，亦是銀行進行升級和轉型的寶貴機遇。\n\n# “一帶一路”和粵港澳大灣區倡議帶來巨大商機\n\n隨著國際金融中心之間的競爭日益激烈，多元化的金融產業對香港尤為重要。2017年，香港金融管理局著手提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。香港具有“以內地為後盾、堅持國際化”的無可比擬優勢，“一帶一路”倡議和粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）建設為金融及銀行業帶來巨大的商機，為香港經濟增長注入新動力。由金融基建促進辦公室推動的“一帶一路”基建融資對接平台已與約90個合作夥伴建立合作關係，為香港作為基礎設施投資融資樞紐打下堅實基礎。2017年，中國國家開發銀行在香港發行的首批“一帶一路”債券彰顯香港在基建項目融資中的核心角色。\n\n除了基礎建設融資外，我們積極促進香港成為企業財資中心、私募股權基金和亞太衍生品交易中心，吸引跨國公司和重要金融機構在港管理資金、資產及各項金融風險。這些舉措將進一步鞏固香港的金融及相關專業服務產業。香港金融管理局亦與粵港澳大灣區相關當局保持緊密對話，促進合作，為將香港打造為一個世界級城市群的金融發展出力。\n\n多年来，香港金融行業以“發揮香港優勢，滿足國家需求”為主題不斷發展。自2014年推出滬港通、2016年推出深港通，以及去年7月啟動的南向債券通，內地與全球市場的互聯互通已由股市擴展到債市，彰顯香港在促進全球投資者接入內地金融市場上的獨特角色。2017年，香港依然保持作為離岸人民幣業務全球中心的領先地位，人民幣即時結算系統的日均交易額達9000億元人民幣。此外，根據SWIFT統計，今年超過70%的全球人民幣支付交易經由香港處理。離岸人民幣市場運作平穩，持續穩步發展。\n\n# 培育人才，增強銀行業的軟實力\n\n隨著金融行業的持續增長，人才培育成為其持續發展的關鍵。香港金融管理局高度重視銀行業的軟實力，並一直鼓勵及支持銀行從業人員的持續能力建設。在引入反洗錢、反恐融資和網絡安全的強化勝任能力框架兩個模塊後，我們去年擴展了範圍，涵蓋零售財富管理和財務管理，以提升從業人員的核心能力水平，促進專業持續發展。我們亦致力於培育年輕人才。在2017年，我們啟動了私人財富管理實習計劃和金融科技職業推廣計劃，並與行業合作。由於反響熱烈，未來這些計劃的範圍將進一步擴大。\n\n# 审慎投資策略實現中長期合理穩定回報\n\n在全球經濟高速增長的背景下，交易基金去年創下歷史新高，投資收益達2640億港元，涵蓋股票、債券和外匯。整體投資回報率為7.4%。投資組合的回報率為12.1%，資產支持組合則為1.8%。自2009年成立以來，長期增長組合（LTGP）的年化內部收益率最高達13.7%。儘管去年投資表現令人滿意，但日益複雜的投資環境要求香港金融管理局持續審慎管理交易基金，我們將保持靈敏反應，密切監察市場動態，並在適當時候採取防禦措施。LTGP下的投資範圍亦將進一步擴展。在管理香港市民財富方面，我們始終堅持“資本第一，長期增長”的投資原則，在可接受風險範圍內穩健操作。\n\n儘管全球實體經濟延續去年的增長勢頭，2018年仍充滿不確定性與風險，包括若通脹上升，美國加息節奏可能快於預期、貿易摩擦升級及地緣政治局勢惡化。如若這些下行風險成真，將對全球金融市場產生重大而廣泛的影響，並對香港資金流動、資產價格及實體經濟產生連鎖反應。因此，我們應謹慎管理各種風險。\n\n未來數月，香港元利率走勢很可能再次成為焦點。自2015年12月以來，美國聯邦儲備局已六次加息。隨著港元與美元利差擴大，資金從港幣流入美元的誘因也在增強。近期，港元受到貶值壓力，7.85港元的弱方兌換保證作出了觸發。我們反覆說明，當7.85弱方兌換保證被觸發，金融管理局將以“超級外幣兌換商”的身份，在市場買入港幣、賣出美元，確保港幣匯率不會跌破7.85水平。此操作屬正常範圍，與聯匯制度設計一致，毋須擔憂。目前，交易基金持有資產已超過4萬億港元，其中香港美元貨幣基數約為1.7萬億港元，能有效緩衝資金外流。多年前，我們已建立多道防線，保障金融與銀行系統的穩定。從積極角度看，資金外流將促使港元利率逐步上升，有助於香港利率環境回歸正常，推動本地經濟和資產市場的可持續發展。在此過程中，金融管理局將保持警惕，盡最大努力維持香港的貨幣與金融穩定。"}

{"en": "# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nAgainst the backdrop of a more synchronised expansion of the global economy, Hong Kong saw faster economic growth, tighter labour market conditions and subdued inflationary pressures in 2017. Economic growth for 2018 is expected to remain solid.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Real activities\n\nAmid a more synchronised expansion of the global economy, the Hong Kong economy grew faster in 2017. Growth in real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increased to 3.8%, much higher than the 2.1% growth in 2016 and the long-term growth of about 3% over the past decade (Chart 1 and Table 1). Domestic demand firmed up, with private consumption growth accelerating and overall investment spending reviving. Stronger domestic demand reflected favourable job and income conditions, booming asset prices and improved business sentiment. Externally, Hong Kong’s exports of goods expanded at a faster pace due to increased global trade flows, and exports of services recovered because of vibrant trade and cargo flows and improving inbound tourism. Imports of goods recorded stronger growth on export-induced demand, and imports of services increased steadily amid strong travel interest among residents. On a net basis, the overall trade surplus shrank, making a negative contribution to GDP growth.\n\n\n# Monetary conditions\n\nOn the monetary front, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate generally eased against the US dollar driven primarily by interest rate arbitrage activities amid the negative interest rate differentials between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar. This reflected the normal functioning of the Linked Exchange Rate System in accordance with its design. While still at relatively low levels, Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates faced more upward pressures towards the end of 2017 due to Initial Public Offeringrelated funding demand and banks’ year-end liquidity needs. For credit growth, after two years of single-digit growth, total bank loans increased at a notably faster pace of 16.1% in 2017, reflecting improving economic conditions and positive financial market sentiment. Despite faster loan growth, there were no signs of loosening of banks’ credit underwriting standards, and overall loan quality remained good.\n\n# Inflation\n\nInflationary pressures remained well contained throughout 2017 (Chart 2). Netting out the effects of the Government’s one-off relief measures, the underlying inflation rate declined to 1.7%, down from 2.3% in 2016. In particular, the housing component of the price index increased at a milder pace, reflecting the filter-through of slower increases in fresh-letting private residential rentals in 2016. More broadly, milder increases in nominal wages and earnings amid strong output growth helped keep local cost pressures in check. Import price inflation was also tame, in line with low inflation in Hong Kong’s major import sources despite a weaker US dollar.\n\n# Labour market\n\nThe labour market tightened in 2017 along with above-par economic growth. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell from 3.4% in 2016 to 2.9% towards the end of 2017, below 3% for the first time in nearly 20 years (Chart 3). Most major economic sectors registered decreases in their respective unemployment rates, with more notable declines seen in the retail, financing and professional and business services sectors. As total employment grew faster and the number of private-sector vacancies picked up, overall labour demand continued to strengthen. The labour force also expanded, partly reflecting more active participation of older-age workers (aged 55 and above). Consistent with tighter labour market conditions and lower inflation, real wages and earnings saw faster increases.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe Hong Kong stock market had an almost uninterrupted rally in 2017. The Hang Seng Index rose by 36%, the largest annual gain since 2010 (Chart 4). The rally reflected optimism about the global economy and corporate earnings, and was in part supported by substantial fund inflows from Mainland investors through the Stock Connects. The Hang Seng Index hit a ten-year high in November and remained at high levels towards the end of 2017. Average daily turnover expanded to HK$88.3 billion from HK$66.9 billion in the previous year, and overall equity funds raised from the local market also increased to HK$581.4 billion, compared with HK$490.1 billion a year earlier.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market maintained its upward momentum throughout the year (Chart 4). Transaction volume expanded from 54,701 units a year ago to 61,591 units and housing prices increased by 14.8% in 2017. Housing affordability stretched further, with a price-toincome ratio of 16.4, higher than the previous peak in 1997, and an income-gearing ratio of 74.1, far above its long-term average.1 In view of rising property prices and the intensifying competition for mortgage business among banks, the HKMA introduced the eighth round of prudential measures in May to strengthen banks’ risk management and safeguard banking stability. Housing price growth moderated temporarily following these measures before accelerating in the fourth quarter. As for the commercial and industrial property markets, trading activities increased significantly during the year, with both transaction value and volume registering double-digit growth. With the pick-up in non-residential property prices, corresponding rental yields fell slightly compared to the previous year.\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nEconomic growth for 2018 is expected to remain solid. The Government forecasts growth in the range of 3–4%, while private-sector analysts project the economy to expand at an average rate of 3.2%. Externally, Hong Kong’s export performance will continue to benefit from the improving global growth outlook and the gradual recovery in inbound tourism. Domestically, private consumption growth is expected to hold up mainly as a result of favourable labour market conditions. As for fixed capital formation, building and construction activity should progress steadily on the back of rising housing supply and continuing infrastructure projects. While improved economic conditions will support business capital spending, headwinds may come from potential rises in interest rates.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nWith still-moderate global inflation and steady increase in local costs, inflationary pressures in Hong Kong are anticipated to remain moderate in 2018, but the inflation rate is likely to pick up gradually from the low in 2017. For example, the rental component of inflation may gather momentum in the latter part of 2018 because of feedthrough from increases in fresh-letting private residential rentals. Market consensus predicts the headline inflation rate to be a still-moderate 2.2% for 2018, and the Government projects the underlying inflation rate to be 2.5%. On the other hand, sustained economic growth, expanding building and construction activity and the gradual recovery in inbound tourism are expected to keep the labour market tight in the near future. Private-sector analysts forecast the unemployment rate to stay at about 3.0% in 2018.\n\n# Uncertainties and risks\n\nThe economic outlook for 2018 is subject to a number of uncertainties and risks including those relating to major central banks’ monetary policy normalisation and global financial market stability, as well as heightened protectionist sentiment and deteriorating geopolitical tensions. In particular, if such risks materialise to trigger reversal of fund flows in Hong Kong, local monetary conditions could tighten faster than expected, putting downward pressures on the real economy and asset prices.\n\nThe outlook for the residential property market remains uncertain. In the near term, the current favourable domestic economic conditions, perceived housing shortage, low mortgage rates and alternative sources of home financing (including mortgage loans provided by property developers and financial support from parents), will continue to support the demand for properties. However, the recent sell-off in global financial markets may dampen sentiments. Over the longer term, the property market will continue to face a number of headwinds. In particular, as the US monetary policy normalisation continues, domestic mortgage rates will rise eventually. In addition, on the back of the Government’s effort to increase the supply of land and residential properties, the housing demand-supply gap is expected to narrow gradually, which would ease the upward pressure on property prices in the longer term.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector continued to be safe and sound in 2017 notwithstanding uncertainties surrounding the global economy. The capital and liquidity positions of authorized institutions (AIs) remained strong, asset quality stayed at healthy levels, and profitability improved notably thanks to increased interest margins and robust credit growth.\n\n# Interest rate trends\n\nAs the US interest rate normalisation continued, the onemonth and three-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) fixings increased by 49 basis points and 39 basis points respectively in 2017. More notable rises were observed in the fourth quarter. Nevertheless, the Hong Kong dollar funding cost of retail banks, as measured by the composite interest rate, remained broadly stable over the year (Chart 5).\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe aggregate pre-tax operating profits of retail banks’ Hong Kong offices grew by 15.8% in 2017. The improved performance was mainly due to increases in net interest income (+20.3%) and fee and commission income (+9.4%). However, these increases were partially offset by a decline in income from foreign exchange and derivatives operations (-29.9%) and a growth in operating expenses (+8.4%). The aggregate post-tax profit of retail banks dropped by 18.1% because of certain non-recurring items recorded in 2016. The post-tax return on average assets of retail banks dropped to 1.07% from 1.44% in 2016 (Chart 6).\n\nRetail banks’ net interest margin widened to 1.45% in 2017 from 1.32% in 2016 (Chart 7) mainly due to rising market interest rates.\n\nThe proportion of retail banks’ non-interest income to total operating income decreased to 40% from 44.3% in 2016. While fee and commission income increased by 9.4%, income originated from foreign exchange and derivatives operations dropped by 29.9%.\n\nRetail banks’ cost-to-income ratio declined to 41.9% in 2017 from 43.2% in 2016, as operating costs (+8.4%) increased at a slower pace than operating income (+11.8%) (Chart 8). Retail banks’ loan impairment charges decreased to HK$7.3 billion from HK$8 billion in 2016.\n\n# Asset quality\n\nLoan quality of retail banks improved during the year, with the classified loan ratio decreasing to 0.54% from 0.72% a year earlier. The overdue and rescheduled loan ratio also decreased to 0.4% from 0.53% in 2016 (Chart 9). Similarly, the classified loan ratio and the overdue and rescheduled loan ratio of the whole banking sector decreased to 0.67% and 0.52%, from 0.85% and 0.67% respectively.\n\nThe quality of banks’ residential mortgage lending portfolios remained good, with the delinquency ratio staying at a low level of 0.03% at the end of 2017 (Chart 10). The rescheduled loan ratio was close to 0%. There was no residential mortgage loan in negative equity at the end of the year, as compared with four cases a year ago.\n\nThe delinquency ratio of credit card lending stayed low at 0.22% at the end of 2017, compared with 0.24% a year ago (Chart 10). The combined delinquent and rescheduled loan ratio edged down to 0.31% from 0.33% during the period. The charge-off ratio also fell slightly to 1.75% from 1.92% in 2016.\n\n# Balance sheet trends\n\nTotal loans of the banking sector grew by 16.1% in 2017, compared with 6.5% in 2016. Demand for credit increased, driven by optimism about the global economic outlook. As total deposits increased at a slower pace than total loans, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio rose to 73% at the end of 2017 from 68.4% a year earlier. The Hong Kong-dollar loan-to-deposit ratio also increased to 82.7% from 77.1% during the same period (Chart 11).\n\nMainland-related lending (including loans booked in Mainland subsidiaries of locally incorporated banks) increased by 17.5% in 2017, compared with a growth of 7% recorded in 2016.\n\n# Holdings of negotiable debt securities\n", "zh": "# 經濟及金融環境\n\n在全球經濟同步擴張的背景下，香港在2017年見證了較快的經濟增長、更緊張的勞動力市場狀況以及低迷的通脹壓力。2018年的經濟增長預計仍將保持堅實。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 實體活動\n\n在全球經濟同步擴展的情況下，香港經濟在2017年增長速度加快。實質國內生產總值（GDP）增長至3.8%，遠高於2016年的2.1%以及過去十年約3%的長期增長水平（圖1和表1）。國內需求趨於穩固，私人消費增長加快，整體投資復甦。強勁的國內需求反映了有利的就業和收入條件、資產價格的繁榮以及商業信心的改善。在外貿方面，香港的貨物出口由於全球貿易流量的增加而加快，服務出口則因繁榮的貿易和貨運流量以及入境旅遊的改善而恢復。貨物進口因出口帶動的需求而增長，服務進口在居民強勁旅行興趣的推動下也穩步增長。總體而言，淨貿易順差縮小，對GDP增長產生了負面貢獻。\n\n# 貨幣狀況\n\n在貨幣方面，港元對美元匯率普遍走軟，主要由於利率套利活動，以及港元與美元之間的負利差所驅動，這反映了聯繫匯率制度按照設計正常運作的情況。儘管仍處於較低水平，2017年底由於首次公開招股相關融資需求及銀行的年終流動性需求，港元銀行同業拆借利率面臨更大上行壓力。就信貸增長而言，經過兩年單位數的增長後，2017年銀行總貸款顯著加快，增長率達16.1%，顯示經濟狀況改善和金融市場情緒積極。儘管貸款增長加快，但銀行的信貸承保標準未見放鬆，整體貸款質量仍保持良好。\n\n# 通脹\n\n2017年，通脹壓力得以良好控制（圖2）。剔除政府一次性紓困措施的影響，基本通脹率下降至1.7%，低於2016年的2.3%。尤其是房屋價格指數中租金部分的漲幅較為溫和，反映了2016年新租私人住宅租金增長放緩的滲透率。更廣泛來看，名義工資和收入的溫和上升，加之產出增長的強勁，幫助控制了本地成本壓力。進口物價通脹亦較為溫和，與香港主要進口來源國的低通脹水平一致，即使美元走弱也未顯著升高。\n\n# 勞動市場\n\n2017年，隨著經濟增長超出預期，勞動市場趨於緊張。季調失業率由2016年的3.4%降至2017年底的2.9%，首次在近20年內低於3%（圖3）。主要經濟部門的失業率普遍下降，零售、金融及專業和商業服務部門尤為明顯。隨著就業總數的快速增長和私營部門空缺數的上升，整體勞動需求持續增強。勞動力也有所擴大，部分原因是老年工作者（55歲及以上）參與度更高。與勞動力市場緊張和通脹降低相符，實際工資和收入增速加快。\n\n# 股票市場\n\n2017年，香港股市幾乎持續上揚。恒生指數上升36%，為自2010年以來最大年度漲幅（圖4）。此次反彈展現了對全球經濟和企業盈利的樂觀預期，而內地投資者通過“滬港通”等資金流入也提供了部分支撐。恒生指數在11月達到十年新高，並在2017年底保持在高位。日均成交額由前一年的66.9億港元擴大到88.3億港元，當地股市募集的股票基金總額也增加至5814億港元，高於去年的4901億港元（圖4）。\n\n# 地產市場\n\n住宅物業市場全年保持上升態勢（圖4）。成交量由去年54,701個單位擴大到61,591個單位，房價則上升14.8%。房屋負擔能力進一步惡化，房價與收入比率達到16.4，創1997年以來新高，而且收入較長期平均水平的房價收入比率高出很多（即：房價越來越難負擔）。鑑於房價上升和銀行間爭奪按揭業務的激烈競爭，金管局於5月推出了第八輪審慎措施，以加強銀行的風險管理和保障金融穩定。在這些措施的影響下，房價漲幅暫時放緩，随后在第四季度再次加快。商業和工業物業方面，交易活動顯著增加，成交額和交易量都實現兩位數增長。由於非住宅物業價格上升，相應的租金收益率較去年略有下降。\n\n# 經濟展望\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n2018年經濟增長預計仍將堅挺。政府預測增幅在3%至4%之間，私營部門分析師則預估平均增長率為3.2%。外部來說，隨著全球經濟展望的改善和入境旅遊的逐步復甦，香港的出口表現將繼續受益。內部方面，預計私人消費增長將主要受到有利的勞動市場條件支撐。至於固定資本形成，建築和工程活動將在房屋供應增加及基礎設施項目持續推進下穩步展開。在經濟狀況改善的背景下，企業資本支出也將受到支撐，但利率潛在上升的阻力仍需關注。\n\n# 通脹和勞動市場\n\n由於全球通脹仍屬溫和，香港本地成本持續上升，預計2018年通脹壓力將保持適中，但通脹率可能逐步回升，較2017年較低的水平。比如，房租部分的通脹預期在2018年下半年可能會開始加速，因為新租私人住宅租金的增長將逐漸傳導。市場普遍預測2018年整體的通脹率仍會保持在約2.2%，而政府則預計基礎通脹率為2.5%。同時，經濟持續增長、建築工程活動擴展及入境旅遊逐步復甦，也預計將使勞動市場繼續保持緊張。私營部門分析師預期失業率將約為3.0%。\n\n# 不確定性與風險\n\n2018年的經濟前景面臨多種不確定性和風險，包括主要中央銀行的貨幣政策正常化以及全球金融市場的穩定性，此外還有保護主義情緒升溫和地緣政治緊張局勢惡化的潛在風險。特別是，如果這些風險造成資金流向香港的逆轉，當地貨幣狀況可能會比預期更快趨緊，從而對實體經濟和資產價格產生下行壓力。\n\n住宅物業市場的前景仍不明朗。在短期內，理想的經濟環境、住房短缺印象、低按揭利率以及房屋資金來源的多元化（包括房地產開發商提供的按揭貸款和家長的財務支持）將持續支撐房地產需求。然而，近期全球金融市場的拋售可能會抑制投資者情緒。從長遠來看，受多重阻力影響，房地產市場仍將面臨挑戰。特別是，隨著美國貨幣政策的正常化，房貸利率最終將上升。此外，政府努力增加土地和住宅供應，預計住房供求缺口會逐步縮小，從而在較長期內緩和房價上漲的壓力。\n\n# 銀行業績表現\n\n儘管全球經濟存在不確定性，香港銀行業在2017年依然保持安全穩健。授權機構的資本和流動性水平仍然強勁，資產質量維持在健康水平，盈利能力顯著改善，主要得益於息差擴大和信貸增長強勁。\n\n# 利率趨勢\n\n隨著美國利率的不斷正常化，2017年港元拆息一個月和三個月的利率分別上升了49個基點和39個基點。第四季度的升幅尤為顯著。然而，衡量零售銀行港元融資成本的綜合利率在全年基本保持穩定（圖5）。\n\n# 獲利能力趨勢\n\n2017年，零售銀行在香港的整體稅前營運利潤增長15.8%。這主要由於淨利息收入增加20.3%及手續費收入增加9.4%。但這些增長部分被外匯和衍生品操作收益下降29.9%以及營運開支上升8.4%所抵消。由於2016年錄得一些一次性非經常性收益，整體稅後純利下降18.1%。零售銀行的平均資產稅後收益率由2016年的1.44%降低至1.07%（圖6）。\n\n由於市場利率上升，零售銀行的淨利差擴大至1.45%（圖7），高於2016年的1.32%。零售銀行非利息收入佔整體營運收入的比重由2016年的44.3%降至40%，手續費收入增加9.4%，外匯和衍生品收益則下降29.9%。營運成本佔比由43.2%降至41.9%，收入增長快於成本增長，貸款減值準備由2016年的8億港元降至7.3億港元。\n\n# 資產質量\n\n年內，零售銀行的貸款質量有所改善，不良貸款比率由一年前的0.72%降低至0.54%。逾期與調整後的貸款比率亦由0.53%降低至0.4%（圖9）。整個銀行業的分類貸款比率和逾期及調整後的貸款比率分別由0.85%及0.67%下降至0.67%和0.52%。住宅按揭貸款的貸款質量依然良好，截至2017年底，逾期率僅0.03%（圖10），調整後的貸款比率接近0%，沒有出現負資產的個案。信用卡貸款的逾期率較低，2017年底為0.22%，較一年前的0.24%略有下降（圖10）。拖欠與調整後的貸款比率合併後為0.31%，低於期內的0.33%；呆帳沖銷率亦由2016年的1.92%略微降至1.75%。\n\n# 資產負債表趨勢\n\n2017年，銀行業的總貸款比2016年增長16.1%，而去年則為6.5%。由於對全球經濟展望的樂觀，信貸需求增加。因存款增長速度慢於貸款，整體貸存比由去年的68.4%升至73%；同期間，港元貸款存款比亦由77.1%升至82.7%（圖11）。與內地相關的貸款（包括在內地子公司登記的貸款）2017年增長17.5%，較2016年的7%大幅提升。\n\n# 有價證券持有情況"}
{"en": "# Monetary Stability\n\nDespite weakening pressure on the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to operate in an orderly manner with ample liquidity. The Linked Exchange Rate System has served as a strong anchor for Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability and proved to be highly resilient against various shocks.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability. This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n- Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three noteissuing banks\n- Government-issued notes and coins in circulation\n- the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of the clearing account balances of banks kept with the HKMA\n- Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the HKMA’s firm commitment to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs). When the demand for Hong Kong dollars is greater than the supply and the market exchange rate strengthens to the strong-side CU of HK$7.75 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to sell Hong Kong dollars to banks for US dollars. The Aggregate Balance will then expand to push down Hong Kong dollar interest rates, creating monetary conditions that move the Hong Kong dollar away from the strong-side limit to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if the supply of Hong Kong dollars is greater than the demand and the market exchange rate weakens to the weak-side CU of HK$7.85 to one US dollar, the HKMA will buy Hong Kong dollars from banks. The Aggregate Balance will then contract to drive Hong Kong dollar interest rates up, pushing the Hong Kong dollar away from the weak-side limit to stay within the Convertibility Zone.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2017\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate generally saw weakening pressure in 2017 (Chart 1). Driven mainly by interest carry trade activities amid widened negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates, the Hong Kong dollar eased gradually against the US dollar, from 7.7566 on 3 January to the year-low of 7.8265 on 22 August. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate gained some strength between late September and early November, underpinned by a tightening of Hong Kong dollar liquidity due to initial public offering (IPO)-related funding demand, and traded steadily within a narrow range of 7.80–7.81. Weakening pressures on the Hong Kong dollar were seen again towards the end of the year, partly reflecting slightly improved Hong Kong dollar liquidity conditions as well as increased year-end commercial demand for the US dollar. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market functioned normally throughout 2017.\n\nAs the CUs were not triggered, the total of the Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs remained virtually unchanged at around HK$1,225.3 billion in 2017 (Chart 2). During the year, the HKMA issued a total of HK$80 billion additional Exchange Fund Bills to meet banks’ increased demand for liquidity management. This led to a contraction of the Aggregate Balance to HK$179.8 billion at the end of 2017. The issuance of additional Exchange Fund Bills was consistent with Currency Board principles, as it only represented a change in the composition of the Monetary Base, with a shift from the Aggregate Balance to the outstanding EFBNs. The Monetary Base remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\n# Money market\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates stayed soft in the first eight months of 2017 before facing more upward pressure towards the end of the year (Chart 3). Despite concerns about the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes and balance sheet normalisation, the Hong Kong dollar interbank rates generally remained soft for the first eight months. As such, the negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates widened between January and August. From September onward, the shortdated Hong Kong dollar interbank rates witnessed large pick-ups, driven mainly by IPO-related and year-end funding demand. Correspondingly, the negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates narrowed in the short-dated segment. Overall, the short-dated interbank rates traded mostly below the Base Rate in 2017.\n\nThe Base Rate was adjusted upwards on 16 March, 15 June and 14 December, by a total of 75 basis points from 1.00% to 1.75%, as the target range for the US federal funds rate moved upward three times by a total of 75 basis points from 0.50–0.75% to 1.25–1.50% during the year. The adjustment of the Base Rate was in accordance with the revised formula announced on 26 March 2009, in which the Base Rate is set at either 50 basis points above the lower bound of the prevailing target range for the US federal funds rate or the average of the five-day moving averages of the overnight and one-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs), whichever is the higher.\n\nRoughly tracking the movements of the Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads, the discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points widened gradually during the first three quarters, with the 12-month Hong Kong dollar forward points reaching about -615 pips in midSeptember (Chart 4). In the fourth quarter, the discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points narrowed slightly along with the narrowing of the negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates. Overall, Hong Kong’s money market continued to operate in an orderly manner and interbank liquidity remained ample. Discount Window borrowing increased from HK$5.3 billion in 2016 to HK$10.3 billion in 2017.\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nSince its establishment in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has served as a strong anchor for Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, and proved to be highly resilient in a series of regional and global financial crises. The Government has reasserted its full commitment to the LERS and the credibility of its commitment was further reinforced by the stability in the foreign exchange and money markets. There is also continued strong public confidence in the Hong Kong dollar as a means of payment and a storage of value. In its 2017 Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund reaffirmed its support for the LERS, commenting that the LERS remained the best exchange rate arrangement for Hong Kong. Combined with robust financial supervision and regulation, prudent fiscal management, and flexible markets, the LERS has worked well to help Hong Kong navigate successfully through both external and domestic challenges.\n\nInternational Monetary Fund: “The Linked Exchange Rate System remains the best arrangement for Hong Kong.”\n\nA sound banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS. During 2017, the HKMA continued to monitor closely banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and stepped up its supervisory efforts on corporate, property-related and mainland-related lending to bolster the resilience of the banking sector. As the US Federal Reserve continues to normalise its monetary policy, the Hong Kong dollar interest rates will gradually normalise as well. The HKMA reiterated that, under the design of the LERS, the outflow of capital, the weakening of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, the triggering of the weak-side CU and the reduction of the Monetary Base are part of the necessary process of the normalisation of Hong Kong dollar interest rates. The HKMA also reminded the public to manage their risks prudently and be well prepared for potential financial turbulence.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio, defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base, moved within a range of 106.7–108.2% during 2017, without touching the Upper or Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 108.1% on 31 December (Chart 5). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. In the event of abrupt shocks, the sizeable amount of financial resources of the Exchange Fund will provide a powerful backstop in protecting Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\n# Other activities\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to the monetary and financial stability of Hong Kong. In 2017, the CBC considered various issues, including the drivers of short-run dynamics in Hong Kong’s housing prices, the determinants of HIBOR-London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) spreads, the effect of property valuation changes on corporate borrowing in Mainland China, and the effect of mortgage debt service burden on private consumption in Hong Kong. Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and the reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research (HKIMR) continued to sponsor research in the fields of monetary policy, banking and finance. Over the past three years, the HKIMR has been re-orienting its activities towards higher policy relevance. This is reflected, in particular, in its conference activities and visiting fellowship programmes. The HKIMR has been collaborating with major central banks and policy institutions to jointly organise more policyfocused conferences. Meanwhile, a thematic research fellowship programme introduced in 2016 has been supporting more research projects related to policy issues that are of importance to the HKMA.\n\nIn 2017, the HKIMR hosted 18 research fellows and published 29 working papers. It also organised four international conferences and workshops during the year:\n- The Eighth Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy, titled “China’s Economic Rebalancing: Where is it Heading?”, was held in January in Hong Kong. The conference provided a forum for academics, policy makers and business economists to discuss important analytical and policy issues related to the Mainland economy. 11 highquality research papers were presented, covering a wide variety of issues including Mainland’s economic rebalancing, structural reform and international spillovers, issues on the renminbi exchange rate, and Mainland’s monetary policy framework and transmission.\n- The 15th HKIMR Summer Workshop was held in July. The workshop was intended to provide an opportunity for staff members of the HKIMR and the HKMA to present their research papers, and to enhance interaction between research staff and visiting fellows.\n- A joint conference organised by the HKMA and the Bank for International Settlements, titled “The Price, Real and Financial Effects of Exchange Rates”, was held in August. The conference provided a platform for in-depth and insightful discussion. A wide range of important topics were covered, including the exchange rate system, the pricing system of international trade, risk taking in the accumulation of foreign currency reserves, and foreign exchange market behaviour.\n- A conference jointly sponsored by the HKMA, the US Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta on “Unconventional Monetary Policy: Lessons Learned” was held in October. The conference reviewed lessons learned from the unconventional monetary policies (UMP) of major central banks over the past ten years. The topics included monetary policy in a low interest rate environment, UMP and its spillovers to emerging economies, UMP and bank lending, and UMP and its effects on the real economy and financial stability.\n", "zh": "# 貨幣穩定性\n\n儘管對香港元兌換率的壓力持續減弱，香港的貨幣及資金市場仍能有序運作，且流動性充裕。聯繫匯率制度一直是維護香港貨幣及金融穩定的堅實錨，並在應對各種衝擊中展現出高度韌性。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的首要目標是貨幣穩定，即將香港貨幣在外匯市場對美元的匯率保持在7.75至7.85港元對1美元的範圍內，並保持外匯穩定。貨幣系統的結構以貨幣局安排為特點，規定貨幣基礎至少由在匯豐銀行基金中持有的美元儲備百分之百支持，且貨幣基礎的變化必須由相應的美元儲備變動百分之百匹配。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n- 債券證明，全面支持三家發鈔銀行發行的鈔票\n- 政府發行的流通中的紙幣和硬幣\n- 總結餘，即與香港金融管理局（HKMA）結算帳戶餘額的銀行清算餘額之和\n- 由HKMA代表政府發行的匯豐票據（EFBNs）\n\n維持港元兌換率穩定，依靠自動利率調整機制和HKMA堅定履行換單信守承諾（CUs）的承諾。當港幣需求大於供應，且市場匯率升至強側的7.75港元/美元時，HKMA準備出售港幣換取美元，擴大總結餘以壓低港元利率，促使貨幣條件向偏離強側限制、進入7.75至7.85的兌換區域方向移動。相反，若港幣供應大於需求，且市場匯率下降至弱側的7.85港元/美元，HKMA將從銀行購買港幣，縮減總結餘以提高港元利率，保持港幣在兌換區域內。\n\n# 2017年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定性\n\n2017年，港元兌換率整體面臨貶值壓力（圖1）。主要由於利差套利活動，伴隨港元與美元利率擴大負差，港幣逐步對美元走軟，從1月3日的7.7566升至8月22日的年低點7.8265。在九月底至十一月初，受到IPO所致資金需求的促進，港幣匯率略微走強，並在7.80至7.81的窄幅範圍內平穩交易。年底前，港幣再次承受貶值壓力，部分反映港幣流動性條件略有改善及年末美元的商業需求增加。整體而言，2017年港幣兌換市場正常運作。\n\n由於未觸發換單信守承諾，2017年結束時，總結餘與未償還EFBNs的總額大致維持在HK$1,225.3億（圖2）。年內，HKMA共發行了HK$800億的額外匯豐票據，以應對銀行對流動性管理需求的增加，這導致年底總結餘縮減至HK$179.8億。此等發行遵循貨幣局原則，僅為貨幣基礎的組成變化，將總結餘由其轉為未償還EFBNs，貨幣基礎仍由外匯儲備完全支持。\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n2017年前八個月，港幣拆息保持偏低，年尾則逐漸升高（圖3）。儘管市場擔憂美國聯邦儲備局升息及資產負債表正常化，港幣拆息在前八個月內仍然偏軟，兩者之間的負差擴大。九月起，短期港幣拆息大幅上升，主要由IPO及年末資金需求推動，導致港元與美元間負差縮窄。整體而言，2017年的短期拆息多在基準利率以下。\n\n3月16日、6月15日及12月14日，香港金融管理局將基準利率調升，共計75個基點，由1.00%升至1.75%。同期，美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍經歷三次上升，合計75個基點，由0.50%–0.75%提升至1.25%–1.50%。基準利率的調整依據2009年3月26日公布的修訂公式設置，按較高者為準，即50個基點高於美元聯邦基金利率目標範圍下限或香港隔夜及一個月拆息五日移動平均值的平均值。\n\n大致跟蹤港元-美元利差變動，可見12個月港幣遠期點數在前三季逐步擴大，至九月中期接近-615點（圖4）。四季內，遠期點數略有收窄，與港元與美元利差收窄同步。總體來說，港幣貨幣市場持續有序運作，銀行同業拆借流動性充裕，折扣窗口借款由2016年的HK$53億增至HK$103億。\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n自1983年建立以來，聯繫匯率制度（LERS）一直是香港貨幣及金融穩定的重要支柱，在一系列地區及全球金融危機中展現出高度韌性。政府重申對LERS的全面承諾，其可信度因外匯及貨幣市場的穩定而進一步強化。公眾對港元作為支付手段及價值儲存方式的信心依然堅固。國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）在2017年對香港的第IV次磋商中，再次確認支持LERS，稱其為香港最適合的匯率安排。再加上健全的金融監管與審慎的財政管理，LERS有效助力香港成功應對外部及國內挑戰。\n\nIMF： “聯繫匯率制度仍是香港最適合的安排。”\n\n健全的銀行體系對LERS的正常運作至關重要。2017年，HKMA持續密切監測銀行的信貸、流動性及利率風險管理與壓力測試結果，加強對企業、房地產及內地貸款的監督，以增強銀行業的韌性。隨著美聯儲逐步正常化貨幣政策，港元利率也將逐步回歸正常。HKMA重申，根據LERS設計，資金外流、港元兌美元走弱、觸發弱側CUs及貨幣基礎縮減，都是正常化過程中必要的一部分。HKMA亦提醒公眾謹慎管理風險，做好應對可能的金融動盪準備。\n\n為提升貨幣局帳戶的透明度，自1998年10月起，已分配部分匯豐基金資產作為貨幣基礎的支持資金。該“支持比率”定義為支持資金除以貨幣基礎，2017年間維持在106.7%至108.2%的範圍內，並於12月31日收於108.1%（圖5）。在LERS下，雖然將特定的匯豐基金資產指定為支持投資組合，但所有基金資產都可用於支持港元匯率。突發震盪中，龐大的匯豐基金資金儲備將提供強大支撐，保障香港貨幣及金融穩定。\n\n# 其他活動\n\n匯豐基金顧問委員會（CBC）貨幣局特別委員會持續監控並審議與香港貨幣金融穩定相關的議題。2017年，CBC考慮了涉及香港房價短期動態驅動因素、香港銀行間拆息與倫敦銀行間拆息差、房價變動對內地企業借款的影響，以及房貸負擔對私人消費的效應等多個議題。相關會議紀錄及匯豐帳戶運作報告已在HKMA網站公布。\n\n香港金融管理研究院（HKIMR）持續支持貨幣政策、銀行及金融領域的研究。在過去三年中，HKIMR逐步調整其活動，使其更具政策相關性，並通過會議和訪問研究員項目進行體現。與主要中央銀行及政策機構合作，組織更多政策聚焦的研討會。此外，自2016年起推出的專題研究獎學金計劃支援多個政策相關研究項目。\n\n2017年，HKIMR共接待18名研究員，出版29篇工作論文，並舉辦了四場國際會議與研討會：\n- 1月在香港舉行“中國經濟再平衡”主題的第八屆中國經濟國際會議，為學界、政策制定者和企業經濟學家提供平台，討論中國經濟重整、結構改革、國際溢出效應、人民幣匯率以及中國的貨幣政策框架和傳導問題等多樣議題，呈現11篇高質量研究。\n- 7月舉辦第十五屆HKIMR夏季研討會，促進HKIMR與HKMA研究人員的交流與展示。\n- 8月由HKMA與國際清算銀行共同主辦“匯率的價格、實際及金融效應” конференція，深入探討匯率制度、國際貿易定價、外匯儲備的風險承擔及外匯市場行為等重要話題。\n- 10月由HKMA、聯邦儲備局及亞特蘭大聯邦儲備銀行合辦“非常規貨幣政策：經驗教訓”會議，回顧過去十年主要央行非常規貨幣政策的經驗，包括低利率環境、溢出效應、銀行信貸及實體經濟與金融穩定的影響。"}
{"en": "# Banking Stability\n\nIn 2017, the HKMA continued to place its supervisory focus on the effectiveness of authorized institutions’ risk governance framework, including credit and liquidity risk management systems. During the year, another round of countercyclical macro-prudential measures was introduced to strengthen the resilience of the banking sector to cope with any downturn in the property market. With cyber threats on the rise, the HKMA stepped up the supervision of authorized institutions’ technology risk management. At the same time, the HKMA launched seven initiatives that prepare Hong Kong to move into a New Era of Smart Banking. The effectiveness of authorized institutions’ anti-money laundering and counterterrorist financing controls remained a key supervisory focus of the HKMA as part of its efforts to combat financial crimes. On conduct supervision, the HKMA took further steps to promote a customer-centric corporate culture, foster financial inclusion, and address difficulties encountered by small and medium-sized enterprises and start-up companies in opening and maintaining bank accounts in Hong Kong. Efforts were also made to enhance the supervision of authorized institutions’ sales practices for investment and insurance products to further strengthen customer protection.\n\nSubstantial progress was made on the local implementation of international supervisory and accounting standards, including capital adequacy standards, disclosure standards, the Net Stable Funding Ratio, large exposure limits, recovery planning and International Financial Reporting Standard 9. In support of the need for capacity building amid an ever-changing banking environment and evolving risk landscape, the HKMA co-ordinated with the industry to develop director empowerment programmes and the Enhanced Competency Framework for banking practitioners.\n\nThe Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance came into operation on 7 July 2017, making Hong Kong one of the few Financial Stability Board member jurisdictions with a fully cross-sectoral resolution regime for financial institutions. The Ordinance, establishing a new line of defence for financial stability, confers necessary powers on the Monetary Authority to manage, in an orderly manner, failure of a financial institution in circumstances where such failure could have adverse systemic consequences.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this objective is contingent upon the financial system being highly resilient and capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their business and, in extremis, by failing in a disorderly manner. The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring banks are resilient to shocks and are able to recover their positions in response to crises, which ultimately helps prevent failures. The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banking business, which includes the business of taking deposits, in Hong Kong. It is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposittaking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs). The Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs).\n\nHowever, the Monetary Authority cannot ensure, nor is the Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework designed to ensure, a zero-risk financial system. Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that in the event of an AI’s failure, resolution may be conducted in an orderly manner such that continuity in critical financial services provided by AIs to their customers can be maintained. To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong is established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs, amongst other financial institutions.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2017\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nIn 2017, 192 off-site reviews were conducted covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL ratings1, corporate governance, business operations and risk management of AIs. As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance at AIs, 30 meetings were held with the boards of directors or board-level committees of AIs, with the discussions focused on important risk management issues. The HKMA also conducted a survey to monitor the adoption of its recent guidance on corporate governance. 27 tripartite meetings among the HKMA, AIs and their external auditors were also held.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA continued to conduct regular on-site examinations supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk. This approach has allowed the HKMA to prioritise its supervisory resources to focus on emerging and more significant risks faced by AIs. The HKMA conducted 401 on-site examinations and thematic reviews during the year. Credit risk management and controls remained the key focus of these examinations and reviews. Another major focus was technology risk and operational risk management. The HKMA also increased the number of overseas examinations and the number of on-site examinations and thematic reviews targeted at liquidity and market risk management as well as anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML/CFT) controls. On-site examinations of AIs’ activities in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses were also conducted by specialist teams.\n\n# Supervision of credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nTotal bank lending grew by 16.1%, compared with a growth of 6.5% in 2016. As shown in Table 2, the loan growth was broad-based.\n\nSpecifically, Mainland-related lending grew by 17.5% to HK$4,188 billion at the end of 2017 (Table 3). This included HK$644 billion of loans booked with Mainland subsidiaries of banks incorporated in Hong Kong.\n\nThe asset quality of AIs remained healthy in 2017. Retail banks’ classified loan ratio edged down from 0.72% at the end of 2016 to 0.54% at the end of 2017, well below the long-run historical average of 2.2% since 2000. For the banking industry as a whole, the classified loan ratio decreased from 0.85% to 0.67%. As regards Mainlandrelated lending, retail banks’ classified loan ratio of such lending edged down to 0.75% in 2017 from 0.82%. For the banking industry as a whole, the ratio decreased to 0.67% from 0.80% a year ago.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA stepped up its supervisory efforts to ensure that AIs continued to adopt prudent credit risk management standards. In particular, the surveillance of AIs’ exposures to major corporates was enhanced. Targeted thematic examinations were conducted, focusing on key credit risk management controls such as loan underwriting standards, the loan classification and provisioning system, credit risk governance framework and risk management for lending to property developers, asset-backed financing and insurance premium financing.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nProperty prices continued to rise in 2017. There were more loans extended by AIs involving borrowers with multiple mortgages or with income derived from outside of Hong Kong. In view of these developments, the HKMA introduced another round of countercyclical macroprudential measures on 19 May. The eighth round of measures included raising the risk-weight floor for the calculation of capital charges for new residential mortgage loans granted by AIs, lowering the applicable loan-to-value (LTV) ratio cap for property mortgage loans extended to borrowers with pre-existing mortgages, and lowering the applicable debt servicing ratio (DSR) limit for property mortgage loans extended to borrowers whose income is derived mainly from outside of Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA’s macro-prudential measures on property mortgage loans, introduced since 2009, have enhanced banks’ resilience to risks associated with the property market. The average LTV ratio of new residential mortgage loans fell to 49% in December 2017 from 64% in September 2009, before the countercyclical measures were first introduced. The average DSR also decreased to 35% in December 2017 from 41% in August 2010, when a cap on DSR was first applied (Chart 1).\n\nThe HKMA observed that some developers financed their property development projects with high gearing and some of them provided mortgages with high LTV ratios to buyers of properties. To address the risks associated with these developments, the HKMA introduced new risk management measures for lending to property developers on 12 May. These included requiring AIs to lower the financing caps for construction financing; requiring AIs to set aside more capital for their lending to property developers with a higher proportion of mortgage loans relative to equity; and performing a round of thematic examinations to ensure that banks continue to follow prudent underwriting standards in their lending to property developers.\n\nSeparately, the HKMA worked with the Land Registry in launching an e-Alert service in February. The e-Alert service provides a notification to the AI concerned whenever a further mortgage in respect of the mortgaged property is lodged with the Land Registry for registration, so that the mortgagee bank can take appropriate risk mitigating actions as appropriate.\n\n# Supervision of operational and technology risks\n\nCybersecurity threats continued to increase over the year. The HKMA stepped up its supervisory efforts in a bid to enhance the cyber resilience of the banking sector. As part of the Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative (CFI) rolled out by the HKMA in 2016, 30 AIs completed an assessment of the maturity of their cyber defences. Separately, the HKMA and the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), after extensive consultation with the banking and securities industry, jointly decided to introduce a mandatory twofactor authentication for online share trading. A round of on-site examinations focused on banks’ cybersecurity controls and operational resilience was also conducted. The HKMA further completed a round of discussions with the senior management of major banks to assess how the banks were managing strategic risks posed by potential new market entrants powered by technological advancement.\n\n# Smart Banking\n\nIn September, the HKMA announced a package of measures to assist Hong Kong’s banking sector in migrating to a new era of Smart Banking. On the supervisory front, the HKMA enhanced the Fintech Supervisory Sandbox to version 2.0, with new features including a Chatroom facility accessible by both banks and technology firms and the establishment of linkages among the sandboxes of the HKMA, the SFC and the Insurance Authority (IA), so as to provide a single point of entry for conducting trials of cross-sector fintech products.\n\nThe HKMA also launched a Banking Made Easy initiative to identify and minimise regulatory frictions with the aim of further improving customers’ experience in using fintech and digital banking services. A taskforce has been set up with the current focus on remote onboarding and account maintenance, online finance and online wealth management.\n\nA review of the existing Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks has commenced to facilitate the introduction of virtual banking in Hong Kong.\n\n# Supervision of treasury activities and liquidity risk\n\nAs the US continued to normalise its monetary policy, global fund flows might become increasingly volatile. In consideration of this, the HKMA placed increased focus on the supervision of liquidity risk during the year. The HKMA enhanced its supervisory liquidity stress testing with additional scenarios, including a more stressful but plausible scenario of fund outflows and a short-term, confidencedriven bank run scenario. The HKMA also stepped up the monitoring and analysis of individual AIs’ liquidity profiles and required selected AIs to strengthen their liquidity risk management capability.\n\nSeparately, the HKMA conducted more on-site examinations of AIs’ market risk management in respect of their debt securities portfolios. A round of thematic reviews were carried out to evaluate potential risks arising from AIs’ increased investment activities in foreign currency bonds and to assess the effectiveness of the corresponding risk management, including hedging practices.\n\n# Prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF)\n\nThe Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) (Amendment) Bill 2017 was gazetted on 23 June and will come into operation in 2018. The amendment is intended to update Hong Kong’s regulatory regime for AML/CFT in line with the latest international requirements as promulgated by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). These changes, together with updates to the statutory guideline on AML/CFT, will help clarify and implement the risk-based approach in customer due diligence (CDD) processes for account opening and the maintenance of bona fide customers, and encourage innovation where such processes are carried out remotely.\n", "zh": "# 銀行穩健\n\n2017年，香港金融管理局持續聚焦於授權機構（AIs）風險治理框架的有效性，包括信貸和流動性風險管理系統。在年度內，又推出了新一輪逆周期宏觀審慎措施，以增強銀行業應對房地產市場任何下滑的韌性。由於網絡威脅日益增加，香港金融管理局加強對授權機構的技術風險管理監管。同時，香港金融管理局推出了七項舉措，準備香港邁入智慧銀行新紀元。授權機構的反洗錢及反恐怖融資控制有效性，仍是其監管重點，以打擊金融犯罪為目標。在操守監管方面，香港金融管理局進一步推動以客戶為中心的企業文化，促進金融包容性，以及解決中小企和新創公司在開戶及維持銀行帳戶方面遇到的困難。同時，也努力提升對授權機構銷售投資及保險產品的操守規範，以進一步增強客戶保障。\n\n在本地執行國際監管和會計標準方面取得了重大進展，包括資本充足率標準、資訊披露標準、Net Stable Funding Ratio（淨穩定資金比率）、大型敞口限制、復甦計劃和國際財務報告準則第9號（IFRS 9）。為因應銀行環境的持續變化和風險格局的演變，香港金融管理局協調行業開發董事賦權計劃及提升銀行從業員能力框架（Enhanced Competency Framework）。\n\n2017年7月7日，《金融機構（償付能力）條例》生效，令香港成為少數具有全面跨行業金融機構償付規程的金融穩定理事會（FSB）成員法域之一。該條例，建立了金融穩定新防線，賦予貨幣當局必要權力，在出現金融機構可能導致系統性風險的故障時，有序管理其倒閉，並確保關鍵金融服務的持續。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港金融管理局的總體目標是促進銀行系統的安全與穩定。實現這一目標，依賴金融系統高度韌性，能夠提供香港經濟所需的關鍵金融服務。\n\n銀行通過其業務操作影響系統穩定性，在極端情況下，甚至可能因無序倒閉而產生系統性風險。作為監管機構，貨幣當局在保障金融穩定方面扮演關鍵角色，確保銀行具備抗撞擊能力，並能在危機中恢復正常運作，從而有效防止失敗。貨幣當局負責香港銀行業的審慎監管，涵蓋接受存款的銀行業務，並負責授權持牌銀行、有限牌照銀行及存款經營公司，統稱授權機構（AIs）。貨幣當局亦負責界定和監管某些金融市場基礎設施（FMIs）。\n\n然而，貨幣當局無法確保或現行管理框架也未旨在確保零風險的金融體系。相反，作為償付制度的制定者，貨幣當局旨在確保AIs倒閉時能有序進行處理，維持其向客戶提供的關鍵金融服務的連續性。為此，香港建立了一套金融機構的償付制度，貨幣當局為AIs等金融機構的償付主管機關。\n\n# 2017年回顧\n\n# 監管活動概述\n\n2017年，進行了192次非現場審查，內容涵蓋CAMEL評級、公司治理、業務操作及風險管理等多方面。為促進AIs風險治理的增強，貨幣當局舉行了30次董事會或董事會委員會會議，重點討論重要風險管理事宜。同時，亦展開調查，以監測其最新指引在公司治理方面的採用情況。與此同時，貨幣當局與AIs及外部審核師共同舉行了27次三方會議。\n\n除非件外，貨幣當局持續進行定期現場稽核，並補充主題性回顧較高危險範疇。這種策略幫助貨幣當局優先配置監管資源，集中在AIs面對的新興及較為重大風險上。年內進行了401次現場檢查和主題性回顧，信用風險管理和控制仍是重點。另外，科技風險和運營風險管理亦受到重視，海外檢查次數增加，並針對流動性、市場風險管理及反洗錢與反恐怖融資（AML/CFT）控制進行了多次現場評核。有專門團隊亦對AIs在證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（MPF）相關業務的檢查進行。\n\n# 信貸風險監管\n\n# 信貸增長與資產質素\n\n整體銀行貸款在2017年增長16.1%，而2016年增長6.5%。如表2所示，貸款的增長較為廣泛。\n\n具體而言，內地相關貸款在2017年底達到4,188億元港幣，較年初增長17.5%（見表3），其中包括以香港為註冊地的銀行子公司所貸的644億元。\n\nAIs的資產質量保持健康，零售銀行的分類貸款比率由2016年底的0.72%降低至2017年底的0.54%，遠低於自2000年以來的長期平均水平2.2%。整體銀行業的分類貸款比率亦由0.85%降至0.67%。在內地相關貸款方面，零售銀行的分類貸款比率由0.82%降低至0.75%。整體銀行業的比率由0.80%下降至0.67%。\n\n年內，貨幣當局加強監督努力，確保AIs持續採用審慎的信貸風險管理標準，特別加強對AIs與大型企業的曝險監控。針對關鍵信貸風險控制，如貸款核准標準、分類及撥備制度、信貸風險治理框架，以及房地產開發商、資產擔保融資及保費融資的風險管理，進行專門的主題性檢查。\n\n# 地產按揭貸款\n\n房價持續上升。AIs發放了更多涉及多重按揭或受惠於境外收入的貸款。為應對這些趨勢，貨幣當局於5月19日再度推出逆周期宏觀審慎措施。第八輪措施包括提高新發放住宅按揭貸款的資本充足率底線、降低向已有按揭的借款人擴展房地產按揭貸款的貸款成數（LTV）上限，以及降低向主要境外收入借款人發放房產按揭貸款的債務承擔比率（DSR）限制。\n\n自2009年以來，貨幣當局的宏觀審慎措施已提升銀行應對房地產市場風險的韌性。新房產按揭貸款的平均LTV在2017年12月降至49%，較2009年9月的64%——措施首次推出時的水平——大幅減少。平均DSR亦由2010年8月的41%降低至12月的35%，當時首次設限（見圖1）。\n\n貨幣當局觀察到，部分開發商以高槓桿籌措資金，並為購房者提供高LTV的按揭。為應對這些潛在風險，貨幣當局於5月12日推出了新一輪房地產貸款風險管理措施，包括降低開發商融資上限、增加其貸款資本撥備要求，以及展開專題檢查，以確保銀行在對房地產開發商放貸時持續遵循審慎的核准標準。\n\n另外，貨幣當局與地政總署合作，於2月啟動電子警示服務，當土地註冊處記錄有新的按揭時，相關金融機構即時獲得通知，以便採取適當的風險緩解措施。\n\n# 運營及科技風險監管\n\n網絡安全威脅全年持續增加。貨幣當局加強監管，提升銀行業的網絡韌性。作為2016年推出的網絡安全鞏固措施（CFI）一部分，30家AIs完成了其網絡防禦成熟度評估。同時，貨幣當局與證券及期貨事務監督委員會（SFC）在與行業進行廣泛諮詢後，聯合推出強制性雙重因素認證，用於線上股票交易。此外，也進行了一輪現場檢查，重點檢視銀行的網絡安全控制和運營韌性。貨幣當局進一步與大型銀行高層討論，評估其在面對由技術進步帶來的新市場參與者時的策略風險管理。\n\n# 智慧銀行\n\n九月，貨幣當局宣布一系列措施，協助香港銀行業轉型進入智慧銀行新時代。在監管層面，貨幣當局將金融科技監管沙盒（Fintech Supervisory Sandbox）升級到版本2.0，新功能包括銀行與科技公司均可進入的聊天室設施，以及與證券及期貨事務監管委員會和保險業監管局（IA）的沙盒連接，為跨行業金融科技產品測試提供統一入口。\n\n貨幣當局亦推出「易用銀行」倡議，旨在辨識並減少制度摩擦，進一步改善客戶使用金融科技和數字銀行服務的體驗。一個專責工作小組成立，主要著眼於遠程開戶及帳戶維護、線上金融及理財。\n\n此外，已展開可促進虛擬銀行推動的虛擬銀行申請指引審查，促使香港引入虛擬銀行。\n\n# 財資運營和流動性風險監管\n\n隨著美國持續正常化貨幣政策，全球資金流動可能日益波動。貨幣當局因此加強對流動性風險的監管。今年，流動性壓力測試加入更多場景，包括一個更嚴格但合理的資金流出場景，以及一個基於動態信心的短期銀行挤兑場景。亦加強對個別AIs流動性狀況的監控與分析，並要求部分AIs強化流動性風險管理能力。\n\n另方面，貨幣當局亦增加對AIs在外幣債券投資的市場風險管理的現場檢查次數，並展開主題性回顧，評估其在外幣債券投資中的潛在風險與風險控制措施成效。 \n\n# 防止洗錢與恐怖融資(ML/TF)\n\n《反洗錢及反恐怖融資（金融機構）(修訂)條例》於2017年6月23日刊憲，將於2018年生效。該修訂旨在按照金聯會（FATF）發布的最新國際規範，更新香港的AML/CFT監管制度。這些變動，連同修訂的法定指引，將幫助明確及推行基於風險的方法，應用於客戶盡職調查（CDD）流程，包括開戶及維持客戶資料的措施，同時鼓勵在遠程操控情況下的創新。"}

These initiatives included:\n- developing the Faster Payment System (FPS) to achieve full connectivity of digital retail payments;\n- introducing an Open Application Programming Interface (Open API) framework;\n- enhancing fintech research and talent development;\n- stepping up cross-border collaboration in fintech;\n- upgrading our existing Fintech Supervisory Sandbox (FSS) 1.0 to Version 2.0;\n- facilitating the introduction of virtual banking; and\n- promoting a new Banking Made Easy initiative to minimise regulatory frictions in customers’ digital experience.\n\nThe HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO), together with the banking departments of the HKMA, played a pivotal role in driving the implementation of these initiatives to strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia.\n\nHong Kong’s international profile as a financing hub for infrastructure investments was raised further, as the number of partners of the HKMA Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO) grew to 87 as at 31 January 2018 from about 40 at inception. During the year, IFFO organised and participated in more than 10 seminars and workshops to facilitate experience sharing and collaborative networking among key stakeholders. In particular, IFFO steered the development of an infrastructure equity investment reference term sheet in its inaugural Debt Financing and Investors’ Roundtables with a view to enhancing infrastructure projects’ bankability and investability.\n\nBond Connect was launched in July, marking another major milestone in mutual access between the Hong Kong and Mainland capital markets, and further solidifying our gateway position for international investors seeking to enter the Mainland market. During the year, Hong Kong’s Renminbi Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (RQFII) quota was increased to RMB500 billion from RMB270 billion. Hong Kong maintained the world’s largest offshore renminbi liquidity pool, with vibrant renminbi financial intermediation activities as evidenced by a high turnover of our renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system and the lion’s share of Hong Kong’s renminbi payment activities in the world.\n\nFollowing the introduction of the tax regime for corporate treasury centres (CTCs) in 2016, the HKMA stepped up its outreach efforts with a view to attracting more multinational corporates to set up treasury centres in Hong Kong. By the end of 2017, more than 40 corporates reflected to the HKMA that they were actively planning to set up, or had set up, treasury centre operations in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA actively contributed to international discussions on issues of significance to global and regional financial stability. The Chief Executive of the HKMA became the Chair of the Standing Committee on Supervisory and Regulatory Co-operation (SRC) of the Financial Stability Board (FSB)1 in April to lead discussions on key financial stability issues.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure lays a solid foundation for Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre and global offshore renminbi business hub. The four interbank RTGS systems and the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) achieved 100% system availability in 2017, as compared to the target of 99.95%. To support Northbound Trading of Bond Connect, CMU has set up accounts with the two Mainland central securities depositories (CSDs) to facilitate the settlement of Bond Connect transactions and holding of Mainland debt securities on behalf of relevant CMU members.\n\nTo promote the general safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA designated four retail payment systems (RPSs) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO) in August to bring their operations under the HKMA’s oversight. The HKMA also conducted supervision of 16 stored value facility (SVF) licensees which actively launched new products and services that sought to offer customers more choices and better user experience. Separately, the coverage of e-Cheque and Electronic Bill Presentment and Payment (EBPP) service was further expanded to include crossboundary payments between Hong Kong and the entire Guangdong Province.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2017\n\n# Hong Kong as a fintech hub in Asia\n\n# Smart Banking Initiatives\n\nIn light of the rapid technological advancements, the HKMA in September announced seven initiatives that would prepare Hong Kong to move into a new era of Smart Banking. The initiatives aimed to help the banking sector to rise to a higher level and embrace the enormous opportunities brought about by the convergence of banking and technology.\n\n“Smart Banking would offer full interconnectivity amongst retail and corporate customers and allow financial services and transactions to be undertaken with great mobility, speed, ease and safety.”\n\nThe HKMA has been working closely with the banking industry and the fintech community, and made good progress in implementing the seven initiatives.\n\n# Faster Payment System\n\nThe FPS is a multi-currency platform that would enable the public to make round-the-clock funds transfers in a real-time manner with ease, through using mobile phone numbers or email addresses. It can support payments in Hong Kong dollars and renminbi. Banks and non-bank payment service providers can participate in the FPS, enabling full connectivity among all payment participants. With system development work close to completion, the FPS is scheduled to launch in September 2018.\n\nFurthermore, the HKMA led a working group, comprising major credit card scheme operators, banks, licensed SVF operators and merchant acquirers, to establish a common QR code standard for retail payments in Hong Kong. A common QR code standard would facilitate merchants in using a single QR code to accept QR code payment solutions from multiple payment service providers, providing greater convenience to customers and merchants. The working group has finalised the relevant technical specification, and would work out the implementation arrangements.\n\n# Open Application Programming Interface\n\nOpen API allows banks’ data to be accessed by third parties to facilitate better and easier integration of services offered by banks and other industries. Users can therefore conveniently stay on one system to enjoy integrated services in a secure environment. To facilitate the development and adoption of Open API by the banking sector, the HKMA has come up with a draft Open API framework, comprising a selection of Open API functions and deployment time frame, technical standards, third-party service provider governance, facilitation measures and maintenance models, for a two-month industry consultation.\n\n# Research and talent development\n\nOne of the major research projects was on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). Following the first DLT whitepaper in 2016, the second whitepaper on DLT was published in October 2017. The second whitepaper further explores the three Proof-of-Concept works, namely trade finance, digital identity management and mortgage application. It also offers advice on the implementation issues relating to governance, legal and compliance, and general control principles on deploying DLT for the banking and payment industries.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan, announces the release of the second whitepaper on DLT at the HKMA Fintech Day.\n\nRiding on the success of the Proof-of-Concept work on trade finance led by the HKMA, seven banks in Hong Kong decided to commercialise the prototype into a production system named Hong Kong Trade Finance Platform (HKTFP) to digitise and share trade documents and automate processes with a view to improving the overall trade process and reducing risks and fraud in the trade finance business.\n\nIn an effort to enlarge the talent pool in the fintech industry, the HKMA launched the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme in collaboration with the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute in December 2016. Response from students was positive. More than 3,000 applications from 421 applicants were received. Finally, 74 students accepted internship offers from the HKMA and 12 banks to work on fintech-related projects for six months or one year starting from July.\n\n# Cross-border collaboration\n\nAs the first step of strengthening our collaboration within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Bay Area, we are partnering with Shenzhen to promote fintech and talent developments. Specifically, the HKMA and the Office of Financial Development Service, the People’s Government of Shenzhen Municipality (OFDS) entered into an agreement in June to (i) provide reciprocal soft-landing support for fintech firms, (ii) co-organise the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Fintech Award in October to recognise and reward outstanding fintech products and solutions in the two cities; and (iii) arrange summer internships at Shenzhen fintech and techfin firms for Hong Kong students.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan (middle), signs and exchanges Memoranda of Understanding on softlanding arrangements with OFDS Director-General, Mr He Xiaojun (left), and Cyberport Chairman, Dr Lee George Lam, at the HKMA Fintech Day.\n\nE-leaflet for the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Fintech Award.\n\nThe HKMA also signed fintech co-operation agreements with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Dubai Financial Services Authority on innovation projects, referrals of innovative businesses, information sharing and exchange of expertise.\n\nIn November, the HKMA further signed a Memorandum of Understanding with MAS to jointly build the Global Trade Connectivity Network (GTCN), which would connect Singapore’s National Trade Platform to the HKTFP to form a cross-border DLT infrastructure in order to digitalise cross-border trade and trade finance processes, making them safer, more efficient and costeffective. It will be an open platform that allows other interested jurisdictions to participate in the future. The GTCN is expected to be launched in the first quarter of 2019.\n\n# Fintech Supervisory Sandbox\n\nThe FSS launched by the HKMA in September 2016 was upgraded to FSS 2.0 to expedite communication with banks and tech firms to facilitate new ideas and initiatives. Specifically, FSS 2.0 has the following new features:\n- A Fintech Supervisory Chatroom is set up to provide feedback to banks and tech firms at an early stage of their fintech projects.\n- Tech firms can access the FSS by seeking feedback from the Chatroom without going through a bank.\n- The sandboxes of the HKMA, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Insurance Authority are linked up so that there is a single point of entry for pilot trials of cross-sector fintech products.\n\nAs of end-2017, 28 new technology products have been tested in the FSS. Out of these cases, 14 pilot trials have been completed, and the relevant products have been rolled out to the market subsequently.\n\n# Banking Made Easy initiative\n\nA Banking Made Easy initiative was launched to minimise regulatory frictions hindering technological innovations. A taskforce has been set up with current focus on the following areas:\n- Remote onboarding and account maintenance\n- Online finance\n- Online wealth management\n\n# Virtual Banking\n\nVirtual banks, which operate without physical branches, are expected to provide additional impetus to the application of fintech in Hong Kong and offer a new kind of customer experience in mobile and digital banking. They may also help promote financial inclusion as they normally target the retail segment, be they individuals or small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The HKMA has commenced the review of the existing Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks with a view to facilitating the introduction of virtual banking in Hong Kong.\n\n# A New Era of Smart Banking\n\n# Supervision and Innovation\n\nThe seven initiatives unveiled by the HKMA last year to prepare Hong Kong for a new era of Smart Banking are a large-scale project involving cooperation among various departments within the HKMA. With fintech becoming an unstoppable force, Mr Raymond Chan, Executive Director (Banking Supervision) of the HKMA, indicated that the HKMA, as a regulator, must embrace this new trend by keeping abreast of the latest technological developments and adjusting its supervisory mindset and approach as appropriate, in order to take bank services and customer experience to a new level.\n", "zh": "# 國際金融中心\n\n為鞏固香港作為國際金融中心的地位，港美銀行力求提升香港金融平台的競爭力。在金融科技方面，七項新措施旨在促進銀行及支付行業的金融科技發展與應用，受到持份者及公眾的熱烈歡迎。由於一系列在網絡和能力建設方面的努力，香港作為基礎設施投資融資樞紐的國際形象進一步提升。Bond Connect的推出鞏固了香港作為內地市場主流入口的地位。港美銀行在企業財資中心等其他領域的努力也取得了成效。\n\n# 概述\n\n面對科技進步的迅速發展，港美銀行於九月宣布推出七項措施，以準備香港邁向智慧銀行的新時代。這些措施包括：\n- 發展快捷支付系統（FPS），實現數碼零售支付的全連接；\n- 推出開放應用程式介面（Open API）框架；\n- 加強金融科技研究與人才培育；\n- 推動跨境金融科技合作；\n- 升級現有的金融科技監管沙盒（FSS）1.0到2.0版本；\n- 促進虛擬銀行的推出；\n- 宣傳「手機銀行，簡單易用」的新措施，以減少客戶數碼體驗中的監管阻力。\n\n港美銀行的金融科技促進辦公室（FFO）與銀行部門在推動這些措施的實施中扮演關鍵角色，鞏固香港作為亞洲金融科技樞紐的地位。\n\n香港作為基礎設施投資融資樞紐的國際形象進一步提升，截至2018年1月31日，港美銀行基建融資促進辦公室（IFFO）的合作夥伴數量已由成立初期約40家增加到87家。本年度，IFFO舉辦並參與了十多場研討會和工作坊，促進經驗分享與合作洽談。特別是，IFFO在其首次債務融資及投資者圓桌會議中推出基礎設施股權投資參考合約範本，以提升基建項目的銀行融通性和可投資性。\n\nBond Connect在七月推出，標誌著香港與內地資本市場互通的重要里程碑，進一步巩固我們作為國際投資者進入內地市場的門戶地位。年度內，香港人民幣合格境外投資者（RQFII）配額由2700億元擴增至5000億元人民幣。香港維持全球最大離岸人民幣流動性池，人民幣金融中介活動繁忙，人民幣實時結算系統（RTGS）交易量高企，亦佔香港人民幣支付行動的最大份額。\n\n自2016年推出公司財資中心（CTC）的稅制後，港美銀行加大推廣力度，吸引更多跨國公司在香港設立財資中心。截至2017年底，有超過40家公司表示正積極規劃或已在香港設立財資中心。\n\n港美銀行積極參與有關全球及區域金融穩定的重要國際討論。港美銀行行政總裁於四月成為金融穩定理事會（FSB）監管合作常設委員會（SRC）主席，領導相關重大金融穩定議題的討論。\n\n香港金融基礎設施的安全高效運作為香港作為國際金融中心及全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐奠定了堅實基礎。2017年，四個銀行同業RTGS系統和中央貨幣市場單位（CMU）全部實現100%系統可用率，超出99.95%的目標。為支持Bond Connect的北向交易，CMU已與內地兩家中央證券存管結算（CSD）機構設立賬戶，以促進Bond Connect交易的結算及內地債券的持有。\n\n為促進本地零售支付行業安全與效率，港美銀行於八月根據《支付系統及擔存值設施條例》（PSSVFO）設立了四個零售支付系統（RPS），進入港美銀監督範圍。同時，港美銀行亦對16家擁有存存值設施（SVF）牌照的公司進行監管，這些公司積極推出新產品和服務，為客戶提供更多選擇和更佳用戶體驗。此外，電子支票和電子帳單及支付（EBPP）服務的覆蓋範圍亦擴大至香港與廣東省的跨境支付。\n\n# 2017年回顧\n\n# 香港作為亞洲金融科技樞紐\n\n# 智能銀行措施\n\n鑑於科技迅速進步，港美銀行於九月宣布推出七項措施，以幫助香港踏入智慧銀行的新紀元。旨在推動銀行業提升至更高水準，並把握銀行與科技融合帶來的巨大機遇。\n\n“智慧銀行將提供零售與企業客戶之間的全互聯互通，使金融服務及交易能以更高的流動性、迅速性、便利性和安全性完成。”\n\n港美銀行一向與銀行業和金融科技界緊密合作，並在推行這七項措施方面取得良好進展。\n\n# 快捷支付系統\n\n快捷支付系統（FPS）是一個多幣種平台，可讓公眾方便地進行全天候實時資金轉賬，支援手機號碼或電郵地址，並支持港幣和人民幣支付。銀行和非銀行支付服務提供者皆可參與，實現所有支付參與方的全連接。系統開發接近完成，預定於2018年九月推出。\n\n此外，港美銀行牽頭成立了一個由主要信用卡運營商、銀行、持牌SVF經營商和商戶收單機構組成的工作小組，制定香港零售支付共同二維碼標準。這個標準將方便商戶使用單一二維碼接受多家支付服務提供者的支付方案，為商戶和顧客提供更大便利。該工作小組已完成相關技術規範，並將制定實施安排。\n\n# 開放應用程式介面（Open API）\n\nOpen API允許第三方存取銀行資料，以促進提供更佳、更便捷的服務集成。用戶因此可以在一個安全的平台上便捷地獲得整合服務。為促進銀行業開發和採用Open API，港美銀行在兩個月的行業諮詢中，推出草擬的Open API框架，包括選擇的功能範圍、部署時間表、技術標準、第三方服務提供者管理、促進措施和維護模式。\n\n# 研究與人才培育\n\n其中一項重大研究涉及分散式帳本技術（DLT）。繼2016年第一份白皮書後，第二份白皮書於2017年十月發布。白皮書深入探討三個概念驗證項目，即貿易融資、數字身份管理和按揭申請，並就治理、法律合規及部署普遍控制原則提出建議。\n\n港美銀行行政總裁陳德霖先生在金融科技日上宣布第二份白皮書的發佈。\n\n借助港美銀行領導的貿易融資概念驗證工作成功經驗，香港的七家銀行決定將原型轉換為正式的貿易融資平台（HKTFP），用於數字化貿易文件和自動化流程，旨在提升整體貿易流程效率，降低風險與欺詐。\n\n為擴大金融科技人才庫，港美銀行於2016年12月聯合香港應用科技研究院推出金融科技人才加速計劃（Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme）。學生回應熱烈，申請人數達421人，申請超過3000份。最終，74名學生獲得港美銀行和12家銀行的實習邀請，參與為期六個月至一年以金融科技為主題的項目。\n\n# 跨境合作\n\n作為加強大灣區合作的第一步，港美銀行與深圳合作推動金融科技和人才培育項目。具體措施包括：港美銀行與深圳市人民政府金融發展局（OFDS）在六月簽署協議，內容包括(i) 為金融科技公司提供互惠軟著陸支持、(ii) 在十月共同舉辦深港金融科技獎，表彰兩地優秀的金融科技產品與解決方案，以及(iii) 為香港學生安排在深圳金融科技和科技金融公司暑期實習。\n\n港美銀行行政總裁陳德霖（中）與金融發展局局長何曉軍（左）以及數碼港主席雷亞歷（右）在金融科技日簽署並交換軟著陸合作備忘錄。\n\n此外，港美銀行還與新加坡金融管理局（MAS）及迪拜金融服務管理局簽署金融科技合作協議，就創新項目、企業推介、資訊共享及經驗交流進行合作。\n\n2018年十一月，港美銀行與新加坡金融管理局再簽備忘錄，共同打造全球貿易通連接平台（GTCN），將新加坡國家貿易平台（NTP）與香港貿易融資平台（HKTFP）連接，構建跨境分散式帳本基礎設施，數字化跨境貿易與貿易融資流程，令流程更安全、更高效、更具成本效益。該平台將向其他有意參與的司法管轄區開放，預計於2019年第一季度推出。\n\n# 金融科技監管沙盒\n\n港美銀行於2016年九月啟動的金融科技監管沙盒（FSS）已升級為FSS 2.0，以加快與銀行和科技公司的溝通，促進創新想法和方案的落實。FSS 2.0的新功能包括：\n- 設立金融科技監管快車道（Chatroom），提前獲取反饋，協助推動金融科技項目；\n- 科技公司可直接通過快車道獲得反饋，無需經過銀行；\n- 港美銀行、證券及期貨事務監察委員會（SFC）及保險業監管局（IA）之間也建立聯通，提供跨界金融科技試點的集中入口。\n\n截至2017年底，有28款新科技產品在FSS中測試，當中14個已完成試點項目，相關產品已陸續推向市場。\n\n# 「易用銀行」計劃\n\n「易用銀行」計劃旨在減少阻礙科技創新之監管阻力，已成立專責工作小組，目前重點範圍包括：\n- 遙距開戶與帳戶維護\n- 線上金融服務\n- 線上財富管理\n\n# 虛擬銀行\n\n虛擬銀行不設實體分行，有望為香港的金融科技應用提供新的動力，並帶來不同的數碼客戶體驗。它們亦有助推動金融包容，因主要目標客群為個人及中小企。港美銀行正檢討現有《虛擬銀行認證指引》，促使快速推行香港虛擬銀行。\n\n# 智慧銀行新時代\n\n# 監管與創新\n\n去年公布的七項措施是港美銀行為迎接智慧銀行新時代而展開的大型項目，涉及港美銀行內部多個部門合作。隨著金融科技成為不可阻擋的力量，港美銀行執行董事（銀行監管）陳德霖先生表示，作為監管機構，必須擁抱這一新趨勢，保持對最新科技發展的敏感度，並適時調整監管思維與方法，以將銀行服務及客戶體驗提升到新的層次。"}
{"en": "# Reserves Management\n\nThe global economy and financial markets performed better than expected in 2017. Global equity markets went up on the back of synchronised economic growth in major developed and emerging market economies, strong corporate earnings, and market expectation of slow and gradual tightening of monetary policies by major central banks. While the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates three times as expected, and began to reduce its balance sheet in October, the 10- Year US Treasury yield remained stable and the US dollar weakened (rather than strengthened) against other major currencies. Under such a favourable environment, the Exchange Fund’s investment income reached a record high of HK$264 billion in 2017, representing an investment return of 7.4%.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary and may be invested in securities or other assets he considers appropriate, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC).\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nEFAC has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n(a) to preserve capital;\n(b) to ensure the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(c) to ensure sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) subject to (a)–(c), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the Fund’s long-term purchasing power.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund.\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP). The BP holds highly liquid US dollardenominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The IP is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of the assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA has been diversifying part of the Exchange Fund’s investments, in a prudent and incremental manner, into a wider variety of asset classes, including emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity and real estate. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The cap for the market value of investments under the LTGP is set at onethird of the accumulated surplus of the Exchange Fund, with further capacity arising from the allocation of part of the Future Fund to long-term assets.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007 to hold shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that were acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes, is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of the unique nature of this Portfolio.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by fiscal reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP1, with the exception of the Future Fund which links its interest rate to both the IP and the LTGP depending on the portfolio mix. As at the end of 2017, the portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 65:35. The portion of the Future Fund linked with the LTGP is expected to gradually build up to around 50% by 2018.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation. The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents the long-term optimal asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark, or strategic allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and tracking error limit are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may take positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nHKMA staff in the Reserves Management Department directly manage about 73% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, which includes the entire BP and part of the IP. This part of the IP includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 27% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes. The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to capture sustainable returns, to benefit from diverse and complementary investment styles and to share market insights and technical expertise with the Exchange Fund.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is primarily determined by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe high volatility of the financial markets subsequent to the 2008/09 global financial crisis has highlighted the importance of risk management. Stringent controls and investment guidelines have been established for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and compliance with guidelines and regulations is closely monitored. Risk assessment has been strengthened to support the Exchange Fund’s increased pace of investment diversification. Risk-control tools are deployed to assess market risks under both normal and adverse market conditions. Detailed performance attribution analyses are also conducted to identify sources of performance, allowing the HKMA to make the best use of the investment skills of internal and external managers.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nThe HKMA is supportive of responsible investment. For instance, the HKMA supports the Principles of Responsible Ownership issued by the Securities and Futures Commission on 7 March 2016, which are voluntary and help investors determine how best to meet their ownership responsibilities in relation to their investments in Hong Kong-listed companies. For the management of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA has encouraged the appointed external fund managers for its Hong Kong equity portfolio to adopt the Principles of Responsible Ownership in managing the investments. Furthermore, the front offices and the Risk Management and Compliance Division have incorporated environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into various internal procedures for making and monitoring investment activities. The HKMA will closely monitor the development of ESG standards and assess how these standards can be further integrated into the investment process.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2017\n\nThe global economy and financial markets in 2017 performed better than expected. On the back of synchronised economic growth in major developed and emerging market economies, strong corporate earnings, and market expectation of slow and gradual tightening of monetary policies by major central banks, the global equity markets performed well. In particular, the Hong Kong equity market rose by 36%, outperforming other major equity markets.\n\nIn the bond markets, short-dated US Treasury yields shot up as the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates three times as expected, and began to reduce its balance sheet in October. Nevertheless, the 10-year US Treasury yield remained stable at about 2.4% over the year. Other major 10-Year government bond yields also ended the year little changed, with the exception of German Bunds which rose on the euro area’s solid economic growth and market expectation of the European Central Bank’s policy tightening.\n\nIn the currency markets, the US dollar weakened against other major currencies, despite the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes and the beginning of its balance sheet reduction. The depreciation of the US dollar was a result of the reviving economic growth in Europe and Japan, and market expectation of diminishing monetary policy divergence between the US and other major economies. The euro and yen appreciated by around 14% and 4% respectively against the US dollar in 2017.\n\nThe performance of major currencies as well as bond and equity markets in 2017 is shown in Table 1.\n\nTable 1 2017 market returns\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$264 billion in 2017. This comprised gains of HK$80.4 billion on overseas equities, gains of HK$58.3 billion on Hong Kong equities, gains of HK$34.4 billion on bonds, a positive currency translation effect of HK$53.5 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets and gains of HK$37.4 billion on other investments held by the investment holding subsidiaries of the Exchange Fund. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$4.5 billion.\n\nThe investment income of HK$264 billion last year is a record high for the Exchange Fund, surpassing the previous record in 2007 (HK$142.2 billion) by HK$121.8 billion.\n\nThe total assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,015.3 billion at year end. The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$235.6 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$157.2 billion and real estate at HK$78.4 billion. Outstanding investment commitments amounted to HK$162.4 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund (excluding the Strategic Portfolio) in 2017 was 7.4%. Specifically, the IP achieved a rate of return of 12.1%, while the BP gained 1.8%. The LTGP recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 13.7% since its inception in 2009.\n\nThe annual return of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2017 is set out in Chart 1. Table 2 shows the 2017 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over several different time horizons. The average return was 2.9% over the past three years, 2.5% over the past five years, 2.2% over the past ten years and 4.9% since 1994.

{"en": "# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communication with the community and the market through the media, public education programmes and other various channels to facilitate public understanding of its policies and operations. During the year, the HKMA continued to improve corporate governance by supporting professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline and enhancing IT security to cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives and the increasing complexity of work.\n\n# ENGAGING THE COMMUNITY CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT\n\n# Media relations\n\nThe HKMA works closely with the media to enhance transparency and promote public understanding about its policies and work. In 2017, 86 open press events were organised, comprising nine press conferences, 16 stand-up interviews and 61 other public functions. In addition, 42 media interviews were arranged and a total of 360 bilingual press releases were issued. It also handles a large number of media enquiries every day.\n\nTo raise awareness of the HKMA’s key functions, guided tours were organised for the media to visit the newly revamped HKMA Information Centre. Furthermore, indepth media briefings and educational workshops were conducted for local and overseas media on a wide range of topics, including the Bond Connect scheme, prudential measures for property mortgage loans, the Resolution Regime and Exchange Fund investments.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan, introduces a mosaic artwork called “Small Change, Big Ode” to the media at the HKMA Information Centre. The artwork, featuring the Victoria Harbour and the Hong Kong skyline, was created using a total of 135,811 pieces of Hong Kong coins in different denominations.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan, conducts a media interview with local newspapers regarding the key initiatives of the HKMA’s Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office and Fintech Facilitation Office.\n\n# Public enquiries\n\nThe Public Enquiry Service provides an effective means for the public to better understand the key functions and operations of the HKMA. A total of 8,752 enquiries were handled in 2017, about half of which were related to banking policies and regulations, monetary and economic issues, consumer banking issues as well as notes and coins. Notable examples included the Coin Collection Programme, banking products and services, bankingrelated guidelines and circulars, monetary and economic statistics, prudential measures for property mortgage loans, and prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received since 2014 and Chart 2 provides a breakdown in terms of the nature of enquiries received in 2017.\n\nChart 1 Total number of public enquiries\n\nChart 2 Nature of enquiries received in 2017\n\n# Publications\n\nApart from the HKMA Annual Report, in 2017 the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report and four issues of the Quarterly Bulletin, and released regular updates of the Monthly Statistical Bulletin to provide up-to-date and thematic information and analyses on monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. In addition, the HKMA issued a total of 23 inSight articles, covering various topical issues related to its work.\n\n# HKMA website\n\nThe HKMA corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk), with over 60,000 pages in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, is the public access gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It also contains the register of authorized institutions (AIs) and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the register of stored value facility (SVF) licensees under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance. Dedicated webpages and eye-catching short-cut links are designed to draw public attention to the new initiatives of the HKMA, such as account opening, the regulatory regime for SVFs, the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office and the Fintech Facilitation Office, as well as important and timely information, such as reminders on the need to remain vigilant against bogus telephone calls and the location of Coin Carts under the Coin Collection Programme.\n\n# Public Education Programme\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre is an important resource for introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters. It consists of an exhibition area and a library, and is open to the public six days a week. The exhibition area introduces the work of the HKMA and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong. It also contains reading materials and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nThe new look of the policy section of the Information Centre, which introduces the work of the HKMA and related financial concepts, was re-opened to the public on 24 February 2017 upon completion of the refurbishment work. The revamped policy section contains various interactive games and devices that integrate play into learning and explain complicated financial concepts in a simple way. Feedback from the visitors has been positive.\n\nStudents try out the educational games at the policy section of the Information Centre to learn about the work of the HKMA.\n\nGuided tours of the Information Centre are organised for visitors. During the year, it received more than 59,000 visitors and hosted over 650 guided tours for schools and other groups (Chart 3). More than 645,000 people have visited the Information Centre since it opened in December 2003.\n\nThe library, situated next to the exhibition area, houses more than 23,000 books, journals and other publications for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs and central banking topics. It also maintains the register of AIs and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nThe library in the HKMA Information Centre.\n\nTo reach out to the community and raise public awareness of the HKMA’s work, the HKMA organised four public education seminars for about 2,000 secondary school students and teachers in 2017. Topics covered in the seminars included the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, banking stability, consumer protection, the Deposit Protection Scheme, fintech, the Belt and Road Initiative and careers in the financial industry. More than 58,400 people have participated in this public education programme since its launch in 1998.\n\nStudents and teachers from secondary schools in different districts participate in one of the public education seminars.\n\nChart 3 Types of group visits to the Information Centre in 2017\n\n# HUMAN RESOURCES\n\nThe HKMA recruits, develops and maintains a highly professional workforce to support its policy objectives and respond flexibly to changing work priorities. While the HKMA is an integral part of the Government, it employs staff on terms different from those of the civil service to attract personnel with the right experience and expertise. As a public organisation, the HKMA aims to maintain a lean and flexible structure and, where possible, to redeploy staff resources to undertake new initiatives and meet increasing workload.\n\n# Organisational changes\n\nThe Resolution Office was established on 1 April 2017 to implement the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance enacted in June 2016. The Office aims to ensure that the Hong Kong resolution regime is operational for banks. This is essential to enhancing the resilience of the Hong Kong banking sector in the event of any crisis.\n\n# Staffing\n\nThe establishment of the HKMA in 2017 was 927. This will be increased by 35 to 962 in 2018 (an increase of 3.8%) to ensure that sufficient resources are provided to cope with the new initiatives and the increasing complexity and volume of existing work. The new posts are deployed to the following functions:\n\n- Enhancing banking and financial stability, which includes:\n    – enhancing capacity to support the launch of the Faster Payment System and easy banking initiatives;\n    – strengthening supervisory capacity to deal with the regional and business expansion of banks and to facilitate (i) the wider adoption of fintech in the provision of banking services and (ii) collaboration with other regulatory authorities on cyber security and fintech issues; and\n    – supporting the work of the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce to fight against fraud, money laundering and other types of financial crimes, and strengthening legal support for enforcement actions under legislation governing anti-money laundering and SVFs.\n- Strengthening investment, risk management and other related support for the further expansion and diversification of the Exchange Fund’s investment activities.\n- Stepping up global macro and financial-sector surveillance, and strengthening talent development programmes to ensure that the HKMA has the necessary human capital to meet the long-term development needs of the organisation.\n\nTable 1 gives a breakdown of the establishment and strength of the HKMA.\n\nTable 1 Establishment and strength of the HKMA on 1 January 2018\n\nTemporary resources are deployed to meet other work demands. The HKMA also transfers staff members on secondment to other international or local organisations, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Services Development Council, to assist in activities or policy initiatives in which Hong Kong or the HKMA has an interest. Some staff members are deployed on a full-time or part-time basis to provide operational support to the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board and the Treasury Markets Association.\n\n# Remuneration policies and pay review mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary (FS) determines the pay and conditions of service for HKMA staff on the advice of the Governance Sub-Committee (GSC) through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC), taking into account the prevailing market rates and practices. Remuneration comprises a total cash package and a provident fund scheme, with minimal benefits in kind. The cash package consists of monthly fixed pay (or basic pay) and variable pay, which may be awarded to individual staff members as a lump sum once a year, depending on performance.\n\nPay for HKMA staff is reviewed annually by the FS in the light of recommendations made to him by the GSC through the EFAC, taking into account the GSC’s assessment of the performance of the HKMA in the preceding year, the paysurvey findings of the financial sector conducted by independent human resources consultants, and any other relevant factors. Special pay adjustments may be made from time to time for individual meritorious staff members to maintain their pay competitiveness.\n\nAny approved annual adjustments to the fixed pay and any variable pay awards for the HKMA are distributed to individual staff members based on their performance. Investment professionals in the HKMA are subject to a variable pay system that seeks to strengthen the link between their investment performance and remuneration award. The pay adjustments and awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Executive Director and above are approved by the FS on the advice of the GSC. The staff members concerned are not present at the meetings when their pay is discussed. The pay adjustments and awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Division Head and below are determined by the Chief Executive of the HKMA under delegated authority from the FS and within the approved overall pay awards.\n\n# Remuneration of senior staff members\n\nThe remuneration packages of senior staff members in 2017 are shown in Table 2.\n\nTable 2 Remuneration packages of HKMA senior staff members in 2017\n\n# Manager Trainee (MT) and Graduate Economist (GE) programmes\n\nTo develop a pool of young talent with sharp analytical minds, strong communication skills and good team spirit for a long-term career in central banking, the HKMA runs two trainee programmes: the MT programme and the GE programme. Each programme lasts for a period of two years.\n\nThe MT programme prepares young graduates interested in central banking work to become the HKMA’s future key management staff and contribute to the financial stability and prosperity of Hong Kong. Each MT undergoes on-the-job training in two to three departments to acquire hands-on experience on the important functions of the HKMA. For the GE programme, young graduates interested in economic research are offered the opportunity to harness their research skills in two to three departments to provide important input to the policy formulation process.\n\nBoth the MT and GE programmes provide an all-rounded career development environment for the trainees. Apart from on-the-job training, the MTs and GEs also attend structured foundation central banking courses organised internally and by leading international or regional organisations.

My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report.  I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards.  I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017.  These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information.  The other information comprises all the information included in the 2017 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.  If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact.  I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.  I also:\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.  The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.  If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion.  My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report.  However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and\n- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements.  I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit.  I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nDavid Sun\nDirector of Audit\n\n11 April 2018\n\n# 1 PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES\n\nThe Monetary Authority, under delegated authority from the Financial Secretary as Controller of the Exchange Fund (the Fund), manages the Fund in accordance with the provisions of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).  The principal activities of the Fund are safeguarding the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong and maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems.\n\nThe assets of the Fund are managed as four portfolios: the Backing Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio and the Strategic Portfolio.  The assets of the Backing Portfolio fully match the Monetary Base, under Hong Kong’s Currency Board system.  The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.  The Long-Term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments.  The Strategic Portfolio holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited acquired by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) for the account of the Fund for strategic purposes. Operating segment information is set out in note 30.\n\n# 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n# 2.1 Statement of compliance\n\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with all applicable Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRSs), which is a collective term that includes all applicable individual Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, Hong Kong Accounting Standards (HKASs) and Interpretations issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), and accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong.  A summary of the significant accounting policies adopted by the Fund and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) is set out below.\n\nThe HKICPA has issued certain new and revised HKFRSs that are first effective or available for early adoption for the current accounting period.  Note 3 provides information on the changes, if any, in accounting policies resulting from initial adoption of these developments to the extent that they are relevant to the Group for the current and prior accounting periods reflected in these financial statements.\n\n# 2.2 Basis of preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe Group financial statements include the financial statements of the Group as well as the Group’s interests in associates and joint ventures.  The principal activities of the principal subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are shown in notes 16 and 17.\n\nThe measurement basis used in the preparation of the financial statements is historical cost except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair values as explained in the accounting policies set out below:\n- trading financial instruments (note 2.6.2.1);\n- financial assets and financial liabilities designated at fair value (note 2.6.2.2);\n- available-for-sale securities (note 2.6.2.5);\n- gold (note 2.11); and\n- investment properties (note 2.12).\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with HKFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure.  The estimates and associated assumptions are based on experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.  Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nNote 18 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of investment properties.  Note 36 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of financial instruments.  Apart from the accounting judgements involving these fair value estimations, there are no other critical accounting judgements involved in the application of the Group’s accounting policies.\n\n# 2.3 Subsidiaries and non-controlling interests\n\nA subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group.  The Group controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.  When assessing whether the Group has power, only substantive rights (held by the Group and other parties) are considered.\n", "zh": "匯備基金\n\n審計主任核數報告\n\n獨立核數師致財經事務財務秘書的報告\n\n意見\n\n我證明已審核匯備基金及其附屬公司（「本集團」）列於第157至243頁的財務報表，包括於2017年12月31日的匯備基金及本集團的資產負債表，以及當年結束的收益及開支帳、全面收益表、權益變動表、現金流量表及財務報表附註，包括主要會計政策摘要。\n\n依據本人之專業判斷，該等財務報表誠實反映基金及本集團於2017年12月31日的財務狀況，以及其於當年度之財務表現與現金流量，並根據由香港會計師公會（「香港會計師公會」）發布的香港財務報告準則（「HKFRSs」）編製，並已依照由行政長官根據《匯備基金條例》（第66章）第7條作出之指令妥善準備。\n\n意見基礎\n\n本人根據《匯備基金條例》第7條所訂指令及審計署的審計準則進行審計。本人在該等準則下的責任於本報告之「審計人對財務報表審計的責任」部分進一步描述。本人依該等準則獨立於本集團，並已履行所有其他道德義務。本人相信所取得之審計證據充足適當，足以構成本意見的基礎。\n\n關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項是指在本人專業判斷下，在審計2017年結束之財務報表期間最具重要性的事項。這些事項是在整體審計範圍內處理，並用於形成本人之意見，本人不就這些事項發表獨立意見。\n\n其他資料\n\n貨幣管理局負責審核其他資料。其他資料包括香港金融管理局2017年年度報告內除財務報表及本人審計報告外的所有資料。\n\n本人對財務報表的意見不涵蓋該等其他資料，也不對其表達任何擔保性結論。\n\n在審計財務報表時，本人有責任閱讀其他資料，並判斷其是否在重大方面與財務報表或本人在審計中獲得之知識不符，或顯示存在重大錯誤。如本人根據已執行之工作認為該等資料存在重大錯誤，必須報告該事實。本報告中本人沒有相關之事項要報告。\n\n貨幣管理局及匯備基金諮詢委員會審計小組對財務報表之責任\n\n貨幣管理局負責按HKFRSs及由行政長官根據《匯備基金條例》第7條作出之指令編製誠實反映基金的財務報表，並負責採取必要的內部控制措施，以確保財務報表不存在由欺詐或錯誤引致的重大錯誤。\n\n在編製財務報表時，貨幣管理局負責評估本集團持續經營的能力，並在必要時披露有關持續經營的事項，並採用持續經營的會計基準。\n\n匯備基金諮詢委員會的審計小組負責監督本集團的財務報告流程。\n\n審計人對財務報表的責任\n\n本人的目標是取得合理保證，確認整體財務報表是否不存在由欺詐或錯誤造成的重要錯誤，並出具包含本人意見的審計報告。合理保證是一個高水平的保證，但不能保證在依照審計署審計準則進行的審計中，所有存在的重大錯誤都必然會被偵測到。錯誤可能由欺詐或錯誤引起，若單獨或合併可能合理影響用戶基於該等財務資訊作出的經濟決策，即屬重大。\n\n作為依照審計署審計準則進行的審計的一部分，本人會在整個審計過程中運用專業判斷並保持專業懷疑。本人亦會：\n- 識別及評估財務報表存在重大錯誤的風險，無論由欺詐或錯誤引起，設計並執行應對該些風險的審計程序，並取得足夠適當的審計證據，以支持本意見。由欺詐引致的重大錯誤未被偵測的風險較由錯誤引起者為高，因欺詐可能涉及合謀、偽造、故意遺漏、錯誤陳述或內部控制的越權；\n- 瞭解與審計相關的內部控制，以設計適當的審計程序，但不就本集團內部控制的有效性發表意見；\n- 評估貨幣管理局所採用會計政策的適當性及會計估計的合理性與相關披露；\n- 對貨幣管理局採用持續經營的合理性作出結論，並根據取得之審計證據，判定是否存在可能對本集團持續經營能力構成立重大疑慮的重大不確定因素。若我認為存在此等不確定性，必須在審計報告中指出相關披露不足或修正意見。我的結論是基於直至審計報告日所取得的審計證據，但未來事件或狀況可能導致本集團不能持續經營；\n- 評估財務報表的整體呈現、結構及內容，包括披露項目，是否反映交易和事件的公正呈示；\n- 獲取充分適當的審計證據，對本集團內各實體或業務活動之財務資訊表達意見。我負責指導、監督及執行本集團的審計工作。本人對我的審計意見負全責。\n\n本人會就包括審計範圍與時間、重大審計發現（包括識別內部控制重大缺陷）之事宜與匯備基金諮詢委員會之議擬事項進行溝通。\n\n此外，本人會向匯備基金諮詢委員會提交一份聲明，證明本人已遵守有關獨立性之道德要求，並就所有可能影響本人獨立性之關係或事由提供說明，以及相關之保障措施（如適用）。\n\n本人亦會根據與審計委員會溝通之事項，確定對本期財務報表審計最為重要的事項，並於審計報告中列明，除非法律或法規限制公布該事項，或在極少數情況下，因不利後果較公眾利益更重要而決定不披露。\n\n孫大衛  審計主任\n\n2018年4月11日"}

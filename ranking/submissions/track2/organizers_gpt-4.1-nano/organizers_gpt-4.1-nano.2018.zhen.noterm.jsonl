{"zh": "# 總裁報告\n\n2018年是全球金融危機發生十周年，十年間國際政經形勢經歷巨大轉變，當中不乏一幕幕超乎最佳編劇所能想像的場景。我在去年的年報指出，2017年金融市場表現是「喜出望外」，同時提到前景「潛藏隱憂」。回顧2018年，或許可形容為「先喜後悲」。環球多個股票指數在1月創出歷史新高後不久，熾熱的投資情緒旋即遇上中美貿易摩擦的冷鋒，加上英國脫歐談判一直拉鋸、地緣政治惡化、美聯儲四次加息等因素，市場樂觀氣氛急劇逆轉，資產價格在年內大幅下跌。MSCI全球指數從高點至低點曾下跌20.3%，全年累跌約一成，是2008年環球金融危機以來表現最差的一年。恒生指數從高點最多曾下跌26.7%，全年下挫13.6%，錄得七年來最大年度跌幅。\n\n# 聯匯穩健 信心所繫\n\n儘管外圍形勢波動難測，香港金融體系仍然保持穩健，貨幣市場運作暢順無阻。實施三十五年的聯繫匯率制度成功應對了資金流出港元的考驗。自環球金融危機爆發以來，累積約10,000億港元等值的資金流入港元。去年，隨着美國息率上升，港美息差持續擴闊，「沽港元、買美元」套息活動增加，港元兌美元匯率在年初轉弱，2005年制訂的「弱方兌換保證」，自4月首度觸發後，年內再觸發26次。金管局按照既定機制，履行「買港元、沽美元」的弱方兌換保證，有序、透明地在市場承接1,035億港元的港元沽盤。隨着資金流走，一個月香港銀行同業拆息在2018年內累升了105基點，而銀行亦在去年9月美國加息後，上調了最優惠利率。金管局多次和適時通過不同渠道向公眾闡釋「弱方兌換保證」的運作機制，令公眾了解資金流出港元是香港利率正常化的必經過程，也是聯匯制度的正常運作。國際貨幣基金組織在去年年底重申支持香港聯匯制度的立場，特區政府也強調聯匯是香港貨幣穩定的基石。這都有助於穩定香港市民對聯繫匯率的信心。\n\n# 銀行體系 穩中有進\n\n2008年環球金融危機暴露了全球金融系統潛藏的種種弊端及隱患，促使國際間在過去十年協調推出一系列針對金融市場、金融機構的改革，包括在銀行業監管方面，提升企業管治和風險管理。金管局的銀行監管工作重點針對兩方面：一是着眼於銀行資產負債風險的審慎監管，二是銀行的行為操守，二者不可偏廢。資產負債風險監管方面，金管局作為巴塞爾銀行監管委員會(Basel Committee on Banking Supervision)及二十國集團轄下金融穩定理事會(FinancialStability Board)成員，有責任全面落實國際監管標準，確保香港銀行業穩健審慎地經營業務。去年底香港銀行資本充足率達20.3%，不但遠高於國際最低標準要求的8%，也較環球金融危機時的14.7%水平顯著提升。大型銀行去年第四季平均流動覆蓋比率達167.6%，同樣遠高於法定最低要求的90%。與此同時，為避免重蹈環球金融危機時需動用公帑拯救「大得不能倒」金融機構的覆轍，金融穩定理事會制訂了關於金融機構處置機制的國際標準。香港是亞洲區內少數已經全面落實符合機制要求的地區之一，金管局下設的處置機制辦公室正落實該機制的操作細則，要求銀行推行結構性變動令處置預案在需要時能有效實施，去年亦推出了《吸收虧損能力規則》，未來還會陸續推出更多相關規則。\n\n鑑於樓價持續上升，金管局未雨綢繆，在2009至2017年間共推出八輪逆周期措施，確保一旦地產市況逆轉，本港銀行體系有足夠的抗震能力應對衝擊。這些措施成效顯著：新造住宅平均按揭成數由2009年的64%降至2018年底的46%；平均供款與入息比率亦由2010年的41%下調至2018年底的34%。年內銀行信貸錄得4.4%的溫和增長，整體資產質素維持良好，零售銀行不良貸款比率進一步降至0.5%，遠低於國際及本港歷史平均水平。去年銀行業盈利持續增長，整體股東權益回報率連升兩年至13%；多家國際性銀行集團在本港的業務交出了不俗的成績表，成為集團盈利的重要支柱。\n\n# 穩善文化 上行下效\n\n在監管銀行的行為操守方面，金管局在2010年增設銀行操守部，促進銀行公平待客，並加強保障消費者權益。要做到標本兼治，除了訂出各種針對銀行營運基本操守的監管要求外，我們近年來大力推動改革銀行文化，鼓勵銀行循管治、獎勵制度、評估與回饋機制三方面推動穩善文化，務求銀行內部做到上行下效，在根本上恢復、提升客戶對銀行的信任和尊重。繼2017年金管局向全港銀行提供具體的指引，金管局在2018年底進一步推出銀行文化的監管措施，包括要求銀行就企業文化和落實有關措施作出自我評估等，令穩善銀行文化的三大支柱能有效執行。\n\n雖然互聯網和移動金融是全球趨勢，金管局去年仍繼續促進普及金融，照顧未能應用新科技的社群。例如我們連同香港銀行公會推動便利店推出長者透過「易辦事」免購物提款服務，有關便利店網絡已增至逾300家；我們並聯絡香港郵政在7家主要位於離島和新界的郵政局推出長者提款易服務。銀行業界響應金管局的建議，年內積極增加無障礙設施，提供傷健共融的銀行服務，例子之一是設有聲音導航的自動櫃員機數目一年內增加逾十倍至超過700部。另外，在金管局積極推動下，我們預期將會陸續有銀行在偏遠地區開設更多實體分行和增設流動銀行服務，便利市民。\n\n# 智慧銀行 嶄新體驗\n\n金管局與銀行和科技業界緊密合作，在2017年9月啟動「智慧銀行新紀元」，推動香港金融科技發展和創新，為市民帶來嶄新的支付和銀行服務體驗。2018年的亮點，無疑是在9月正式開通的「轉數快」。它是全球獨一無二的零售快速支付系統，打破香港各種電子支付工具和銀行帳戶之間的屏障，讓市民享受全年無休的港元和人民幣即時轉帳服務。金管局還同步推出全球首個「共用二維碼」標準和應用程式，商戶可憑單個二維碼接通多個電子支付系統。「轉數快」推出以來深受市民歡迎，短短半年，登記紀錄已逾258萬個，日均交易量達6萬宗，平均每宗金額分別20,700港元和38,000元人民幣。\n\n去年5月，金管局發出虛擬銀行的認可指引，隨即有33家機構提交虛擬銀行牌照的申請。截至今年四月中，四個牌照已經發出，預期它們將於年內正式投入營運。虛擬銀行有助推動香港金融科技發展和創新，為個人和中小企提供嶄新服務和體驗，並促進普及金融。\n\n此外，金管局在7月發布開放應用程式介面(OpenAPI)框架，銀行將分四階段開放產品和服務的對外接口，開創更靈活、更開放的金融科技環境，讓銀行客戶更便捷地整合帳戶資料、獲取資訊，選取貼合自己需要的服務。年內，共有42項新科技產品使用金管局的金融科技監管沙盒進行測試，當中28項完成試行，有關產品和服務已順利推出市場。\n\n金管局聯同多家銀行研發的「貿易聯動」去年10月正式啟用，這個採用「分布式分類帳技術」的貿易融資平台，將提升銀行審批貿易融資的效率。「貿易聯動」目前正在測試連接其他地區相關平台，以促進跨境貿易融資活動。\n\n金融科技不但廣泛應用於日常生活，近年更走進合規和監管領域。金管局鼓勵銀行運用合規科技(Regtech)協助處理日常營運如監察涉嫌洗錢和恐怖分子資金籌集的可疑活動。與此同時金管局正研究使用監管科技(Suptech)，進一步提升監管工作的效率和成效。\n\n# 金融實力 鞏固提升\n\n國際金融中心之間是軟實力的較量，我們要不斷順應經濟社會和科技發展的變化，把握機遇，不斷為香港金融業開拓新的發展空間。綠色金融就是香港開拓債券和項目融資市場的一個重大機遇。金管局支持和配合特區政府發展綠色金融，除了配合特區政府籌備1,000億港元的政府綠色債券發行計劃，我們去年還舉辦多場綠色金融研討會，包括兩場國際大型會議，以提升市場對綠色金融的認識、了解和參與，並鼓勵發行機構參與政府去年推出的綠色債券資助計劃和香港的綠色金融認證服務。去年在港發行綠色債券規模逾110億美元，相等於2017年的三倍多。\n\n近年來投資界對基建和相關項目興趣日濃。金管局於2016年成立基建融資促進辦公室(IFFO)，合作夥伴至今已倍增至95家機構，成為區內基建融資的重要交流平台。去年金管局與國務院國有資產監督管理委員會（國資委）首次合辦高層圓桌會議，討論香港為中央國有企業「走出去」的獨特優勢和作用，為央企與香港金融、專業服務界日後共拓發展機遇奠下良好基礎。\n", "en": "# CEO Report\n\n2018 marked the tenth anniversary of the global financial crisis. Over the past decade, the international political and economic landscape has undergone significant changes, with many scenes beyond the imagination of the best screenwriters. In last year's annual report, I highlighted that the performance of the financial markets in 2017 was \"beyond expectations,\" while also noting that \"hidden risks\" lurked in the outlook. Reflecting on 2018, it could perhaps be described as \"joy followed by sorrow.\" Shortly after several global stock indices hit record highs in January, the overheated investment sentiment was quickly met with the cold edge of US-China trade frictions. Coupled with ongoing Brexit negotiations, deteriorating geopolitical tensions, and four Federal Reserve interest rate hikes, market optimism sharply reversed, and asset prices fell sharply within the year. The MSCI Global Index fell 20.3% from its high to low, with an annual decline of about 10%, making it the worst year since the global financial crisis in 2008. The Hang Seng Index once declined by as much as 26.7% from its peak, ending the year down 13.6%, recording its largest annual drop in seven years.\n\n# Stable Linkage, Confidence as the Foundation\n\nDespite unpredictable external fluctuations, Hong Kong’s financial system remained resilient, with smooth functioning of the monetary markets. The thirty-five-year-old Linked Exchange Rate System successfully met the challenges of capital outflows from the Hong Kong dollar. Since the outbreak of the global financial crisis, there has been approximately HKD 1 trillion in capital inflows into the Hong Kong dollar. Last year, with rising US interest rates, the Hong Kong-US interest rate differential continued to widen, prompting increased carry trades of \"selling HKD and buying USD.\" The HKD/USD exchange rate weakened at the beginning of the year; since the first trigger of the \"Weakening Exchange Rate Guarantee\" established in 2005 in April, it was triggered 26 more times during the year. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) duly fulfilled the \"buy Hong Kong dollars, sell US dollars\" guarantee in an orderly and transparent manner, absorbing HKD 103.5 billion of Hong Kong dollar sale orders. As capital outflows persisted, the one-month HIBOR increased by 105 basis points over the year, and following the US rate hike in September, banks raised their best lending rates. The HKMA repeatedly and timely explained the operation of the \"Weakening Exchange Rate Guarantee\" through various channels, helping the public understand that capital outflows are a normal part of interest rate normalization and the proper functioning of the Linked Exchange Rate system. At the end of last year, the International Monetary Fund reiterated its support for Hong Kong's Linked Exchange Rate system, and the SAR government also emphasized that the system is the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary stability. These measures help maintain public confidence in the linked exchange rate.\n\n# Banking System: Progress amid Stability\n\nThe global financial crisis in 2008 revealed numerous hidden flaws and risks within the international financial system, prompting coordinated reforms over the past decade targeting financial markets and institutions, including enhanced corporate governance and risk management in banking supervision. The HKMA’s banking supervision focuses on two areas: prudential oversight of banks’ asset-liability risks and the integrity of banks’ conduct. Both are equally important. In asset-liability risk management, as a member of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the Financial Stability Board, the HKMA is responsible for implementing international standards to ensure the prudent operation of Hong Kong’s banking sector. At the end of last year, Hong Kong’s banking capital adequacy ratio reached 20.3%, significantly higher than the minimum international standard of 8% and well above the 14.7% level during the global financial crisis. The average liquidity coverage ratio of major banks in the fourth quarter was 167.6%, far exceeding the statutory minimum of 90%. Meanwhile, to avoid repeating the crisis where taxpayer funds were used to rescue \"too big to fail\" institutions, the Financial Stability Board established international standards for the resolution mechanisms of financial institutions. Hong Kong is among the few Asian regions to fully implement these standards, with the HKMA’s Resolution Office actively developing detailed operational guidelines to ensure effective implementation of resolution plans, including the recent introduction of the \"Loss Absorbency Requirement.\" Future regulations are also planned.\n\nGiven the continuous rise in property prices, the HKMA adopted pre-emptive measures from 2009 to 2017, with eight rounds of countercyclical policies, to ensure the resilience of the banking sector against potential market reversals. These measures have proved effective: the average mortgage loan-to-value ratio for new residential properties declined from 64% in 2009 to 46% at the end of 2018; the average debt-service-to-income ratio decreased from 41% in 2010 to 34% at year-end. Bank credit experienced a modest annual growth of 4.4%, with overall asset quality remaining good; retail banking’s non-performing loan ratio further declined to 0.5%, well below international and historical averages. Last year, banking profitability continued to grow, with overall return on equity rising for the second consecutive year to 13%; many international banking groups operating in Hong Kong delivered excellent results, becoming a key pillar of their group profitability.\n\n# Building a Culture of Integrity and Service\n\nIn terms of regulatory conduct, the HKMA established the Banking Conduct Department in 2010 to promote fair treatment of customers and strengthen consumer protection. To address both symptoms and root causes, in addition to setting out various regulatory requirements on core banking conduct, recent years have seen a strong push for cultural reform within the banking sector, encouraging banks to implement a culture of integrity and service through governance, reward systems, and assessment and feedback mechanisms. The goal is for internal practices to set an example from top to bottom, fundamentally restoring and enhancing customer trust and respect. After the HKMA provided specific guidance to banks across Hong Kong in 2017, at the end of 2018 the HKMA further introduced supervisory measures on banking culture, including requiring banks to conduct self-assessments on corporate culture and related measures, ensuring the effective implementation of the three pillars of a culture of integrity and service.\n\nAlthough internet and mobile banking are global trends, the HKMA continued to promote financial inclusion last year, serving communities less able to adopt new technologies. For instance, we collaborated with the Hong Kong Association of Banks to introduce a \"DigiBank\" service at convenience stores, allowing seniors to withdraw cash without shopping. The convenience store network has expanded to over 300 locations; we also coordinated with Hong Kong Post to launch senior-friendly ATM services at seven main post offices in Outlying Islands and the New Territories. In response to the HKMA’s recommendations, banks actively increased accessible facilities during the year, providing inclusive banking services—for example, the number of ATMs with voice navigation increased more than tenfold to over 700. Additionally, under the HKMA's vigorous promotion, we expect more banks to open additional branches and mobile banking services in remote areas, making banking more accessible for citizens.\n\n# Smart Banking: A New Experience\n\nThe HKMA has collaborated closely with banks and the tech industry to launch the \"Smart Banking Era\" in September 2017, promoting financial technology development and innovation in Hong Kong, delivering a new experience in payments and banking services. A key development in 2018 was the official launch of \"FPS\" (Faster Payment System) in September. This is a unique real-time retail payment system globally, breaking down barriers between various e-wallets and bank accounts in Hong Kong, allowing citizens to enjoy 24/7 real-time transfers in HKD and RMB. The HKMA also introduced the world’s first \"Shared QR Code\" standard and app, enabling merchants to use a single QR code to connect with multiple e-payment platforms. Since launch, FPS has been very popular, with over 2.58 million registered users and an average daily transaction volume of 60,000, with average amounts of HKD 20,700 and RMB 38,000 per transaction.\n\nIn May last year, the HKMA issued guidelines for virtual banking licenses, leading to 33 applications from different institutions. As of mid-April this year, four licenses have been issued, with expected full operation within the year. Virtual banks will help drive financial technology development and innovation in Hong Kong, offering new services and experiences for individuals and SMEs, and promoting financial inclusion.\n\nMoreover, in July, the HKMA released an OpenAPI framework, enabling banks to gradually open up their products and services in four phases. This creates a more flexible and open fintech environment, allowing customers easier access to integrate account information, obtain data, and select services aligned with their needs. During the year, 42 new tech products were tested within the HKMA’s fintech sandbox, with 28 completing testing and successfully launching on the market.\n\nThe HKMA, together with several banks, launched \"TradeConnect\" in October last year. Using distributed ledger technology (DLT), this trade financing platform aims to improve the efficiency of trade finance approval processes. \"TradeConnect\" is currently testing connections with relevant platforms in other regions to facilitate cross-border trade financing activities.\n\nFintech is not only widely applied in daily life but is also increasingly used in compliance and regulatory fields. The HKMA encourages banks to utilize RegTech to assist in daily operations, such as monitoring suspicious activities related to money laundering and terrorist financing. Meanwhile, the HKMA is exploring the application of SupTech (supervisory technology) to further improve the efficiency and effectiveness of regulatory work.\n\n# Strengthening Financial Power\n\nInternational financial centers compete in soft power. We must continually adapt to economic, social, and technological changes, grasp opportunities, and develop new growth spaces for Hong Kong’s financial industry. Green finance presents a major opportunity for Hong Kong to expand its bond and project financing markets. The HKMA supports and cooperates with the SAR government in developing green finance. Besides coordinating the SAR’s HKD 100 billion green bond issuance program, we held multiple green finance seminars last year, including two major international conferences, to enhance market awareness, understanding, and participation in green finance. We also encourage issuers to participate in the government’s green bond support scheme and Hong Kong’s green finance certification services. Last year, green bonds issued in Hong Kong exceeded USD 11 billion, over three times the size in 2017.\n\nRecently, investment interests in infrastructure and related projects have grown significantly. The HKMA established the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO) in 2016, which has expanded its partners to 95 institutions, becoming an important platform for infrastructure financing dialogue in the region.

The HKMA was subsequently established on April 1, 1993.\n\nThe powers, functions, and responsibilities of the Chief Executive of the HKMA are explicitly provided in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the Banking Ordinance, the Financial Institutions (Dispute Resolution) Ordinance, the Deposit Protection Scheme Ordinance, the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, and related regulations. A 2003 exchange of letters between the Financial Secretary and the Chief Executive of the HKMA delineates their respective roles and responsibilities in monetary and financial affairs, including the delegation of certain powers. These letters are publicly available on the HKMA website.\n\nThe Exchange Fund, established under the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is under the control of the Financial Secretary. The Ordinance stipulates that the fund should primarily be used to influence the HK dollar’s exchange rate. The Financial Secretary may also use the Exchange Fund to maintain the stability and soundness of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems, thus supporting Hong Kong’s status as an international financial center.\n\nThe Chief Executive of the HKMA is appointed under the Exchange Fund Ordinance to assist the Financial Secretary in executing his functions conferred by the Ordinance, as well as other statutes and duties assigned by the Financial Secretary. The HKMA’s office is known as the “Office of the HKMA,” and the Chief Executive is the Governor of the HKMA.\n\nUnder the powers granted by the Banking Ordinance, the Chief Executive of the HKMA regulates and supervises banking activities and deposit-taking institutions. The Ordinance makes the Chief Executive responsible for licensing licensed banks, restricted license banks, and authorized deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong.\n\nThe Financial Institutions (Dispute Resolution) Ordinance designates the Chief Executive of the HKMA as the resolution authority for banking sector entities. This ordinance grants the HKMA various powers to ensure orderly resolution of such entities to minimize the risk of their unsustainable operations undermining the stability and effective functioning of Hong Kong’s financial system.\n\nThe Securities and Futures Ordinance and the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Ordinance confer powers on the HKMA related to banking, securities, and MPF businesses.\n\nThe Insurance Ordinance stipulates that the HKMA may be empowered to investigate and examine banking insurance activities.\n\nThe Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance authorizes the HKMA to oversee banks’ compliance with AML/CTF regulations.\n\nThe Deposit Protection Scheme Ordinance assigns the HKMA the responsibility to oversee the scheme’s operation and to initiate compensation payments from the scheme’s fund to depositors of insolvent banks.\n\nUnder the statutory framework provided by the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, the Chief Executive of the HKMA can designate and supervise payment and settlement systems that are critical to the Hong Kong dollar or financial stability or to Hong Kong’s role as an international financial center. The ordinance also authorizes the HKMA to manage the licensing regime for stored value facilities, designate retail payment systems, and oversee their safe and efficient operation.\n\n# The HKMA and the Hong Kong SAR Government\n\nThe HKMA is part of the Hong Kong SAR Government’s structure but can employ staff under terms different from civil service employment to attract personnel with relevant experience and expertise. The HKMA’s Governor and staff are public officers. Its daily operations are highly autonomous within the scope of powers conferred or delegated by the Chief Executive.\n\nThe Financial Secretary is responsible for setting Hong Kong’s monetary policy objectives and framework. In a 2003 letter to the HKMA, the Financial Secretary outlined that monetary stability should be maintained through the Note-issuing Bank system, keeping the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate around HKD 7.80 to USD 1. The HKMA is responsible for achieving monetary policy objectives by deciding strategies, tools, and implementation methods, and for maintaining the stability and soundness of Hong Kong’s monetary system.\n\nWith the support of the Financial Secretary and the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury is responsible for maintaining the stability of Hong Kong’s financial system and promoting the city’s status as an international financial center. To implement these policies, the HKMA’s responsibilities include:\n- Promoting the overall stability and effective operation of the banking system\n- Collaborating with relevant institutions and organizations to develop debt markets\n- Handling matters related to the issuance and circulation of legal tender and coins\n- Developing and overseeing payment, settlement, and clearing systems, including operating such systems when appropriate, to ensure the safety and efficiency of financial infrastructure\n- Working with relevant bodies to promote confidence in Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems, and implementing measures to enhance Hong Kong’s competitiveness in international financial services.\n\nThe Exchange Fund remains under the control of the Financial Secretary. The HKMA must report to the Financial Secretary on the deployment and investment management of the Exchange Fund based on delegated authority.\n\n# Accountability and Transparency\n\nRegarding daily operations and the implementation of government policy goals, the HKMA maintains high levels of autonomy complemented by strong accountability and transparency.\n\nThe HKMA is committed to supporting the stability of the monetary and banking systems, effectively managing official reserves, developing and supervising resilient and diversified financial infrastructure, thereby strengthening Hong Kong’s position as an international financial center, and supporting economic development.\n\nFor effective performance, the HKMA must gain public confidence. Therefore, it carefully explains its policies and work to the public, addressing issues within its scope of responsibilities that attract social concern.\n\nAs the HKMA’s Chief Executive is appointed by the Financial Secretary, the organization reports to the public via the Financial Secretary. Since its authority derives from legislation enacted by the Legislative Council, the HKMA is also accountable to the Legislative Council. The HKMA aims to promote public understanding of its role and goals, and to monitor issues of public concern. In executing its daily work and maintaining broad engagement with society, it adheres to policies aimed at increasing transparency and openness. These policies have two main objectives:\n- To maximize the public and financial sector’s understanding of the HKMA’s work while respecting legal restrictions on confidentiality, market sensitivity, and disclosure of commercial secrets\n- To ensure the HKMA stays in touch with societal trends and responds appropriately to public opinions.\n\nThe HKMA aims for international excellence in transparency, maintaining extensive contact with the media and publishing various bilingual journals and thematic publications. Its bilingual website (www.hkma.gov.hk) features sections on economic research, statistics, consumer information, and other topics, along with publications, press releases, speeches, and briefing materials. It also actively uses social media platforms to communicate more effectively with the public in the digital age. The HKMA’s information center, comprising a library and exhibitions hall, is open six days a week to the public. The HKMA also conducts public educational activities through lectures and guided tours, explaining its work, especially to students, and promoting financial literacy. Details on its media relations, publications, and educational activities can be found in the chapter on “Institutional Functions.”\n\nThe frequency and detail of the HKMA’s disclosures of Exchange Fund and Currency Board account information have gradually increased over time. Since 1999, the HKMA has participated in the IMF’s Special Data Dissemination Standard for central banks. It also publishes meeting minutes of the Currency Board Subcommittee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee and reports on the operation of the Currency Board system. Since 1996, the HKMA’s website has also included banking regulatory policies and guidelines.\n\nThe relationship between the HKMA and the Legislative Council is vital for accountability and transparency. The HKMA’s Chief Executive commits to quarterly briefings to the Legislative Council’s Financial Committee on its activities and policies, answering questions. HKMA representatives also attend meetings of the Legislative Council’s Finance Committee and Bills Committee to explain and discuss specific issues and assist legislators with bill review.\n\n# Advisory Committees and Other Committees\n\n# Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\n\nWhen the Financial Secretary exercises control over the Exchange Fund, he consults the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee. This committee was established under section 3(1) of the Exchange Fund Ordinance. This provision states that the Financial Secretary must consult the committee when exercising control over the fund. The Financial Secretary is the ex officio chairman of the committee, while other members (including the HKMA’s Chief Executive) are appointed personally by the Financial Secretary under the authority of the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong SAR. Members are appointed based on their professional expertise and experience, which benefits the committee’s advice and decision-making. The members’ expertise covers fields such as currency, finance, economics, investment, accounting, management, commerce, and law.\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee has five specialized subcommittees responsible for supervising the HKMA’s specific activities and reporting or making recommendations to the Financial Secretary via the main advisory committee. In 2018, the committee held five meetings to discuss issues related to the HKMA’s work, most of which were pre-discussed by the subcommittees.\n\nThe Governance Committee oversees the HKMA’s performance and provides recommendations on compensation, staffing, HR policies, budget, administration, and governance to the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee. The committee held five meetings in 2018, covering HKMA’s expenditure budget, performance evaluation, annual salary review, and strategic planning. It also reviews the HKMA’s periodic work reports.\n\nThe Audit Committee reviews the HKMA’s financial reporting process and assesses whether its internal controls are adequate and effective, submitting reports on these reviews. It examines the HKMA’s financial statements, the components and accounting principles used, and coordinates external and internal audits. Members of the Audit Committee have no administrative functions within the HKMA. In 2018, the committee held two meetings and reviewed reports from the Risk Committee and Internal Audit Department.\n\nThe Currency Board Subcommittee supervises the operations of the Currency Board system and reports on its status as the core of the Linked Exchange Rate System. It ensures the system operates according to policy, recommends improvements, and maintains high transparency. The HKMA regularly publishes the committee’s meeting records and reports on the system’s operation. In 2018, the subcommittee held four meetings."}

As global economic growth slowed, it is expected that Hong Kong's economic growth will also decelerate in 2019.\n\n# Economic Review\n\n# Real Economic Activities\n\nIn 2018, Hong Kong's economy further expanded, but the year-on-year growth rate gradually slowed from 4.6% in the first quarter to 1.3% in the fourth quarter (Table 1), dragging the full-year growth rate down from 3.8% in 2017 to 3.0%. The slowdown in economic expansion reflects a deceleration in domestic demand growth and the ongoing drag from net exports (Figure 1). On the domestic front, private consumption grew strongly in the first quarter, but the momentum diminished thereafter, partly due to increased uncertainties from rising trade protectionism and wealth effects from a correction in local asset prices. Due to fragile business confidence, overall investment growth also slowed. On the external side, merchandise exports remained roughly stable in the first three quarters but deteriorated significantly in the fourth quarter amid escalating US-China trade tensions. Merchandise imports also slowed due to weakened demand driven by exports. Conversely, service exports grew faster throughout the year, partly benefiting from a booming inbound tourism industry, while service imports maintained momentum owing to growth in transportation, business, and other services. Net trade turned from a surplus in 2017 to a small deficit in 2018, which weighed on the local economy.\n\nTable 1: Real Gross Domestic Product Growth by Expenditure Item (Compared with previous quarter)\n\nNote: The seasonally adjusted quarter-to-quarter change in total gross fixed capital formation is not available.\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\nFigure 1: Contributions of Components to Real Gross Domestic Product Growth\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Monetary Conditions\n\nMainly influenced by carry trade activities under the negative interest rate differential between HKD and USD, the HKD exchange rate against the USD generally depreciated in 2018. Notably, the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking was triggered in April, May, and August, prompting the Monetary Authority to buy HKD and sell USD at the linked exchange rate of HKD 7.85 to 1 USD, as stipulated under the Linked Exchange Rate System. Under this system, the monetary base of HKD contracted, indicating a decrease in banking system liquidity, combined with market expectations of US rate hikes, which caused overall interbank interest rates in HKD to rise. As the cost of funds in the banking system increased, some banks raised their best lending rates by 12.5 to 25 basis points after the Federal Reserve increased its target federal funds rate in late September. Regarding credit, growth slowed significantly from 16.1% in 2017 to 4.4% in 2018, partly due to a slowdown in the domestic economy and weakening external trade performance.\n\n# Inflation\n\nInflationary pressures slightly increased in 2018. Excluding the effects of one-off government relief measures, the core inflation rate rose from a low of 1.7% in 2017 to 2.6% in 2018, still reflecting moderate levels. The faster increase in housing rents, prompted by earlier rises in private residential rents signed, contributed significantly (Figure 2). Broader analysis indicates that growth in nominal labor costs and commercial property rents accelerated slightly, further indicating rising local cost pressures. As inflation increased in some major sources of Hong Kong’s imports, import prices also rose accordingly.\n\nFigure 2: Core Consumer Price Inflation\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Labour Market\n\nThe labour market remained resilient in 2018 (Figure 3). The unemployment rate decreased from 3.1% for the whole of 2017 to 2.8% in 2018, the lowest since 1997. Most major service sectors saw declining unemployment rates, especially in accommodation and food services. With further increases in total employment and vacancies in the private sector, overall labour demand continued to strengthen, and the labour force participation rate also edged up slightly. Under tighter labour market conditions, real wages and incomes further increased.\n\nFigure 3: Labour Market Conditions\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Stock Market\n\nHong Kong’s stock market experienced a sharp reversal in 2018. Driven by strong upward momentum in 2017, the Hang Seng Index reached an all-time high of 33,484 points in January 2018 (Figure 4). However, concerns among investors escalated due to tightening monetary policies by major central banks, worsening US-China trade frictions, and a slowdown in local economic growth, leading to a rapid shift from optimism. The Hang Seng Index fell to a low of 24,586 points in October and closed the year at 25,846 points, down 13.6% from a year earlier. Nonetheless, the average daily trading volume increased from HKD 88.2 billion in 2017 to HKD 107.4 billion, while the total capital raised through initial public offerings (IPOs) surged significantly due to the listing of companies engaged in new economy and innovative technology sectors.\n\nFigure 4: Asset Prices\nSource: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\n\n# Property Market\n\nThe residential property market remained buoyant in the first half of 2018 but cooled down in the second half amid worsening US-China trade tensions, correction in global stock markets, and rising local interest rates. Overall, property prices declined by 9% from their peak between July and December but still recorded a 2% increase for the full year (Figure 4). Transaction volumes in both primary and secondary markets decreased notably in the second half, with total property transactions dropping 7% to 57,247 cases compared to the previous year. Housing affordability remained tight, with price-to-income and leverage ratios at 17.0 and 75.7 respectively, both well above long-term averages. Meanwhile, non-residential property prices rose across the year but slightly retreated near the end. Overall, prices and rents continued to increase, while rental yields remained low.\n\n# Economic Outlook\n\n# Economic Environment\n\nDue to a slowdown in global growth, Hong Kong’s economic growth in 2019 is expected to decelerate. Particularly, the external environment faces numerous challenges, and Hong Kong’s exports are expected to remain under pressure. On the domestic front, low unemployment and rising household income are expected to support private consumption, but growth may slow due to weakened consumer confidence and the wealth effects from earlier asset price adjustments. Regarding fixed capital formation, activities should gradually expand with increased housing supply, but rising uncertainties may cause firms to adopt a more cautious approach to capital investment. The government anticipates real GDP growth of 2% to 3% in 2019, while private sector analysts’ latest forecasts average around 2.3%.\n\n# Inflation and Labour Market\n\nWith global growth, including Hong Kong’s, slowing, external price pressures and domestic cost pressures are likely to ease, maintaining moderate inflation in 2019. Recently observed declines in new residential rent agreements will also help keep inflation subdued. The consensus in the market is that overall inflation will be around 2.2% in 2019, while the government’s forecast for core inflation is 2.5%. Under the continued economic growth and thriving inbound tourism industry, the labour market is expected to remain tight. Private sector analysts predict the unemployment rate will stay around 3% in 2019.\n\n# Uncertainties and Risks\n\nThe 2019 economic outlook is subject to uncertainties and risks stemming from trade tensions, the future direction of US monetary policy, mainland China’s economic performance, Brexit, and geopolitical tensions. Moreover, if these uncertainties worsen or persist long term, financial market sentiment and business confidence could be greatly affected, putting downward pressure on the local asset markets and the real economy.\n\nAdditionally, the residential property market is influenced by many external and local factors, and its outlook remains uncertain. External factors like US-China trade tensions could impact market sentiment, economic prospects, and financial conditions, casting a shadow over Hong Kong’s property outlook. Domestically, despite the slowing economic growth, stable employment and income growth may support housing demand. Hong Kong interest rates will partly depend on future US policy rate adjustments, which remain uncertain. In the long term, increased housing completions over the past years and government efforts to boost land and housing supply are expected to narrow the housing supply-demand gap.\n\n# Banking System Performance\n\nDespite increased external uncertainties, such as US-China trade conflicts, Brexit, and normalization of interest rates, leading to more volatile financial markets, Hong Kong’s banking system remained resilient in 2018. The capital and liquidity positions were sound, and asset quality remained good. Rising interest rates widened interest spreads, significantly boosting bank profitability.\n\n# Balance Sheet Trends\n\nIn 2018, the banking system continued to grow steadily, with total assets and liabilities expanding by 5.9%. Ongoing economic uncertainties, such as trade tensions and rate hikes in major economies, led to more cautious borrowing by firms. Total loans increased by 4.4% compared to 16.1% in 2017, driven by loans used domestically (+6.5%) and abroad (+2%). Meanwhile, trade financing declined by 7.6%, reflecting global trade uncertainties. Growth of loans to mainland China slowed from 17.5% in 2017 to 1.4% in 2018.\n\nAt the end of 2018, debt securities accounted for 22% of total assets, unchanged from 2017, mainly consisting of investment-grade bonds issued by the government and banks, with low credit risk.\n\nOn the liabilities side, total deposits increased by 5% in 2018, compared to an 8.7% increase in 2017. Anticipating continued US rate hikes, some banks raised fixed deposit rates to attract depositors and lock in funds. The share of current and savings deposits in total deposits fell from 57.4% in the previous year to 51.4% at the end of 2018, leading to higher funding costs. As the growth of total deposits lagged behind loans, the loan-to-deposit ratio slightly decreased from 73% at the end of 2017 to 72.6% at year-end (Figure 5).\n\nFigure 5: Loans and Deposits in the Banking System\n\n# Capital Adequacy\n\nThe banking system maintained a comfortable capital buffer, indicating strong resilience against potential shocks. The capital adequacy ratio reached a record high since the implementation of Basel III; the consolidated total capital ratio of authorized local institutions rose from 19.1% at the end of 2017 to 20.3% at the end of 2018 (Figure 6).\n\nFigure 6: Consolidated Capital Ratio of Local Licensed Banks\n\nBasel III leverage ratio came into effect on January 1, 2018. It is a non-risk-based indicator aimed at limiting excessive leverage in the banking sector. By the end of 2018, the leverage ratio stood at 8.0%, well above the statutory minimum requirement of 3% (Figure 7).\n\nFigure 7: Consolidated Leverage Ratio of Local Licensed Banks\n\n# Liquidity Conditions\n\nThe liquidity in the banking system remained stable, reflecting its robust capacity to withstand potential financial and economic shocks. For short-term liquidity (covering 1-month funds), the average liquidity coverage ratio of Class 1 institutions was 167.6% in the fourth quarter, well above the statutory minimum of 90%. The average liquidity maintenance ratio of Class 2 institutions was 54.3%, also far exceeding the minimum requirement of 25% (Figure 8)."}
{"zh": "# 貨幣穩定\n\n2018年港元利率普遍上升，而港元現貨匯率則回軟，並貼近弱方兌換保證匯率的水平。儘管如此，港元外匯及貨幣市場運作仍然暢順有序。聯繫匯率制度是香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石，並繼續展現其承受強大衝擊的能力。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的主要目標是維持貨幣穩定，即確保港元匯價穩定，使港元在外匯市場兌美元的匯率保持在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的區間內。該貨幣體制主要採用貨幣發行局制度，規定由外匯基金所持的美元儲備向貨幣基礎提供最少百分之百的支持；貨幣基礎若有變動，美元儲備亦必須作出相應增減，與貨幣基礎的變動百分之百配合。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n- 負債證明書（為3間發鈔銀行發行的銀行紙幣提供十足支持）\n- 政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣\n- 銀行在金管局所持結算戶口的結餘總額（即總結餘）\n- 金管局代表政府發行的外匯基金票據及債券。\n\n金管局透過自動利率調節機制及履行兌換保證的堅決承諾來維持港元匯率的穩定。若市場對港元的需求大過供應，令市場匯率轉強至7.75港元兌1美元的強方兌換保證匯率，金管局會向銀行沽出港元、買入美元，使總結餘增加及港元利率下跌，從而令港元匯率從強方兌換保證匯率水平回復至7.75到7.85的兌換範圍內。相反，若港元供過於求，令市場匯率轉弱至7.85港元兌1美元的弱方兌換保證匯率，金管局會向銀行買入港元，使總結餘減少及推高港元利率，港元匯率隨之由弱方兌換保證匯率水平回復至兌換範圍內。\n\n# 2018年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n在港元與美元負息差擴闊帶動套息活動的背景下，港元匯率自年初以來逐步轉弱。於4月12日，弱方兌換保證在2005年訂於7.85水平以來首度被觸發。全年計，弱方兌換保證在2018年合共被觸發27次，分別在4月被觸發13次，5月6次，以及8月8次。儘管如此，港元交易仍然暢順有序，港元匯率於4月中至9月中在弱方兌換保證匯率7.85附近徘徊（圖1）。其後港元匯率略為轉強，部分反映假期、季結及年結臨近，銀行同業流動性收緊，帶動部分套息交易平倉。同時，某程度上港元亦受到11月初股市氣氛好轉支持。整體而言，港元外匯市場在2018年全年正常運作。\n\n圖1 2018年市場匯率\n\n由於弱方兌換保證被觸發，總結餘與未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額由2017年底的12,268億港元，下降至2018年底的11,362億港元（圖2）。年內，金管局按照聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）的設計，應銀行要求於弱方兌換保證匯率7.85的水平，購入合共1,035億港元，總結餘因而由2017年底的1,798億港元下降至2018年底的764億港元。年內未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額沒有明顯變動。貨幣基礎仍然由外匯儲備提供十足支持。\n\n於2018年底，總結餘與未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額為11,362億港元。\n\n圖2 2018年總結餘及未償還外匯基金票據及債券\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n由於觸發弱方兌換保證後銀行同業流動性減少，以及市場預期美國加息，香港銀行同業拆息在2018年內普遍上升。受新股集資活動相關的資金需求增加及季節性流動資金需求帶動，短期銀行同業拆息更出現較大波幅（圖3）。整體而言，短期銀行同業拆息在2018年大致維持在低於基本利率的水平。鑑於銀行體系資金成本上升，在9月下旬美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍上調後，銀行調高最優惠貸款利率12.5至25基點。\n\n因應年內美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍4次合共上調100基點，由1.25至1.50厘上調至2.25至2.50厘，基本利率於3月22日、6月14日、9月27日及12月20日合共上調100基點，由1.75厘上調至2.75厘。基本利率的調整是按照2009年3月26日宣布的經修訂計算公式作出。按照該公式，基本利率定於美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍下限加50基點的水平，或隔夜與1個月香港銀行同業拆息的5天移動平均數的平均值水平，以兩者中較高者為準。\n\n圖3 2018年香港銀行同業拆息\n\n港元遠期匯率折讓在首4個月擴大，大致跟隨港元與美元息差的走勢，其中12個月港元遠期匯率點子在4月中達到負620點子（圖4）。其後隨着港元與美元的負息差收窄，港元遠期匯率折讓略為縮小，然後在第4季再度擴大。整體而言，香港貨幣市場繼續正常運作。貼現窗借貸由2017年的103億港元增至2018年的402億港元。\n\n圖4 2018年美元兌港元遠期匯率點子\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n聯匯制度自1983年實施以來，直是維持香港貨幣及金融穩定的重要基石；並在多次區內以至全球金融危機考驗下，展現其承受強大衝擊的能力。由於港元轉弱，作為聯匯制度設計一部分的弱方兌換保證於4月、5月及8月被多次觸發。資金流出港元，是香港利率正常化的必經過程，亦是聯匯制度下的正常運作。為增進各界對有關操作及聯匯制度機制的了解，金管局致力向公眾闡釋聯匯制度的技術細節，並展示香港金融體系應對衝擊的能力。政府亦堅決維持聯匯制度。外匯及貨幣市場保持穩定，進一步鞏固公眾對政府的承擔，以及港元作為支付及保值貨幣的信心。國際貨幣基金組織在與香港進行2018年第四條磋商時，重申對聯匯制度的支持，並指出聯匯制度仍然是最適合香港的貨幣制度，是維持穩定的支柱，有助確保經濟持續增長、維持競爭力及促進龐大的金融服務業暢順運作。\n\n鑑於穩健的銀行體系對聯匯制度的正常運作具關鍵作用，金管局繼續密切監察銀行的信用、流動性及利率風險管理，以及壓力測試結果，並維持對銀行的企業、物業相關及內地相關貸款的監管，以確保銀行體系具備承受衝擊的能力。銀行持有大量外匯基金票據及債券，可經貼現窗用作換取港元流動資金，為利率大幅波動的情況提供有效緩衝。金管局隨時準備透過調整外匯基金票據及債券的發行量以提供額外流動性，以應對資金可能急劇流出港元的情況。金管局亦提醒市民審慎管理市場及利率風險，並為可能出現的市場波動作好準備。\n\n為提高貨幣發行局帳目的透明度，自1998年10月起，外匯基金已有部分資產被指定用作支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（即支持資產相對貨幣基礎的比率）於2018年在107.8至109.9%之間上落，並無觸及上限或下限。該比率於12月31日為109.9%（圖5）。在聯匯制度下，雖然已指定某些外匯基金資產作為支持組合，但外匯基金的全部資產均可用作支持港元匯率。外匯基金的龐大財政資源，能在面對突如其來的衝擊時為保障香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供強力後盾。\n\n圖5 2018年支持比率每日變動\n\n# 貨幣發行委員會\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的貨幣發行委員會（貨幣發行委員會）負責監察和探討與香港貨幣及金融穩定有關的課題。在2018年，貨幣發行委員會探討的課題包括多國央行聯合退出非常規貨幣政策對在香港的境外銀行美元貸款供應造成的潛在影響、港元貨幣需求的利率敏感度，以及聯匯制度自3項優化措施以來的運作機制及理論。貨幣發行委員會會議紀錄及金管局向其呈交的貨幣發行局制度運作報告，均載於金管局網站。\n\n# 研究\n\n香港金融研究中心（研究中心）繼續支持貨幣政策、銀行業及金融範疇的研究工作。過去4年，研究中心更着重政策方面的研究，從所舉辦的研討會及訪問學者計劃尤其可見一斑。一方面，研究中心與主要中央銀行及政策研究機構合作，聯合舉辦更多政策相關的研討會。另一方面，在2016年推出專題研究學者計劃，支持更多與金管局政策制定相關的研究項目。\n\n在2018年，研究中心合共邀請16位研究學者到訪，並發表了25份研究論文。年內研究中心亦舉辦了4場國際研討會：\n- 於1月舉行的「第9屆中國經濟年度國際研討會」，主題為「中國房地產市場及其對經濟與金融穩定的影響」。研討會由研究中心、國務院發展研究中心市場經濟研究所及中國人民銀行金融研究所合辦，集中討論內地房地產市場相關的課題及風險。\n- 於10月舉行由金管局及國際結算銀行合辦的「匯率與貨幣政策框架」研討會。研討會為國際結算銀行於香港的亞太區辦事處成立20周年的慶祝活動之一，旨在探討匯率在貨幣政策框架中的角色。\n- 於11月舉行的「2018年中央銀行金融市場微結構的年度研討會」。研討會討論金融市場微結構理論研究、實證研究結果及近期發展相關的政策影響。\n- 於11月舉行由金管局、歐洲中央銀行及美國聯邦儲備委員會合辦的「中國經濟的新時代」中國專家網絡研討會。研討會討論內地經濟正面對的迫切問題及其對全球經濟的影響，並特別着重與中央銀行決策者相關的政策議題。這是中國專家網絡研討會首次在歐洲以外地區舉行。\n", "en": "# Currency Stability\n\nIn 2018, interest rates for the Hong Kong dollar generally increased, while the on-shore exchange rate declined and approached the level of the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking rate. Nevertheless, the operations of the Hong Kong dollar foreign exchange and monetary markets remained smooth and orderly. The Linked Exchange Rate System is the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, continuing to demonstrate its resilience against substantial shocks.\n\n# Objectives\n\nHong Kong’s main monetary policy goal is to maintain currency stability, ensuring that the Hong Kong dollar’s exchange rate remains within the range of 7.75 to 7.85 Hong Kong dollars per US dollar in the foreign exchange market. The monetary system primarily employs a Currency Board arrangement, stipulating that the US dollar reserves held by the Exchange Fund support at least 100% of the monetary base; any changes in the monetary base must be matched by equivalent increases or decreases in US dollar reserves, maintaining a 100% parity.\n\nThe monetary base (Table 1) includes:\n- Certificate of indebtedness (fully backing banknotes issued by three note-issuing banks)\n- Circulating banknotes and coins issued by the government\n- Total balances held by banks in settlement accounts with the Monetary Authority (the total reserve)\n- Foreign reserves issued by the Exchange Fund on behalf of the government, in the form of certificates and bonds.\n\nThe Monetary Authority (MA) maintains exchange rate stability through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and a firm commitment to convertibility. If market demand for the Hong Kong dollar exceeds supply, pushing the market rate towards the strong-side Convertibility Undertaking rate of 7.75 HKD per USD, the MA will sell Hong Kong dollars and buy US dollars from banks, increasing total reserves and lowering Hong Kong dollar interest rates, thus bringing the exchange rate back into the 7.75-7.85 range. Conversely, if the Hong Kong dollar is in excess supply, causing the market rate to weaken toward the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking rate of 7.85 HKD per USD, the MA will buy Hong Kong dollars from banks, reducing reserves and raising the Hong Kong dollar interest rates, restoring the exchange rate within the specified range.\n\n# Review of 2018\n\n# Exchange Rate Stability\n\nAmid widening interest rate differentials between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar, driven by carry trade activities, the Hong Kong dollar gradually depreciated throughout the year. On April 12, the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking was triggered for the first time since 2005, when it was set at 7.85. Over the year, the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking was triggered a total of 27 times, with 13 triggers in April, 6 in May, and 8 in August. Despite this, trading remained smooth and orderly, with the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate hovering around 7.85 from mid-April to mid-September (see Chart 1). Afterwards, the Hong Kong dollar slightly appreciated, partly reflecting the approaching holidays, quarter-end, and year-end, which tightened banking sector liquidity and led to some positions being unwound. Additionally, the market sentiment improved in early November, supporting the Hong Kong dollar. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar foreign exchange market operated normally throughout 2018.\n\nFigure 1. Market Exchange Rate in 2018\n\nAs the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking was triggered, reserves and the total amount of outstanding foreign currency notes and bonds issued by the Exchange Fund decreased from HKD 1,226.8 billion at the end of 2017 to HKD 1,136.2 billion at the end of 2018 (see Chart 2). During the year, the MA purchased a total of HKD 103.5 billion from banks at the weak-side exchange rate of 7.85 HKD/USD, in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System. Reserves decreased from HKD 179.8 billion at the end of 2017 to HKD 76.4 billion at the end of 2018. The total amount of outstanding foreign currency notes and bonds remained relatively unchanged. The monetary base remained fully supported by foreign exchange reserves.\n\nBy the end of 2018, reserves and outstanding foreign currency notes and bonds totaled HKD 1,136.2 billion.\n\nFigure 2. Total Reserves and Outstanding Foreign Currency Notes and Bonds in 2018\n\n# Money Market\n\nFollowing the triggering of the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking and the reduction in banking sector liquidity, combined with market expectations of US interest rate hikes, interbank interest rates in Hong Kong generally rose during 2018. Increased funding needs related to equity fundraising and seasonal liquidity demands led to higher volatility in short-term interbank rates (see Chart 3). Overall, short-term interbank rates mostly remained below baseline rates. As funding costs in the banking system rose, and after the US Federal Reserve raised its target rate range in late September, banks increased their best lending rates by 12.5 to 25 basis points.\n\nIn response to four US Federal Reserve rate hikes totaling 100 basis points during the year (from 1.25–1.50% to 2.25–2.50%), the base rate was adjusted four times—on March 22, June 14, September 27, and December 20—by a total of 100 basis points, from 1.75% to 2.75%. These adjustments follow a formula announced on March 26, 2009, setting the base rate at the lower end of the US Federal Funds target range plus 50 basis points or the 5-day moving average of overnight and 1-month Hong Kong dollar interbank rates, whichever is higher.\n\nChart 3. Hong Kong Interbank Rates in 2018\n\nThe forward points discount of the Hong Kong dollar widened in the first four months of the year, roughly following the interest rate differential with the US dollar, with the 12-month forward points reaching -620 in April (see Chart 4). As the interest rate differential narrowed later in the year, the forward points discount decreased somewhat and widened again in the fourth quarter. Overall, the Hong Kong monetary market continued to operate normally. Discount window lending increased from HKD 10.3 billion in 2017 to HKD 40.2 billion in 2018.\n\nFigure 4. USD/HKD Forward Points in 2018\n\n# Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nSince its implementation in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System has been a crucial pillar supporting Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. It has withstood multiple regional and global financial crises. As the Hong Kong dollar depreciated, the system’s mechanism of the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking was repeatedly triggered in April, May, and August. Outflows of funds from the Hong Kong dollar are a normal part of monetary normalization and operations under the Linked Exchange Rate System. To improve public understanding of these operations and the system’s mechanics, the MA actively explains the technical details of the system and demonstrates Hong Kong’s capacity to respond to shocks. The government remains committed to maintaining the Linked Exchange Rate System. Foreign exchange and monetary markets stayed stable, further strengthening public confidence in the government’s commitment and the Hong Kong dollar’s role as a medium of exchange and store of value. During the Fund’s Article IV consultation with Hong Kong in 2018, the IMF reaffirmed its support for the Linked Exchange Rate System, emphasizing its status as the most suitable monetary framework for Hong Kong, serving as the linchpin for stability, supporting ongoing economic growth, maintaining competitiveness, and ensuring the smooth functioning of the large financial services sector.\n\nGiven the critical role of a sound banking system for the normal functioning of the Linked Exchange Rate System, the MA continues to closely monitor banks’ credit, liquidity, and interest rate risk management, as well as stress testing outcomes, and maintains oversight of banks’ property, enterprise, and mainland-related lending, to ensure the resilience of the banking sector. Banks hold substantial foreign reserves, which can be accessed via the discount window to smooth liquidity management during periods of interest rate volatility. The MA remains prepared to adjust the issuance of foreign reserves certificates and bonds to provide additional liquidity if rapid outflows of funds from the Hong Kong dollar occur. The MA also reminds the public to manage market and interest rate risks prudently and to prepare for potential market fluctuations.\n\nTo enhance transparency of the Currency Board account, since October 1998, some foreign exchange fund assets have been designated to support the monetary base. The support ratio (supporting assets relative to the monetary base) fluctuated between 107.8% and 109.9% throughout 2018, without reaching its upper or lower limits. On December 31, 2018, the ratio was 109.9% (see Chart 5). Under the Linked Exchange Rate System, although certain foreign reserves assets have been designated as supporting assets, all assets in the Foreign Exchange Reserve can be used to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. The large fiscal resources of the foreign exchange fund provide a strong cushion to safeguard Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability in the face of sudden shocks.\n\nFigure 5. Daily Support Ratio in 2018\n\n# Monetary Authority Currency Board Committee\n\nThe Currency Board Committee (CBC), operating under the Foreign Reserve Advisory Committee, is responsible for monitoring and discussing issues related to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. In 2018, topics discussed included the potential impact of multiple countries’ central banks exiting unconventional monetary policies on offshore USD loans in Hong Kong, the interest rate sensitivity of Hong Kong dollar monetary demand, and operational mechanisms and theories since the three major enhancements to the Linked Exchange Rate System. Minutes of CBC meetings and the monetary operations reports submitted to it are accessible on the MA’s website.\n\n# Research\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Research Centre (Research Centre) continued to support research in the fields of monetary policy, banking, and finance. Over the past four years, the Centre has increasingly focused on policy-oriented research, as evidenced by seminars and scholar visits. It collaborates with major central banks and policy research institutions to organize more policy-related seminars. In addition, launched in 2016, the specialized scholar program supports more research projects related to MA policy formulation.\n\nIn 2018, the Centre hosted a total of 16 visiting scholars and published 25 research papers. During the year, it also organized four international conferences:\n- The 9th Annual China Economic Conference in January, themed “China’s Real Estate Market and Its Impact on Economic and Financial Stability.” Co-organized by the Research Centre, the Development Research Center of the State Council’s Market Economy Research Institute, and the People’s Bank of China’s Financial Research Institute, focusing on real estate-related issues and risks in Mainland China.\n- A September conference on “Exchange Rate and Monetary Policy Framework,” co-hosted by the MA and the Bank for International Settlements. It celebrated the 20th anniversary of the BIS Asia Regional Office in Hong Kong, focusing on the role of exchange rates within monetary policy frameworks.\n- The 2018 Annual Seminar on Microstructure of Central Bank Financial Markets in November, discussing theoretical and empirical research on financial market microstructure and recent policy developments.\n- A November China experts’ webinar on “A New Era for China’s Economy,” co-hosted with the BIS and the US Federal Reserve.

The effectiveness of the liquidity and credit risk management frameworks of authorized institutions continued to be a key supervisory focus for the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) during the year. Given the ongoing rise in cyber threats and the broader use of financial technology in banking, the HKMA enhanced its supervision of technological risk management and business operational resilience for authorized institutions. In May, the HKMA issued a revised \"Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks\" and began processing applications for virtual bank authorization. Regarding conduct regulation, the HKMA took further measures to strengthen supervision of authorized institutions’ sales practices of investment and insurance products, promote accessible banking services for persons with disabilities, and foster a customer-centric corporate culture.\n\nAs financial crimes become more complex and globalized, the HKMA continues to leverage new technologies and a risk-based approach to strengthen Hong Kong’s capacity to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. Progress in implementing international regulatory standards in Hong Kong has been satisfactory, including standards on capital adequacy, disclosure, liquidity, and large exposure limits. Additionally, the HKMA has strengthened communication with the banking industry to ensure an appropriate balance between supervisory effectiveness and market development.\n\nMeanwhile, the HKMA remains committed to establishing a credible resolution framework for authorized institutions, including the introduction of rules on minimum loss-absorbing capacity, addressing a significant obstacle to the resolution of authorized institutions.\n\n# Goals\n\nOne of the HKMA's overarching objectives is to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this goal relies heavily on building and maintaining a resilient financial system capable of providing critical financial services essential for Hong Kong’s economic stability.\n\nBanks may impact financial stability due to their operational practices or, in extreme cases, by failing in an unorderly manner. As the regulatory authority, the HKMA plays a vital role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring banks are capable of resisting shocks, responding effectively to crises, and recovering swiftly, ultimately helping to prevent failures. The HKMA is responsible for prudential supervision of banks, including licensed banks, restricted license banks, and deposit-taking companies (collectively referred to as \"authorized institutions\"), as well as some designated financial market infrastructure.\n\nHowever, the HKMA cannot guarantee a risk-free financial system, nor is Hong Kong’s prudential supervision system designed for \"zero risk.\" As a resolution authority, the HKMA aims to ensure an orderly resolution process if an authorized institution can no longer sustainably operate. To this end, Hong Kong has established a resolution regime for financial institutions, under which the HKMA acts as the resolution authority for a number of entities, including authorized institutions. Developing a smooth and effective resolution framework in Hong Kong requires the formulation of resolution legislation and policy standards, planning to remove obstacles to resolution, and enhancing the HKMA’s operational capabilities to resolve failing authorized institutions. To execute these tasks effectively, the HKMA adopts internationally consistent and coordinated approaches.\n\n# Review of 2018\n\n# Overview of Supervisory Activities\n\nIn 2018, the HKMA conducted a total of 187 off-site reviews covering a wide range of areas including CAMEL ratings, corporate governance, business operations, and risk management of authorized institutions, as well as their strategies for coping with financial technological developments. To further enhance the risk governance of authorized institutions, the HKMA held 27 meetings with the boards or board sub-committees of authorized institutions and followed up on the implementation progress of corporate governance guidelines. Additionally, the HKMA held 28 tripartite meetings with authorized institutions and their external auditors.\n\nBesides off-site reviews, the HKMA continued regular on-site examinations and used thematic assessments to review higher-risk areas. Throughout the year, 392 on-site reviews and thematic assessments were performed, with a continued focus on credit risk management. Other key areas included cyber and operational risk management, as well as anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) measures. The HKMA also increased the number of on-site examinations and thematic assessments related to liquidity and market risk management, as well as the implementation of the Basel Capital Adequacy Framework. The Special Examination Team conducted on-site reviews of authorized institutions’ securities activities, investment products, insurance, and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) operations.\n\nTable 1 provides an overview of the HKMA’s supervisory activities in 2018.\n\n# Supervision of Credit Risk\n\n# Credit Growth and Asset Quality\n\nCredit growth slowed in 2018, with total loans increasing by 4.4%, compared to a 16.1% increase in 2017 (Table 2). Trade financing declined by 7.6% in 2018. The slowdown in loan growth was mainly due to heightened global economic and trade uncertainties, leading to reduced credit demand.\n\nTable 2 shows the growth of loans and advances.\n\nThe total mainland-related loans increased by 1.4% to HKD 4,249 billion at the end of 2018, lower than the growth rate in 2017 (Table 3).\n\nTable 3 shows the growth of mainland-related loans.\n\nThe asset quality of authorized institutions remained resilient in 2018. The specific loan ratio for retail banking decreased from 0.56% at the end of 2017 to 0.50% at the end of 2018, well below the long-term average since 2000 of 2.1%. During the same period, the overall banking sector’s specific loan ratio declined from 0.68% to 0.55%. For mainland-related loans, the retail banking specific loan ratio dropped from 0.75% to 0.63% in 2018, while the overall sector’s ratio decreased from 0.67% to 0.54%.\n\nThroughout the year, the HKMA strengthened supervision to ensure authorized institutions continued to adopt prudent credit risk management practices. Specifically, the HKMA proactively gained insights into the backgrounds and structures of large corporate borrowers, enhancing the supervisory regime for corporate credit risk. Furthermore, thematic assessments focused on key credit risk management controls, including approval standards and risk management of large corporate loans, loan classification and provisioning systems, credit risk governance structures, risk management for property developers’ loans, as well as loans secured by mortgages and insurance policies.\n\n# Mortgage Lending\n\nResidential property prices hit a historic high in July 2018 but showed signs of easing in the second half of the year. Since October 2009, the HKMA has introduced eight rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures, which have enhanced Hong Kong banks’ resilience against potential reversals in the local property market. The average loan-to-value ratio (LTV) for new residential mortgages decreased from 64% before the first countercyclical measure in September 2009 to 46% in December 2018. The average repayment-to-income ratio also declined from 41% at the maximum limit introduced in August 2010 to 34% in December 2018 (see Diagram 1).\n\nDiagram 1 shows the average LTV and repayment-to-income ratios of new residential mortgages.\n\n# Business Operations and Technology Risk Supervision\n\nThe banking industry continues to face high technology risks. In 2016, the HKMA launched the \"Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework.\" Phase 1 implementation covers 30 authorized institutions, including all major banks. These institutions have completed three stages of assessment: self-assessment of risk levels, maturity assessment, and, where applicable, cyber threat simulation exercises based on risk information. This evaluation helps authorized institutions identify operational gaps and implement remedial actions to strengthen cyber defenses. Meanwhile, the HKMA has outlined schedules for phases 2 and 3, which will cover the remaining authorized institutions. During the year, on-site examinations focused on cyber security controls, outsourcing arrangements, and IT governance.\n\n# Smart Banking\n\nThe HKMA continues to collaborate with the banking industry on seven initiatives announced in September 2017 to promote smart banking and foster fintech development in Hong Kong. In supervisory developments, the HKMA issued a revised \"Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks\" in May. Additionally, under the \"Banking Simplification\" measure, regulatory requirements for remote account opening, online lending, and online wealth management have been streamlined. These regulatory enhancements improve the online banking customer experience. In September, the scope of the \"Banking Simplification\" initiative was expanded to promote the adoption of RegTech, with three new focal points: AML and CTF monitoring technologies, RegTech for prudent risk management and compliance, and \"machine-readable\" regulatory requirements. \n\nHKMA Deputy Chief Executive Mr. Ng Ki-hung delivered a speech titled \"The New Era of Smart Banking and Financial Compliance Technologies\" at the Hong Kong Institute of Bankers’ 2018 Hong Kong Banking Summit.\n\n# Liquidity and Market Risk Supervision\n\nAs U.S. monetary policy continues normalization, the HKMA has strengthened liquidity risk supervision to ensure authorized institutions prudently and effectively manage their liquidity risks. During the year, the HKMA conducted a thematic review to assess the preparedness of authorized institutions for potential tightening of dollar liquidity and their internal liquidity stress testing capabilities. The HKMA also monitored compliance with the \"Net Stable Funding Ratio\" requirement that took effect in January 2018.\n\nIn addition to reviewing the market risk management of authorized institutions’ bond portfolios, the HKMA conducted thematic on-site reviews of compliance with the \"Global FX Code\" and standards for margin and risk mitigation of non-centrally cleared OTC derivatives, to assess institutional adherence to these international standards in their treasury activities.\n\n# Combating Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing\n\nThe government released the \"Hong Kong Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment Report\" in April, which identified high AML/CTF threats facing the Hong Kong banking system, reflecting the increasingly globalized and complex nature of financial services. The threats include not only local criminal activities but also external sources such as illicit proceeds from overseas corruption, scam activities by transnational criminal groups, tax evasion, and risks related to Hong Kong’s role as a payment and trading hub subject to sanctions. Under the HKMA’s support, the government issued a policy statement on AML/CTF efforts, outlining responses to these threats. Its aim is to strengthen the AML/CTF system while attracting and facilitating legitimate business activities.\n\nThe \"Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Amendment) Ordinance 2018,\" which took effect on March 1, introduced revisions including flexibility in customer due diligence procedures to support authorized institutions’ use of technology for customer onboarding. The amendments also broadened the scope to require lawyers, accountants, estate agents, and trust or corporate service providers to bear AML/CTF responsibilities, further strengthening the system. These amendments, together with updates to the Companies Ordinance aimed at increasing transparency of beneficial ownership, assist authorized institutions in fulfilling AML/CTF obligations.\n\nTo enhance communication with authorized institutions regarding AML/CTF policies and supervisory approaches, the HKMA issued a new section titled \"Methods of Supervision—AML/CTF\" within the \"Supervisory Policy Manual\" in October. A draft revised \"Guideline on AML/CTF for Authorized Institutions\" was also issued to better implement a risk-based approach and reduce obstacles for authorized institutions in adopting new technologies for AML/CTF efforts.\n\nInformation exchange plays an increasingly important role in AML/CTF efforts. Supported by the HKMA and the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB), the banking industry actively participates in the Anti-Fraud and Anti-Money Laundering Information Sharing Group, which has achieved tangible results. The review of this initiative’s pilot phase began at the end of 2018 and is expected to conclude in early 2019."}

Seven measures to promote the development and application of financial technology (fintech) in banking and payments industries have seen good progress this year, with the fastest success being the rapid payment system \"FPS\" launched successfully.\n\nOptimised measures for the connectivity plan between Mainland China and Hong Kong’s capital markets, as well as the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), have further reinforced Hong Kong’s unique position as a key gateway into Mainland China. Hong Kong’s status as a global offshore Renminbi (RMB) business hub has also become more solid, with vibrant RMB financial activities flourishing.\n\nMeanwhile, the HKMA is committed to exploring new opportunities to enhance Hong Kong's financial platform competitiveness, including infrastructure financing, corporate treasury centres, and green bond markets. The HKMA also enhances international and mainland stakeholder outreach, promoting Hong Kong’s advantages through market promotion initiatives. On the international stage, the HKMA plays a leading role in multiple regional and international committees, exemplifying Hong Kong’s professional expertise and responsibilities in relevant global work.\n\nOverview\n\nTo bolster Hong Kong’s status as an Asian fintech hub, the HKMA has implemented seven measures announced in September 2017, aimed at helping banks improve and seize the vast opportunities merging banking with technology. Key progress in implementing these measures and transforming Hong Kong's financial ecosystem this year includes:\n\n- Successful launch of FPS, connecting various banks and stored value facilities (“e-wallets”) seamlessly;\n- Release of the Open Application Programming Interface (API) framework for banks and promotion of industry adoption;\n- Enhancement of fintech research and talent training;\n- Strengthening cross-border fintech cooperation;\n- Revision of the “Guidelines on Virtual Banks” and processing virtual bank license applications;\n- Smooth operation of the upgraded Fintech Supervisory Sandbox (FSS 2.0);\n- Expansion of “Banking with Ease” to promote adoption of RegTech.\n\nThe HKMA’s Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO), together with various banking departments, plays an important role in driving the implementation of these measures.\n\nAs the connectivity measures between Mainland China and Hong Kong’s capital markets advance, Hong Kong’s unique role as a gateway into Mainland China is further solidified. “Bond Connect” has fully adopted real-time Delivery vs. Payment (DvP) settlement and the State Council announced tax exemptions for overseas investors investing in China’s domestic bond market, further enhancing efficiency and attractiveness. The HKMA works closely with mainland authorities to explore and implement numerous financial infrastructure measures that facilitate personal and corporate participation in the GBA. Hong Kong’s offshore RenminbiBusiness continues to flourish, with RMB deposits increasing by 6% year-on-year to HKD 657.7 billion; the RTGS system for RMB payments averages daily transactions valued at RMB 101.01 billion.\n\nThe HKMA actively explores new opportunities to further enhance Hong Kong’s financial platform competitiveness. To develop the bond market, the HKMA implements the “Bond Initiatives” as proposed in the Fiscal Budget, providing funding support for issuers debuting bonds in Hong Kong, and collaborates closely with the government to revise regulations, expanding the scope of taxable income under the “Qualifying Debt Instrument” scheme. The HKMA also boosts market promotion activities to showcase Hong Kong’s advantages to overseas and mainland stakeholders, including organising large-scale and thematic outreach activities to promote Hong Kong as a hub for green finance, infrastructure funding, and corporate treasury functions.\n\nOn the international front, the HKMA leads multiple regional and international committees. It currently chairs the Basel Committee’s Prudential Supervisory Framework and Implementation Standards Group, the Financial Market Working Group under the East Asia and Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP), as well as the Basel Committee’s Supervisory and Implementation Standards subcommittee.\n\nThe secure and efficient operation of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure provides a solid foundation for its status as an international financial centre. Four RTGS systems for interbank transactions, the Central Clearing System (CCS) for debt instruments, and the Hong Kong Trade Data Repository (HKTR) achieved 100% system availability in 2018, exceeding the target of 99.95%. The CCS, via accounts in two Mainland China central securities depositories, continues to facilitate bond connect northbound settlement and holds Mainland bonds for relevant CCS members.\n\nTo promote the overall safety and efficiency of retail payment services, the HKMA designated two additional retail payment systems under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (“Ordinance”) in August, bringing the total to six retail payment systems under regulation. The HKMA also regulates 16 stored value facility licensees, whose active promotion of new products and services offers customers more choices and better user experiences. Concurrently, electronic cheques, e-bills, and payment services are further expanded to include cross-border transactions between Hong Kong and the entire Guangdong Province.\n\n2018 Review\n\nHong Kong as Asia’s Fintech Hub\n\nMeasures to Promote Smart Banking\n\nIn September 2017, the HKMA announced seven measures to promote smart banking, aimed at elevating banks to higher levels and capturing the tremendous opportunities at the intersection of banking and technology. The HKMA made good progress within the year in implementing these measures and transforming Hong Kong’s financial ecosystem.\n\nFPS\n\nFPS was successfully launched in September, providing convenience for bank and e-wallet users to make instant cross-bank fund transfers in HKD and RMB anytime and anywhere by entering the recipient’s mobile number or email address. Twenty-one banks (including most retail banks) and ten e-wallet operators participated, offering instant payments and/or account linking services.\n\nIn just 3.5 months, FPS registered over two million user registrations, about 27% of Hong Kong’s population. Since launch, the system has processed over 4.8 million transactions, totaling over HKD 104.9 billion and RMB 2.75 billion.\n\nIn the same month, the HKMA also launched the HKQR – Hong Kong’s common retail QR code standard and associated mobile app, the “Hong Kong Common QR Code” (HKQR). It is the world’s first mobile app integrating multiple QR codes into a single comprehensive QR, allowing merchants—especially SMEs—to accept different payment schemes with a single QR code, eliminating the need to display multiple codes to customers.\n\nOpen API\n\nOpen APIs refer to sharing banking data with third-party service providers to enable more seamless integration of banking and other sector services. Users can enjoy comprehensive services securely through a single system. To promote banking industry R&D and provision of open APIs, the HKMA issued the Open API Framework in July, adopting a risk-based approach and phased implementation across four stages. As of end-January 2019, 20 banks had opened around 500 APIs in phase one, covering data for over 1,000 products and services.\n\nFintech Research and Talent Training\n\nBuilding on the proof-of-concept results of the HKMA-led Trade Finance Digitalisation initiative, an alliance of multiple Hong Kong banks launched the “TradeConnect” platform in October, based on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). The platform aims to reduce errors and fraud risks by digitising trade documents and automating trade finance workflows. By the end of 2018, 12 banks had joined as members. “TradeConnect” also signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Europe’s “we.trade” platform to connect the two platforms for joint proof-of-concept testing. The HKMA is also exploring opportunities to connect “TradeConnect” with other regions, including collaborating with the Monetary Authority of Singapore on a “Global Trade Connectivity Network.”\n\nAt the same time, to cultivate more fintech talents, the HKMA launched an upgraded “Fintech Talent Development Scheme” (FCAS 2.0) in January in partnership with the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute (ASTRI). FCAS 2.0 features four tracks suitable for young professionals at different stages of career development, benefitting more than 200 students.\n\nHKMA’s Chief Executive Mr. Norman Chan (left) attended the FCAS 2.0 launch ceremony along with Cyberport Chairman Dr. Selina Lo (left), Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute Chairman Mr. Tony Lambda (right), and Hong Kong Science Park CEO Mr. Albert Wong (right).\n\nCross-border Cooperation\n\nFollowing the 2017 Memorandum of Understanding with the Shenzhen Municipal People’s Government’s Financial Development Service Office (Shenzhen Financial Office), the HKMA continues to strengthen fintech collaboration with Shenzhen. This includes sponsoring the “Shenzhen Fintech Summer Internship Program,” allowing 50 students to undertake six-week internships at renowned firms in Shenzhen to experience the local fintech ecosystem. The HKMA also co-organised with the Shenzhen Financial Office the second “Shenzhen-Hong Kong Fintech Innovation Award.”\n\nMr. Louis Chan (right, second from right), HKMA Deputy Chief Executive, interacting with the first batch of Shenzhen Fintech Summer Interns.\n\nThe HKMA also signed fintech cooperation agreements in 2018 with the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA), the Polish Financial Supervision Authority (KNF), the Abu Dhabi International Financial Centre Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FRSA), and the Central Bank of Brazil, to facilitate fintech collaboration.\n\nIn August, the HKMA issued a joint announcement with 11 other financial regulators and related institutions launching the “Global Financial Innovation Network” (GFIN). The network aims to provide more effective channels for innovative firms to interact with regulators and promote cooperation among regulators on innovation-related topics.\n\nVirtual Banks\n\nThe introduction of virtual banks will inject new momentum into Hong Kong’s fintech development and provide groundbreaking digital banking experiences. Virtual banks target retail clients such as individuals and SMEs, thereby also helping promote financial inclusion. Following public consultation, the HKMA revised the “Guidelines on Virtual Banks” in May and received around 30 applications by late August.\n\nFintech Regulatory Sandbox\n\nUsage of the sandbox steadily increased over the year. To help build a fintech compliance ecosystem, the sandbox was opened to regtech projects starting September.\n\nBy the end of 2018, a total of 42 fintech or technology products had been approved for testing within the sandbox, with 28 having completed testing and launched into the market. The HKMA also received 220 cases via the “RegTech Supervisory Chatroom,” seeking regulatory feedback early in their development, with about 70% of those cases originating from tech companies."}
{"zh": "# 儲備管理\n\n2018年對投資者而言是困難的一年，投資環境備受多項風險因素困擾，包括美國利率持續正常化引發金融狀況收緊、主要經濟體之間的貿易摩擦升級，以及全球多處民粹主義抬頭及地緣政治風險加劇。環球股市普遍向下，美國國庫券收益率亦隨着美國聯邦儲備局4次加息而上升。在美息趨升下，美元轉強。部分新興市場面對國內嚴峻的政治及經濟壓力，其貨幣顯著下挫。儘管投資環境充滿挑戰，外匯基金在2018年仍錄得109億港元投資收入。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》，外匯基金的首要目的是直接或間接影響港元匯價，亦可運用於保持香港貨幣及金融體系穩定健全，藉此保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。金管局根據財政司司長轉授的權力及轉授權力的條款，就外匯基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標及組合架構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會為外匯基金制定下列投資目標：\n\n(a) 保障資本；\n(b) 確保整體貨幣基礎在任何時候都由流通性極高的美元資產提供十足支持；\n(c) 確保流動資金足以維持貨幣及金融穩定；以及\n(d) 在符合上述(a)至(c)項的前提下盡量爭取投資回報，以保障基金的長期購買力。\n\n以上目標全面顧及外匯基金的法定目的，並已於外匯基金的組合結構及目標資產配置中反映。\n\n外匯基金大致上分成兩個主要組合：支持組合及投資組合。支持組合持有流通性極高的美元資產，按照貨幣發行局制度的規定為貨幣基礎提供十足支持。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債市及股市，以保障資產的價值及長期購買力。\n\n為能更妥善管理風險及提高中長期回報，金管局以審慎及循序漸進方式將外匯基金的部分資產分散投資至較多元化的資產類別，包括新興巿場及內地債券與股票、私募股權（包括基建）及房地產。新興巿場及內地債券與股票由投資組合持有，私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合持有。長期增長組合的市值上限為外匯基金累計盈餘的三分之一及未來基金與外匯基金附屬公司存款中與長期增長組合掛鈎部分的總和。\n\n策略性資產組合於2007年設立，以持有政府基於策略性目的而為外匯基金帳目購入的香港交易及結算所有限公司股份。由於這個組合性質獨特，因此外匯基金的投資表現評估並無將其包括在內。\n\n# 於外匯基金的存款\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定組織的存款，利率一般與投資組合的表現掛鈎，但主要以未來基金除外。未來基金存款的利率與投資組合及長期增長組合的表現掛鈎，實際利率視乎組合比重而定。於2018年底，未來基金在投資組合與長期增長組合的比重約為50:50。\n\n# 投資程序\n\n外匯基金的投資程序分別以策略性資產配置及戰略性資產配置作基礎。策略性資產配置，即投資基準反映的配置情況，顯示外匯基金為達到投資目標而可作出的長線資產配置。外匯基金以策略性配置作為指引，對資產進行戰略性配置，以爭取超越基準的回報。因此，實際配置往往會與基準配置（亦即策略性配置）有所偏離，而實際與基準配置之間的差距稱為「戰略性偏離」。財政司司長經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後制定投資基準及循跡誤差限額，金管局獲授權決定戰略性資產配置及定出戰略性偏離的容許範圍。投資組合經理可在戰略性偏離的容許範圍內選持倉盤，從短期市場變化中獲利。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局於8月成立外匯基金投資辦公室，專責投資及相關風險管理職能。該辦公室職員負責直接管理外匯基金約72%的投資，包括整個支持組合及部分投資組合。該部分的投資組合投資於環球定息市場，並透過衍生工具執行外匯基金的宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 外聘投資經理\n\n除透過內部職員管理資產外，金管局亦僱用外聘投資經理負責管理外匯基金約28%的資產，包括所有上市股票組合及其他特別資產。僱用外聘投資經理的目的是要運用市場上最佳的專業投資技術為外匯基金投資，以取得可持續回報，並讓外匯基金受惠於多元化及互補的投資方式，以及汲取市場心得與專業投資技術知識。\n\n僱用外聘投資經理的相關支出包括基金管理與託管費、交易費、預扣稅及其他稅項。這些支出主要受市場因素影響而每年不同。\n\n# 風險管理及監察\n\n投資環境越趨複雜，突顯風險管理的重要。金管局為內部及外聘投資經理所管理的投資組合均訂立嚴格管控措施及投資指引，並密切監察對指引及法規的遵守情況。金管局已加強風險評估，以配合外匯基金越趨多元化的投資；另採用風險管控工具來評估在正常及極度不利市況下的市場風險。金管局亦進行詳細的投資表現因素分析，以識別促成不同表現的成因，藉此評估如何充分利用內部及外聘投資經理的投資管理技術。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n金管局支持負責任投資。例如，金管局已採納證券及期貨事務監察委員會公布的《負責任的擁有權原則》。該套原則旨在協助投資者釐定如何以最佳方法履行其於香港上市公司投資的擁有權責任。就外匯基金的管理而言，金管局已就環境、社會及管治因素制定內部指引，適用於外聘基金經理的甄選、委任及監察程序。獲委任負責主動式管理香港股票組合的外聘基金經理，須在管理有關投資時遵守《負責任的擁有權原則》。整體而言，金管局已將環境、社會及管治因素納入投資及相關監察活動的內部程序。金管局會密切注視環境、社會及管治因素的相關標準的發展，並評估如何能夠將這些標準進一步融入投資程序。此外，為促進負責任投資的國際合作，金管局已成為非牟利組織FCLTGlobal的成員，該組織旨在推動長遠目標為本的業務及投資決定。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2018年的金融市場\n\n在2018年，原先被市場低估的多項風險因素一一浮現，包括美國利率正常化的步伐、美國政府外貿政策和保護主義對全球貿易的衝擊，以及地緣政治的風險，環球金融市場因而出現大幅波動及調整。\n\n中美貿易爭議升級，令投資者非常憂慮，新興市場及香港股市自1月底開始反覆下跌，恒生指數自該月份的高位最多下跌27%。自第4季起，主要歐美股市亦大幅下滑，錄得雙位數字跌幅。就2018年整體而言，全球股市普遍下跌，涵蓋已發展國家股市的MSCI全球指數下跌10.4%，MSCI新興市場指數亦下跌16.6%。\n\n債市方面，由於美國貨幣政策正常化，美國國庫券收益率於2018年大致向上。然而，年內債市仍有波動。例如10年期美國國庫券收益率由年初約2.5%上升至11月3.2%的7年新高，但至年底時受投資者憂慮中美貿易爭議及趨向避險投資所影響而回軟至2.7%。\n\n貨幣市場方面，年內美元跟隨美國加息轉強。美匯指數上升4.4%，歐元及人民幣等主要貨幣兌美元下跌約5%。此外，部分新興市場受到國內政局及經濟不穩影響，其貨幣進一步受挫。例如，阿根廷披索及土耳其里拉兌美元分別下跌約五成及三成。相比之下，避險投資需求帶動日圓兌美元上升2.7%。\n\n表1列載主要貨幣、債巿及股市在2018年的表現。\n\n表1 2018年市場回報\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n外匯基金在2018年錄得109億港元投資收入，當中包括債券投資收益574億港元、香港股票投資虧損207億港元、其他股票投資虧損387億港元、非港元資產外匯估值下調90億港元，以及外匯基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資收益219億港元。另一方面，策略性資產組合錄得5億港元估值下調。\n\n於2018年年底，外匯基金的資產總值達40,549億港元。長期增長組合投資的總市值為2,836億港元，當中私募股權為1,911億港元，房地產為925億港元。已承擔但尚未提取作投資的總額為2,024億港元。\n\n外匯基金（不包括策略性資產組合）在2018年的投資回報率為0.3%，其中投資組合的回報率為負2.4%，支持組合為2.1%。長期增長組合自2009年開展投資以來的內部回報率年率為12.9%。\n\n圖1列明外匯基金由1994至2018年的年度回報率。表2顯示外匯基金在2018年的投資回報率及不同年期的平均投資回報率。外匯基金在過去3年的平均回報率為3.2%、過去5年為2.1%、過去10年為2.8%，以及自1994年起計為4.7%3。表3列載外匯基金資產於2018年12月31日的貨幣比重。\n", "en": "2018 was a difficult year for investors, as the investment environment was troubled by multiple risk factors, including the sustained normalization of US interest rates leading to tightening financial conditions, escalating trade disputes among major economies, and rising populism and geopolitical risks worldwide. Global stock markets generally declined, and US Treasury yields rose following four rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. The US dollar strengthened as US interest rates increased. Some emerging markets faced severe domestic political and economic pressures, leading to significant currency devaluations. Despite these challenging conditions, the Foreign Exchange Fund recorded investment income of HKD 10.9 billion in 2018.\n\nAccording to the Hong Kong Exchange Fund Ordinance, the primary purpose of the Exchange Fund is to directly or indirectly influence the HK dollar exchange rate and to maintain the stability and soundness of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems, thereby supporting Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is responsible for the management and investment of the Fund under delegated powers from the Financial Secretary.\n\nManagement of the Exchange Fund involves setting investment objectives and portfolio structure. The Exchange Fund Advisory Committee establishes the following investment goals:\n(a) Capital preservation;\n(b) Ensuring the overall monetary base is fully supported at all times by highly liquid US dollar assets;\n(c) Maintaining sufficient liquidity to sustain monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) Achieving investment returns within the framework of (a) to (c) to safeguard the long-term purchasing power of the Fund.\n\nThese objectives fully reflect the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund and are incorporated into its portfolio structure and target asset allocation.\n\nThe Fund is broadly divided into two main portfolios: the support portfolio and the investment portfolio. The support portfolio holds highly liquid US dollar assets, providing full support for the monetary base in accordance with the currency issuance system. The investment portfolio mainly invests in bonds and equities of OECD member countries to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of the assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance medium- to long-term returns, the HKMA has prudently and gradually diversified part of the Fund’s assets into a wider range of asset classes, including emerging markets, Mainland Chinese bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate. Exposure to emerging markets and Mainland bonds and equities is held within the investment portfolio, while private equity and real estate investments are held within the long-term growth portfolio. The long-term growth portfolio’s market value cap is set at one-third of the cumulative surplus of the Fund and the total of deposits attributed to the Fund’s subsidiaries linked to the long-term growth portfolio.\n\nThe strategic asset portfolio was established in 2007 to hold shares of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited bought for strategic purposes. Due to its unique nature, the performance of this portfolio is excluded from the overall investment performance evaluation of the Fund.\n\nThe Fund also accepts deposits from the Financial Reserve, Government Funds, and statutory bodies. The interest rates on these deposits are generally linked to the performance of the investment portfolios, except for the Future Fund deposits. The interest rate on Future Fund deposits is linked to the performance of the investment and long-term growth portfolios, with actual rates depending on respective proportions. At the end of 2018, the Future Fund’s deposits were approximately 50:50 in the investment and long-term growth portfolios.\n\nInvestment procedures are based on strategic and tactical asset allocation. Strategic asset allocation reflects the long-term target allocation to meet investment objectives, serving as a benchmark. The Fund adopts a tactical approach to asset allocation to seek returns above the benchmark, leading to deviations from the benchmark known as “strategic deviations.” After consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, the Financial Secretary sets the investment benchmarks and allowable tracking error limits. The HKMA is authorized to determine strategic asset allocation and establish permissible ranges for strategic deviations. Portfolio managers can take advantage of short-term market movements within these ranges.\n\nInvestment management comprises direct investments and external managers. The HKMA’s Offshore Investment Office, established in August, is responsible for direct investment and risk management, overseeing about 72% of the Fund’s investments, including the entire support portfolio and part of the investment portfolio. This segment invests in global fixed income markets and employs derivatives for macro risk management.\n\nAdditionally, external investment managers are hired to manage approximately 28% of the assets, including all listed equities and other specialized assets. The purpose is to leverage market expertise to achieve sustainable returns, benefit from diversified and complementary investment strategies, and incorporate market insights and professional investment techniques.\n\nExpenses related to external managers include management and custodial fees, trading costs, withholding taxes, and other taxes, which vary annually depending on market conditions.\n\nRisk management and monitoring are increasingly important amid a complex investment environment. The HKMA enforces strict controls and guidelines on both internal and external-managed portfolios, with close monitoring of compliance. Enhanced risk assessments are conducted to adapt to the Fund’s growing diversification; risk control tools evaluate market risks under normal and adverse conditions. Detailed performance analyses identify factors influencing returns, facilitating the optimal use of internal and external management capabilities.\n\nThe HKMA advocates responsible investment. For example, it has adopted the Principles for Responsible Ownership issued by the Securities and Futures Commission. These principles help investors determine the best way to discharge ownership responsibilities when investing in Hong Kong-listed companies. Regarding the Fund’s management, internal guidelines on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors have been established, applicable to the selection, appointment, and supervision of external managers. External managers responsible for active management of Hong Kong equities are required to adhere to these Principles. Overall, ESG considerations are integrated into the Fund’s investment and monitoring processes. The HKMA keeps abreast of developments in ESG standards and assesses ways to further incorporate them. To promote international cooperation on responsible investment, the HKMA is a member of FCLTGlobal, a non-profit organization dedicated to long-term, value-driven business and investment decisions.\n\nThe performance of the Exchange Fund in 2018 saw a net investment income of HKD 10.9 billion, comprising bond investment income of HKD 57.4 billion, Hong Kong equity investment loss of HKD 20.7 billion, other equity investment loss of HKD 38.7 billion, valuation decreases of non-HKD assets valued in foreign currency of HKD 9 billion, and other income from investments held by subsidiaries of the Fund of HKD 21.9 billion. The strategic asset portfolio experienced a valuation decrease of HKD 0.5 billion.\n\nBy the end of 2018, the total assets of the Fund reached HKD 4,054.9 billion. The total market value of the long-term growth investments was HKD 283.6 billion, including private equity valued at HKD 191.1 billion and real estate at HKD 92.5 billion. The total amount committed but not yet drawn down for investment was HKD 202.4 billion.\n\nThe Fund (excluding the strategic asset portfolio) had a return of 0.3% in 2018, with the investment portfolio returning -2.4%, and the support portfolio returning 2.1%. The internal rate of return of the long-term growth portfolio since investments began in 2009 has been 12.9% annually.\n\nFigure 1 shows the annual returns of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2018. Table 2 presents the 2018 investment returns and average returns over different periods. The average return over the past three years is 3.2%, over five years 2.1%, over ten years 2.8%, and since 1994, 4.7%. Table 3 lists the currency composition of the Fund’s assets as of December 31, 2018."}

During the year, the HKMA continued to strengthen corporate governance, including supporting staff in enhancing their professional capabilities, strictly controlling finances, and strengthening information technology security to address challenges brought by the implementation of new measures and increasing workload.\n\n# Connecting with the Public\n\n# Media Relations and Social Media\n\nThe HKMA maintains close ties with the media to improve transparency and deepen public understanding of its policies and work. In 2018, the HKMA organized a total of 96 public media events, including 21 press conferences, 11 on-site interviews, and 64 other public activities. Additionally, 39 media interviews were arranged during the year, and 462 bilingual press releases were issued. The media also submitted a large number of inquiries daily.\n\nTo enhance societal awareness of the HKMA’s main functions, the HKMA held media briefings and workshops for local and overseas media, covering topics such as the Linked Exchange Rate system, financial technology development, green finance, and infrastructure financing. Besides enriching content on its YouTube channel and LinkedIn page, the HKMA launched an official Facebook page in July to further utilize social media for better communication with the public.\n\nThe HKMA's Chief Executive, Mr. Norman Chan (left), collaborated with the Environment Bureau’s mascot, “Big Trash Ghost,” on social media to promote the use of “Welcome New Banknotes” red envelopes.\n\n# Public Inquiries\n\nPublic inquiry services are an effective way to increase the public’s understanding of the HKMA’s main functions and operations. In 2018, a total of 9,950 inquiries were handled, about half of which related to banking policies and regulations, banking consumer matters, and currency coins, particularly the coin collection program, banking products and services, banking-related guidelines and notices, the Faster Payment System (“FPS”), virtual banks, and the 2018 Hong Kong new banknote series.\n\nFigure 1 shows the total number of public inquiries received each year since 2015, and Figure 2 lists the proportions of different types of inquiries in 2018.\n\nFigure 1 Total Number of Public Inquiries\n\nFigure 2 Distribution of Inquiries by Type in 2018\n\n# Publications\n\nIn addition to the HKMA’s Annual Report, in 2018 the HKMA published two issues of the “Mid-year Monetary and Financial Stability Review” and four issues of the Quarterly Bulletin. The HKMA also regularly updates data in the “Financial Data Monthly,” providing the latest and focused information and analysis on Hong Kong’s monetary, banking, and economic matters. Furthermore, the HKMA issued 13 articles in its \"Hindsight\" series, explaining various topics related to its work.\n\n# HKMA Website\n\nThe HKMA’s institutional website (www.hkma.gov.hk) provides over 60,000 pages of information in both English and traditional Chinese, making it easy for the public to access the latest information about the HKMA. The website also features records of “Recognized Institutions and Local Representative Offices” filed under Section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, and “Records of Securities Staff of Recognized Institutions,” as well as records of “Licensed Stored Value Facility Providers” filed under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facility Ordinance. The website includes dedicated thematic pages and prominent quick links to alert the public to new measures such as “FPS” and important timely topics like phone scam prevention and the coin collection program’s parking locations.\n\nTo promote the implementation of open APIs in banking, the HKMA introduced open APIs on its website in July, facilitating public access to key information. The initial release included 50 datasets in API format, covering popular topics such as banking system and Exchange Fund statistics, press releases, and the cash vehicle schedule. The remaining 80 datasets are scheduled to be rolled out gradually by mid-2019. To further enhance public access to the latest news and information about the HKMA, the website is undergoing a comprehensive redesign to improve usability and content clarity, with the new site expected to launch within 2019.\n\nThe HKMA actively promotes the development and application of open APIs.\n\n# Public Education Program\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre, located on the 55th floor of the International Finance Centre 2, introduces the HKMA’s work and increases public understanding of monetary and banking affairs. The Centre consists of an exhibition hall and a library, both open six days a week. The exhibition hall covers the HKMA’s functions as well as the development of Hong Kong’s currency and banking sector; it also offers reading materials and exhibits for research on Hong Kong’s monetary system, banking, and finance.\n\nThe currency exhibition area within the Centre showcases the design, anti-counterfeiting features, production process, and interesting facts about Hong Kong banknotes and coins. Renovation work commenced in the first quarter of 2018, adding interactive elements such as educational games that make learning fun for visitors. A newly added artful camellia tree, made of 2,018 discarded and shredded banknotes encased in transparent cubes, is displayed alongside a mosaic made of Hong Kong coins, creating an engaging visual. The renovated currency exhibition was reopened on August 16.\n\nThe Centre offers guided tours. During the year, it welcomed over 59,000 visitors and provided more than 580 guided tours for schools and groups (see Figure 3). Since its opening in December 2003, the Centre has served over 705,000 visitors. The library adjacent to the exhibition hall stocks over 26,000 books, journals, and other publications for research on Hong Kong’s monetary system, banking, finance, and central banking. It also maintains the “Records of Recognized Institutions and Local Representative Offices” and “Records of Securities Staff of Recognized Institutions” as required by Section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nInteractive games illustrating the process of banknote production.\n\nThe camellia tree, suspended in midair, features lighting effects that reflect its changing appearance through different seasons.\n\nThe Centre provides guided tours for schools and groups.\n\nStudents and teachers from various districts attend public education talks.\n\nTo maintain community ties and increase awareness of the HKMA’s work, in 2018 the HKMA organized three public education lectures, attracting about 1,500 students and teachers. Topics covered include the linked exchange rate system, Hong Kong banknotes, banking stability, deposit protection scheme, FPS, stored value facilities, financial technology, consumer protection, and employment opportunities in the financial sector. Since its inception in 1998, nearly 60,000 teachers and students have participated.\n\nFigure 3 Types of groups visiting the HKMA Information Centre in 2018\n\n# HKMA Staff\n\nThe HKMA is part of the government structure but hires staff under non-civil service terms, attracting individuals with relevant experience and expertise. As a public-sector entity, the HKMA continually streamlines workflows, improves efficiency and cost-effectiveness. It aims to maintain a lean and flexible organizational structure and deploy existing staff as much as possible to implement new measures and cope with increasing workload.\n\nThe HKMA is committed to being an equal employment opportunity employer, ensuring staff can work in an environment free from discrimination. Its equal opportunity policies apply to hiring, remuneration and benefits, performance appraisal, promotion, transfer/training opportunities, and general conduct.\n\nThe HKMA endeavors to employ, train, and retain a professional, highly competent workforce capable of fulfilling policy objectives and adapting flexibly to changing operational demands. It requires employees to uphold high standards of conduct and ethics at all times, adhere strictly to personal and professional integrity norms, and act in the best interests of the HKMA.\n\n# Main Human Resources Data as of January 1, 2019\n\n# Organizational Changes in 2018\n\nThe Foreign Reserves Investment Office was established on August 1, replacing the previous responsibilities of the Reserve Management Department and the Risk Management and Monitoring Department for investment and related risk management functions. The establishment of this office highlights the HKMA’s investment role, enhances its institutional image, and allows more flexibility in responding to market changes to support the ongoing expansion and diversification of foreign reserves investments.\n\nTable 1 lists the HKMA’s position structure and actual staff numbers by department as of January 1, 2019.\n\nTable 1 HKMA Position Structure and Actual Staff Numbers as of January 1, 2019\n\nEmployees responsible for monitoring investment risks are part of the Foreign Reserves Investment Office organizational structure, summarized here under the Risk Management and Monitoring Department for ease of presentation.\n\n# Compensation Policy and Salary Review Mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary, via the Foreign Reserves Consultative Committee, considers the views of the governing committee under its jurisdiction and refers to market salary levels and practices when determining the HKMA’s staff remuneration and terms of service. The compensation package includes cash salary and MPF contributions, along with basic benefits. Cash remuneration comprises a fixed monthly salary (the basic salary) and an annual performance-based variable component paid once a year.\n\nWhen reviewing HKMA staff pay annually, the Financial Secretary consults the governing committee under its jurisdiction through the Foreign Reserves Consultative Committee and considers the governing committee’s performance assessment of the HKMA over the past year, results of salary surveys conducted by independent HR consultants, and other relevant factors. High-performing employees may receive special salary adjustments to maintain competitive remuneration.\n\nBased on individual performance, the HKMA allocates funds approved for fixed salary adjustments and variable pay increases; the variable component for investment-responsible staff aims to link performance with remuneration. Adjustments to fixed salaries and the issuance of variable pay for senior staff (Assistant General Manager and above) are approved by the Financial Secretary, after consulting the governing committee, with relevant employees abstaining during discussions on their own remuneration proposals. Fixed salary adjustments and variable pay for managerial and subordinate staff are determined by the HKMA’s Chief Executive under delegated authority from the Financial Secretary, based on the total approved amount designated for remuneration payments.\n\n# Senior Executive Compensation\n\nTable 2 lists the salary information for senior executives in 2018.\n\n1. Except for accrued annual leave, employees with less than one year of service are calculated as if they completed a full year for the purposes of average salary calculations for their grade.\n2. The reported employee numbers include those with less than one year of service. Senior management positions include the President of Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation Limited, a Disposal Mechanism Officer, and the Chief Operating Officer of the Foreign Reserves Investment Office.\n3.

My responsibilities under those standards are described in the “Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements” section of this report. I am independent of the Group in accordance with the HKICPA’s Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, and I have fulfilled other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these standards. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements of the year ended December 31, 2018. I handle these matters in forming my overall audit opinion, but I do not express a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Valuation of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities at Fair Value\n\nPlease refer to notes 2.5, 2.6, and 40.1 to the financial statements.\n\nAs at December 31, 2018, the Group’s financial assets at fair value amounted to HKD 3,693.589 billion, and financial liabilities at fair value amounted to HKD 1,133.829 billion.\n\n93% of these financial assets and all of these financial liabilities are measured based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 inputs), or are estimated using valuation techniques that incorporate observable market data (Level 2 inputs).\n\nThe remaining 7% of financial assets’ fair value are estimated using valuation techniques that rely on inputs not observable in the market (Level 3 inputs). These chiefly include HKD 275.631 billion of unlisted investments, primarily non-listed investment funds.\n\nConsidering the large sum involved and the estimation process, the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value is a key audit matter.\n\nAudit procedures for the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value include:\n\n- Understanding the valuation processes for different categories of financial assets and liabilities, including relevant controls;\n- Evaluating and testing the controls, including computer system-based controls;\n- Confirming the existence, rights and obligations, valuation, and completeness of financial assets and liabilities through direct communication with the entities involved;\n- Verifying prices obtained from independent sources if market quotes are used;\n- If valuation techniques incorporate observable market data, assessing whether the valuation models are appropriate and the assumptions reasonable, and verifying the parameters from independent sources; and\n- If valuation techniques rely on unobservable inputs, assessing the appropriateness of the valuation models and the reasonableness of the assumptions and parameters involved.\n\n# Valuation of Investment Properties at Fair Value\n\nPlease refer to notes 2.12, 20, and 21 to the financial statements.\n\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Group’s investment properties at fair value were valued at HKD 25.321 billion. The Group also holds interests in three associates and twenty joint ventures, primarily involved in holding overseas investment properties, with interests totaling HKD 44.336 billion. Whether held directly by the Group or through associates or joint ventures, the fair value of these investment properties is mainly determined based on valuations provided by independent professional valuers. These valuations involve significant judgment and estimates, including the valuation methods and assumptions used.\n\nAudit procedures for the valuation of investment properties at fair value include:\n\n- Obtaining and reviewing valuation reports for properties directly held by the Group or through associates or joint ventures, and verifying that the fair values are derived based on the relevant valuation reports;\n- Evaluating the independence and qualifications of the valuers; and\n- Assessing whether the valuation methods are appropriate, and whether the assumptions and parameters involved are reasonable.\n\n# Other Information\n\nThe Financial Secretary is responsible for other information. Other information includes all information contained in the 2018 annual report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, excluding the financial statements and my auditor’s report.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover other information, and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion on it.\n\nFor the purpose of the audit of the financial statements, I read the other information to consider whether there is any material inconsistency with the financial statements or with the knowledge I have obtained during my audit, or whether it appears to contain material misstatements. Based on the work I have performed, if I conclude that there is a material misstatement, I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Financial Secretary and the Audit Committee of the Exchange Fund for the Financial Statements\n\nThe Financial Secretary is responsible for preparing the financial statements, which give a true and fair view in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the HKICPA and the instructions issued by the Governor under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for implementing internal controls that the Financial Secretary determines to be necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Financial Secretary is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to do so, and using the going concern basis of accounting unless there is a material uncertainty.\n\nThe Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\n\nMy objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Hong Kong Standards on Auditing will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. A misstatement is considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, it could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.\n\nDuring an audit conducted in accordance with the Hong Kong Standards on Auditing, I will exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. I will:\n\n- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements due to fraud or error; design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks; and obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence to draw reasonable conclusions. Because fraud may involve collusion, falsification, deliberate omissions, false representations, or circumventing internal controls, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than for error;\n- Understand internal controls relevant to the audit in order to design appropriate procedures. However, I do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls;\n- Evaluate whether the accounting policies adopted by the Financial Secretary are appropriate, and whether the accounting estimates and related disclosures are reasonable;\n- Conclude whether there is a material uncertainty related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, based on the audit evidence obtained. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I will draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements. If the disclosures are inadequate, I will issue a modified auditor’s report. My conclusions are based on audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. Future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure, and content of the financial statements, including disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events fairly;\n- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for directing, supervising, and performing the Group audit, and I bear all responsibility for my audit opinion.\n\nI will communicate with the Audit Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding the planned scope and timing of the audit, as well as significant audit findings, including any significant internal control deficiencies identified during the audit.\n\nI will also provide the Audit Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have met the relevant ethical requirements relating to independence, and I will communicate to them all relationships and other matters that, in my professional judgment, may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, as well as any safeguards applied.\n\nFrom the communication with the Audit Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I will determine which matters are most significant to the current period’s financial statement audit and therefore constitute key audit matters. I will describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation prohibits public disclosure of specific matters or in extreme cases, when I decide that communicating such matters could cause negative consequences that outweigh public interest in disclosure.\n\nIssued by\nThe Director of Audit\nZhū Nǎi Zhāng\n\nApril 4, 2019"}

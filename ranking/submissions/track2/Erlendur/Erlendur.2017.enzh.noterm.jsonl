{"en": "# Chief Executive’s Statement\n\nIn 2017, the global economy and financial markets performed much better than expected: the real economy saw steady growth; inflation remained subdued; the three interest rate hikes and the reduction in the balance sheet by the US Federal Reserve during the year did not result in capital outflows from emerging market economies or a strengthening of the US dollar. Amid bullish sentiment, global stock markets, including the three major US stock indices, kept hitting new highs. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index surged by 34%. The Hang Seng Index gained nearly 8,000 points (or 36%) in 2017 and surpassed the 30,000-point level to reach an all-time high in January 2018.\n\nMany investors were filled with optimism, even exuberance, in such a favourable environment. However, this was until early February this year when the latest data showed a higher than expected wage increase in the US, prompting investors to reappraise inflation risks and triggering significant corrections to global stock markets. The Dow Jones Index fell more than 1,000 points in two days during the second week of February, and the Hang Seng Index dropped more than 3,000 points in the same week. The 10-year US Treasury yield surged to as high as 2.95%. The swift reversal of fund flows indicated that the record high market valuation was not built on a solid foundation. It also reminded us of the importance of a sound and robust financial system for Hong Kong to meet the challenges brought by asset market volatility and capital outflows.\n\n# Banking system resilience boosted by precautionary measures\n\nAs the saying goes, “prevention is better than cure”. The HKMA implemented further risk mitigation measures in 2017 to safeguard the stability of Hong Kong’s banking and financial systems. In May, we introduced the eighth round of countercyclical measures for banks’ mortgage loans and strengthened banks’ credit risk management on lending to property developers, with the aim of enhancing the banking system’s resilience to shocks arising from any downturn in the property market. With the several rounds of measures, the average loan-to-value ratio of new residential mortgage loans fell to 49% at the end of 2017 from 64% in September 2009, while the average debt servicing ratio also declined to 35% from 41% in August 2010.\n\nIn 2017, we established the Resolution Office to implement international standards on the resolution of non-viable financial institutions that are considered “too big to fail”. This will help prevent a recurrence of a global financial crisis similar to the one in 2008 where public money was used to save failing financial institutions, and will minimise the impact of their closures on the financial system, the economy and the community at large.\n\nRobust risk management is the cornerstone of steady and sustainable development of the banking sector. The liquidity ratio and capital adequacy ratio of Hong Kong’s banking system are well above the applicable statutory requirements and among the highest in the world. This undoubtedly reflects the high resilience of Hong Kong’s banking system. Indeed, the banking sector registered strong growth in 2017, with total loans increasing by 16%, while the asset quality also held up well. The classified loan ratio of retail banks fell to 0.54% from 0.72% in 2016, well below the long-term average of 2.2% since 2000. The banking industry’s overall return on equity (based on pre-tax operating profits) reached 11.74% in 2017, a very healthy level compared with other international financial centres.\n\n# Sound banking the key to long-term financial stability\n\nThe 2008 global financial crisis revealed the limitations of relying solely on rules and regulations to restrain the financial industry from pursuing profitability without regard to their primary responsibilities. In light of this, the HKMA has stepped up the promotion of “sound banking” practices in recent years, encouraging banks to develop and pursue good corporate culture and values. In particular, to address the issue of bank staff pursuing short-term profits at the expense of the long-term interests of their customers or banks, we are encouraging banks to put in place appropriate incentive systems that are in line with their corporate culture and values. As part of this campaign, we arranged the inaugural Annual Conference for Independent Non-Executive Directors (INEDs) in March 2017 to highlight the importance of establishing a good banking culture and to empower the INEDs to perform their oversight and monitoring roles more effectively.\n\nWith the support of the banking industry, 2017 was a successful year for the HKMA in the advancement of financial inclusion. Six physical bank branches and three mobile branches began operating in remote areas. The Hong Kong Association of Banks worked out an arrangement with EPS and a convenience store chain to launch a pilot scheme allowing the elderly to withdraw cash from the stores in remote areas without the need to make purchases. Hongkong Post is also launching this year a cash withdrawal service for the elderly at seven Post Offices mainly on outlying islands and in the New Territories. Regarding account opening, the HKMA last year set up a webpage and an email account with a dedicated team to follow up public enquiries or complaints relating to the opening of bank accounts. Thanks to the concerted efforts of various stakeholders, there has been a significant improvement in customer experience in opening individual and corporate bank accounts.\n\n# Fintech a game changer for the banking industry\n\nIn an era of rapid technological advancement, fintech has been gradually integrated into our daily lives. In this ever changing technological environment, banks must embrace new developments and pursue innovation in their application of fintech. With the new era of Smart Banking, the HKMA launched seven initiatives in September (see page 106 for details) promoting the adoption of fintech in banking to improve the quality of banking products and services for customers. While these initiatives are independent of one another, they are complementary and will be a game changer for the future landscape of payment and banking services in Hong Kong. Customers will not only enjoy more convenient, efficient and secure payment and banking services, they will also have more choices and greater control over their financial transactions. Fintech will be the key to banks’ future business success, and moving into the new era of Smart Banking will be a great opportunity for the banks to upgrade and transform themselves.\n\n# Enormous opportunities created by the Belt and Road and the Bay Area Initiatives\n\nWith competition among international financial centres becoming more intense, a diversified financial industry is of paramount importance to Hong Kong. In 2017, the HKMA stepped up its work on enhancing Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre. Given Hong Kong’s unparalleled advantage of “having the Mainland as our hinterland while maintaining an international outlook”, the Belt and Road Initiative and the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Bay Area (Bay Area) will offer enormous opportunities for the financial and banking sectors and give new impetus to the economic growth of Hong Kong. The HKMA Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office, which was established in response to the Belt and Road Initiative, saw the number of its partners grow to around 90 since launch, laying a solid foundation for promoting Hong Kong as a financing hub for infrastructure investments. The issuance of the first Belt and Road bond in Hong Kong by the China Development Bank in 2017 highlighted the pivotal role Hong Kong can play in facilitating the financing of these infrastructure projects.\n\nIn addition to infrastructure financing, we are actively involved in the development of Hong Kong as a hub for corporate treasury centres, private equity funds and Asian derivatives businesses, by attracting multinational corporations and major financial institutions to manage their funds, assets and various financial risks in the city. These initiatives will further consolidate and upgrade Hong Kong’s financial and related professional services sectors. The HKMA also maintains close dialogue with the relevant authorities responsible for the development of the Bay Area to strengthen collaboration with a view to contributing to the financial development of the area as a world-class city cluster.\n\nOver the years, Hong Kong’s financial industry has been developing under the theme of “leveraging Hong Kong’s advantages, meeting the country’s needs”. With the introduction of the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect in 2014, the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect in 2016 and the Northbound Trading of Bond Connect in July last year, the mutual market access between the Mainland and the rest of the world through Hong Kong’s financial platform has been expanded from stock markets to bond markets. This underscores Hong Kong’s unique role as a financial intermediary in facilitating global investors’ access to the Mainland’s financial markets. In 2017, Hong Kong maintained its position as the leading global hub for offshore renminbi business. Average daily turnover of the renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement system stood at RMB900 billion. In addition, according to SWIFT statistics, more than 70% of global renminbi payment transactions were handled through Hong Kong during the year. The offshore renminbi market continued to operate smoothly and develop steadily.\n\n# Nurturing talent to strengthen the soft power of the banking industry\n\nWith the continuing growth of the financial industry, nurturing talent is crucial to its sustainable development. The HKMA attaches great importance to the soft power of the banking industry, and we have been encouraging and supporting ongoing capacity building of banking practitioners. Following the introduction of two modules on anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism and cybersecurity under the Enhanced Competency Framework, we expanded its coverage last year by including retail wealth management and treasury management to enhance the level of core competence of banking practitioners through continuing professional development. The HKMA is also committed to nurturing young talent for the banking industry. In 2017, we launched the Pilot Apprenticeship Programme for Private Wealth Management and the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme in collaboration with the industry. Given the overwhelming response, the coverage of these programmes will be further expanded in the future.\n\n# Prudent investment strategy achieving a reasonable and stable return over the medium to long term\n\nOn the back of strong global economic growth, the Exchange Fund achieved a record high investment income of HK$264 billion last year with gains across the board, including equities, bonds and foreign exchange. The overall investment return was 7.4%. The Investment Portfolio achieved a rate of return of 12.1%, while the Backing Portfolio gained 1.8%. The Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP)’s annualised internal rate of return since its inception in 2009 reached as high as 13.7%. While the investment performance last year was satisfactory, the increasingly complex investment environment requires the HKMA to continue its prudent management of the Exchange Fund. We will remain agile and nimble, monitor market developments closely and deploy defensive measures as and when appropriate. Investments under the LTGP will also be further expanded. As always, the investment principle of “capital preservation first, long-term growth next” within acceptable risk levels will be adhered to when managing the wealth for the people of Hong Kong.\n\nWhile the global real economy is extending last year’s growth momentum, uncertainties and risks still abound in 2018. These include a faster-than-expected pace of US interest rate hikes in case inflation picks up, escalating trade frictions and a deteriorating geopolitical landscape. Should these downside risks materialise, they will have significant and widespread implications for global financial markets, and knock-on effects for Hong Kong’s fund flows, asset prices and real economy. It is therefore advisable that we should all manage the risks prudently.\n\nIn the coming months, it is likely Hong Kong dollar interest rate movements will remain in the spotlight. The US Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times since December 2015. With widening spreads between Hong Kong dollar interest rates and their US dollar counterparts, there is a greater incentive for funds to flow from the Hong Kong dollar into the US dollar. The Hong Kong dollar has been under weakening pressure recently and the 7.85 weak-side Convertibility Undertaking (CU) has been triggered. As we have repeatedly stated, when the 7.85 weak-side CU is triggered, the HKMA will act as a “super money changer” by buying Hong Kong dollars and selling US dollars in the market to ensure that the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate will not weaken beyond the 7.85 level. Such operations are normal and in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System. This should not cause any concern. Indeed, the Exchange Fund currently holds more than HK$4 trillion worth of assets, of which the Hong Kong dollar Monetary Base amounts to about HK$1.7 trillion, providing a strong buffer in the event of fund outflows. Over the years, the HKMA has put in place various lines of defence to safeguard the stability of the banking and financial systems. From a positive perspective, capital outflows will lead to a gradual increase in Hong Kong dollar interest rates, which will be conducive to the normalisation of the interest rate environment in Hong Kong and hence the sustainable development of the local economy and asset markets. During this process, the HKMA will stay vigilant and make every effort to maintain monetary and banking stability in Hong Kong.\n", "zh": "# 總裁報告\n\n2017年，全球經濟及金融市場表現遠超預期：實體經濟持續穩健增長，通脹維持溫和，美國聯邦儲備局於年內三度加息並縮減資產負債表，卻未有導致新興市場經濟體出現資本外流或美元走強。在樂觀情緒帶動下，全球股市，包括美國三大主要股指，屢創新高。MSCI新興市場指數大升34%。恒生指數於2017年上升近8,000點（或36%），並於2018年1月突破30,000點大關，創下歷史新高。\n\n在如此有利的環境下，許多投資者充滿信心，甚至過於亢奮。然而，這種情況直至今年二月初才出現逆轉，當時美國最新數據顯示工資增幅高於預期，促使投資者重新評估通脹風險，並引發全球股市大幅調整。道瓊斯指數於二月第二週兩日內下跌逾1,000點，恒生指數同週亦下挫逾3,000點。美國十年期國債孳息率急升至2.95%。資金流向迅速逆轉，顯示市場創新高的估值並非建立於穩固基礎之上。這同時提醒我們，香港必須擁有穩健及強韌的金融體系，方能應對資產市場波動及資本外流帶來的挑戰。\n\n# 預防性措施提升銀行體系抗逆力\n\n俗語有云：「預防勝於治療」。金管局於2017年進一步推行風險緩釋措施，以維護香港銀行及金融體系的穩定。5月，我們推出第八輪銀行按揭貸款逆周期措施，並加強銀行對地產發展商貸款的信貸風險管理，旨在提升銀行體系對樓市下行衝擊的抗逆力。經過多輪措施，新批住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數由2009年9月的64%降至2017年底的49%，而平均供款與入息比率亦由2010年8月的41%降至35%。\n\n2017年，我們成立了處理「大而不能倒」非可持續經營金融機構的決策辦公室，落實國際標準。這有助防止重演2008年全球金融危機時以公帑拯救失敗金融機構的情況，並將其倒閉對金融體系、經濟及社會的影響減至最低。\n\n穩健的風險管理是銀行業穩定及可持續發展的基石。香港銀行體系的流動資金比率及資本充足比率均遠高於法定要求，並位列全球前列，充分反映本港銀行體系的高度抗逆力。事實上，銀行業於2017年錄得強勁增長，總貸款額上升16%，資產質素亦保持良好。零售銀行的不良貸款比率由2016年的0.72%降至0.54%，遠低於自2000年以來2.2%的長期平均水平。銀行業以稅前經營溢利計算的整體股本回報率於2017年達11.74%，與其他國際金融中心相比屬於非常健康的水平。\n\n# 穩健銀行業是長遠金融穩定的關鍵\n\n2008年全球金融危機揭示，僅靠規則和法規限制金融業追逐利潤而忽視其本分，存在明顯局限。有鑑於此，金管局近年積極推動「穩健銀行」文化，鼓勵銀行建立及實踐良好的企業文化和價值觀。特別是針對銀行員工為追求短期利潤而犧牲客戶或銀行長遠利益的問題，我們鼓勵銀行建立與其企業文化和價值觀一致的合適激勵機制。作為推動工作的一部分，我們於2017年3月舉辦首屆獨立非執行董事（INEDs）年會，強調建立良好銀行文化的重要性，並協助INEDs更有效地履行監督及審查職能。\n\n在銀行業的支持下，2017年金管局在推動金融共融方面取得豐碩成果。六間實體分行及三間流動分行於偏遠地區投入服務。香港銀行公會與易辦事及某連鎖便利店合作，推出試驗計劃，讓長者可於偏遠地區的便利店無需消費即可提取現金。香港郵政今年亦將於七間主要位於離島及新界的郵政局推出長者現金提取服務。就開戶方面，金管局去年設立專頁及電郵帳戶，並組成專責團隊，跟進公眾有關開立銀行帳戶的查詢或投訴。在各方共同努力下，個人及企業開戶體驗有明顯改善。\n\n# 金融科技為銀行業帶來顛覆性變革\n\n在科技迅速發展的時代，金融科技已逐步融入我們的日常生活。在這個瞬息萬變的科技環境下，銀行必須擁抱新發展，積極創新應用金融科技。隨著「智慧銀行」新時代來臨，金管局於9月推出七項推動銀行業採用金融科技的措施（詳見第106頁），以提升銀行產品及服務質素。這些措施雖然各自獨立，卻能相輔相成，將為香港支付及銀行服務的未來格局帶來顛覆性變化。客戶不僅可享受更便捷、高效及安全的支付和銀行服務，亦有更多選擇及更大自主權。金融科技將成為銀行未來業務成功的關鍵，邁向「智慧銀行」新時代亦是銀行升級轉型的重大機遇。\n\n# 「一帶一路」及大灣區倡議帶來龐大機遇\n\n隨著國際金融中心競爭日趨激烈，金融業多元化對香港至關重要。2017年，金管局加強推動提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。憑藉「背靠內地、面向國際」的獨特優勢，「一帶一路」倡議及粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）發展將為金融及銀行業帶來龐大機遇，並為香港經濟增長注入新動力。金管局為配合「一帶一路」倡議而設立的基建融資促進辦公室，自成立以來合作夥伴增至約90個，為推動香港成為基建投融資樞紐奠定堅實基礎。2017年，中國國家開發銀行於香港發行首隻「一帶一路」債券，突顯香港在促進基建項目融資方面可發揮的關鍵作用。\n\n除了基礎設施融資外，我們亦積極推動香港發展成為企業財資中心、私募股權基金及亞洲衍生工具業務的樞紐，吸引跨國企業及主要金融機構在本港管理其資金、資產及各類金融風險。這些舉措將進一步鞏固及提升香港的金融及相關專業服務行業。金管局亦與負責大灣區發展的有關當局保持緊密溝通，加強合作，致力為該區作為世界級城市群的金融發展作出貢獻。\n\n多年來，香港金融業一直以「發揮香港優勢，滿足國家需要」為主題發展。隨著2014年滬港通、2016年深港通及去年七月「債券通」北向通的推出，內地與全球市場透過香港金融平台的互聯互通已由股票市場擴展至債券市場，突顯香港作為金融中介，協助全球投資者進入內地金融市場的獨特角色。2017年，香港繼續保持全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的領先地位。人民幣實時全額結算系統的日均交易額達到9,000億元人民幣。此外，根據SWIFT統計，全球超過七成的人民幣支付交易於年內經香港處理。離岸人民幣市場運作持續暢順，穩步發展。\n\n# 培育人才，強化銀行業軟實力\n\n隨著金融業持續發展，培育人才對其可持續發展至關重要。金管局高度重視銀行業的軟實力，並一直鼓勵及支持銀行從業員持續提升能力。繼於「專業能力提升框架」下推出反洗錢及打擊恐怖分子資金籌集及網絡安全兩個單元後，去年進一步涵蓋零售財富管理及財資管理，透過持續專業發展提升銀行從業員的核心能力水平。金管局亦致力為銀行業培育年輕人才。2017年，我們與業界合作推出私人財富管理見習計劃及金融科技人才培訓計劃。由於反應熱烈，這些計劃的涵蓋範圍將來會進一步擴大。\n\n# 審慎投資策略　中長期實現合理穩定回報\n\n受惠於全球經濟強勁增長，去年外匯基金錄得2,640億港元的歷史新高投資收入，股票、債券及外匯均有斬獲，整體投資回報率為7.4%。投資組合回報率達12.1%，而票據組合則錄得1.8%回報。長遠增長組合（LTGP）自2009年成立以來的年化內部回報率高達13.7%。雖然去年投資表現令人滿意，但日益複雜的投資環境要求金管局繼續審慎管理外匯基金。我們會保持靈活機動，密切監察市場動向，並在適當時候採取防禦性措施。長遠增長組合的投資亦會進一步擴展。正如以往一樣，管理香港市民財富時，我們會堅守「保本為先，長遠增值」的投資原則，在可接受風險水平下追求回報。\n\n雖然全球實體經濟正延續去年的增長動力，但2018年仍充滿不確定性和風險，包括美國加息步伐若因通脹上升而快於預期、貿易摩擦升級及地緣政治局勢惡化。若這些下行風險成真，將對全球金融市場產生重大而廣泛的影響，並對香港的資金流動、資產價格及實體經濟帶來連鎖反應。因此，我們都應審慎管理風險。\n\n未來數月，港元利率走勢預計仍會成為市場焦點。自2015年12月以來，美國聯邦儲備局已加息六次。隨著港元與美元利差擴大，資金由港元流向美元的誘因增加。近期港元受壓，7.85弱方兌換保證（CU）已被觸發。正如我們多次強調，當7.85弱方兌換保證被觸發時，金管局會充當「超級找換商」，在市場上買入港元、賣出美元，以確保港元匯率不會跌穿7.85水平。這些操作屬於聯繫匯率制度設計下的正常安排，毋須擔心。事實上，外匯基金現時持有超過4萬億港元資產，其中港元貨幣基礎約為1.7萬億港元，為資金流出時提供強大緩衝。多年來，金管局已建立多重防線，保障銀行及金融體系穩定。從正面看，資金流出將令港元利率逐步上升，有助本港利率環境回復正常，從而促進本地經濟及資產市場的可持續發展。在這過程中，金管局會保持警覺，全力維護香港貨幣及銀行體系的穩定。"}

{"en": "# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nAgainst the backdrop of a more synchronised expansion of the global economy, Hong Kong saw faster economic growth, tighter labour market conditions and subdued inflationary pressures in 2017. Economic growth for 2018 is expected to remain solid.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Real activities\n\nAmid a more synchronised expansion of the global economy, the Hong Kong economy grew faster in 2017. Growth in real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increased to 3.8%, much higher than the 2.1% growth in 2016 and the long-term growth of about 3% over the past decade (Chart 1 and Table 1). Domestic demand firmed up, with private consumption growth accelerating and overall investment spending reviving. Stronger domestic demand reflected favourable job and income conditions, booming asset prices and improved business sentiment. Externally, Hong Kong’s exports of goods expanded at a faster pace due to increased global trade flows, and exports of services recovered because of vibrant trade and cargo flows and improving inbound tourism. Imports of goods recorded stronger growth on export-induced demand, and imports of services increased steadily amid strong travel interest among residents. On a net basis, the overall trade surplus shrank, making a negative contribution to GDP growth.\n\n\n# Monetary conditions\n\nOn the monetary front, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate generally eased against the US dollar driven primarily by interest rate arbitrage activities amid the negative interest rate differentials between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar. This reflected the normal functioning of the Linked Exchange Rate System in accordance with its design. While still at relatively low levels, Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates faced more upward pressures towards the end of 2017 due to Initial Public Offeringrelated funding demand and banks’ year-end liquidity needs. For credit growth, after two years of single-digit growth, total bank loans increased at a notably faster pace of 16.1% in 2017, reflecting improving economic conditions and positive financial market sentiment. Despite faster loan growth, there were no signs of loosening of banks’ credit underwriting standards, and overall loan quality remained good.\n\n# Inflation\n\nInflationary pressures remained well contained throughout 2017 (Chart 2). Netting out the effects of the Government’s one-off relief measures, the underlying inflation rate declined to 1.7%, down from 2.3% in 2016. In particular, the housing component of the price index increased at a milder pace, reflecting the filter-through of slower increases in fresh-letting private residential rentals in 2016. More broadly, milder increases in nominal wages and earnings amid strong output growth helped keep local cost pressures in check. Import price inflation was also tame, in line with low inflation in Hong Kong’s major import sources despite a weaker US dollar.\n\n# Labour market\n\nThe labour market tightened in 2017 along with above-par economic growth. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell from 3.4% in 2016 to 2.9% towards the end of 2017, below 3% for the first time in nearly 20 years (Chart 3). Most major economic sectors registered decreases in their respective unemployment rates, with more notable declines seen in the retail, financing and professional and business services sectors. As total employment grew faster and the number of private-sector vacancies picked up, overall labour demand continued to strengthen. The labour force also expanded, partly reflecting more active participation of older-age workers (aged 55 and above). Consistent with tighter labour market conditions and lower inflation, real wages and earnings saw faster increases.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe Hong Kong stock market had an almost uninterrupted rally in 2017. The Hang Seng Index rose by 36%, the largest annual gain since 2010 (Chart 4). The rally reflected optimism about the global economy and corporate earnings, and was in part supported by substantial fund inflows from Mainland investors through the Stock Connects. The Hang Seng Index hit a ten-year high in November and remained at high levels towards the end of 2017. Average daily turnover expanded to HK$88.3 billion from HK$66.9 billion in the previous year, and overall equity funds raised from the local market also increased to HK$581.4 billion, compared with HK$490.1 billion a year earlier.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market maintained its upward momentum throughout the year (Chart 4). Transaction volume expanded from 54,701 units a year ago to 61,591 units and housing prices increased by 14.8% in 2017. Housing affordability stretched further, with a price-toincome ratio of 16.4, higher than the previous peak in 1997, and an income-gearing ratio of 74.1, far above its long-term average.1 In view of rising property prices and the intensifying competition for mortgage business among banks, the HKMA introduced the eighth round of prudential measures in May to strengthen banks’ risk management and safeguard banking stability. Housing price growth moderated temporarily following these measures before accelerating in the fourth quarter. As for the commercial and industrial property markets, trading activities increased significantly during the year, with both transaction value and volume registering double-digit growth. With the pick-up in non-residential property prices, corresponding rental yields fell slightly compared to the previous year.\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nEconomic growth for 2018 is expected to remain solid. The Government forecasts growth in the range of 3–4%, while private-sector analysts project the economy to expand at an average rate of 3.2%. Externally, Hong Kong’s export performance will continue to benefit from the improving global growth outlook and the gradual recovery in inbound tourism. Domestically, private consumption growth is expected to hold up mainly as a result of favourable labour market conditions. As for fixed capital formation, building and construction activity should progress steadily on the back of rising housing supply and continuing infrastructure projects. While improved economic conditions will support business capital spending, headwinds may come from potential rises in interest rates.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nWith still-moderate global inflation and steady increase in local costs, inflationary pressures in Hong Kong are anticipated to remain moderate in 2018, but the inflation rate is likely to pick up gradually from the low in 2017. For example, the rental component of inflation may gather momentum in the latter part of 2018 because of feedthrough from increases in fresh-letting private residential rentals. Market consensus predicts the headline inflation rate to be a still-moderate 2.2% for 2018, and the Government projects the underlying inflation rate to be 2.5%. On the other hand, sustained economic growth, expanding building and construction activity and the gradual recovery in inbound tourism are expected to keep the labour market tight in the near future. Private-sector analysts forecast the unemployment rate to stay at about 3.0% in 2018.\n\n# Uncertainties and risks\n\nThe economic outlook for 2018 is subject to a number of uncertainties and risks including those relating to major central banks’ monetary policy normalisation and global financial market stability, as well as heightened protectionist sentiment and deteriorating geopolitical tensions. In particular, if such risks materialise to trigger reversal of fund flows in Hong Kong, local monetary conditions could tighten faster than expected, putting downward pressures on the real economy and asset prices.\n\nThe outlook for the residential property market remains uncertain. In the near term, the current favourable domestic economic conditions, perceived housing shortage, low mortgage rates and alternative sources of home financing (including mortgage loans provided by property developers and financial support from parents), will continue to support the demand for properties. However, the recent sell-off in global financial markets may dampen sentiments. Over the longer term, the property market will continue to face a number of headwinds. In particular, as the US monetary policy normalisation continues, domestic mortgage rates will rise eventually. In addition, on the back of the Government’s effort to increase the supply of land and residential properties, the housing demand-supply gap is expected to narrow gradually, which would ease the upward pressure on property prices in the longer term.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector continued to be safe and sound in 2017 notwithstanding uncertainties surrounding the global economy. The capital and liquidity positions of authorized institutions (AIs) remained strong, asset quality stayed at healthy levels, and profitability improved notably thanks to increased interest margins and robust credit growth.\n\n# Interest rate trends\n\nAs the US interest rate normalisation continued, the onemonth and three-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) fixings increased by 49 basis points and 39 basis points respectively in 2017. More notable rises were observed in the fourth quarter. Nevertheless, the Hong Kong dollar funding cost of retail banks, as measured by the composite interest rate, remained broadly stable over the year (Chart 5).\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe aggregate pre-tax operating profits of retail banks’ Hong Kong offices grew by 15.8% in 2017. The improved performance was mainly due to increases in net interest income (+20.3%) and fee and commission income (+9.4%). However, these increases were partially offset by a decline in income from foreign exchange and derivatives operations (-29.9%) and a growth in operating expenses (+8.4%). The aggregate post-tax profit of retail banks dropped by 18.1% because of certain non-recurring items recorded in 2016. The post-tax return on average assets of retail banks dropped to 1.07% from 1.44% in 2016 (Chart 6).\n\nRetail banks’ net interest margin widened to 1.45% in 2017 from 1.32% in 2016 (Chart 7) mainly due to rising market interest rates.\n\nThe proportion of retail banks’ non-interest income to total operating income decreased to 40% from 44.3% in 2016. While fee and commission income increased by 9.4%, income originated from foreign exchange and derivatives operations dropped by 29.9%.\n\nRetail banks’ cost-to-income ratio declined to 41.9% in 2017 from 43.2% in 2016, as operating costs (+8.4%) increased at a slower pace than operating income (+11.8%) (Chart 8). Retail banks’ loan impairment charges decreased to HK$7.3 billion from HK$8 billion in 2016.\n\n# Asset quality\n\nLoan quality of retail banks improved during the year, with the classified loan ratio decreasing to 0.54% from 0.72% a year earlier. The overdue and rescheduled loan ratio also decreased to 0.4% from 0.53% in 2016 (Chart 9). Similarly, the classified loan ratio and the overdue and rescheduled loan ratio of the whole banking sector decreased to 0.67% and 0.52%, from 0.85% and 0.67% respectively.\n\nThe quality of banks’ residential mortgage lending portfolios remained good, with the delinquency ratio staying at a low level of 0.03% at the end of 2017 (Chart 10). The rescheduled loan ratio was close to 0%. There was no residential mortgage loan in negative equity at the end of the year, as compared with four cases a year ago.\n\nThe delinquency ratio of credit card lending stayed low at 0.22% at the end of 2017, compared with 0.24% a year ago (Chart 10). The combined delinquent and rescheduled loan ratio edged down to 0.31% from 0.33% during the period. The charge-off ratio also fell slightly to 1.75% from 1.92% in 2016.\n\n# Balance sheet trends\n\nTotal loans of the banking sector grew by 16.1% in 2017, compared with 6.5% in 2016. Demand for credit increased, driven by optimism about the global economic outlook. As total deposits increased at a slower pace than total loans, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio rose to 73% at the end of 2017 from 68.4% a year earlier. The Hong Kong-dollar loan-to-deposit ratio also increased to 82.7% from 77.1% during the same period (Chart 11).\n\nMainland-related lending (including loans booked in Mainland subsidiaries of locally incorporated banks) increased by 17.5% in 2017, compared with a growth of 7% recorded in 2016.\n\n# Holdings of negotiable debt securities\n", "zh": "# 經濟及金融環境\n\n在全球經濟更趨同步擴張的背景下，香港於2017年錄得更快的經濟增長、更緊張的勞工市場狀況，以及溫和的通脹壓力。預計2018年經濟增長將維持穩健。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 實體經濟活動\n\n隨著全球經濟更趨同步擴張，香港經濟於2017年增長加快。實質本地生產總值（GDP）增長加至3.8%，遠高於2016年的2.1%，亦高於過去十年約3%的長期增長（見圖1及表1）。本地需求進一步鞏固，私人消費增長加快，整體投資開支亦見復甦。較強的本地需求反映有利的就業及收入狀況、資產價格上升及商業信心改善。對外方面，受惠於全球貿易流動增加，香港貨物出口增長加快，服務出口則因貿易及貨運流動暢旺及入境旅遊改善而回升。受出口帶動的需求，貨物進口錄得更強增長，而在居民旅遊意欲高漲下，服務進口亦持續穩步上升。淨計下，整體貿易順差收窄，對GDP增長構成負面貢獻。\n\n\n# 貨幣狀況\n\n在貨幣方面，受港元與美元之間負利率差下的利率套利活動主導，港元兌美元匯率普遍走軟。這反映聯繫匯率制度按設計正常運作。雖然仍處於相對低水平，港元銀行同業拆息於2017年底因首次公開招股相關資金需求及銀行年終流動性需要而面臨更大上升壓力。信貸增長方面，經歷兩年單位數增長後，2017年銀行總貸款增長顯著加快至16.1%，反映經濟狀況改善及金融市場氣氛正面。儘管貸款增長加快，銀行的信貸審批標準並無放寬跡象，整體貸款質素仍然良好。\n\n# 通脹\n\n2017年通脹壓力整體上保持受控（見圖2）。扣除政府一次性紓困措施的影響，基本通脹率降至1.7%，較2016年的2.3%為低。特別是，物價指數中的住屋項目升幅放緩，反映2016年新租私人住宅租金升幅減慢的滲透效應。更廣泛而言，在經濟增長強勁下，名義工資及收入升幅溫和，有助抑制本地成本壓力。進口價格通脹亦保持溫和，與香港主要進口來源地通脹低企一致，儘管美元走弱。\n\n# 勞工市場\n\n隨著經濟增長高於趨勢，2017年勞工市場進一步收緊。經季節性調整的失業率由2016年的3.4%降至2017年底的2.9%，為近20年來首次低於3%（見圖3）。大部分主要經濟行業的失業率均有下降，零售、金融及專業和商業服務業的跌幅尤為顯著。隨著總就業人數增長加快及私營職位空缺增加，整體勞動需求持續增強。勞動人口亦有所擴大，部分反映年長勞工（55歲及以上）參與更為積極。與勞工市場收緊及通脹較低相符，實質工資及收入升幅加快。\n\n# 股票市場\n\n2017年香港股市幾乎持續上升。恒生指數全年上升36%，為2010年以來最大年度升幅（見圖4）。這波升勢反映市場對全球經濟及企業盈利的樂觀情緒，部分亦受內地投資者透過「滬深港通」大量資金流入支持。恒生指數於11月創下十年新高，並於2017年底維持高位。平均每日成交額由上年的669億港元增至883億港元，本地市場集資總額亦由上年的4,901億港元增至5,814億港元。\n\n# 物業市場\n\n住宅物業市場全年保持上升動力（見圖4）。成交量由一年前的54,701宗增至61,591宗，樓價於2017年上升14.8%。樓價負擔能力進一步惡化，樓價對收入比率達16.4，較1997年高位為高，入息供款比率為74.1，遠高於長期平均水平。1 鑑於樓價上升及銀行間按揭業務競爭加劇，金管局於5月推出第八輪審慎監管措施，加強銀行風險管理，維護銀行體系穩定。措施推出後樓價升幅一度放緩，惟第四季再度加快。至於工商物業市場，全年交投顯著增加，成交金額及宗數均錄得雙位數增長。隨著非住宅物業價格回升，相關租金回報率較上年略為下跌。\n\n# 經濟前景展望\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n預計2018年經濟增長將維持穩健。政府預測增長介乎3–4%，而私營機構分析員則預計經濟平均增長3.2%。對外方面，香港出口表現將繼續受惠於全球經濟前景改善及入境旅遊逐步復甦。內部方面，私人消費增長預期將主要受惠於有利的勞工市場狀況而保持穩健。固定資本形成方面，隨著房屋供應增加及基建項目持續推進，建築活動應可穩步發展。雖然經濟環境改善將支持企業資本開支，但利率可能上升帶來的阻力不容忽視。\n\n# 通脹及勞工市場\n\n在全球通脹仍屬溫和及本地成本穩步上升下，預期2018年香港通脹壓力將維持溫和，但通脹率有可能自2017年低位逐步回升。例如，通脹中的租金項目或會因新租私人住宅租金升幅的滲透效應，於2018年下半年加快上升。市場普遍預期2018年整體通脹率仍屬溫和，為2.2%，政府則預測基本通脹率為2.5%。另一方面，持續的經濟增長、建築活動擴大及入境旅遊逐步復甦，預期短期內勞工市場將維持緊張。私營機構分析員預測2018年失業率將維持約3.0%。\n\n# 不確定性及風險\n\n2018年經濟前景面臨多項不確定性及風險，包括主要央行貨幣政策正常化及全球金融市場穩定性，以及保護主義情緒升溫及地緣政治緊張加劇。特別是，若相關風險實現，觸發香港資金流向逆轉，本地貨幣狀況可能較預期更快收緊，對實體經濟及資產價格帶來下行壓力。\n\n住宅物業市場前景仍然充滿不確定性。短期內，現時有利的本地經濟環境、普遍認為的房屋短缺、低按揭利率及其他置業融資渠道（包括由發展商提供的按揭貸款及父母的財務支援），將繼續支持物業需求。然而，近期環球金融市場的拋售可能會削弱市場情緒。長遠而言，物業市場將繼續面對多項挑戰。特別是，隨著美國貨幣政策正常化的持續推進，本地按揭利率最終將會上升。此外，隨著政府致力增加土地及住宅供應，預期住屋供求差距將會逐步收窄，這將有助於長遠紓緩樓價的上升壓力。\n\n# 銀行業表現\n\n儘管環球經濟前景存在不確定性，香港銀行業於2017年仍然保持穩健安全。認可機構的資本及流動性狀況依然強勁，資產質素維持健康水平，盈利能力因息差擴闊及信貸增長強勁而顯著改善。\n\n# 利率走勢\n\n隨著美國利率正常化持續推進，2017年港元一個月及三個月銀行同業拆息（HIBOR）分別上升49個基點及39個基點。第四季升幅尤為顯著。儘管如此，以綜合利率衡量的零售銀行港元資金成本全年大致保持穩定（圖5）。\n\n# 盈利走勢\n\n2017年，零售銀行香港辦事處的稅前經營溢利總額增長15.8%。業績改善主要由於淨利息收入（+20.3%）及手續費及佣金收入（+9.4%）增加。然而，這些增幅部分被外匯及衍生工具業務收入下跌（-29.9%）及經營開支上升（+8.4%）所抵銷。由於2016年錄得若干一次性項目，零售銀行的稅後溢利總額下跌18.1%。零售銀行的平均資產稅後回報率由2016年的1.44%降至1.07%（圖6）。\n\n零售銀行的淨息差由2016年的1.32%擴闊至2017年的1.45%（圖7），主要受市場利率上升所帶動。\n\n零售銀行非利息收入佔總經營收入的比例由2016年的44.3%降至40%。雖然手續費及佣金收入上升9.4%，但外匯及衍生工具業務收入則下跌29.9%。\n\n零售銀行的成本對收入比率由2016年的43.2%降至2017年的41.9%，因經營開支（+8.4%）增幅低於經營收入（+11.8%）（圖8）。零售銀行的貸款減值撥備由2016年的80億港元減少至73億港元。\n\n# 資產質素\n\n年內零售銀行的貸款質素有所改善，分類貸款比率由一年前的0.72%降至0.54%。逾期及重組貸款比率亦由2016年的0.53%降至0.4%（圖9）。同樣，整體銀行業的分類貸款比率及逾期及重組貸款比率分別由0.85%及0.67%降至0.67%及0.52%。\n\n銀行的住宅按揭貸款組合質素維持良好，2017年底拖欠比率維持在0.03%的低水平（圖10）。重組貸款比率接近0%。年末並無任何住宅按揭貸款處於負資產狀態，而一年前則有四宗個案。\n\n信用卡貸款的拖欠比率於2017年底維持在0.22%的低水平，較一年前的0.24%略為下降（圖10）。同期，拖欠及重組貸款合計比率由0.33%微降至0.31%。撇賬比率亦由2016年的1.92%輕微下降至1.75%。\n\n# 資產負債表走勢\n\n2017年銀行業總貸款增長16.1%，高於2016年的6.5%。受對環球經濟前景樂觀情緒帶動，信貸需求上升。由於總存款增長速度低於總貸款，整體貸存比率由一年前的68.4%上升至2017年底的73%。同期，港元貸存比率亦由77.1%升至82.7%（圖11）。\n\n與內地相關的貸款（包括本地註冊銀行在內地子公司所錄得的貸款）於2017年增長17.5%，高於2016年錄得的7%增幅。\n\n# 可轉讓債務證券持有情況"}
{"en": "# Monetary Stability\n\nDespite weakening pressure on the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to operate in an orderly manner with ample liquidity. The Linked Exchange Rate System has served as a strong anchor for Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability and proved to be highly resilient against various shocks.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability. This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n- Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three noteissuing banks\n- Government-issued notes and coins in circulation\n- the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of the clearing account balances of banks kept with the HKMA\n- Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the HKMA’s firm commitment to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs). When the demand for Hong Kong dollars is greater than the supply and the market exchange rate strengthens to the strong-side CU of HK$7.75 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to sell Hong Kong dollars to banks for US dollars. The Aggregate Balance will then expand to push down Hong Kong dollar interest rates, creating monetary conditions that move the Hong Kong dollar away from the strong-side limit to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if the supply of Hong Kong dollars is greater than the demand and the market exchange rate weakens to the weak-side CU of HK$7.85 to one US dollar, the HKMA will buy Hong Kong dollars from banks. The Aggregate Balance will then contract to drive Hong Kong dollar interest rates up, pushing the Hong Kong dollar away from the weak-side limit to stay within the Convertibility Zone.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2017\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate generally saw weakening pressure in 2017 (Chart 1). Driven mainly by interest carry trade activities amid widened negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates, the Hong Kong dollar eased gradually against the US dollar, from 7.7566 on 3 January to the year-low of 7.8265 on 22 August. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate gained some strength between late September and early November, underpinned by a tightening of Hong Kong dollar liquidity due to initial public offering (IPO)-related funding demand, and traded steadily within a narrow range of 7.80–7.81. Weakening pressures on the Hong Kong dollar were seen again towards the end of the year, partly reflecting slightly improved Hong Kong dollar liquidity conditions as well as increased year-end commercial demand for the US dollar. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market functioned normally throughout 2017.\n\nAs the CUs were not triggered, the total of the Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs remained virtually unchanged at around HK$1,225.3 billion in 2017 (Chart 2). During the year, the HKMA issued a total of HK$80 billion additional Exchange Fund Bills to meet banks’ increased demand for liquidity management. This led to a contraction of the Aggregate Balance to HK$179.8 billion at the end of 2017. The issuance of additional Exchange Fund Bills was consistent with Currency Board principles, as it only represented a change in the composition of the Monetary Base, with a shift from the Aggregate Balance to the outstanding EFBNs. The Monetary Base remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\n# Money market\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates stayed soft in the first eight months of 2017 before facing more upward pressure towards the end of the year (Chart 3). Despite concerns about the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes and balance sheet normalisation, the Hong Kong dollar interbank rates generally remained soft for the first eight months. As such, the negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates widened between January and August. From September onward, the shortdated Hong Kong dollar interbank rates witnessed large pick-ups, driven mainly by IPO-related and year-end funding demand. Correspondingly, the negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates narrowed in the short-dated segment. Overall, the short-dated interbank rates traded mostly below the Base Rate in 2017.\n\nThe Base Rate was adjusted upwards on 16 March, 15 June and 14 December, by a total of 75 basis points from 1.00% to 1.75%, as the target range for the US federal funds rate moved upward three times by a total of 75 basis points from 0.50–0.75% to 1.25–1.50% during the year. The adjustment of the Base Rate was in accordance with the revised formula announced on 26 March 2009, in which the Base Rate is set at either 50 basis points above the lower bound of the prevailing target range for the US federal funds rate or the average of the five-day moving averages of the overnight and one-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs), whichever is the higher.\n\nRoughly tracking the movements of the Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads, the discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points widened gradually during the first three quarters, with the 12-month Hong Kong dollar forward points reaching about -615 pips in midSeptember (Chart 4). In the fourth quarter, the discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points narrowed slightly along with the narrowing of the negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates. Overall, Hong Kong’s money market continued to operate in an orderly manner and interbank liquidity remained ample. Discount Window borrowing increased from HK$5.3 billion in 2016 to HK$10.3 billion in 2017.\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nSince its establishment in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has served as a strong anchor for Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, and proved to be highly resilient in a series of regional and global financial crises. The Government has reasserted its full commitment to the LERS and the credibility of its commitment was further reinforced by the stability in the foreign exchange and money markets. There is also continued strong public confidence in the Hong Kong dollar as a means of payment and a storage of value. In its 2017 Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund reaffirmed its support for the LERS, commenting that the LERS remained the best exchange rate arrangement for Hong Kong. Combined with robust financial supervision and regulation, prudent fiscal management, and flexible markets, the LERS has worked well to help Hong Kong navigate successfully through both external and domestic challenges.\n\nInternational Monetary Fund: “The Linked Exchange Rate System remains the best arrangement for Hong Kong.”\n\nA sound banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS. During 2017, the HKMA continued to monitor closely banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and stepped up its supervisory efforts on corporate, property-related and mainland-related lending to bolster the resilience of the banking sector. As the US Federal Reserve continues to normalise its monetary policy, the Hong Kong dollar interest rates will gradually normalise as well. The HKMA reiterated that, under the design of the LERS, the outflow of capital, the weakening of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, the triggering of the weak-side CU and the reduction of the Monetary Base are part of the necessary process of the normalisation of Hong Kong dollar interest rates. The HKMA also reminded the public to manage their risks prudently and be well prepared for potential financial turbulence.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio, defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base, moved within a range of 106.7–108.2% during 2017, without touching the Upper or Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 108.1% on 31 December (Chart 5). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. In the event of abrupt shocks, the sizeable amount of financial resources of the Exchange Fund will provide a powerful backstop in protecting Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\n# Other activities\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to the monetary and financial stability of Hong Kong. In 2017, the CBC considered various issues, including the drivers of short-run dynamics in Hong Kong’s housing prices, the determinants of HIBOR-London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) spreads, the effect of property valuation changes on corporate borrowing in Mainland China, and the effect of mortgage debt service burden on private consumption in Hong Kong. Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and the reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research (HKIMR) continued to sponsor research in the fields of monetary policy, banking and finance. Over the past three years, the HKIMR has been re-orienting its activities towards higher policy relevance. This is reflected, in particular, in its conference activities and visiting fellowship programmes. The HKIMR has been collaborating with major central banks and policy institutions to jointly organise more policyfocused conferences. Meanwhile, a thematic research fellowship programme introduced in 2016 has been supporting more research projects related to policy issues that are of importance to the HKMA.\n\nIn 2017, the HKIMR hosted 18 research fellows and published 29 working papers. It also organised four international conferences and workshops during the year:\n- The Eighth Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy, titled “China’s Economic Rebalancing: Where is it Heading?”, was held in January in Hong Kong. The conference provided a forum for academics, policy makers and business economists to discuss important analytical and policy issues related to the Mainland economy. 11 highquality research papers were presented, covering a wide variety of issues including Mainland’s economic rebalancing, structural reform and international spillovers, issues on the renminbi exchange rate, and Mainland’s monetary policy framework and transmission.\n- The 15th HKIMR Summer Workshop was held in July. The workshop was intended to provide an opportunity for staff members of the HKIMR and the HKMA to present their research papers, and to enhance interaction between research staff and visiting fellows.\n- A joint conference organised by the HKMA and the Bank for International Settlements, titled “The Price, Real and Financial Effects of Exchange Rates”, was held in August. The conference provided a platform for in-depth and insightful discussion. A wide range of important topics were covered, including the exchange rate system, the pricing system of international trade, risk taking in the accumulation of foreign currency reserves, and foreign exchange market behaviour.\n- A conference jointly sponsored by the HKMA, the US Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta on “Unconventional Monetary Policy: Lessons Learned” was held in October. The conference reviewed lessons learned from the unconventional monetary policies (UMP) of major central banks over the past ten years. The topics included monetary policy in a low interest rate environment, UMP and its spillovers to emerging economies, UMP and bank lending, and UMP and its effects on the real economy and financial stability.\n", "zh": "# 貨幣穩定\n\n儘管港元匯率承受貶值壓力，香港的外匯及貨幣市場仍然以有序方式運作，流動性充裕。聯繫匯率制度一直為香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供堅實的錨，並在各種衝擊下展現出高度的韌性。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的首要目標是維持貨幣穩定。這是指在外匯市場上，港元兌美元的匯率於7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的區間內，保持港元對外匯價值的穩定。香港貨幣體系的結構以貨幣發行局制度為特點，要求貨幣基礎必須至少有100%由外匯基金持有的美元儲備作支持，貨幣基礎的變動必須100%由相應的美元儲備變動所配合。\n\n貨幣基礎（見表1）包括：\n- 貨幣發行銀行發行的鈔票所需的全額支持——發鈔銀行債務證明書\n- 政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣\n- 銀行在金管局開立的結算賬戶餘額總和，即結餘總額\n- 金管局代表政府發行的外匯基金票據及債券（EFBNs）。\n\n港元匯率的穩定是通過自動利率調整機制及金管局堅定履行兌換保證（CUs）來維持的。當市場對港元的需求大於供應，匯率升至強方兌換保證（7.75港元兌1美元）時，金管局隨時準備向銀行賣出港元換取美元。此舉將擴大結餘總額，壓低港元利率，從而令港元匯率由強方極限回落至7.75至7.85的兌換保證區間內。相反，當港元供應大於需求，匯率跌至弱方兌換保證（7.85港元兌1美元）時，金管局會向銀行買入港元。結餘總額隨之收縮，推高港元利率，令港元匯率由弱方極限回升，維持在兌換保證區間內。\n\n# 2017年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n2017年，港元匯率普遍面臨貶值壓力（見圖1）。主要受港元與美元利差擴大下的利差交易活動推動，港元兌美元匯率由1月3日的7.7566，逐步貶至8月22日的全年低位7.8265。9月底至11月初期間，受首次公開招股（IPO）相關資金需求導致港元流動性收緊的支撐，港元匯率有所回升，並於7.80至7.81的窄幅區間內穩定交易。年末，港元再度出現貶值壓力，部分反映港元流動性略為改善，以及年底美元商業需求上升。整體而言，2017年港元外匯市場運作正常。\n\n由於兌換保證未被觸發，結餘總額及未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額於2017年基本維持在約12,253億港元（見圖2）。年內，金管局為配合銀行流動性管理需求，額外發行了800億港元外匯基金票據，導致結餘總額於年底收縮至1,798億港元。額外發行外匯基金票據符合貨幣發行局原則，僅屬貨幣基礎組合的調整，即由結餘總額轉移至未償還的外匯基金票據及債券。貨幣基礎仍然完全由外匯儲備支持。\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n2017年前八個月，港元銀行同業拆息維持偏軟，年底前則面臨較大上升壓力（見圖3）。儘管市場關注美國聯邦儲備局加息及資產負債表正常化，港元同業拆息於首八個月大致維持偏軟，令港元與美元利差於1月至8月期間進一步擴大。9月起，受IPO及年底資金需求帶動，短期港元同業拆息大幅上升，相應短期港元與美元利差收窄。全年短期同業拆息大多低於基本利率。\n\n基本利率於3月16日、6月15日及12月14日三度上調，全年累計上調75個基點，由1.00%升至1.75%，與美國聯邦基金利率目標區間全年三次上調共75個基點（由0.50–0.75%升至1.25–1.50%）一致。基本利率的調整依據2009年3月26日公布的修訂公式，即基本利率設於美國聯邦基金利率目標區間下限之上50個基點，或隔夜及一個月港元銀行同業拆息（HIBOR）五日移動平均數的平均值，以較高者為準。\n\n港元與美元利差的變動大致同步，港元遠期點貼水於首三季逐步擴大，12個月港元遠期點於9月中達到約-615點（見圖4）。第四季，隨著港元與美元短期利差收窄，港元遠期點貼水亦略為收窄。整體而言，香港貨幣市場繼續有序運作，同業流動性充裕。貼現窗借款由2016年的53億港元增至2017年的103億港元。\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n自1983年設立以來，聯繫匯率制度（LERS）一直為香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供堅實的錨，並在多次地區及全球金融危機中展現出高度韌性。政府重申對聯繫匯率制度的堅定承諾，而外匯及貨幣市場的穩定進一步鞏固了這一承諾的公信力。公眾對港元作為支付及儲值工具的信心依然強勁。國際貨幣基金組織於2017年與香港進行第四條磋商時，重申支持聯繫匯率制度，並指出該制度仍然是香港最佳的匯率安排。配合穩健的金融監管、審慎的財政管理及靈活的市場，聯繫匯率制度有效協助香港成功應對外部及本地挑戰。\n\n國際貨幣基金組織：「聯繫匯率制度仍然是香港最佳的匯率安排。」\n\n健全的銀行體系對聯繫匯率制度（LERS）的正常運作至關重要。於2017年，香港金融管理局（HKMA）繼續密切監察銀行對信貸、流動性及利率風險的管理和壓力測試結果，並加強對企業、物業相關及內地相關貸款的監管工作，以提升銀行業的抗逆能力。隨著美國聯邦儲備局（美聯儲）持續推進貨幣政策正常化，港元利率亦將逐步回復正常。金管局重申，根據聯繫匯率制度的設計，資金流出、港元匯率轉弱、觸發弱方兌換保證（CU）及貨幣基礎縮減，均屬港元利率正常化過程中的必要步驟。金管局亦提醒公眾審慎管理風險，並為潛在的金融波動做好充分準備。\n\n為提升貨幣發行局賬戶的透明度，自1998年10月起，部分外匯基金資產已專門撥作支持貨幣基礎之用。備用比率（Backing Ratio），即備用資產與貨幣基礎的比率，在2017年內於106.7%至108.2%之間波動，並未觸及上限或下限觸發水平。該比率於12月31日收報108.1%（見圖5）。根據聯繫匯率制度，雖然部分外匯基金資產已指定為備用組合，但所有外匯基金資產均可用以支持港元匯率。如遇突發衝擊，外匯基金龐大的金融資源將為維護香港貨幣及金融穩定提供有力的後盾。\n\n# 其他工作\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的貨幣發行局小組委員會（CBC）負責監察及檢討與香港貨幣及金融穩定相關的議題。2017年，CBC審議了多項議題，包括香港樓價短期動態的驅動因素、HIBOR與倫敦銀行同業拆息（LIBOR）息差的決定因素、內地物業估值變動對企業借貸的影響，以及按揭債務服務負擔對香港私人消費的影響。CBC就這些議題的討論紀錄及提交CBC的貨幣發行局運作報告，均已於金管局網站公開。\n\n香港貨幣研究院（HKIMR）繼續資助貨幣政策、銀行及金融領域的研究。過去三年，HKIMR已將其活動方向調整為更具政策相關性，這一點特別體現在其會議活動及訪問學人計劃上。HKIMR與主要央行及政策機構合作，聯合舉辦更多以政策為重點的會議。同時，自2016年起推出的主題研究學人計劃，亦支持更多與金管局重要政策議題相關的研究項目。\n\n2017年，HKIMR共接待18位研究學人，並發表29份工作論文。年內亦舉辦了四個國際會議及工作坊：\n- 第八屆中國經濟年度國際會議於1月在香港舉行，主題為「中國經濟再平衡：走向何方？」。會議為學者、政策制定者及商業經濟學家提供討論內地經濟重要分析及政策議題的平台。會上發表了11篇高質素研究論文，涵蓋內地經濟再平衡、結構性改革及國際溢出效應、人民幣匯率問題，以及內地貨幣政策框架與傳導等多個範疇。\n- 第十五屆HKIMR夏季工作坊於7月舉行，旨在為HKIMR及金管局職員提供發表研究論文的機會，並加強研究人員與訪問學人之間的交流。\n- 由金管局與國際結算銀行（BIS）合辦的「匯率的價格、實體及金融效應」會議於8月舉行。會議提供深入且具啟發性的討論平台，涵蓋多項重要議題，包括匯率制度、國際貿易定價體系、外匯儲備累積中的風險承擔，以及外匯市場行為等。\n- 由金管局、美國聯邦儲備局（Fed）及亞特蘭大聯邦儲備銀行聯合主辦的「非常規貨幣政策：經驗教訓」會議於10月舉行。會議回顧過去十年主要央行實施非常規貨幣政策（UMP）的經驗教訓，議題包括低息環境下的貨幣政策、UMP對新興經濟體的溢出效應、UMP與銀行貸款，以及UMP對實體經濟及金融穩定的影響。"}
{"en": "# Banking Stability\n\nIn 2017, the HKMA continued to place its supervisory focus on the effectiveness of authorized institutions’ risk governance framework, including credit and liquidity risk management systems. During the year, another round of countercyclical macro-prudential measures was introduced to strengthen the resilience of the banking sector to cope with any downturn in the property market. With cyber threats on the rise, the HKMA stepped up the supervision of authorized institutions’ technology risk management. At the same time, the HKMA launched seven initiatives that prepare Hong Kong to move into a New Era of Smart Banking. The effectiveness of authorized institutions’ anti-money laundering and counterterrorist financing controls remained a key supervisory focus of the HKMA as part of its efforts to combat financial crimes. On conduct supervision, the HKMA took further steps to promote a customer-centric corporate culture, foster financial inclusion, and address difficulties encountered by small and medium-sized enterprises and start-up companies in opening and maintaining bank accounts in Hong Kong. Efforts were also made to enhance the supervision of authorized institutions’ sales practices for investment and insurance products to further strengthen customer protection.\n\nSubstantial progress was made on the local implementation of international supervisory and accounting standards, including capital adequacy standards, disclosure standards, the Net Stable Funding Ratio, large exposure limits, recovery planning and International Financial Reporting Standard 9. In support of the need for capacity building amid an ever-changing banking environment and evolving risk landscape, the HKMA co-ordinated with the industry to develop director empowerment programmes and the Enhanced Competency Framework for banking practitioners.\n\nThe Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance came into operation on 7 July 2017, making Hong Kong one of the few Financial Stability Board member jurisdictions with a fully cross-sectoral resolution regime for financial institutions. The Ordinance, establishing a new line of defence for financial stability, confers necessary powers on the Monetary Authority to manage, in an orderly manner, failure of a financial institution in circumstances where such failure could have adverse systemic consequences.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this objective is contingent upon the financial system being highly resilient and capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their business and, in extremis, by failing in a disorderly manner. The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring banks are resilient to shocks and are able to recover their positions in response to crises, which ultimately helps prevent failures. The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banking business, which includes the business of taking deposits, in Hong Kong. It is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposittaking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs). The Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs).\n\nHowever, the Monetary Authority cannot ensure, nor is the Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework designed to ensure, a zero-risk financial system. Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that in the event of an AI’s failure, resolution may be conducted in an orderly manner such that continuity in critical financial services provided by AIs to their customers can be maintained. To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong is established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs, amongst other financial institutions.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2017\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nIn 2017, 192 off-site reviews were conducted covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL ratings1, corporate governance, business operations and risk management of AIs. As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance at AIs, 30 meetings were held with the boards of directors or board-level committees of AIs, with the discussions focused on important risk management issues. The HKMA also conducted a survey to monitor the adoption of its recent guidance on corporate governance. 27 tripartite meetings among the HKMA, AIs and their external auditors were also held.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA continued to conduct regular on-site examinations supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk. This approach has allowed the HKMA to prioritise its supervisory resources to focus on emerging and more significant risks faced by AIs. The HKMA conducted 401 on-site examinations and thematic reviews during the year. Credit risk management and controls remained the key focus of these examinations and reviews. Another major focus was technology risk and operational risk management. The HKMA also increased the number of overseas examinations and the number of on-site examinations and thematic reviews targeted at liquidity and market risk management as well as anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML/CFT) controls. On-site examinations of AIs’ activities in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses were also conducted by specialist teams.\n\n# Supervision of credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nTotal bank lending grew by 16.1%, compared with a growth of 6.5% in 2016. As shown in Table 2, the loan growth was broad-based.\n\nSpecifically, Mainland-related lending grew by 17.5% to HK$4,188 billion at the end of 2017 (Table 3). This included HK$644 billion of loans booked with Mainland subsidiaries of banks incorporated in Hong Kong.\n\nThe asset quality of AIs remained healthy in 2017. Retail banks’ classified loan ratio edged down from 0.72% at the end of 2016 to 0.54% at the end of 2017, well below the long-run historical average of 2.2% since 2000. For the banking industry as a whole, the classified loan ratio decreased from 0.85% to 0.67%. As regards Mainlandrelated lending, retail banks’ classified loan ratio of such lending edged down to 0.75% in 2017 from 0.82%. For the banking industry as a whole, the ratio decreased to 0.67% from 0.80% a year ago.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA stepped up its supervisory efforts to ensure that AIs continued to adopt prudent credit risk management standards. In particular, the surveillance of AIs’ exposures to major corporates was enhanced. Targeted thematic examinations were conducted, focusing on key credit risk management controls such as loan underwriting standards, the loan classification and provisioning system, credit risk governance framework and risk management for lending to property developers, asset-backed financing and insurance premium financing.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nProperty prices continued to rise in 2017. There were more loans extended by AIs involving borrowers with multiple mortgages or with income derived from outside of Hong Kong. In view of these developments, the HKMA introduced another round of countercyclical macroprudential measures on 19 May. The eighth round of measures included raising the risk-weight floor for the calculation of capital charges for new residential mortgage loans granted by AIs, lowering the applicable loan-to-value (LTV) ratio cap for property mortgage loans extended to borrowers with pre-existing mortgages, and lowering the applicable debt servicing ratio (DSR) limit for property mortgage loans extended to borrowers whose income is derived mainly from outside of Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA’s macro-prudential measures on property mortgage loans, introduced since 2009, have enhanced banks’ resilience to risks associated with the property market. The average LTV ratio of new residential mortgage loans fell to 49% in December 2017 from 64% in September 2009, before the countercyclical measures were first introduced. The average DSR also decreased to 35% in December 2017 from 41% in August 2010, when a cap on DSR was first applied (Chart 1).\n\nThe HKMA observed that some developers financed their property development projects with high gearing and some of them provided mortgages with high LTV ratios to buyers of properties. To address the risks associated with these developments, the HKMA introduced new risk management measures for lending to property developers on 12 May. These included requiring AIs to lower the financing caps for construction financing; requiring AIs to set aside more capital for their lending to property developers with a higher proportion of mortgage loans relative to equity; and performing a round of thematic examinations to ensure that banks continue to follow prudent underwriting standards in their lending to property developers.\n\nSeparately, the HKMA worked with the Land Registry in launching an e-Alert service in February. The e-Alert service provides a notification to the AI concerned whenever a further mortgage in respect of the mortgaged property is lodged with the Land Registry for registration, so that the mortgagee bank can take appropriate risk mitigating actions as appropriate.\n\n# Supervision of operational and technology risks\n\nCybersecurity threats continued to increase over the year. The HKMA stepped up its supervisory efforts in a bid to enhance the cyber resilience of the banking sector. As part of the Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative (CFI) rolled out by the HKMA in 2016, 30 AIs completed an assessment of the maturity of their cyber defences. Separately, the HKMA and the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), after extensive consultation with the banking and securities industry, jointly decided to introduce a mandatory twofactor authentication for online share trading. A round of on-site examinations focused on banks’ cybersecurity controls and operational resilience was also conducted. The HKMA further completed a round of discussions with the senior management of major banks to assess how the banks were managing strategic risks posed by potential new market entrants powered by technological advancement.\n\n# Smart Banking\n\nIn September, the HKMA announced a package of measures to assist Hong Kong’s banking sector in migrating to a new era of Smart Banking. On the supervisory front, the HKMA enhanced the Fintech Supervisory Sandbox to version 2.0, with new features including a Chatroom facility accessible by both banks and technology firms and the establishment of linkages among the sandboxes of the HKMA, the SFC and the Insurance Authority (IA), so as to provide a single point of entry for conducting trials of cross-sector fintech products.\n\nThe HKMA also launched a Banking Made Easy initiative to identify and minimise regulatory frictions with the aim of further improving customers’ experience in using fintech and digital banking services. A taskforce has been set up with the current focus on remote onboarding and account maintenance, online finance and online wealth management.\n\nA review of the existing Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks has commenced to facilitate the introduction of virtual banking in Hong Kong.\n\n# Supervision of treasury activities and liquidity risk\n\nAs the US continued to normalise its monetary policy, global fund flows might become increasingly volatile. In consideration of this, the HKMA placed increased focus on the supervision of liquidity risk during the year. The HKMA enhanced its supervisory liquidity stress testing with additional scenarios, including a more stressful but plausible scenario of fund outflows and a short-term, confidencedriven bank run scenario. The HKMA also stepped up the monitoring and analysis of individual AIs’ liquidity profiles and required selected AIs to strengthen their liquidity risk management capability.\n\nSeparately, the HKMA conducted more on-site examinations of AIs’ market risk management in respect of their debt securities portfolios. A round of thematic reviews were carried out to evaluate potential risks arising from AIs’ increased investment activities in foreign currency bonds and to assess the effectiveness of the corresponding risk management, including hedging practices.\n\n# Prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF)\n\nThe Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) (Amendment) Bill 2017 was gazetted on 23 June and will come into operation in 2018. The amendment is intended to update Hong Kong’s regulatory regime for AML/CFT in line with the latest international requirements as promulgated by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). These changes, together with updates to the statutory guideline on AML/CFT, will help clarify and implement the risk-based approach in customer due diligence (CDD) processes for account opening and the maintenance of bona fide customers, and encourage innovation where such processes are carried out remotely.\n", "zh": "# 銀行穩定性\n\n在2017年，香港金融管理局（HKMA）繼續將監管重點放在認可機構風險管治框架的有效性上，包括信貸及流動性風險管理系統。年內，金管局推出新一輪逆周期宏觀審慎措施，以加強銀行業對應樓市下行的抗逆力。隨著網絡威脅日益增加，金管局加強了對認可機構科技風險管理的監管。同時，金管局推出七項舉措，為香港邁向智能銀行新時代作好準備。認可機構的反洗錢及打擊恐怖分子資金籌集（AML/CFT）控制的有效性，仍然是金管局打擊金融犯罪工作中的一項重要監管重點。在行為監管方面，金管局進一步推動以客為本的企業文化，促進金融共融，並解決中小企及初創公司在香港開立及維持銀行賬戶時遇到的困難。同時，金管局亦加強對認可機構銷售投資及保險產品的監管，以進一步提升客戶保障。\n\n在落實國際監管及會計準則方面，包括資本充足率標準、披露標準、淨穩定資金比率、大額風險暴露限額、復甦計劃及國際財務報告準則第9號（IFRS 9），本地實施工作取得重大進展。為配合銀行環境不斷變化及風險格局演變下的能力建設需要，金管局與業界協作，制定了董事賦能計劃及銀行業專業能力提升框架。\n\n《金融機構（處置）條例》於2017年7月7日生效，使香港成為少數擁有全面跨界別金融機構處置機制的金融穩定理事會（FSB）成員司法管轄區之一。該條例為金融穩定建立了新的防線，賦予金融管理專員在金融機構出現可能對系統產生不利影響的失敗情況下，有秩序地管理該等失敗的必要權力。\n\n# 目標\n\n金管局的總體目標是促進銀行體系的安全與穩定。實現這一目標有賴於金融體系具備高度的抗逆力，並能夠為香港經濟提供所需的關鍵金融服務。\n\n銀行可通過其業務運作方式，甚至在極端情況下（in extremis）以無序方式倒閉，影響系統穩定性。作為監管機構，金融管理專員在保障金融穩定方面發揮關鍵作用，確保銀行具備抵禦衝擊的能力，並能在危機中恢復其狀況，最終有助於防止失敗發生。金融管理專員負責香港銀行業務的審慎監管，包括吸收存款業務，並負責授權香港的持牌銀行、有限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司（統稱為認可機構，AIs）。金融管理專員亦負責指定及監督若干金融市場基礎設施（FMIs）。\n\n然而，金融管理專員無法保證，也並非香港審慎監管框架的設計目標，去確保一個零風險的金融體系。相反，作為處置機構，金融管理專員致力於確保在認可機構失敗時，能以有秩序的方式進行處置，從而維持認可機構向客戶提供關鍵金融服務的連續性。為此，香港已建立金融機構處置機制，當中金融管理專員為認可機構及其他金融機構的處置機構。\n\n# 2017年回顧\n\n# 監管活動概覽\n\n2017年，金管局共進行192次非現場審查，涵蓋廣泛議題，包括CAMEL評級1、企業管治、業務運作及認可機構的風險管理。作為持續推動認可機構加強風險管治的努力之一，金管局與認可機構董事會或董事會層級委員會舉行了30次會議，重點討論重要的風險管理議題。金管局亦進行了調查，以監察業界對近期企業管治指引的採納情況。此外，金管局、認可機構及其外部核數師三方會議亦舉行了27次。\n\n除非現場活動外，金管局繼續進行定期現場檢查，並就被評為較高風險的範疇進行主題式審查。這種方法使金管局能夠優先調配監管資源，聚焦認可機構面臨的新興及較重大風險。年內，金管局共進行401次現場檢查及主題式審查。信貸風險管理及控制仍為這些檢查和審查的重點。另一個主要重點是科技風險及營運風險管理。金管局亦增加了海外檢查次數，以及針對流動性及市場風險管理、反洗錢及打擊恐怖分子資金籌集（AML/CFT）控制的現場檢查及主題式審查次數。專責團隊亦對認可機構在證券、投資產品、保險及強積金（MPF）相關業務的活動進行了現場檢查。\n\n# 信貸風險監管\n\n# 信貸增長及資產質素\n\n銀行總貸款增長16.1%，對比2016年增長6.5%。如表2所示，貸款增長分布廣泛。\n\n具體而言，與內地相關的貸款增長17.5%，於2017年底達41,880億港元（見表3）。其中包括由在香港註冊銀行的內地子公司所錄得的6,440億港元貸款。\n\n2017年認可機構的資產質素保持健康。零售銀行的不良分類貸款比率由2016年底的0.72%微降至2017年底的0.54%，遠低於自2000年以來2.2%的長期歷史平均水平。整體銀行業的不良分類貸款比率由0.85%降至0.67%。至於與內地相關的貸款，零售銀行該類貸款的不良分類貸款比率由0.82%微降至2017年的0.75%。整體銀行業該比率由一年前的0.80%降至0.67%。\n\n年內，金管局加強監管力度，確保認可機構繼續採取審慎的信貸風險管理標準。特別是加強了對認可機構對大型企業曝險的監察。進行了針對性主題式檢查，重點關注主要信貸風險管理控制，如貸款審批標準、貸款分類及撥備系統、信貸風險管治框架，以及對地產發展商、資產抵押融資及保費融資的貸款風險管理。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n2017年物業價格持續上升。認可機構發放的多按揭或收入來自香港以外的借款人貸款有所增加。鑑於這些發展，金管局於5月19日推出新一輪逆周期宏觀審慎措施。第八輪措施包括：提高認可機構新批住宅按揭貸款計算資本要求的風險權重下限、下調向已有按揭的借款人發放物業按揭貸款的適用按揭成數（LTV）上限，以及下調主要收入來自香港以外的借款人發放物業按揭貸款的適用供款與入息比率（DSR）上限。\n\n自2009年以來，香港金融管理局（HKMA）推出的物業按揭貸款宏觀審慎措施，已加強銀行對與物業市場相關風險的抵禦能力。新批住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數（LTV）由2009年9月反周期措施首次推出前的64%，下降至2017年12月的49%。平均供款與入息比率（DSR）亦由2010年8月首次設限時的41%，降至2017年12月的35%（見圖1）。\n\n金管局觀察到部分發展商以高槓桿為其物業發展項目融資，並向買家提供高按揭成數的按揭貸款。為應對這些發展帶來的風險，金管局於5月12日推出針對向物業發展商放款的新風險管理措施，包括要求認可機構（AIs）下調建築融資的融資上限；要求AIs對於按揭貸款佔權益比例較高的物業發展商貸款，撥備更多資本；以及進行一輪主題式檢查，以確保銀行在向物業發展商放款時，繼續遵循審慎的審批標準。\n\n此外，金管局與土地註冊處合作，於2月推出電子提示（e-Alert）服務。該服務在有關按揭物業於土地註冊處登記新按揭時，會向相關認可機構發出通知，讓按揭銀行可適時採取適當的風險緩解措施。\n\n# 營運及科技風險的監管\n\n網絡安全威脅於年內持續上升。金管局加強監管力度，以提升銀行業的網絡防禦能力。作為2016年推出的網絡安全強化計劃（CFI）的一部分，30家認可機構已完成其網絡防禦成熟度的評估。此外，金管局與證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）在與銀行及證券業界廣泛諮詢後，決定共同推行網上股票買賣的強制性雙重認證措施。金管局亦進行了一輪以銀行網絡安全控制及營運韌性為重點的現場檢查，並與主要銀行高層管理層完成一輪討論，以評估銀行如何應對由科技進步帶來的新市場參與者所構成的策略風險。\n\n# 智慧銀行\n\n金管局於9月宣布一系列措施，協助香港銀行業邁向智慧銀行新時代。在監管方面，金管局將金融科技監管沙盒升級至2.0版本，新增包括銀行及科技公司均可使用的即時諮詢（Chatroom）功能，以及與金管局、證監會及保險業監管局（IA）沙盒之間建立聯繫，為跨界別金融科技產品試驗提供單一入口。\n\n金管局亦推出「簡易銀行服務」計劃，旨在識別及減少監管摩擦，進一步提升客戶使用金融科技及數碼銀行服務的體驗。現已成立專責小組，重點關注遙距開戶及賬戶維護、網上金融及網上財富管理。\n\n現正檢討現有虛擬銀行認可指引，以促進虛擬銀行在香港的發展。\n\n# 庫務活動及流動性風險的監管\n\n隨著美國繼續正常化其貨幣政策，全球資金流動可能日益波動。有鑑於此，金管局於年內加強對流動性風險的監管。金管局進一步完善監管流動性壓力測試，加入更多情景，包括更嚴峻但合理的資金流出情景及短期信心危機引發的銀行擠提情景。金管局亦加強對個別認可機構流動性狀況的監察和分析，並要求部分認可機構提升其流動性風險管理能力。\n\n此外，金管局加強對認可機構債務證券投資組合市場風險管理的現場檢查，並進行一輪主題式檢討，以評估認可機構加大外幣債券投資活動所帶來的潛在風險，以及相關風險管理（包括對沖措施）的成效。\n\n# 防止洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集（ML/TF）\n\n《2017年打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集（金融機構）（修訂）條例草案》已於6月23日刊憲，並將於2018年生效。該修訂旨在使香港的反洗錢及反恐怖分子資金籌集（AML/CFT）監管制度與金融行動特別工作組（FATF）最新國際要求接軌。這些變動，連同對AML/CFT法定指引的更新，將有助於釐清及落實以風險為本的方法於開戶及維持真誠（bona fide）客戶的盡職審查（CDD）流程，並鼓勵在遙距進行相關流程時的創新。"}
{"en": "# International Financial Centre\n\nTo consolidate Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre, the HKMA strives to enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. On fintech, the seven new initiatives aimed at facilitating the development and use of fintech in the banking and payment industries were well received by stakeholders and the public. Hong Kong’s international profile as a financing hub for infrastructure investments was raised further, thanks to a series of efforts on network and capacity building on this front. The launch of Bond Connect reinforced Hong Kong’s position as the main gateway to opportunities in Mainland China. The HKMA’s efforts on other areas such as corporate treasury centres were also bearing fruits.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nIn view of the rapid technological advancements, the HKMA in September announced the launch of seven initiatives to prepare Hong Kong to move into a new era of Smart Banking. These initiatives included:\n- developing the Faster Payment System (FPS) to achieve full connectivity of digital retail payments;\n- introducing an Open Application Programming Interface (Open API) framework;\n- enhancing fintech research and talent development;\n- stepping up cross-border collaboration in fintech;\n- upgrading our existing Fintech Supervisory Sandbox (FSS) 1.0 to Version 2.0;\n- facilitating the introduction of virtual banking; and\n- promoting a new Banking Made Easy initiative to minimise regulatory frictions in customers’ digital experience.\n\nThe HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO), together with the banking departments of the HKMA, played a pivotal role in driving the implementation of these initiatives to strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia.\n\nHong Kong’s international profile as a financing hub for infrastructure investments was raised further, as the number of partners of the HKMA Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO) grew to 87 as at 31 January 2018 from about 40 at inception. During the year, IFFO organised and participated in more than 10 seminars and workshops to facilitate experience sharing and collaborative networking among key stakeholders. In particular, IFFO steered the development of an infrastructure equity investment reference term sheet in its inaugural Debt Financing and Investors’ Roundtables with a view to enhancing infrastructure projects’ bankability and investability.\n\nBond Connect was launched in July, marking another major milestone in mutual access between the Hong Kong and Mainland capital markets, and further solidifying our gateway position for international investors seeking to enter the Mainland market. During the year, Hong Kong’s Renminbi Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (RQFII) quota was increased to RMB500 billion from RMB270 billion. Hong Kong maintained the world’s largest offshore renminbi liquidity pool, with vibrant renminbi financial intermediation activities as evidenced by a high turnover of our renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system and the lion’s share of Hong Kong’s renminbi payment activities in the world.\n\nFollowing the introduction of the tax regime for corporate treasury centres (CTCs) in 2016, the HKMA stepped up its outreach efforts with a view to attracting more multinational corporates to set up treasury centres in Hong Kong. By the end of 2017, more than 40 corporates reflected to the HKMA that they were actively planning to set up, or had set up, treasury centre operations in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA actively contributed to international discussions on issues of significance to global and regional financial stability. The Chief Executive of the HKMA became the Chair of the Standing Committee on Supervisory and Regulatory Co-operation (SRC) of the Financial Stability Board (FSB)1 in April to lead discussions on key financial stability issues.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure lays a solid foundation for Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre and global offshore renminbi business hub. The four interbank RTGS systems and the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) achieved 100% system availability in 2017, as compared to the target of 99.95%. To support Northbound Trading of Bond Connect, CMU has set up accounts with the two Mainland central securities depositories (CSDs) to facilitate the settlement of Bond Connect transactions and holding of Mainland debt securities on behalf of relevant CMU members.\n\nTo promote the general safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA designated four retail payment systems (RPSs) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO) in August to bring their operations under the HKMA’s oversight. The HKMA also conducted supervision of 16 stored value facility (SVF) licensees which actively launched new products and services that sought to offer customers more choices and better user experience. Separately, the coverage of e-Cheque and Electronic Bill Presentment and Payment (EBPP) service was further expanded to include crossboundary payments between Hong Kong and the entire Guangdong Province.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2017\n\n# Hong Kong as a fintech hub in Asia\n\n# Smart Banking Initiatives\n\nIn light of the rapid technological advancements, the HKMA in September announced seven initiatives that would prepare Hong Kong to move into a new era of Smart Banking. The initiatives aimed to help the banking sector to rise to a higher level and embrace the enormous opportunities brought about by the convergence of banking and technology.\n\n“Smart Banking would offer full interconnectivity amongst retail and corporate customers and allow financial services and transactions to be undertaken with great mobility, speed, ease and safety.”\n\nThe HKMA has been working closely with the banking industry and the fintech community, and made good progress in implementing the seven initiatives.\n\n# Faster Payment System\n\nThe FPS is a multi-currency platform that would enable the public to make round-the-clock funds transfers in a real-time manner with ease, through using mobile phone numbers or email addresses. It can support payments in Hong Kong dollars and renminbi. Banks and non-bank payment service providers can participate in the FPS, enabling full connectivity among all payment participants. With system development work close to completion, the FPS is scheduled to launch in September 2018.\n\nFurthermore, the HKMA led a working group, comprising major credit card scheme operators, banks, licensed SVF operators and merchant acquirers, to establish a common QR code standard for retail payments in Hong Kong. A common QR code standard would facilitate merchants in using a single QR code to accept QR code payment solutions from multiple payment service providers, providing greater convenience to customers and merchants. The working group has finalised the relevant technical specification, and would work out the implementation arrangements.\n\n# Open Application Programming Interface\n\nOpen API allows banks’ data to be accessed by third parties to facilitate better and easier integration of services offered by banks and other industries. Users can therefore conveniently stay on one system to enjoy integrated services in a secure environment. To facilitate the development and adoption of Open API by the banking sector, the HKMA has come up with a draft Open API framework, comprising a selection of Open API functions and deployment time frame, technical standards, third-party service provider governance, facilitation measures and maintenance models, for a two-month industry consultation.\n\n# Research and talent development\n\nOne of the major research projects was on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). Following the first DLT whitepaper in 2016, the second whitepaper on DLT was published in October 2017. The second whitepaper further explores the three Proof-of-Concept works, namely trade finance, digital identity management and mortgage application. It also offers advice on the implementation issues relating to governance, legal and compliance, and general control principles on deploying DLT for the banking and payment industries.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan, announces the release of the second whitepaper on DLT at the HKMA Fintech Day.\n\nRiding on the success of the Proof-of-Concept work on trade finance led by the HKMA, seven banks in Hong Kong decided to commercialise the prototype into a production system named Hong Kong Trade Finance Platform (HKTFP) to digitise and share trade documents and automate processes with a view to improving the overall trade process and reducing risks and fraud in the trade finance business.\n\nIn an effort to enlarge the talent pool in the fintech industry, the HKMA launched the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme in collaboration with the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute in December 2016. Response from students was positive. More than 3,000 applications from 421 applicants were received. Finally, 74 students accepted internship offers from the HKMA and 12 banks to work on fintech-related projects for six months or one year starting from July.\n\n# Cross-border collaboration\n\nAs the first step of strengthening our collaboration within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Bay Area, we are partnering with Shenzhen to promote fintech and talent developments. Specifically, the HKMA and the Office of Financial Development Service, the People’s Government of Shenzhen Municipality (OFDS) entered into an agreement in June to (i) provide reciprocal soft-landing support for fintech firms, (ii) co-organise the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Fintech Award in October to recognise and reward outstanding fintech products and solutions in the two cities; and (iii) arrange summer internships at Shenzhen fintech and techfin firms for Hong Kong students.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan (middle), signs and exchanges Memoranda of Understanding on softlanding arrangements with OFDS Director-General, Mr He Xiaojun (left), and Cyberport Chairman, Dr Lee George Lam, at the HKMA Fintech Day.\n\nE-leaflet for the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Fintech Award.\n\nThe HKMA also signed fintech co-operation agreements with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Dubai Financial Services Authority on innovation projects, referrals of innovative businesses, information sharing and exchange of expertise.\n\nIn November, the HKMA further signed a Memorandum of Understanding with MAS to jointly build the Global Trade Connectivity Network (GTCN), which would connect Singapore’s National Trade Platform to the HKTFP to form a cross-border DLT infrastructure in order to digitalise cross-border trade and trade finance processes, making them safer, more efficient and costeffective. It will be an open platform that allows other interested jurisdictions to participate in the future. The GTCN is expected to be launched in the first quarter of 2019.\n\n# Fintech Supervisory Sandbox\n\nThe FSS launched by the HKMA in September 2016 was upgraded to FSS 2.0 to expedite communication with banks and tech firms to facilitate new ideas and initiatives. Specifically, FSS 2.0 has the following new features:\n- A Fintech Supervisory Chatroom is set up to provide feedback to banks and tech firms at an early stage of their fintech projects.\n- Tech firms can access the FSS by seeking feedback from the Chatroom without going through a bank.\n- The sandboxes of the HKMA, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Insurance Authority are linked up so that there is a single point of entry for pilot trials of cross-sector fintech products.\n\nAs of end-2017, 28 new technology products have been tested in the FSS. Out of these cases, 14 pilot trials have been completed, and the relevant products have been rolled out to the market subsequently.\n\n# Banking Made Easy initiative\n\nA Banking Made Easy initiative was launched to minimise regulatory frictions hindering technological innovations. A taskforce has been set up with current focus on the following areas:\n- Remote onboarding and account maintenance\n- Online finance\n- Online wealth management\n\n# Virtual Banking\n\nVirtual banks, which operate without physical branches, are expected to provide additional impetus to the application of fintech in Hong Kong and offer a new kind of customer experience in mobile and digital banking. They may also help promote financial inclusion as they normally target the retail segment, be they individuals or small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The HKMA has commenced the review of the existing Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks with a view to facilitating the introduction of virtual banking in Hong Kong.\n\n# A New Era of Smart Banking\n\n# Supervision and Innovation\n\nThe seven initiatives unveiled by the HKMA last year to prepare Hong Kong for a new era of Smart Banking are a large-scale project involving cooperation among various departments within the HKMA. With fintech becoming an unstoppable force, Mr Raymond Chan, Executive Director (Banking Supervision) of the HKMA, indicated that the HKMA, as a regulator, must embrace this new trend by keeping abreast of the latest technological developments and adjusting its supervisory mindset and approach as appropriate, in order to take bank services and customer experience to a new level.\n", "zh": "# 國際金融中心\n\n為鞏固香港作為國際金融中心的地位，香港金融管理局（HKMA）致力提升香港金融平台的競爭力。在金融科技（Fintech）方面，旨在促進銀行及支付行業金融科技發展與應用的七項新舉措，獲得持份者及公眾的廣泛好評。透過一系列網絡及能力建設的努力，香港作為基礎設施投資融資樞紐的國際形象進一步提升。債券通的推出，進一步強化了香港作為內地機遇主要門戶的地位。金管局在企業財資中心等其他領域的努力亦已初見成效。\n\n# 概覽\n\n鑑於科技迅速發展，金管局於九月宣布推出七項舉措，為香港邁向智能銀行新時代作好準備。這些舉措包括：\n- 發展「轉數快」（Faster Payment System, FPS），實現數碼零售支付的全面互聯互通；\n- 推出開放應用程式介面（Open API）框架；\n- 加強金融科技研究及人才培育；\n- 加強金融科技跨境合作；\n- 將現有金融科技監管沙盒（Fintech Supervisory Sandbox, FSS）1.0升級至2.0版本；\n- 促進虛擬銀行的引入；\n- 推動「輕鬆銀行」新舉措，減少客戶數碼體驗中的監管摩擦。\n\n金管局金融科技促進辦公室（Fintech Facilitation Office, FFO）聯同金管局銀行部門，在推動上述舉措的落實方面發揮了關鍵作用，進一步鞏固香港作為亞洲金融科技樞紐的地位。\n\n隨著金管局基礎設施融資促進辦公室（Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office, IFFO）合作夥伴數目由成立時約40個增至2018年1月31日的87個，香港作為基礎設施投資融資樞紐的國際形象進一步提升。年內，IFFO舉辦及參與超過10場研討會及工作坊，促進主要持份者之間的經驗分享及協作網絡。特別是，IFFO於首次舉辦的債務融資及投資者圓桌會議中，主導制定基礎設施股權投資參考條款表，旨在提升基礎設施項目的可融資性及可投資性。\n\n債券通於七月推出，標誌著香港與內地資本市場互聯互通的又一重大里程碑，進一步鞏固了我們作為國際投資者進入內地市場門戶的地位。年內，香港的人民幣合格境外機構投資者（RQFII）額度由2,700億元人民幣增至5,000億元人民幣。香港繼續保持全球最大離岸人民幣流動資金池，人民幣金融中介活動活躍，體現在人民幣實時全額結算（RTGS）系統的高交易量及香港在全球人民幣支付活動中佔據主導地位。\n\n自2016年引入企業財資中心（CTC）稅制後，金管局加強外展工作，吸引更多跨國企業在港設立財資中心。截至2017年底，超過40家企業向金管局反映，正積極計劃或已在香港設立財資中心業務。\n\n金管局積極參與國際間有關全球及地區金融穩定的重要議題討論。金管局總裁於四月出任金融穩定理事會（FSB）監管合作常設委員會（SRC）主席，領導討論關鍵金融穩定議題。\n\n香港金融基礎設施的安全及高效運作，為香港作為國際金融中心及全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐奠定堅實基礎。四個銀行間實時全額結算（RTGS）系統及中央結算系統（CMU）於2017年均達到100%系統可用性，超越99.95%的目標。為支持債券通北向交易，CMU已在內地兩家中央證券託管機構（CSDs）開設賬戶，便利債券通交易的結算及代表相關CMU會員持有內地債券。\n\n為促進本地零售支付行業的整體安全及效率，金管局於八月根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（PSSVFO）指定四個零售支付系統（RPSs），將其運作納入金管局監管。金管局亦對16家儲值支付工具（SVF）持牌人進行監管，這些持牌人積極推出新產品及服務，為客戶提供更多選擇及更佳用戶體驗。此外，電子支票（e-Cheque）及電子賬單展示及支付（EBPP）服務的覆蓋範圍進一步擴展，涵蓋香港與整個廣東省之間的跨境支付。\n\n# 2017年回顧\n\n# 香港作為亞洲金融科技樞紐\n\n# 智能銀行舉措\n\n鑑於科技迅速發展，金管局於九月宣布七項舉措，為香港邁向智能銀行新時代作好準備。這些舉措旨在協助銀行業提升至更高層次，把握銀行與科技融合帶來的巨大機遇。\n\n「智能銀行將實現零售及企業客戶之間的全面互聯互通，並讓金融服務及交易以高度流動性、快捷、便利及安全的方式進行。」\n\n金管局一直與銀行業及金融科技界緊密合作，並在推動七項舉措的落實方面取得良好進展。\n\n# 轉數快（Faster Payment System）\n\n轉數快是一個多貨幣平台，讓公眾可透過手機號碼或電郵地址，隨時隨地以實時方式輕鬆轉賬。該系統可支援港元及人民幣支付。銀行及非銀行支付服務提供者均可參與轉數快，實現所有支付參與者之間的全面互聯互通。隨著系統開發工作接近完成，轉數快預計於2018年9月推出。\n\n此外，金管局牽頭成立一個工作小組，成員包括主要信用卡計劃營運商、銀行、持牌SVF營運商及商戶收單機構，為香港零售支付建立統一二維碼（QR code）標準。統一QR code標準將便利商戶以單一QR code接受多個支付服務提供者的支付方案，為客戶及商戶帶來更大便利。工作小組已敲定相關技術規格，並將制定實施安排。\n\n# 開放應用程式介面（Open API）\n\n開放API允許第三方存取銀行數據，促進銀行及其他行業服務的更好及更便捷整合。用戶因此可在同一系統內於安全環境下方便地享用綜合服務。為促進銀行業發展及採用開放API，金管局已制定開放API框架草案，包括開放API功能選擇及推行時間表、技術標準、第三方服務供應商治理、推動措施及維護模式，並展開為期兩個月的業界諮詢。\n\n# 研究及人才發展\n\n其中一項主要研究項目是分布式帳本技術（Distributed Ledger Technology，DLT）。繼2016年發表首份DLT白皮書後，第二份DLT白皮書於2017年10月發佈。第二份白皮書進一步探討了三個概念驗證（Proof-of-Concept）項目，分別為貿易融資、數碼身份管理及按揭申請，並就銀行及支付行業在推行DLT時於管治、法律及合規，以及一般控制原則等實施問題提供建議。\n\n香港金融管理局（金管局）總裁陳德霖先生於金管局金融科技日宣布發佈第二份DLT白皮書。\n\n在金管局主導的貿易融資概念驗證項目取得成功的基礎上，香港七家銀行決定將原型系統商業化，推出名為「香港貿易融資平台」（Hong Kong Trade Finance Platform，HKTFP）的生產系統，以數碼化及共享貿易文件，自動化流程，從而提升整體貿易流程，並降低貿易融資業務中的風險及欺詐行為。\n\n為擴大金融科技行業的人才庫，金管局於2016年12月與香港應用科技研究院合作推出「金融科技人才培育計劃」（Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme）。學生反應踴躍，共收到421名申請人遞交的超過3,000份申請。最終，74名學生接受了金管局及12家銀行的實習聘書，於7月起參與為期六個月或一年的金融科技相關項目。\n\n# 跨境合作\n\n作為加強粵港澳大灣區合作的第一步，我們正與深圳攜手推動金融科技及人才發展。具體而言，金管局與深圳市人民政府金融發展服務辦公室（OFDS）於6月簽署協議，內容包括：（一）為金融科技企業提供互惠的「軟著陸」支援；（二）於10月合辦「深港金融科技獎」，表彰兩地傑出的金融科技產品及解決方案；（三）為香港學生安排於深圳金融科技及科技金融企業的暑期實習。\n\n金管局總裁陳德霖先生（中）於金管局金融科技日，與OFDS主任何曉軍先生（左）及數碼港主席林家禮博士（右）簽署並交換「軟著陸」安排的合作備忘錄。\n\n深港金融科技獎電子宣傳單張。\n\n金管局亦與新加坡金融管理局（MAS）及杜拜金融服務管理局簽署金融科技合作協議，涵蓋創新項目、創新企業推薦、資訊共享及專業交流。\n\n2017年11月，金管局進一步與新加坡金融管理局簽署諒解備忘錄，攜手建立「全球貿易聯通網絡」（Global Trade Connectivity Network，GTCN），將新加坡「全國貿易平台」與香港貿易融資平台（HKTFP）連接，構建跨境DLT基礎設施，以數碼化跨境貿易及貿易融資流程，提升安全性、效率及成本效益。該平台將開放予其他有興趣的司法管轄區參與。GTCN預計於2019年第一季推出。\n\n# 金融科技監管沙盒\n\n金管局於2016年9月推出的金融科技監管沙盒（FSS）已升級至FSS 2.0，以加快與銀行及科技企業的溝通，促進新構思及新舉措。FSS 2.0具備以下新功能：\n- 設立「金融科技監管聊天室」，於金融科技項目的早期階段向銀行及科技企業提供反饋。\n- 科技企業可直接透過聊天室獲取反饋，無需經由銀行進入沙盒。\n- 金管局、證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）及保險業監管局的沙盒已互聯，為跨界別金融科技產品的試點測試提供單一入口。\n\n截至2017年底，共有28項新科技產品在FSS中進行測試，其中14項試點測試已完成，相關產品隨後已推向市場。\n\n# 「簡易銀行服務」計劃\n\n金管局推出「簡易銀行服務」計劃，旨在減少阻礙科技創新的監管摩擦。專責小組現時重點關注以下範疇：\n- 遙距開戶及帳戶維護\n- 網上金融服務\n- 網上財富管理\n\n# 虛擬銀行\n\n虛擬銀行無需設立實體分行，預期將為香港金融科技應用帶來新動力，並為流動及數碼銀行服務帶來全新客戶體驗。虛擬銀行通常以零售市場為目標，包括個人及中小企，有助推動普惠金融。金管局已展開現有《虛擬銀行認可指引》的檢討工作，以促進虛擬銀行在香港的引入。\n\n# 智慧銀行新紀元\n\n# 監管與創新\n\n金管局去年公布的七項舉措，旨在為香港迎接智慧銀行新紀元作好準備，這是一項涉及金管局多個部門合作的大型項目。隨著金融科技成為不可逆轉的趨勢，金管局銀行監理部執行董事陳維民先生表示，作為監管機構，金管局必須緊貼最新科技發展，調整監管思維及方式，從而大幅提升銀行服務及客戶體驗。"}
{"en": "# Reserves Management\n\nThe global economy and financial markets performed better than expected in 2017. Global equity markets went up on the back of synchronised economic growth in major developed and emerging market economies, strong corporate earnings, and market expectation of slow and gradual tightening of monetary policies by major central banks. While the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates three times as expected, and began to reduce its balance sheet in October, the 10- Year US Treasury yield remained stable and the US dollar weakened (rather than strengthened) against other major currencies. Under such a favourable environment, the Exchange Fund’s investment income reached a record high of HK$264 billion in 2017, representing an investment return of 7.4%.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary and may be invested in securities or other assets he considers appropriate, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC).\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nEFAC has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n(a) to preserve capital;\n(b) to ensure the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(c) to ensure sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) subject to (a)–(c), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the Fund’s long-term purchasing power.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund.\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP). The BP holds highly liquid US dollardenominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The IP is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of the assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA has been diversifying part of the Exchange Fund’s investments, in a prudent and incremental manner, into a wider variety of asset classes, including emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity and real estate. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The cap for the market value of investments under the LTGP is set at onethird of the accumulated surplus of the Exchange Fund, with further capacity arising from the allocation of part of the Future Fund to long-term assets.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007 to hold shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that were acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes, is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of the unique nature of this Portfolio.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by fiscal reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP1, with the exception of the Future Fund which links its interest rate to both the IP and the LTGP depending on the portfolio mix. As at the end of 2017, the portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 65:35. The portion of the Future Fund linked with the LTGP is expected to gradually build up to around 50% by 2018.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation. The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents the long-term optimal asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark, or strategic allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and tracking error limit are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may take positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nHKMA staff in the Reserves Management Department directly manage about 73% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, which includes the entire BP and part of the IP. This part of the IP includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 27% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes. The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to capture sustainable returns, to benefit from diverse and complementary investment styles and to share market insights and technical expertise with the Exchange Fund.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is primarily determined by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe high volatility of the financial markets subsequent to the 2008/09 global financial crisis has highlighted the importance of risk management. Stringent controls and investment guidelines have been established for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and compliance with guidelines and regulations is closely monitored. Risk assessment has been strengthened to support the Exchange Fund’s increased pace of investment diversification. Risk-control tools are deployed to assess market risks under both normal and adverse market conditions. Detailed performance attribution analyses are also conducted to identify sources of performance, allowing the HKMA to make the best use of the investment skills of internal and external managers.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nThe HKMA is supportive of responsible investment. For instance, the HKMA supports the Principles of Responsible Ownership issued by the Securities and Futures Commission on 7 March 2016, which are voluntary and help investors determine how best to meet their ownership responsibilities in relation to their investments in Hong Kong-listed companies. For the management of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA has encouraged the appointed external fund managers for its Hong Kong equity portfolio to adopt the Principles of Responsible Ownership in managing the investments. Furthermore, the front offices and the Risk Management and Compliance Division have incorporated environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into various internal procedures for making and monitoring investment activities. The HKMA will closely monitor the development of ESG standards and assess how these standards can be further integrated into the investment process.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2017\n\nThe global economy and financial markets in 2017 performed better than expected. On the back of synchronised economic growth in major developed and emerging market economies, strong corporate earnings, and market expectation of slow and gradual tightening of monetary policies by major central banks, the global equity markets performed well. In particular, the Hong Kong equity market rose by 36%, outperforming other major equity markets.\n\nIn the bond markets, short-dated US Treasury yields shot up as the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates three times as expected, and began to reduce its balance sheet in October. Nevertheless, the 10-year US Treasury yield remained stable at about 2.4% over the year. Other major 10-Year government bond yields also ended the year little changed, with the exception of German Bunds which rose on the euro area’s solid economic growth and market expectation of the European Central Bank’s policy tightening.\n\nIn the currency markets, the US dollar weakened against other major currencies, despite the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes and the beginning of its balance sheet reduction. The depreciation of the US dollar was a result of the reviving economic growth in Europe and Japan, and market expectation of diminishing monetary policy divergence between the US and other major economies. The euro and yen appreciated by around 14% and 4% respectively against the US dollar in 2017.\n\nThe performance of major currencies as well as bond and equity markets in 2017 is shown in Table 1.\n\nTable 1 2017 market returns\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$264 billion in 2017. This comprised gains of HK$80.4 billion on overseas equities, gains of HK$58.3 billion on Hong Kong equities, gains of HK$34.4 billion on bonds, a positive currency translation effect of HK$53.5 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets and gains of HK$37.4 billion on other investments held by the investment holding subsidiaries of the Exchange Fund. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$4.5 billion.\n\nThe investment income of HK$264 billion last year is a record high for the Exchange Fund, surpassing the previous record in 2007 (HK$142.2 billion) by HK$121.8 billion.\n\nThe total assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,015.3 billion at year end. The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$235.6 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$157.2 billion and real estate at HK$78.4 billion. Outstanding investment commitments amounted to HK$162.4 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund (excluding the Strategic Portfolio) in 2017 was 7.4%. Specifically, the IP achieved a rate of return of 12.1%, while the BP gained 1.8%. The LTGP recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 13.7% since its inception in 2009.\n\nThe annual return of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2017 is set out in Chart 1. Table 2 shows the 2017 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over several different time horizons. The average return was 2.9% over the past three years, 2.5% over the past five years, 2.2% over the past ten years and 4.9% since 1994.

{"en": "# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communication with the community and the market through the media, public education programmes and other various channels to facilitate public understanding of its policies and operations. During the year, the HKMA continued to improve corporate governance by supporting professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline and enhancing IT security to cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives and the increasing complexity of work.\n\n# ENGAGING THE COMMUNITY CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT\n\n# Media relations\n\nThe HKMA works closely with the media to enhance transparency and promote public understanding about its policies and work. In 2017, 86 open press events were organised, comprising nine press conferences, 16 stand-up interviews and 61 other public functions. In addition, 42 media interviews were arranged and a total of 360 bilingual press releases were issued. It also handles a large number of media enquiries every day.\n\nTo raise awareness of the HKMA’s key functions, guided tours were organised for the media to visit the newly revamped HKMA Information Centre. Furthermore, indepth media briefings and educational workshops were conducted for local and overseas media on a wide range of topics, including the Bond Connect scheme, prudential measures for property mortgage loans, the Resolution Regime and Exchange Fund investments.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan, introduces a mosaic artwork called “Small Change, Big Ode” to the media at the HKMA Information Centre. The artwork, featuring the Victoria Harbour and the Hong Kong skyline, was created using a total of 135,811 pieces of Hong Kong coins in different denominations.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan, conducts a media interview with local newspapers regarding the key initiatives of the HKMA’s Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office and Fintech Facilitation Office.\n\n# Public enquiries\n\nThe Public Enquiry Service provides an effective means for the public to better understand the key functions and operations of the HKMA. A total of 8,752 enquiries were handled in 2017, about half of which were related to banking policies and regulations, monetary and economic issues, consumer banking issues as well as notes and coins. Notable examples included the Coin Collection Programme, banking products and services, bankingrelated guidelines and circulars, monetary and economic statistics, prudential measures for property mortgage loans, and prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received since 2014 and Chart 2 provides a breakdown in terms of the nature of enquiries received in 2017.\n\nChart 1 Total number of public enquiries\n\nChart 2 Nature of enquiries received in 2017\n\n# Publications\n\nApart from the HKMA Annual Report, in 2017 the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report and four issues of the Quarterly Bulletin, and released regular updates of the Monthly Statistical Bulletin to provide up-to-date and thematic information and analyses on monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. In addition, the HKMA issued a total of 23 inSight articles, covering various topical issues related to its work.\n\n# HKMA website\n\nThe HKMA corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk), with over 60,000 pages in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, is the public access gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It also contains the register of authorized institutions (AIs) and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the register of stored value facility (SVF) licensees under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance. Dedicated webpages and eye-catching short-cut links are designed to draw public attention to the new initiatives of the HKMA, such as account opening, the regulatory regime for SVFs, the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office and the Fintech Facilitation Office, as well as important and timely information, such as reminders on the need to remain vigilant against bogus telephone calls and the location of Coin Carts under the Coin Collection Programme.\n\n# Public Education Programme\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre is an important resource for introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters. It consists of an exhibition area and a library, and is open to the public six days a week. The exhibition area introduces the work of the HKMA and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong. It also contains reading materials and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nThe new look of the policy section of the Information Centre, which introduces the work of the HKMA and related financial concepts, was re-opened to the public on 24 February 2017 upon completion of the refurbishment work. The revamped policy section contains various interactive games and devices that integrate play into learning and explain complicated financial concepts in a simple way. Feedback from the visitors has been positive.\n\nStudents try out the educational games at the policy section of the Information Centre to learn about the work of the HKMA.\n\nGuided tours of the Information Centre are organised for visitors. During the year, it received more than 59,000 visitors and hosted over 650 guided tours for schools and other groups (Chart 3). More than 645,000 people have visited the Information Centre since it opened in December 2003.\n\nThe library, situated next to the exhibition area, houses more than 23,000 books, journals and other publications for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs and central banking topics. It also maintains the register of AIs and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nThe library in the HKMA Information Centre.\n\nTo reach out to the community and raise public awareness of the HKMA’s work, the HKMA organised four public education seminars for about 2,000 secondary school students and teachers in 2017. Topics covered in the seminars included the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, banking stability, consumer protection, the Deposit Protection Scheme, fintech, the Belt and Road Initiative and careers in the financial industry. More than 58,400 people have participated in this public education programme since its launch in 1998.\n\nStudents and teachers from secondary schools in different districts participate in one of the public education seminars.\n\nChart 3 Types of group visits to the Information Centre in 2017\n\n# HUMAN RESOURCES\n\nThe HKMA recruits, develops and maintains a highly professional workforce to support its policy objectives and respond flexibly to changing work priorities. While the HKMA is an integral part of the Government, it employs staff on terms different from those of the civil service to attract personnel with the right experience and expertise. As a public organisation, the HKMA aims to maintain a lean and flexible structure and, where possible, to redeploy staff resources to undertake new initiatives and meet increasing workload.\n\n# Organisational changes\n\nThe Resolution Office was established on 1 April 2017 to implement the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance enacted in June 2016. The Office aims to ensure that the Hong Kong resolution regime is operational for banks. This is essential to enhancing the resilience of the Hong Kong banking sector in the event of any crisis.\n\n# Staffing\n\nThe establishment of the HKMA in 2017 was 927. This will be increased by 35 to 962 in 2018 (an increase of 3.8%) to ensure that sufficient resources are provided to cope with the new initiatives and the increasing complexity and volume of existing work. The new posts are deployed to the following functions:\n\n- Enhancing banking and financial stability, which includes:\n    – enhancing capacity to support the launch of the Faster Payment System and easy banking initiatives;\n    – strengthening supervisory capacity to deal with the regional and business expansion of banks and to facilitate (i) the wider adoption of fintech in the provision of banking services and (ii) collaboration with other regulatory authorities on cyber security and fintech issues; and\n    – supporting the work of the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce to fight against fraud, money laundering and other types of financial crimes, and strengthening legal support for enforcement actions under legislation governing anti-money laundering and SVFs.\n- Strengthening investment, risk management and other related support for the further expansion and diversification of the Exchange Fund’s investment activities.\n- Stepping up global macro and financial-sector surveillance, and strengthening talent development programmes to ensure that the HKMA has the necessary human capital to meet the long-term development needs of the organisation.\n\nTable 1 gives a breakdown of the establishment and strength of the HKMA.\n\nTable 1 Establishment and strength of the HKMA on 1 January 2018\n\nTemporary resources are deployed to meet other work demands. The HKMA also transfers staff members on secondment to other international or local organisations, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Services Development Council, to assist in activities or policy initiatives in which Hong Kong or the HKMA has an interest. Some staff members are deployed on a full-time or part-time basis to provide operational support to the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board and the Treasury Markets Association.\n\n# Remuneration policies and pay review mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary (FS) determines the pay and conditions of service for HKMA staff on the advice of the Governance Sub-Committee (GSC) through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC), taking into account the prevailing market rates and practices. Remuneration comprises a total cash package and a provident fund scheme, with minimal benefits in kind. The cash package consists of monthly fixed pay (or basic pay) and variable pay, which may be awarded to individual staff members as a lump sum once a year, depending on performance.\n\nPay for HKMA staff is reviewed annually by the FS in the light of recommendations made to him by the GSC through the EFAC, taking into account the GSC’s assessment of the performance of the HKMA in the preceding year, the paysurvey findings of the financial sector conducted by independent human resources consultants, and any other relevant factors. Special pay adjustments may be made from time to time for individual meritorious staff members to maintain their pay competitiveness.\n\nAny approved annual adjustments to the fixed pay and any variable pay awards for the HKMA are distributed to individual staff members based on their performance. Investment professionals in the HKMA are subject to a variable pay system that seeks to strengthen the link between their investment performance and remuneration award. The pay adjustments and awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Executive Director and above are approved by the FS on the advice of the GSC. The staff members concerned are not present at the meetings when their pay is discussed. The pay adjustments and awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Division Head and below are determined by the Chief Executive of the HKMA under delegated authority from the FS and within the approved overall pay awards.\n\n# Remuneration of senior staff members\n\nThe remuneration packages of senior staff members in 2017 are shown in Table 2.\n\nTable 2 Remuneration packages of HKMA senior staff members in 2017\n\n# Manager Trainee (MT) and Graduate Economist (GE) programmes\n\nTo develop a pool of young talent with sharp analytical minds, strong communication skills and good team spirit for a long-term career in central banking, the HKMA runs two trainee programmes: the MT programme and the GE programme. Each programme lasts for a period of two years.\n\nThe MT programme prepares young graduates interested in central banking work to become the HKMA’s future key management staff and contribute to the financial stability and prosperity of Hong Kong. Each MT undergoes on-the-job training in two to three departments to acquire hands-on experience on the important functions of the HKMA.

{"en": "# The Exchange Fund\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 157 to 243, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2017, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2017, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards.  My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report.  I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards.  I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017.  These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information.  The other information comprises all the information included in the 2017 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.  If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact.  I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.  I also:\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.  The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.  If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion.  My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report.  However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and\n- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements.  I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit.  I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nDavid Sun\nDirector of Audit\n\n11 April 2018\n\n# 1 PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES\n\nThe Monetary Authority, under delegated authority from the Financial Secretary as Controller of the Exchange Fund (the Fund), manages the Fund in accordance with the provisions of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).  The principal activities of the Fund are safeguarding the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong and maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems.\n\nThe assets of the Fund are managed as four portfolios: the Backing Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio and the Strategic Portfolio.  The assets of the Backing Portfolio fully match the Monetary Base, under Hong Kong’s Currency Board system.  The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.  The Long-Term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments.  The Strategic Portfolio holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited acquired by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) for the account of the Fund for strategic purposes. Operating segment information is set out in note 30.\n\n# 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n# 2.1 Statement of compliance\n\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with all applicable Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRSs), which is a collective term that includes all applicable individual Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, Hong Kong Accounting Standards (HKASs) and Interpretations issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), and accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong.  A summary of the significant accounting policies adopted by the Fund and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) is set out below.\n\nThe HKICPA has issued certain new and revised HKFRSs that are first effective or available for early adoption for the current accounting period.  Note 3 provides information on the changes, if any, in accounting policies resulting from initial adoption of these developments to the extent that they are relevant to the Group for the current and prior accounting periods reflected in these financial statements.\n\n# 2.2 Basis of preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe Group financial statements include the financial statements of the Group as well as the Group’s interests in associates and joint ventures.  The principal activities of the principal subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are shown in notes 16 and 17.\n\nThe measurement basis used in the preparation of the financial statements is historical cost except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair values as explained in the accounting policies set out below:\n- trading financial instruments (note 2.6.2.1);\n- financial assets and financial liabilities designated at fair value (note 2.6.2.2);\n- available-for-sale securities (note 2.6.2.5);\n- gold (note 2.11); and\n- investment properties (note 2.12).\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with HKFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure.  The estimates and associated assumptions are based on experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.  Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nNote 18 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of investment properties.  Note 36 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of financial instruments.  Apart from the accounting judgements involving these fair value estimations, there are no other critical accounting judgements involved in the application of the Group’s accounting policies.\n\n# 2.3 Subsidiaries and non-controlling interests\n\nA subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group.  The Group controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.  When assessing whether the Group has power, only substantive rights (held by the Group and other parties) are considered.\n", "zh": "# 外匯基金\n\n# 審計署署長報告\n\n# 獨立核數師報告 致財政司司長\n\n# 意見\n\n本人證明，已審核載於第157至243頁的外匯基金及其附屬公司（「本集團」）的財務報表，包括截至2017年12月31日的外匯基金及本集團的資產負債表，以及截至該日止年度的收支帳目、全面收益表、權益變動表及現金流量表，以及財務報表附註，包括主要會計政策概要。\n\n本人認為，該等財務報表已根據香港會計師公會（「HKICPA」）頒布的《香港財務報告準則》（「HKFRSs」）及根據《外匯基金條例》（第66章）第7條行政長官所作指示，真實而公平地反映了截至2017年12月31日外匯基金及本集團的財務狀況，以及該年度的財務表現和現金流量，並已妥善編製。\n\n# 意見的基礎\n\n本人根據《外匯基金條例》第7條行政長官所作指示及審計署審計準則進行審計。本人在本報告「核數師對財務報表審計的責任」部分進一步說明了根據該等準則所承擔的責任。本人根據該等準則，對本集團保持獨立，並已履行其他道德責任。本人相信，所獲得的審計證據足以及適當，作為發表意見的基礎。\n\n# 核心審計事項\n\n核心審計事項是指本人在專業判斷下，認為對截至2017年12月31日止年度財務報表審計最為重要的事項。這些事項是在整體審計財務報表及形成意見時處理的，並非對這些事項單獨發表意見。\n\n# 其他資料\n\n金融管理專員負責其他資料。其他資料包括香港金融管理局2017年年報中除財務報表及本人核數師報告以外的所有資料。\n\n本人對財務報表的意見不涵蓋其他資料，亦不對該等資料發表任何形式的保證結論。\n\n在審計財務報表過程中，本人有責任閱讀其他資料，並在此過程中考慮該等資料是否與財務報表或本人在審計中獲得的知識存在重大不一致，或是否顯示出重大錯誤陳述。如根據本人所執行的工作，認為其他資料存在重大錯誤陳述，必須報告有關事實。就此而言，並無事項須予報告。\n\n# 金融管理專員及外匯基金諮詢委員會審核小組對財務報表的責任\n\n金融管理專員負責根據香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》及《外匯基金條例》第7條行政長官所作指示，編製能夠真實而公平反映的財務報表，並負責其認為為編製不含重大錯誤陳述（無論因舞弊或錯誤而產生）財務報表所必需的內部控制。\n\n在編製財務報表時，金融管理專員負責評估本集團持續經營的能力，並在適用時披露與持續經營有關的事項，以及採用持續經營會計基礎。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會審核小組負責監督本集團的財務報告程序。\n\n# 核數師對財務報表審計的責任\n\n本人的目標是就整體財務報表是否不含重大錯誤陳述（無論因舞弊或錯誤而產生）取得合理保證，並出具包括本人意見的核數師報告。合理保證屬高層次保證，但並不能保證根據審計署審計準則進行的審計在存在重大錯誤陳述時必然能發現。錯誤陳述可能因舞弊或錯誤而產生，若單獨或匯總起來，合理預期會影響使用者根據該等財務報表作出的經濟決定，則屬重大。\n\n根據審計署審計準則進行審計時，本人運用專業判斷，並在整個審計過程中保持專業懷疑態度。此外，本人亦：\n- 識別及評估因舞弊或錯誤導致財務報表存在重大錯誤陳述的風險，設計及執行針對該等風險的審計程序，並獲取足夠及適當的審計證據作為發表意見的基礎。由於舞弊可能涉及串謀、偽造、蓄意遺漏、虛假陳述或凌駕內部控制，故未能發現因舞弊導致的重大錯誤陳述的風險高於因錯誤導致者；\n- 了解與審計相關的內部控制，以設計適當的審計程序，但並非為對本集團內部控制的有效性發表意見；\n- 評估金融管理專員所採用會計政策的恰當性及所作會計估計及相關披露的合理性；\n- 就金融管理專員採用持續經營會計基礎的恰當性作出結論，並根據所獲得的審計證據，判斷是否存在與本集團持續經營能力產生重大疑慮的事項或情況。如本人認為存在重大不確定性，須在核數師報告中提請注意財務報表中的相關披露，或如該等披露不足，則須修改意見。本人之結論乃基於截至核數師報告日所獲得的審計證據。然而，未來事件或情況可能導致本集團無法持續經營；\n- 評估財務報表的整體列報方式、結構及內容，包括披露事項，以及財務報表是否以公平列報方式反映基礎交易及事項；\n- 就本集團內各實體或業務活動的財務資料獲取足夠及適當的審計證據，以對財務報表發表意見。本人負責集團審計的指導、監督及執行，並對審計意見承擔全部責任。\n\n本人與外匯基金諮詢委員會審核小組溝通，包括審計計劃範圍及時間安排，以及重大審計發現，包括在審計過程中發現的任何重大內部控制缺陷。\n\n本人亦向外匯基金諮詢委員會審核小組聲明，已遵守有關獨立性的道德規範，並就所有可能合理被認為會影響本人獨立性之關係及其他事項（包括相關防護措施，如適用）與其溝通。\n\n根據與外匯基金諮詢委員會審核小組溝通的事項，我確定在本期財務報表審計中最為重要的事項，並因此將其界定為關鍵審計事項。除非法律或法規禁止對該事項公開披露，或在極為罕見的情況下，我認為某事項不應在報告中溝通，因為這樣做所帶來的不利後果可合理預期將超過此類溝通所帶來的公共利益，否則我會在審計師報告中描述這些事項。\n\n孫德基\n審計署署長\n\n2018年4月11日\n\n# 1 主要業務\n\n金管局根據財政司司長作為外匯基金（下稱「基金」）管理人的授權，依據《外匯基金條例》（第66章）管理基金。基金的主要業務為維護香港貨幣的匯率價值，以及維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定和完整性。\n\n基金的資產分為四個投資組合管理：外匯基金票據組合、投資組合、長遠增長組合及策略組合。外匯基金票據組合的資產完全對應貨幣基礎，根據香港的貨幣發行局制度運作。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織（OECD）成員國的債券及股票市場。長遠增長組合持有私募股權及房地產投資。策略組合則持有由香港特別行政區政府為基金帳戶策略性目的而購入的香港交易及結算所有限公司（港交所）股份。有關經營分部的資料載於附註30。\n\n# 2 主要會計政策\n\n# 2.1 合規聲明\n\n本財務報表乃根據所有適用的《香港財務報告準則》（HKFRSs）編製，該術語包括所有適用的個別《香港財務報告準則》、《香港會計準則》（HKASs）及香港會計師公會（HKICPA）頒布的詮釋，以及香港普遍採納的會計原則。基金及其附屬公司（統稱「本集團」）所採納的主要會計政策摘要如下。\n\n香港會計師公會已頒布若干於本會計期首次生效或可供提前採納的新訂及經修訂的香港財務報告準則。附註3載有有關首次採納這些準則（如適用於本集團並反映於本期及以往會計期財務報表中）而導致會計政策變動的資料。\n\n# 2.2 財務報表的編製基準\n\n本集團財務報表包括本集團的財務報表，以及本集團於聯營公司及合營企業的權益。主要附屬公司、聯營公司及合營企業的主要業務載於附註16及17。\n\n財務報表的編製以歷史成本為基礎，但下列資產及負債則根據下述會計政策以公允價值列賬：\n- 交易性金融工具（附註2.6.2.1）；\n- 指定以公允價值計量的金融資產及金融負債（附註2.6.2.2）；\n- 可供出售證券（附註2.6.2.5）；\n- 黃金（附註2.11）；及\n- 投資物業（附註2.12）。\n\n根據香港財務報告準則編製財務報表，管理層需作出判斷、估計及假設，影響政策的應用及資產、負債、收入及支出的報告金額。這些估計及相關假設乃根據經驗及於有關情況下被認為合理的各種其他因素作出，其結果構成對資產及負債賬面價值作出判斷的基礎，而這些價值未必能從其他來源直接得知。實際結果可能與這些估計有所不同。\n\n這些估計及相關假設會持續檢討。會計估計的修訂，若僅影響本期，則於本期確認；若影響本期及未來期間，則於本期及未來期間確認。\n\n有關投資物業公允價值估值假設的資料載於附註18。有關金融工具公允價值估值假設的資料載於附註36。除涉及這些公允價值估值的會計判斷外，於應用本集團會計政策時，並無其他關鍵會計判斷。\n\n# 2.3 附屬公司及非控股權益\n\n附屬公司指由本集團控制的實體。當本集團因參與該實體而承擔可變回報的風險或享有相關權利，並有能力通過對該實體的權力影響這些回報時，即視為本集團控制該實體。在評估本集團是否擁有權力時，僅考慮本集團及其他方所持有的實質性權利。"}

{"zh": "# 總裁報告\n\n2016年的全球政經舞台上「黑天鵝」身影頻仍，英國脫歐公投和美國總統大選結果固然令各種民調淪為笑柄，但更出乎意料的卻是金融市場的反應。以美國大選為例，特朗普當選消息令美股三大指數的期貨在開市前急挫，但開市不久美股指數隨即反彈，此後凱歌高奏，屢創新高。連串事件，凸顯了傳統智慧和思維對預測市場能力的局限性，也標誌着未來環球局勢發展的重大不確定性。\n\n過去一年，多項主要金融數據都反映市場情緒異常敏感：美國十年期國庫債券收益率在7月跌至1.36厘歷史低位後，在美國總統大選後的12月中旬飆升至2.6厘。反映美元兌一籃子貨幣走勢的美匯指數在年底升至14年高位；紐約原油期貨價格由年初每桶26美元低位反彈至年底的54美元。本港股市方面，恒生指數全年微升86點，但期內峰谷差逾6,000點。外圍形勢驚濤駭浪，更形金融體系尤其是貨幣和銀行體系穩定的重要和可貴。\n\n2016年1月，國際對沖基金部署狙擊人民幣和港元的傳言甚囂塵上，人心虛怯。金管局迅即向市場發放明確、堅定的訊息，我們絕對有信心、有能力捍衛聯匯制度和香港的金融體系穩定，適時穩住了市場信心。綜觀2016年全年，港元長時間貼近強方兌換保證。由於銀行體系資金非常充裕，即使去年12月和今年3月美國聯儲局加息，對港元利率和匯率並未有明顯的即時影響。\n\n香港銀行體系繼續穩步發展，去年整體貸款錄得6.5%溫和增長，資產質素保持良好，不良貸款比率維持在0.85%的健康水平，遠低於2000年以來約2%的長期平均水平。銀行體系的資本充足率和流動性比率均保持在高於法定要求的高水平。在樓宇按揭業務方面，經過七輪逆周期措施，新造住宅物業按揭平均成數從2009年9月的64%下降至2016年底的51%，平均供款與入息比率也從2010年8月的41%下降至2016年底的34%，為樓市周期一旦逆轉而令銀行體系受到衝擊時，提供了所需的緩衝。金管局會繼續密切留意樓市的發展，因應周期變化而採取合適措施，以保持銀行體系穩定。\n\n進一步強化銀行體系穩定的立法工作去年取得令人鼓舞的進展。優化存款保障制度和針對金融機構「大得不能倒」風險的兩條法例，及時在上屆立法會任期屆滿前順利通過。前者加快存款保障金的發放速度，簡化發放程序，有助加強存戶對銀行體系的信心；後者則為包括銀行在內的金融機構建立處置機制，防範這些機構一旦倒閉而引發的系統性金融風險，並盡量避免動用公帑為它們「包底埋單」。金管局已在今年4月1日設立處置機制辦公室，落實執行法例的要求和跟進工作。\n\n銀行業素有「百業之母」之稱，是實體經濟和普羅市民日常生活倚重的儲蓄、支付渠道和信貸來源。年內，部分中小企業界代表反映融資有困難。金管局即時與銀行界溝通，希望銀行在維持審慎風險管理的情況下，盡可能為中小企的營運和發展繼續提供資金支援。我們又透過轄下香港按揭證券公司，加強向工商界推廣政府的「中小企融資擔保計劃」，並與銀行業界緊密溝通，以釋除疑慮、釐清誤解及理順處理壞帳的索償程序，從而提高銀行參與該計劃的意願。多管齊下，收到了一定成效，根據金管局對銀行進行的調查，中小企整體信貸額度在去年保持平穩，超過九成企業的信貸額度得以維持甚至增加。同時，「中小企融資擔保計劃」的申請數字亦明顯上升。\n\n近年來金管局大力推動普及金融，就是考慮到基本銀行服務已是營商和日常生活不可或缺的環節。去年當我們得知有些海外公司和初創企業在香港開戶遇到困難後，旋即展開跟進工作，與多個國際商會和企業協會聯繫，並跟銀行業界深入溝通，對症下藥。去年9月我向香港所有銀行簽發通告，闡釋應如何理解金管局針對反洗錢和恐怖分子資金籌集活動的「風險為本」監管原則，如何將這項原則應用在開戶申請和對現有客戶的盡職審查措施上，強調銀行不應對所有客戶採用「一刀切」的要求和程序。經我們與銀行和商界協商後，企業開戶情況有所改善，但仍有進步空間，這也是我們今年工作重點之一。\n\n普及金融還涉及銀行分行服務的覆蓋面。金管局一直鼓勵銀行在營商圖利之餘，也要顧及市民的基本銀行服務需要。金融科技一日千里，銀行提供服務的渠道也更趨多元化。除了日益普及的網上銀行服務外，去年多家銀行紛紛推出流動銀行車或視像櫃員機服務，提供較傳統櫃員機更貼身、更全面的銀行服務。在我們的推動下，多家銀行也計劃在偏遠地區設立實體分行，加強對當區居民的服務。\n\n金融中心的發展就如逆水行舟，因此，金管局多年來不斷為香港金融業發展尋求新的契機，開拓新的領域。2016年可說是成果豐碩的一年，當中又以金融科技(Fintech)和基建融資為亮點。\n\n在金融科技方面，香港的零售支付服務在2016年進入新時代。金管局去年發出13個儲值支付工具牌照，通過發牌和恒常監管制度為零售支付服務創造有利的營商環境，配以一系列公眾教育宣傳，讓消費者在享受新科技帶來的便捷之餘，權益也得到合理保障。\n\n此外，去年3月金管局成立了金融科技促進辦公室，以此平台推動與銀行業相關的金融科技發展。幾個月間，我們推出多項新猷，包括「網絡防衛計劃」(Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative)，為強化銀行體系網絡安全建立風險評估、資訊共享和人才培訓三足鼎立的新平台。我們並與香港應用科技研究院（應科院）合作，開展分布式分類帳技術(distributed ledger technology)專項研究，探討該技術在香港銀行業應用的可行性，並在應科院設立金融科技創新中心(Fintech Innovation Hub)，為銀行業界和金融科技界提供技術支援。金管局的銀行監管部門還設立「金融科技監管沙盒」(Fintech Supervisory Sandbox)，讓銀行在較小和可控範圍內測試新技術的應用，為新產品、新服務的開發提速。自去年9月至今年3月，已有6家銀行共14項新技術項目使用沙盒進行測試，部分項目亦已相繼推出市場，為市民帶來更多金融科技的新產品。\n\n世界各地對基建融資的需求巨大，特別是「一帶一路」倡議提出以來，基建融資更成中外矚目的議題。香港是亞洲的國際金融中心，在基建融資領域極具優勢。去年7月金管局成立了基建融資促進辦公室(Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office，簡稱IFFO)，搭建一個嶄新和獨特的平台，匯聚60多家世界級的多邊機構、機構投資者、銀行、保險公司和其他金融機構、基建項目的建設和營運方、各類專業機構等，就基建投融資課題互通訊息、交流經驗、尋求合作機會。IFFO成立至今已舉辦十多場大型會議、研討會和工作坊，金管局並分別與國際金融公司(International Finance Corporation)、全球基礎設施中心(Global Infrastructure Hub)、國家開發銀行(China Development Bank)和中國進出口銀行(The Export-Import Bank of China)簽署了共同促進基建投融資活動的《諒解備忘錄》。起步時間雖然不長，但為香港未來作為基建投融資中心奠下堅實的基礎。\n\n拆牆鬆綁是提升競爭力的不二法門。年內，金管局積極參與和支援特區政府修訂稅務條例，向在港經營集團內部財資業務的企業提供有利的稅務環境。我們並積極接觸跨國企業，吸引它們來港發展或擴充企業財資活動，藉此進一步強化香港金融市場的功能。\n\n去年的離岸人民幣市場處於調整期。受市場波動和對人民幣匯率預期等因素影響，全球離岸人民幣資金池規模普遍收縮。儘管如此，香港仍穩執離岸人民幣業務的牛耳，保持全球最大的人民幣資金池，經香港結算的人民幣維持在日均約8,600億元人民幣高位。為進一步優化香港離岸人民幣市場的流動性安排，去年10月我們將一級流動性提供行由7家增至9家，支援雙邊流動資金的總額度由原來的140億元人民幣增至180億元，確保在離岸人民幣市場資金出現緊絀的情況下，仍可保持市場有序運作。去年12月股票市場「深港通」開通，令香港的人民幣業務再添動力。金管局亦正與內地有關當局研究「債券通」方案，進一步便利兩地投資者參與債券市場，並優化債券市場基礎設施的聯繫。\n\n儘管去年全球投資環境充斥着各種不穩因素，但有賴於過去一段時間所採取的多項防禦性部署，外匯基金去年錄得681億港元投資收入。自1994年以來外匯基金的複合年度投資回報率達4.8%，高於同期2.1%的本地通脹率。\n\n外匯基金將繼續推動多元化投資，包括進一步擴展資產類別，加大對於信貸資產、抵禦通脹類投資產品和新興市場的投資。而作為多元化投資旗艦的「長期增長組合」，透過私募股權和房地產項目等投資於另類資產。該組合自2009年啟動以來一直保持不俗的成績，成立至今的平均內部回報率年率約12%，而隨着政府「未來基金」部分投放於該組合，我們加快了投資步伐，去年底「長期增長組合」的資產規模約1,818億港元，已批出但未提取作投資的總額約1,338億港元。外匯基金將繼續恪守「保本先行、長期增值」的投資策略，在保持充裕的流動性和備用資金的前提下，尋求長遠穩定的回報。\n", "en": "# Chief Executive’s Report\n\nIn 2016, the global political and economic stage was frequently visited by \"black swan\" events. The outcomes of the Brexit referendum and the US presidential election not only rendered various public opinion polls a laughingstock, but even more surprising was the reaction of the financial markets. Take the US election as an example: news of Trump’s victory caused the futures of the three major US stock indices to plunge before the market opened, but shortly after opening, the indices rebounded and subsequently surged triumphantly, repeatedly reaching new highs. This series of events highlighted the limitations of traditional wisdom and thinking in predicting markets, and also signaled significant uncertainty in the future development of the global landscape.\n\nOver the past year, several major financial indicators reflected an unusually sensitive market sentiment: the yield on the US 10-year Treasury bond fell to a historic low of 1.36% in July, then surged to 2.6% in mid-December after the US presidential election. The US Dollar Index, which tracks the performance of the dollar against a basket of currencies, rose to a 14-year high by year-end; New York crude oil futures rebounded from a low of US$26 per barrel at the beginning of the year to US$54 by year-end. In Hong Kong’s stock market, the Hang Seng Index edged up by 86 points for the year, but the peak-to-trough difference exceeded 6,000 points during the period. Amidst such turbulent external conditions, the importance and value of maintaining the stability of the financial system—especially the monetary and banking systems—became even more apparent.\n\nIn January 2016, rumors of international hedge funds preparing to attack the renminbi and the Hong Kong dollar were rampant, causing widespread unease. The HKMA promptly delivered a clear and firm message to the market: we have absolute confidence and capability to defend the Linked Exchange Rate System and the stability of Hong Kong’s financial system, thereby stabilizing market confidence in a timely manner. Looking at the whole of 2016, the Hong Kong dollar remained close to the strong-side Convertibility Undertaking for extended periods. Due to the ample liquidity in the banking system, even after the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates in December last year and March this year, there was no significant or immediate impact on Hong Kong dollar interest rates or the exchange rate.\n\nHong Kong’s banking system continued to develop steadily, with overall loans recording a moderate growth of 6.5% last year. Asset quality remained sound, with the non-performing loan ratio staying at a healthy level of 0.85%, well below the long-term average of about 2% since 2000. Both the capital adequacy ratio and liquidity ratio of the banking system remained well above statutory requirements. In the area of mortgage lending, after seven rounds of counter-cyclical measures, the average loan-to-value ratio for new residential mortgages fell from 64% in September 2009 to 51% at the end of 2016, while the average debt service ratio dropped from 41% in August 2010 to 34% at the end of 2016. These provide the necessary buffer for the banking system in the event of a market downturn. The HKMA will continue to closely monitor developments in the property market and adopt appropriate measures in response to cyclical changes to maintain the stability of the banking system.\n\nLegislative work to further strengthen the stability of the banking system made encouraging progress last year. Two pieces of legislation—one to enhance the deposit protection scheme and another to address the \"too big to fail\" risk of financial institutions—were successfully passed before the end of the previous Legislative Council term. The former expedites the payout of deposit protection funds and simplifies the claims procedure, helping to strengthen depositors’ confidence in the banking system; the latter establishes a resolution mechanism for financial institutions, including banks, to guard against systemic financial risks in the event of their failure and to avoid, as far as possible, the use of public funds to bail them out. The HKMA established the Resolution Office on 1 April this year to implement and follow up on the requirements of the legislation.\n\nThe banking industry, long known as the \"mother of all industries,\" is a vital source of savings, payment channels, and credit for the real economy and the daily lives of ordinary citizens. During the year, some SME representatives reported difficulties in obtaining financing. The HKMA immediately communicated with the banking sector, encouraging banks to continue providing funding support for the operations and development of SMEs as far as possible, while maintaining prudent risk management. Through the Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation, we also stepped up promotion of the Government’s \"SME Financing Guarantee Scheme\" to the business sector, and maintained close communication with the banking industry to dispel doubts, clarify misunderstandings, and streamline the claims procedures for bad debts, thereby increasing banks’ willingness to participate in the scheme. These multi-pronged efforts have yielded results: according to HKMA surveys, the overall credit lines for SMEs remained stable last year, with over 90% of enterprises having their credit lines maintained or even increased. At the same time, applications for the \"SME Financing Guarantee Scheme\" also rose significantly.\n\nIn recent years, the HKMA has vigorously promoted financial inclusion, recognizing that basic banking services are indispensable for business operations and daily life. Last year, upon learning that some overseas companies and start-ups were encountering difficulties in opening accounts in Hong Kong, we immediately followed up, liaising with various international chambers of commerce and business associations, and engaging in in-depth discussions with the banking sector to address the issues. In September last year, I issued a circular to all banks in Hong Kong, explaining how to interpret the HKMA’s \"risk-based\" regulatory principle for anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing, and how to apply this principle to account opening and ongoing customer due diligence. I emphasized that banks should not adopt a \"one-size-fits-all\" approach to requirements and procedures for all customers. Following our consultations with banks and the business community, the situation regarding account opening for businesses has improved, though there is still room for further progress. This remains one of our key priorities for this year.\n\nFinancial inclusion also involves the coverage of bank branch services. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has consistently encouraged banks to consider the basic banking service needs of the public, in addition to pursuing commercial profit. With the rapid advancement of financial technology, banks are offering increasingly diversified service channels. In addition to the growing popularity of online banking services, last year, several banks launched mobile banking vehicles and video teller machine services, providing more personalized and comprehensive banking services than traditional ATMs. Driven by our efforts, a number of banks are also planning to establish physical branches in remote areas to enhance services for local residents.\n\nThe development of a financial center is like sailing against the current; therefore, the HKMA has, over the years, continuously sought new opportunities and explored new frontiers for the development of Hong Kong’s financial industry. The year 2016 can be described as a fruitful one, with particular highlights in financial technology (Fintech) and infrastructure financing.\n\nIn terms of financial technology, Hong Kong’s retail payment services entered a new era in 2016. Last year, the HKMA issued 13 stored value payment instrument licenses, creating a favorable business environment for retail payment services through licensing and ongoing regulatory regimes. This was complemented by a series of public education campaigns, ensuring that while consumers enjoy the convenience brought by new technology, their rights and interests are also reasonably protected.\n\nIn addition, in March last year, the HKMA established the Fintech Facilitation Office as a platform to promote the development of fintech related to the banking industry. Within a few months, we launched several new initiatives, including the Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative, which established a new three-pronged platform for strengthening the banking system’s cybersecurity through risk assessment, information sharing, and talent development. We also collaborated with the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute (ASTRI) to conduct dedicated research on distributed ledger technology, exploring its applicability in Hong Kong’s banking sector, and established the Fintech Innovation Hub at ASTRI to provide technical support to the banking and fintech industries. The HKMA’s Banking Supervision Department also set up the Fintech Supervisory Sandbox, allowing banks to test new technologies within a smaller and controlled environment, thereby accelerating the development of new products and services. From September last year to March this year, six banks have used the sandbox to test a total of 14 new technology projects, some of which have already been launched in the market, bringing more fintech products to the public.\n\nThere is enormous global demand for infrastructure financing, especially since the launch of the Belt and Road Initiative, which has brought infrastructure financing into the international spotlight. As an international financial center in Asia, Hong Kong holds significant advantages in this field. In July last year, the HKMA established the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO), creating a new and unique platform that brings together more than 60 world-class multilateral institutions, institutional investors, banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions, infrastructure project developers and operators, and various professional organizations to exchange information, share experiences, and seek cooperation opportunities on infrastructure investment and financing. Since its establishment, IFFO has organized more than ten major conferences, seminars, and workshops. The HKMA has also signed Memoranda of Understanding with the International Finance Corporation, the Global Infrastructure Hub, the China Development Bank, and The Export-Import Bank of China to jointly promote infrastructure investment and financing activities. Although the initiative is still in its early stages, it has laid a solid foundation for Hong Kong’s future as a center for infrastructure investment and financing.\n\nRemoving barriers and relaxing restrictions is the key to enhancing competitiveness. During the year, the HKMA actively participated in and supported the SAR Government’s amendment of tax ordinances to provide a favorable tax environment for enterprises conducting group treasury activities in Hong Kong. We also proactively engaged with multinational corporations to attract them to develop or expand their corporate treasury activities in Hong Kong, thereby further strengthening the functions of Hong Kong’s financial markets.\n\nLast year, the offshore RMB market underwent a period of adjustment. Affected by market volatility and expectations regarding the RMB exchange rate, the scale of global offshore RMB liquidity pools generally contracted. Nevertheless, Hong Kong continued to lead the offshore RMB business, maintaining the world’s largest RMB liquidity pool, with RMB settlement through Hong Kong remaining at a high daily average of about RMB 860 billion. To further optimize liquidity arrangements in Hong Kong’s offshore RMB market, in October last year we increased the number of primary liquidity providers from seven to nine, and raised the total bilateral liquidity facility from RMB 14 billion to RMB 18 billion, ensuring orderly market operations even in times of tight liquidity. The launch of the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect in December last year further energized Hong Kong’s RMB business. The HKMA is also working with Mainland authorities to study the Bond Connect scheme, which will further facilitate cross-border participation in the bond market and enhance the connectivity of bond market infrastructure.\n\nDespite the various uncertainties in the global investment environment last year, thanks to a range of defensive measures implemented over time, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HKD 68.1 billion last year. Since 1994, the Exchange Fund’s compound annual return rate has reached 4.8%, higher than the local inflation rate of 2.1% over the same period.\n\nThe Exchange Fund will continue to promote diversified investment, including further expanding asset classes and increasing investments in credit assets, inflation-hedging investment products, and emerging markets. As the flagship of diversified investment, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio invests in alternative assets such as private equity and real estate projects. Since its inception in 2009, the portfolio has consistently delivered solid results, with an average annual internal rate of return of approximately 12%. With the government's Future Fund partially allocated to this portfolio, we have accelerated our investment pace. By the end of last year, the asset size of the Long-Term Growth Portfolio was about HK$181.8 billion, with a total of approximately HK$133.8 billion approved but not yet drawn for investment. The Exchange Fund will continue to adhere to the investment strategy of 'capital preservation first, long-term appreciation,' seeking stable long-term returns while maintaining ample liquidity and reserve funds.", "terms": {"進": ["enter", "go", "proceed", "capitalising in", "leveraging on", "advance", "promote", "further"], "議題": ["subjects", "issues"], "支援": ["support", "technical support"], "體系": ["system", "banking system", "sector"], "「": ["“", "\""], "已舉": ["have been organised"], "預期": ["expectation", "expected", "anticipate", "forecasts", "projects"], "並與": ["and", "and"], "啟動": ["triggered", "launch", "initiation", "launching"], "信貸": ["credit"], "港": ["Hong Kong"], "升至": ["rose to", "increased to", "climbed to", "edged up to", "picked up to"], "為": ["for", "to", "as", "to help cope", "foster", "promote", "to be", "to render by", "tobe", "at", "of", "be", "become"], "科技": ["technology", "fintech", "Fintech", "technological", "tech", "It"], "建": ["developed", "build", "carry out", "built", "establish", "established"], "多項": ["several", "multiple"], "多家": ["several", "several"], "人才": ["talent", "talent"], "近年": ["over the years", "in recent years", "recent years"], "12": ["12", "December", "twelve"], "重點": ["priorities", "highlights", "key", "major"], "特別": ["especially", "special"], "針對": ["aimed at", "in combating", "with regard to"], "放程序": ["the payout process", "requirements and procedures"], "牆": ["barriers"], "德霖": ["Norman T.L.", "Norman Chan"], "人民": ["renminbi", "Renminbi", "RMB"], "流動": ["liquidity", "fund flows", "mobile", "liquid"], "價格": ["prices"], "之稱": ["known as"], "金融": ["financial", "finance", "fintech", "Fintech", "Finance"], "紛紛": ["several", "several"], "培訓": ["talent development", "personnel training", "training"], "銀行": ["banks", "banking", "bank", "banks’"], "申請": ["applications", "application", "apply"], "微升": ["a slight increase"], "上": ["in", "on", "upwards"], "令美股": ["led to an immediate plunge in the ...

{"zh": "# 2016年摘要\n\n# 經濟及金融環境\n\n隨着環球經濟及貿易活動疲弱，香港經濟增長回軟。年內本港股市及住宅物業市場波動，置業負擔能力依然偏緊。\n\n儘管環球市場風險及衝擊增加，香港銀行體系仍維持穩健。銀行資本及流動性狀況維持良好；資產質素輕微轉差，但仍處於健康水平。\n\n# 貨幣穩定\n\n儘管面對波動的外圍環境，港元匯率仍然保持穩定，反映聯繫匯率制度承受外來衝擊的能力。\n\n貨幣市場繼續運作暢順，銀行同業流動資金充裕。於12月，繼美國聯邦儲備局決定上調聯邦基金利率目標範圍，香港基本利率上調25基點至1.00厘。\n\n# 銀行體系穩定\n\n金管局加強監管銀行的風險管治架構，以及信用、流動性與科技風險管理。金管局亦採取具體行動，促進普及金融和應對企業在香港開立及維持銀行帳戶遇到的困難。\n\n監管政策方面，就本港實施國際監管及會計標準的準備工作取得重大進展，當中包括《金融機構（處置機制）條例》下的處置框架。\n\n# 香港的國際金融中心地位\n\n香港維持其作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐和資產管理中心的地位。稅制獲進一步完善，營造更有利環境，吸引跨國公司在香港設立企業財資中心。\n\n為發展香港成為基建融資中心與金融科技樞紐，金管局成立基建融資促進辦公室及金融科技促進辦公室。金管局順利開始實施儲值支付工具及零售支付系統的監管制度，並批出13個儲值支付工具牌照。\n\n# 儲備管理\n\n儘管投資環境困難，充斥黑天鵝事件，但有賴過去幾年所採取的一連串防禦措施，增強外匯基金的抗震能力，外匯基金錄得2%的整體投資回報。\n\n金管局加快多元化投資的步伐，特別是長期增長組合的投資。\n\n# 機構職能\n\n金管局透過傳媒、公眾教育活動及其他各種渠道與社會和市場保持有效溝通，增進公眾對金管局政策及運作的了解。\n\n金管局繼續加強機構管治，包括推動員工提升專業能力、嚴格控制財政及加強資訊科技保安，以應付推行新措施及日益繁重的工作所帶來的挑戰。\n", "en": "# 2016 Summary\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nWith the global economy and trade activities remaining weak, Hong Kong’s economic growth softened. During the year, the local stock market and residential property market experienced volatility, and housing affordability remained tight.\n\nDespite increased global market risks and shocks, Hong Kong’s banking system remained robust. Banks maintained strong capital and liquidity positions; asset quality saw a slight deterioration but remained at healthy levels.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nDespite a volatile external environment, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained stable, reflecting the Linked Exchange Rate System’s resilience to external shocks.\n\nThe money market continued to function smoothly, and interbank liquidity remained ample. In December, following the US Federal Reserve’s decision to raise the target range for the Federal Funds Rate, Hong Kong’s Base Rate was raised by 25 basis points to 1.00%.\n\n# Banking System Stability\n\nThe HKMA strengthened the risk governance framework of banks, as well as credit, liquidity, and technology risk management. The HKMA also took concrete actions to promote financial inclusion and address the difficulties faced by corporates in opening and maintaining bank accounts in Hong Kong.\n\nOn the regulatory front, significant progress was made in preparing for the implementation of international regulatory and accounting standards in Hong Kong, including the resolution framework under the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance.\n\n# Hong Kong’s Status as an International Financial Centre\n\nHong Kong maintained its position as a global offshore RMB business hub and asset management centre. The tax regime was further refined to create a more favourable environment, attracting multinational corporations to establish corporate treasury centres in Hong Kong.\n\nTo develop Hong Kong as a centre for infrastructure financing and fintech, the HKMA established the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office and the Fintech Facilitation Office. The HKMA successfully commenced the regulatory regime for stored value facilities and retail payment systems, and granted 13 stored value facility licenses.\n\n# Reserve Management\n\nDespite a challenging investment environment marked by black swan events, a series of defensive measures taken in recent years enhanced the Exchange Fund’s resilience, resulting in an overall investment return of 2%.\n\nThe HKMA accelerated the pace of diversified investments, particularly in the long-term growth portfolio.\n\n# Institutional Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintained effective communication with the community and the market through the media, public education activities, and various other channels, enhancing public understanding of HKMA policies and operations.\n\nThe HKMA continued to strengthen institutional governance, including promoting staff professional competence, exercising strict fiscal control, and enhancing information technology security, in order to meet the challenges arising from the implementation of new measures and an increasingly heavy workload.", "terms": {"進": ["enter", "go", "proceed", "capitalising in", "leveraging on", "advance", "promote", "further"], "議題": ["subjects", "issues"], "支援": ["support", "technical support"], "體系": ["system", "banking system", "sector"], "「": ["“", "\""], "已舉": ["have been organised"], "預期": ["expectation", "expected", "anticipate", "forecasts", "projects"], "並與": ["and", "and"], "啟動": ["triggered", "launch", "initiation", "launching"], "信貸": ["credit"], "港": ["Hong Kong"], "升至": ["rose to", "increased to", "climbed to", "edged up to", "picked up to"], "為": ["for", "to", "as", "to help cope", "foster", "promote", "to be", "to render by", "tobe", "at", "of", "be", "become"], "科技": ["technology", "fintech", "Fintech", "technological", "tech", "It"], "建": ["developed", "build", "carry out", "built", "establish", "established"], "多項": ["several", "multiple"], "多家": ["several", "several"], "人才": ["talent", "talent"], "近年": ["over the years", "in recent years", "recent years"], "12": ["12", "December", "twelve"], "重點": ["priorities", "highlights", "key", "major"], "特別": ["especially", "special"], "針對": ["aimed at", "in combating", "with regard to"], "放程序": ["the payout process", "requirements and procedures"], "牆": ["barriers"], "德霖": ["Norman T.L.", "Norman Chan"], "人民": ["renminbi", "Renminbi", "RMB"], "流動": ["liquidity", "fund flows", "mobile", "liquid"], "價格": ["prices"], "之稱": ["known as"], "金融": ["financial", "finance", "fintech", "Fintech", "Finance"], "紛紛": ["several", "several"], "培訓": ["talent development", "personnel training", "training"], "銀行": ["banks", "banking", "bank", "banks’"], "申請": ["applications", "application", "apply"], "微升": ["a slight increase"], "上": ["in", "on", "upwards"], "令美股": ["led to an immediate plunge in the ...

{"zh": "# 經濟及金融環境\n\n隨着環球經濟及貿易活動疲弱，香港經濟增長在2016年回軟。面對外圍環境不明朗因素加劇，預期2017年經濟增長仍然溫和。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 概覽\n\n香港經濟增長在2016年放緩，實質本地生產總值增長由2015年的2.4%降至1.9%（表1）。淨出口是主要拖累，當中訪港旅遊業疲弱令服務輸出受壓（圖1）。本地需求動力亦放緩，但繼續為整體經濟增長提供主要支持。勞工市場大致保持穩定，失業率維持於3.3至3.4%的低位。由於本地成本及外部價格壓力減退，消費物價通脹進一步放緩。面對波動的外圍環境及多變的市場氣氛，資產市場增添起伏。鑑於住宅物業市場再度暢旺，政府於11月實施新印花稅措施。\n\n儘管外圍環境波動及美元利率上升，本港外匯及貨幣市場繼續運作暢順。港元現貨匯率於1月份略為轉弱後一直在7.75附近水平徘徊。年內兌換保證並無被觸發，總結餘與未償還外匯基金票據及債券合計幾乎維持不變，約為1.2萬億港元。繼美國於12月中加息後，金管局基本利率由0.75厘上調至1厘。香港銀行同業拆息及較長期債券收益率維持在相對較低水平，但在接近年底時稍升，部分反映美元相應拆息及收益率的走勢。整體銀行貸款增長在2016年加快至6.5%。雖然整體貸款質素略為轉差，但特定分類貸款比率仍然維持在極低水平。\n\n圖 1 組成部分對實質本地生產總值增長的貢獻\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n表 1 按開支項目計的實質本地生產總值增長（比對上期）\n\n註：本地固定資本形成總額經季節因素調整的按季增減幅度不詳。\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 本地需求\n\n本地需求的增長力度在2016年略為減弱。儘管穩定的就業及收入狀況繼續為私人消費帶來支持，但其增速仍降至1.6%，部分反映經濟不明朗因素加劇。政府消費增長亦略為減慢至3.3%。本地固定資本形成總額繼續按季大幅上落（圖2），累計全年收縮0.5%。私營部門機器及設備購置成為主要拖累，在營商前景欠佳下連續第3年收縮，而樓宇及建造活動則因住屋動工項目增加而轉殷。\n\n圖 2 本地需求\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 外部需求\n\n香港出口在接近2016年底時有回穩跡象，但綜合全年表現仍然乏力（圖3）。貨品出口較2015年的低基數上升1.7%。香港對先進經濟體的出口仍然呆滯；但在區內貿易流動轉趨穩定下，香港對中國內地、印度、韓國、新加坡及台灣的出口則較2015年好轉。\n\n部分反映零售銷售在近年急速增長後轉趨正常化，香港服務輸出在2016年顯著收縮3.1%。貨品進口在2015年收縮後於2016年收復部分失地，服務輸入則部分受惠於本地居民外遊意欲而持續增長。2016年整體貿易順差收窄，拖累本地經濟增長。\n\n圖 3 貨品出口及服務輸出\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 通脹\n\n通脹壓力在2016年仍然受控。剔除政府一次性紓緩措施的影響後，基本通脹率由2015年的2.5%下降至2016年的2.3%（圖4）。在早前新訂私人住宅租金下調所帶來的傳遞效應下，綜合消費物價指數中的租金組成項目通脹回落。受惠於全球商品價格偏軟及港元強勢，進口價格通脹受到遏抑。另一方面，在勞工成本穩定增長及租金成本壓力（尤其零售範疇）有所紓緩下，本地成本壓力保持溫和。\n\n圖 4 基本消費物價通脹\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 勞工市場\n\n勞工市場在2016年大致保持穩定，勞工供求升幅相若。按行業分析，旅遊相關行業的勞工市場狀況轉差，其他行業則大致平穩。整體而言，經季節因素調整失業率由2015年的3.3%稍升至3.4%（圖5）。在勞工市場穩定下，名義工資在首3季上升3.8%，而2015年的升幅為4.6%。首3季實質工資亦上升0.9%，而2015年的升幅為1.5%。\n\n圖 5 勞工市場狀況\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 股市\n\n香港股市在2016年大幅上落。受到人民幣貶值壓力及內地股市波動所影響，恒生指數於2月份跌至3年來的低位（圖6）。本港股市在3月份跟隨美國及其他主要股市顯著造好而回升。儘管英國脫歐公投觸發市場波動，但在外界預期美國聯邦儲備局會放緩加息步伐及其他主要央行推行貨幣寬鬆政策下，市場氣氛迅速改善。恒生指數於9月份升至24,100點的一年高位。然而，受到美國總統選舉結果及預計美國會加快加息步伐所影響，本港股市在第4季再度受壓。整體而言，恒生指數於2016年微升0.4%，在2015年則下跌7.2%。平均每日成交額由上年的1,056億港元降至669億港元，而本港股市集資總額亦由上年的11,156億港元減少至4,901億港元。\n\n圖 6 資產價格\n資料來源：差餉物業估價署及香港交易及結算所有限公司。\n\n# 物業市場\n\n住宅物業市場在2016年略為波動。物業成交量於第1季錄得歷史新低後，在其後數月有所回升，但在11月推出新印花稅措施後再度下挫。整體而言，成交量在2016年稍跌至54,701宗。另一方面，樓價自第2季起上升並超越2015年9月的高位，2016年的累計升幅為7.8%（圖6）。置業負擔能力依然偏緊，樓價與收入比率為15.9，超越1997年的歷史高位；而收入槓桿比率為72.0%，遠高於長期平均水平。2 由於銀行推出具競爭力的按揭計劃，按揭利率稍為回落，於接近年底時則跟隨香港銀行同業拆息上升而略為回升。工商物業市場方面，全年交投大致保持穩定。由於非住宅物業價格較2015年高位回落，相應租金收益率較上年微升，但仍處於低位。\n\n# 經濟前景\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n預期2017年實質本地生產總值增長將保持溫和。政府預測經濟增長幅度介乎2至3%之間，私營機構分析員預測增幅平均為2.0%。外圍方面，隨着環球宏觀經濟及金融環境變得不明朗，全球經濟及貿易增長或會保持溫和；再加上港元實質有效匯率因美元強勢而上升，將會抑制香港的出口表現。本地方面，雖然穩定的就業及收入狀況會支持消費，但受利率上升所拖累，預期私人消費會溫和增長。受惠於住屋供應增加及多個基建項目展開，樓宇及建造活動應會穩步增長，但營商氣氛疲弱及利率趨升將影響商界資本投資。\n\n# 通脹及勞工市場\n\n預計2017年通脹壓力仍然溫和。一方面環球商品價格上漲及中國內地通脹趨升或會令進口價格上升，另一方面港元轉強卻可能會令上述壓力受到遏抑。在溫和的經濟動力下，本地成本壓力仍可受控，但由於新訂住宅租金於2017年初上升，綜合消費物價指數中的租金組成項目通脹可能會稍升。市場共識預測2017年整體通脹率為1.9%，政府預期基本通脹率為2.0%。雖然不明朗因素加劇或會影響招聘意欲，私營機構分析員預計2017年失業率會維持於3.4%。\n\n# 不明朗因素及風險\n\n2017年經濟前景會受制於眾多不明朗因素，當中來自外圍環境的影響尤甚。美國新一屆政府政策的不確定性，將令環球經濟前景變得不明朗，當中可能出現的保護主義政策亦會對全球貿易帶來阻力。英國脫歐進程及歐洲幾個主要國家舉行大選，亦可能導致資產市場波動，並影響港元資金流向。此外，美國利率正常化將會令本地貨幣狀況收緊，並對實質經濟及資產價格構成下調壓力；當中樓市繼續偏緊，市場前景仍然很不明朗。短期而言，按揭息率仍然偏低、就業及收入狀況穩定，以及地產發展商加推優惠（例如折扣及現金回贈）令累積的購買力獲得釋放，均可為住宅需求帶來支持。另一方面，新印花稅措施、美國可能加快加息步伐及房屋供應穩步增長，則可能繼續為樓市帶來阻力。\n\n# 銀行體系表現\n\n儘管本港經濟面對阻力，加上國際政治事件出乎意料的結果令市場波動加劇，香港銀行體系在2016年仍然穩健。認可機構的資本及流動性狀況維持良好，資產質素輕微轉差，但仍處於健康水平。\n\n# 利率走勢\n\n隨着美國利率上升，香港銀行同業拆息在11月及12月顯著上升。反映零售銀行港元資金成本的綜合利率則輕微上升（圖7）。\n\n圖 7 香港銀行同業拆息、綜合利率及最優惠貸款利率\n\n註：\n1. 香港銀行同業拆息（每月平均數）由香港銀行公會公布。\n2. 最優惠貸款利率（每月平均數）是參考香港上海滙豐銀行有限公司所報利率。\n\n# 盈利走勢\n\n零售銀行在2016年的盈利略為改善，其香港業務的整體除稅前經營溢利增長8.7%。增長主要是由外匯及衍生工具業務收入（+39.7%）、附屬公司派發的股息收入（+123.5%）及淨利息收入（+2.8%）所帶動，不過部份增長被費用及佣金收入減少(-11.3%)所抵銷。零售銀行除稅後溢利錄得44.4%的升幅，增長主要來自非經常項目。零售銀行除稅後平均資產回報率亦相應由2015 年的 1.04% 上升至 1.44%（圖 8）。\n\n圖8 零售銀行的表現\n\n2016年零售銀行淨息差為1.32%，與2015年的水平相同（圖9）。雖然零售銀行繼續將剩餘資金配置於息率較低而流動性較高的金融投資，但利息收益的減少被利息成本下降所抵銷。\n\n圖9 零售銀行淨息差\n\n零售銀行非利息收入佔總經營收入的比例為44.3%，大致維持穩定。雖然費用與佣金收入下跌11.3%，但股息收入及外匯與衍生工具業務收入分別上升123.5%及39.7%。\n", "en": "# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nWith the global economy and trade activities remaining weak, Hong Kong's economic growth softened in 2016. Facing heightened external uncertainties, economic growth in 2017 is expected to remain moderate.\n\n# Economic Review\n\n# Overview\n\nHong Kong's economic growth slowed in 2016, with real GDP growth declining from 2.4% in 2015 to 1.9% (Table 1). Net exports were the main drag, with the weak inbound tourism sector putting pressure on service exports (Chart 1). Domestic demand momentum also weakened, but continued to provide the main support for overall economic growth. The labour market remained broadly stable, with the unemployment rate staying at a low level of 3.3% to 3.4%. As both local cost and external price pressures eased, consumer price inflation further moderated. Amid a volatile external environment and fluctuating market sentiment, asset markets experienced increased volatility. Given the renewed buoyancy in the residential property market, the government implemented new stamp duty measures in November.\n\nDespite external volatility and rising US interest rates, Hong Kong's foreign exchange and money markets continued to function smoothly. After a slight weakening in January, the HKD spot exchange rate hovered around 7.75. The convertibility undertaking was not triggered during the year, and the aggregate balance together with outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and Notes remained virtually unchanged at around HK$1.2 trillion. Following the US interest rate hike in mid-December, the HKMA Base Rate was raised from 0.75% to 1%. HIBOR and longer-term bond yields remained at relatively low levels, but edged up towards the end of the year, partly reflecting movements in corresponding US dollar rates and yields. Overall bank lending growth accelerated to 6.5% in 2016. Although overall loan quality slightly deteriorated, the classified loan ratio remained at an extremely low level.\n\nChart 1 Contribution of Components to Real GDP Growth\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\nTable 1 Real GDP Growth by Expenditure Component (Quarter-on-Quarter Comparison)\n\nNote: Seasonally adjusted quarter-on-quarter changes in gross domestic fixed capital formation are not available.\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Domestic Demand\n\nThe growth momentum of domestic demand slightly weakened in 2016. Despite stable employment and income conditions continuing to provide support for private consumption, its growth rate still fell to 1.6%, partly reflecting increased economic uncertainties. Government consumption growth also slowed slightly to 3.3%. Gross domestic fixed capital formation continued to fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis (Chart 2), contracting by 0.5% for the year as a whole. Private sector machinery and equipment investment was the main drag, shrinking for the third consecutive year amid a subdued business outlook, while building and construction activity picked up due to increased housing starts.\n\nChart 2 Domestic Demand\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# External Demand\n\nHong Kong's exports showed signs of stabilisation towards the end of 2016, but overall annual performance remained sluggish (Chart 3). Goods exports rose 1.7% from the low base in 2015. Exports to advanced economies remained sluggish; however, with intra-regional trade flows stabilising, exports to Mainland China, India, South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan improved compared to 2015.\n\nPartly reflecting a normalisation after rapid growth in recent years, Hong Kong's service exports contracted significantly by 3.1% in 2016. After contracting in 2015, goods imports regained some lost ground in 2016, while service imports continued to grow, partly benefiting from increased outbound travel by local residents. The overall trade surplus narrowed in 2016, weighing on Hong Kong's economic growth.\n\nChart 3 Goods Exports and Service Exports\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Inflation\n\nInflationary pressures remained contained in 2016. Excluding the effects of the government's one-off relief measures, the underlying inflation rate fell from 2.5% in 2015 to 2.3% in 2016 (Chart 4). Due to the lagged effect of earlier declines in new private residential rents, inflation in the rental component of the Composite Consumer Price Index moderated. Benefiting from subdued global commodity prices and a strong Hong Kong dollar, import price inflation was contained. On the other hand, with stable growth in labour costs and some easing of rental cost pressures (especially in the retail sector), local cost pressures remained moderate.\n\nChart 4 Underlying Consumer Price Inflation\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Labour Market\n\nThe labour market remained broadly stable in 2016, with labour supply and demand rising at similar rates. By industry, labour market conditions in tourism-related sectors deteriorated, while other sectors remained broadly stable. Overall, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate edged up from 3.3% in 2015 to 3.4% (Chart 5). With a stable labour market, nominal wages rose by 3.8% in the first three quarters, compared with a 4.6% increase in 2015. Real wages also rose by 0.9% in the first three quarters, compared with a 1.5% increase in 2015.\n\nChart 5 Labour Market Conditions\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Stock Market\n\nHong Kong's stock market experienced significant fluctuations in 2016. Affected by depreciation pressure on the renminbi and volatility in Mainland China's stock market, the Hang Seng Index fell to a three-year low in February (Chart 6). The local stock market rebounded in March, following notable improvements in the US and other major stock markets. Although the Brexit referendum triggered market volatility, market sentiment quickly improved as expectations grew that the US Federal Reserve would slow the pace of interest rate hikes and other major central banks would implement monetary easing policies. The Hang Seng Index climbed to a one-year high of 24,100 points in September. However, due to the outcome of the US presidential election and expectations of a faster pace of US interest rate hikes, the local stock market came under renewed pressure in the fourth quarter. Overall, the Hang Seng Index edged up by 0.4% in 2016, compared to a 7.2% decline in 2015. The average daily turnover fell from HK$105.6 billion in the previous year to HK$66.9 billion, while total funds raised in the local stock market also decreased from HK$1,115.6 billion to HK$490.1 billion.\n\nChart 6 Asset Prices\nSource: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\n\n# Property Market\n\nThe residential property market was somewhat volatile in 2016. After transaction volume hit a historic low in the first quarter, it rebounded in the following months, but fell again after the introduction of new stamp duty measures in November. Overall, transaction volume edged down slightly to 54,701 cases in 2016. On the other hand, housing prices began to rise from the second quarter, surpassing the September 2015 peak, with a cumulative increase of 7.8% for 2016 (Chart 6). Housing affordability remained tight, with the price-to-income ratio at 15.9, exceeding the historical high in 1997; the income gearing ratio stood at 72.0%, well above the long-term average.2 Due to banks offering competitive mortgage schemes, mortgage rates fell slightly, but edged up towards the end of the year in line with the rise in HIBOR. As for the commercial property market, overall transaction activity remained broadly stable throughout the year. As non-residential property prices retreated from the 2015 peak, corresponding rental yields rose slightly compared to the previous year, but remained at low levels.\n\n# Economic Outlook\n\n# Economic Environment\n\nReal GDP growth in 2017 is expected to remain moderate. The government forecasts economic growth in the range of 2 to 3%, while private sector analysts project an average increase of 2.0%. Externally, with the global macroeconomic and financial environment becoming more uncertain, global economic and trade growth may remain moderate; in addition, the real effective exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar is expected to rise due to the strong US dollar, which will dampen Hong Kong's export performance. Domestically, while stable employment and income conditions will support consumption, private consumption is expected to grow moderately, weighed down by rising interest rates. Benefiting from increased housing supply and the commencement of several infrastructure projects, building and construction activity should grow steadily, but weak business sentiment and rising interest rates will affect business capital investment.\n\n# Inflation and Labour Market\n\nInflationary pressure is expected to remain moderate in 2017. On the one hand, rising global commodity prices and higher inflation in Mainland China may push up import prices; on the other hand, a stronger Hong Kong dollar may help contain these pressures. With moderate economic momentum, local cost pressures should remain manageable, but as new residential rents rose at the beginning of 2017, inflation in the rental component of the Composite Consumer Price Index may edge up. Market consensus forecasts an overall inflation rate of 1.9% for 2017, while the government expects the underlying inflation rate to be 2.0%. Although heightened uncertainties may affect hiring intentions, private sector analysts expect the unemployment rate to remain at 3.4% in 2017.\n\n# Uncertainties and Risks\n\nThe economic outlook for 2017 will be subject to numerous uncertainties, particularly those arising from the external environment. The uncertainty surrounding the policies of the new US administration will cloud the global economic outlook, and possible protectionist policies may pose resistance to global trade. The Brexit process and elections in several major European countries may also lead to volatility in asset markets and affect capital flows in the Hong Kong dollar. In addition, the normalization of US interest rates will tighten local monetary conditions and exert downward pressure on the real economy and asset prices; the property market remains tight, and the market outlook is still highly uncertain. In the short term, mortgage rates remain low, stable employment and income conditions, and additional incentives offered by property developers (such as discounts and cash rebates) that have released pent-up purchasing power, all provide support for residential demand. On the other hand, new stamp duty measures, a possible acceleration in US interest rate hikes, and steady growth in housing supply may continue to pose resistance to the property market.\n\n# Banking Sector Performance\n\nDespite headwinds facing the local economy and increased market volatility due to unexpected international political events, Hong Kong's banking sector remained robust in 2016. The capital and liquidity position of authorized institutions remained sound, and asset quality deteriorated slightly but stayed at healthy levels.\n\n# Interest Rate Trends\n\nWith US interest rates rising, HIBOR in Hong Kong rose significantly in November and December. The composite interest rate, reflecting the funding cost of retail banks in Hong Kong dollars, also edged up slightly (Chart 7).\n\nChart 7 HIBOR, Composite Interest Rate, and Prime Lending Rate in Hong Kong\n\nNote:\n1. The Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (monthly average) is published by the Hong Kong Association of Banks.\n2. The Prime Lending Rate (monthly average) is based on the rate quoted by The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited.\n\n# Profitability Trends\n\nRetail banks saw a slight improvement in profitability in 2016, with pre-tax operating profit from their Hong Kong operations increasing by 8.7%. The growth was mainly driven by income from foreign exchange and derivatives business (+39.7%), dividend income from subsidiaries (+123.5%), and net interest income (+2.8%). However, part of the increase was offset by a decrease in fee and commission income (-11.3%). Retail banks recorded a 44.4% increase in post-tax profit, mainly attributable to non-recurring items. The post-tax average return on assets for retail banks also rose from 1.04% in 2015 to 1.44% (see Chart 8).\n\nChart 8 Performance of Retail Banks\n\nIn 2016, the net interest margin of retail banks was 1.32%, unchanged from the 2015 level (see Chart 9). Although retail banks continued to allocate surplus funds to financial investments with lower yields but higher liquidity, the reduction in interest income was offset by a decrease in interest expense.\n\nChart 9 Net Interest Margin of Retail Banks\n\nNon-interest income accounted for 44.3% of total operating income for retail banks, remaining broadly stable. While fee and commission income declined by 11.3%, dividend income and income from foreign exchange and derivatives business increased by 123.5% and 39.7%, respectively.", "terms": {"進": ["enter", "go", "proceed", "capitalising in", "leveraging on", "advance", "promote", "further"], "議題": ["subjects", "issues"], "支援": ["support", "technical support"], "體系": ["system", "banking system", "sector"], "「": ["“", "\""], "已舉": ["have been organised"], "預期": ["expectation", "expected", "anticipate", "forecasts", "projects"], "並與": ["and", "and"], "啟動": ["triggered", "launch", "initiation", "launching"], "信貸": ["credit"], "港": ["Hong Kong"], "升至": ["rose to", "increased to", "climbed to", "edged up to", "picked up to"], "為": ["for", "to", "as", "to help cope", "foster", "promote", "to be", "to render by", "tobe", "at", "of", "be", "become"], "科技": ["technology", "fintech", "Fintech", "technological", "tech", "It"], "建": ["developed", "build", "carry out", "built", "establish", "established"], "多項": ["several", "multiple"], "多家": ["several", "several"], "人才": ["talent", "talent"], "近年": ["over the years", "in recent years", "recent years"], "12": ["12", "December", "twelve"], "重點": ["priorities", "highlights", "key", "major"], "特別": ["especially", "special"], "針對": ["aimed at", "in combating", "with regard to"], "放程序": ["the payout process", "requirements and procedures"], "牆": ["barriers"], "德霖": ["Norman T.L.", "Norman Chan"], "人民": ["renminbi", "Renminbi", "RMB"], "流動": ["liquidity", "fund flows", "mobile", "liquid"], "價格": ["prices"], "之稱": ["known as"], "金融": ["financial", "finance", "fintech", "Fintech", "Finance"], "紛紛": ["several", "several"], "培訓": ["talent development", "personnel training", "training"], "銀行": ["banks", "banking", "bank", "banks’"], "申請": ["applications", "application", "apply"], "微升": ["a slight increase"], "上": ["in", "on", "upwards"], "令美股": ["led to an immediate plunge in the ...

{"zh": "# 貨幣穩定\n\n儘管外圍環境波動及美元息率上升，港元匯率在2016年仍然保持穩定。香港貨幣市場亦繼續運作暢順，銀行同業流動資金充裕。聯繫匯率制度繼續展現高度承受衝擊的能力，是香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的主要目標是維持貨幣穩定，即確保港元匯價穩定，使港元在外匯市場兌美元的匯率保持在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的區間內。該貨幣體制主要採用貨幣發行局制度，規定由外匯基金所持的美元儲備向貨幣基礎提供最少百分之百的支持；貨幣基礎若有變動，美元儲備亦必須作出相應增減，與貨幣基礎的變動百分之百配合。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n- 負債證明書（為3間發鈔銀行發行的銀行紙幣提供十足支持）\n- 政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣\n- 銀行在金管局所持結算戶口的結餘總額（即總結餘）\n- 金管局代表政府發行的外匯基金票據及債券。\n\n表1 貨幣基礎\n\n金管局透過自動利率調節機制及履行兌換保證的堅決承諾來維持港元匯率的穩定。若市場對港元的需求大過供應，令市場匯率轉強至7.75港元兌1美元的強方兌換保證匯率，金管局會向銀行沽出港元、買入美元，使總結餘增加及港元利率下跌，從而令港元匯率從強方兌換保證匯率水平回復至7.75到7.85的兌換範圍內。相反，若港元供過於求，令市場匯率轉弱至7.85港元兌1美元的弱方兌換保證匯率，金管局會向銀行買入港元，使總結餘減少及推高港元利率，港元匯率隨之由弱方兌換保證匯率水平回復至兌換範圍內。\n\n# 2016年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n港元匯率在2016年首兩個月略有波動後，於年內餘下時間一直窄幅徘徊。港元在2016年初兌美元顯著轉弱，由1月4日的7.7510降至1月20日的7.8196（圖1）。港元匯率轉弱符合聯繫匯率制度的正常運作，反映美國在2015年12月加息後港元與美元的負息差擴濶。此外，其他市場相關因素，包括香港股市出現拋售、內地及香港經濟前景不及以前樂觀、人民幣匯率波動增加，以及亞洲貨幣普遍疲弱，均導致港元需求減弱。受到市場氣氛改善支持，港元匯率在2月略為轉強，並自3月起一直在7.753至7.776之間窄幅徘徊，即使英國脫歐公投及美國總統選舉引發市場波動亦未受影響。由於市場預期美國會在夏季加息，港元匯率於5月出現短暫的轉弱壓力。整體而言，港元外匯市場在2016年一直正常運作。\n\n圖 1 2016年市場匯率\n\n由於兌換保證沒有被觸發，因此總結餘及未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額在2016年沒有明顯變動，大致維持在12,222億港元左右（圖2）。年內金管局增發總值1,320億港元的外匯基金票據，以滿足銀行在流動性管理方面的龐大需求，令總結餘相應減少至2016年底的2,596億港元。增發外匯基金票據符合貨幣發行局制度的原則，這是由於增發外匯基金票據只屬貨幣基礎組成部分之間的轉移，即由總結餘移至未償還外匯基金票據及債券，貨幣基礎仍然由外匯儲備提供十足支持。\n\n圖 2 2016年總結餘及未償還外匯基金票據及債券\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n香港銀行同業拆息在2016年大部分時間維持在較低水平（圖3）。香港銀行同業拆息在1、2月期間因金融市場波動加劇而面對一些上升壓力，但在3月隨着金融環境回復平靜而轉趨穩定。於第2及第3季，儘管市場關注英國脫歐公投結果以及美國貨幣市場基金改革，香港銀行同業拆息仍大致保持穩定。部分受到年底資金需求影響，以及港元拆息追回美元拆息的升幅，香港銀行同業拆息在第4季錄得較大升幅。儘管如此，短期銀行同業拆息在2016年大致維持在低於基本利率的水平。\n\n因應美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍於12月14日（美國時間）由0.25至0.50厘上調至0.50至0.75厘，基本利率於12月15日由0.75厘上調至1.00厘。基本利率的調整是按照於2009年3月26日宣布的經修訂計算公式作出。按照該公式，基本利率定於美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍下限加50基點的水平，或隔夜與1個月香港銀行同業拆息的5天移動平均數的平均值水平，兩者以較高者為準。\n\n圖 3 2016年香港銀行同業拆息\n\n港元遠期匯率點子在1月出現大幅溢價，大致跟隨港元與美元息差的走勢，以及部分反映投資者為其港股組合作出外匯對沖的需求（圖4）。遠期匯率溢價在2月開始收窄。隨着市況轉趨穩定，港元遠期匯率點子在3至11月期間大致保持穩定，其後在12月因港元與美元息差收窄而再度上升。整體而言，香港貨幣市場運作暢順，銀行同業流動資金充裕。貼現窗借貸在2016年並不活躍，僅涉及53億港元。\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n儘管經歷多次區內以至全球金融危機，聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）過去數十年來一直是香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石。2016年初市場波動加劇，再度引起有關港元轉弱及情況有如亞洲金融危機時期的評論。為增進各界對聯匯制度的認識，金管局向公眾闡釋聯匯制度的技術細節，並指出香港金融體系有能力抵禦衝擊。政府亦重申堅決維持聯匯制度。外匯及貨幣市場穩定，進一步鞏固公眾對政府維持聯匯制度的決心以及港元作為支付及保值貨幣的信心。國際貨幣基金組織在與香港進行年度第四條磋商時，明確表示聯匯制度是最適合香港的貨幣制度，指出香港靈活的經濟結構、充裕的財政及儲備緩衝、以及穩健有效的金融監管是聯匯制度的後盾。\n\n圖 4 2016年美元兌港元遠期匯率點子\n\n鑑於穩健的銀行體系對聯匯制度的正常運作具關鍵作用，金管局繼續密切監察銀行的信用、流動性及利率風險管理以及壓力測試結果，並加強對銀行個人、企業及內地相關貸款的監管，以確保銀行體系具備應付衝擊的能力。面對美國貨幣政策正常化，香港銀行同業拆息開始上升，金管局提醒市民保持警覺，並作好準備以應付可能出現的市場波動及風險。\n\n為提高貨幣發行局帳目的透明度，自1998年10月起，外匯基金已有部分資產被指定用作支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（即支持資產相對貨幣基礎的比率）於2016年在106.3至107.5%之間的窄幅上落，並無觸及上限或下限。該比率於2016年12月31日為106.7%（圖5）。在聯匯制度下，雖然已指定某些外匯基金資產作為支持組合，但外匯基金的全部資產均可用作支持港元匯率。外匯基金的龐大財政資源，能在面對突如其來的衝擊時為香港貨幣及金融穩定提供強力後盾。\n\n圖5 2016年支持比率每日變動\n\n# 研究工作\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的貨幣發行委員會負責監察和探討與香港貨幣及金融穩定有關的課題。在2016年，貨幣發行委員會探討的課題包括香港與中國內地及美國經濟增長同步性、港元貨幣外部需求及香港的金融狀況指數。貨幣發行委員會會議紀錄及金管局向其呈交的貨幣發行局制度運作報告，均載於金管局網站。\n\n香港金融研究中心繼續支持貨幣政策、銀行業及金融範疇的研究工作。在2016年，研究中心合共邀請18位學者到訪，並發表20份工作論文。\n\n年內研究中心舉辦6項國際會議及研討會，主要包括：\n- 於1月舉辦「第7屆中國經濟年度國際研討會」，主題為「中國對全球經濟的影響日益加深」，其間發表8份涵蓋廣泛議題的研究論文，包括中國增長再平衡及增長潛力、來自中國的經濟外溢效應、人民幣對全球及區內的影響，以及人民幣市場之間的利差交易走勢及資訊流動。\n- 於3月與香港科技大學及慶應大學合辦「科技大學與慶應大學及研究中心匯率及宏觀經濟研討會」，內容涵蓋多個不同經濟議題，包括全球經濟失衡、匯率動態變化、資本管制及貨幣政策。\n- 於8月與香港城市大學合辦「房地產與金融穩定研討會」，會上發表的論文內容涵蓋年齡、人口與住屋需求；大額投資者對資產質素的影響；香港房屋價格動態變動；住屋市場負擔能力；按揭規例對家庭生命周期置業決定的影響，以及中國內地的住宅物業市場。\n- 於10月與金管局及國際結算銀行合辦有關亞太區經濟體系的研討會，主題為「在動盪不穩的全球環境下區內經濟體系的抗震能力」。研討會吸引多間央行的高層、主要學者及來自國際組織與私人機構的專家出席，就亞太區經濟體系最迫切的事項進行互動式圓桌討論，交流意見。探討的議題涵蓋廣泛，包括亞洲的金融失衡狀況、資金流、內地經濟放緩對區內其他地方的外溢效應，以及亞洲潛在增長受到的影響及前景。\n\n研究中心亦於8月舉辦「第14屆年度夏季研討會」，並於9月舉辦「第14屆中國內地經濟研討會」，探討內地銀行的資產質素及金融穩定事項。上述會議及研討會吸引學術界、金融服務界及各地央行代表參加。研究中心亦於年內舉辦21場公開小型研討會，探討廣泛的經濟、貨幣及金融議題。\n\n# 紙幣及硬幣\n\n截至2016年底，流通銀行紙幣（指發鈔銀行發行的紙幣）總值4,078億港元，較上年增加13.2%（圖6、7及8）。政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣總值118億港元，較上年增加5.3%（圖9及10）。在政府發行的紙幣及硬幣中，10港元流通紙幣總值44億港元，當中塑質鈔票佔86%。\n", "en": "# Monetary Stability\n\nDespite volatility in the external environment and rising US dollar interest rates, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained stable in 2016. The Hong Kong money market also continued to function smoothly, with ample interbank liquidity. The Linked Exchange Rate System continued to demonstrate a high degree of resilience to shocks, serving as the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\n# Target\n\nThe primary objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is to maintain monetary stability, that is, to ensure the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, keeping the HKD/USD rate within the range of 7.75 to 7.85 Hong Kong dollars per US dollar in the foreign exchange market. This monetary regime mainly adopts the Currency Board System, which requires that the US dollar reserves held by the Exchange Fund provide at least 100% backing for the monetary base; any change in the monetary base must be matched by a corresponding change in US dollar reserves, maintaining a 100% alignment with changes in the monetary base.\n\nThe monetary base (Table 1) includes:\n- Certificates of Indebtedness (which provide full backing for banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks)\n- Government-issued circulating banknotes and coins\n- The aggregate balance of clearing accounts maintained by banks with the HKMA (i.e., the aggregate balance)\n- Exchange Fund Bills and Notes issued by the HKMA on behalf of the government.\n\nTable 1 Monetary Base\n\nThe HKMA maintains the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate through the Automatic Interest Rate Adjustment Mechanism and a firm commitment to the Convertibility Undertaking. If demand for the Hong Kong dollar exceeds supply, causing the market exchange rate to strengthen to the strong-side Convertibility Undertaking rate of 7.75 HKD per USD, the HKMA will sell Hong Kong dollars and buy US dollars from banks, increasing the aggregate balance and lowering Hong Kong dollar interest rates, thereby bringing the exchange rate back within the 7.75 to 7.85 range. Conversely, if the supply of Hong Kong dollars exceeds demand, causing the market exchange rate to weaken to the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking rate of 7.85 HKD per USD, the HKMA will buy Hong Kong dollars from banks, reducing the aggregate balance and pushing up Hong Kong dollar interest rates, thus returning the exchange rate to within the target range.\n\n# Review of 2016\n\n# Exchange Rate Stability\n\nAfter some mild fluctuations in the first two months of 2016, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained within a narrow range for the rest of the year. At the beginning of 2016, the Hong Kong dollar weakened significantly against the US dollar, falling from 7.7510 on January 4 to 7.8196 on January 20 (Chart 1). The weakening of the Hong Kong dollar was consistent with the normal operation of the Linked Exchange Rate System, reflecting the widening negative interest rate differential between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar following the US interest rate hike in December 2015. In addition, other market-related factors—including a sell-off in the Hong Kong stock market, less optimistic economic prospects for Mainland China and Hong Kong, increased volatility in the renminbi exchange rate, and general weakness in Asian currencies—also contributed to reduced demand for the Hong Kong dollar. Supported by improved market sentiment, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate strengthened slightly in February and, from March onwards, remained within a narrow range of 7.753 to 7.776, unaffected even by market volatility triggered by the Brexit referendum and the US presidential election. Due to market expectations of a US interest rate hike in the summer, the Hong Kong dollar experienced brief weakening pressure in May. Overall, the Hong Kong foreign exchange market operated normally throughout 2016.\n\nChart 1 2016 Market Exchange Rate\n\nAs the Convertibility Undertaking was not triggered, there were no significant changes in the aggregate balance and the outstanding amount of Exchange Fund Bills and Notes in 2016, which remained at around HKD 1,222.2 billion (Chart 2). During the year, the HKMA issued an additional HKD 132 billion in Exchange Fund Bills to meet strong demand from banks for liquidity management, resulting in a corresponding decrease in the aggregate balance to HKD 259.6 billion at the end of 2016. The issuance of additional Exchange Fund Bills is consistent with the principles of the Currency Board System, as it merely represents a transfer between components of the monetary base—from the aggregate balance to outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and Notes—while the monetary base continues to be fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\nChart 2 2016 Aggregate Balance and Outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\n\n# Money Market\n\nHong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBOR) remained at relatively low levels for most of 2016 (Chart 3). HIBOR faced some upward pressure in January and February due to increased financial market volatility, but stabilized in March as financial conditions calmed. In the second and third quarters, despite market concerns over the outcome of the Brexit referendum and US money market fund reform, HIBOR remained generally stable. Partly due to year-end funding demand and the catch-up of Hong Kong dollar interbank rates with US dollar rates, HIBOR recorded a more significant increase in the fourth quarter. Nevertheless, short-term interbank rates in 2016 generally remained below the Base Rate.\n\nIn response to the increase in the target range for the US federal funds rate on December 14 (US time) from 0.25–0.50% to 0.50–0.75%, the Base Rate was raised from 0.75% to 1.00% on December 15. The adjustment to the Base Rate was made in accordance with the revised calculation formula announced on March 26, 2009. According to this formula, the Base Rate is set at the higher of (i) the lower end of the target range for the US federal funds rate plus 50 basis points, or (ii) the average of the five-day moving averages of the overnight and one-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBOR).\n\nChart 3: 2016 Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates\n\nIn January, forward points for the Hong Kong dollar exhibited a significant premium, broadly tracking the interest rate differential between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar, and partly reflecting investors’ demand for FX hedging of their Hong Kong equity portfolios (see Chart 4). The forward premium began to narrow in February. As market conditions stabilized, forward points for the Hong Kong dollar remained generally stable from March to November, before rising again in December as the interest rate differential between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar narrowed. Overall, the Hong Kong money market operated smoothly, with ample interbank liquidity. Discount window borrowing was not active in 2016, involving only HK$5.3 billion.\n\n# Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nDespite having weathered numerous regional and global financial crises, the Linked Exchange Rate System (the Linked Rate System) has remained the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability for decades. The heightened market volatility at the beginning of 2016 once again sparked commentary regarding the weakening of the Hong Kong dollar and comparisons to the Asian Financial Crisis. To enhance public understanding of the Linked Rate System, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) explained the technical details of the system to the public and pointed out that Hong Kong’s financial system is capable of withstanding shocks. The Government also reiterated its firm commitment to maintaining the Linked Rate System. The stability of the foreign exchange and money markets further consolidated public confidence in the Government’s determination to uphold the Linked Rate System and in the Hong Kong dollar as a means of payment and store of value. During its annual Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) explicitly stated that the Linked Rate System is the most suitable monetary regime for Hong Kong, noting that Hong Kong’s flexible economic structure, ample fiscal and reserve buffers, and robust and effective financial supervision provide strong support for the system.\n\nChart 4: 2016 US Dollar/Hong Kong Dollar Forward Points\n\nGiven that a sound banking system is crucial to the proper functioning of the Linked Rate System, the HKMA continued to closely monitor banks’ credit, liquidity, and interest rate risk management, as well as the results of stress tests. The HKMA also strengthened supervision of banks’ personal, corporate, and Mainland-related lending to ensure that the banking system is equipped to cope with shocks. In the face of US monetary policy normalization, Hong Kong interbank offered rates began to rise. The HKMA reminded the public to remain alert and to be well-prepared for possible market volatility and risks.\n\nTo enhance the transparency of the Currency Board accounts, since October 1998, a portion of the Exchange Fund’s assets has been designated as backing for the monetary base. The Backing Ratio (i.e., the ratio of backing assets to the monetary base) fluctuated within a narrow range of 106.3% to 107.5% in 2016, without reaching either the upper or lower limits. As at December 31, 2016, the ratio stood at 106.7% (see Chart 5). Under the Linked Rate System, although certain Exchange Fund assets have been designated as the backing portfolio, all assets of the Exchange Fund may be used to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. The substantial financial resources of the Exchange Fund provide a strong backing for Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability in the face of sudden shocks.\n\nChart 5: Daily Movements of the Backing Ratio in 2016\n\n# Research Work\n\nThe Currency Board Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for monitoring and examining issues related to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. In 2016, topics explored by the Currency Board Committee included the synchronization of economic growth between Hong Kong, Mainland China, and the United States, external demand for the Hong Kong dollar, and Hong Kong’s Financial Conditions Index. The minutes of the Currency Board Committee meetings and the reports on the operation of the Currency Board System submitted by the HKMA are available on the HKMA website.\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research continued to support research in the areas of monetary policy, banking, and finance. In 2016, the Institute invited a total of 18 scholars for visits and published 20 working papers.\n\nDuring the year, the Research Centre organized six international conferences and seminars, including:\n- In January, the \"7th Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy\" was held, with the theme \"China's Growing Impact on the Global Economy.\" Eight research papers covering a wide range of topics were presented, including China's growth rebalancing and growth potential, economic spillover effects from China, the impact of the renminbi on the global and regional economies, as well as trends in carry trades and information flows among renminbi markets.\n- In March, in collaboration with the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and Keio University, the \"HKUST-Keio-HKIMR Conference on Exchange Rates and Macroeconomics\" was held, covering various economic topics such as global economic imbalances, exchange rate dynamics, capital controls, and monetary policy.\n- In August, in partnership with City University of Hong Kong, the \"Real Estate and Financial Stability Conference\" was held. Papers presented at the conference covered topics such as age, demographics and housing demand; the impact of large investors on asset quality; dynamics of Hong Kong housing prices; housing market affordability; the impact of mortgage regulations on household lifecycle homeownership decisions; and the residential property market in Mainland China.\n- In October, together with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Bank for International Settlements, a seminar on Asia-Pacific economic systems was held, themed \"Resilience of Regional Economic Systems in a Turbulent Global Environment.\" The seminar attracted senior central bank officials, leading academics, and experts from international organizations and private institutions, who engaged in interactive roundtable discussions on the most pressing issues facing Asia-Pacific economic systems. Topics discussed were wide-ranging, including financial imbalances in Asia, capital flows, spillover effects of Mainland China's economic slowdown on other regional economies, as well as the impact and outlook for Asia's potential growth.\n\nThe Research Centre also held the \"14th Annual Summer Workshop\" in August and the \"14th Mainland China Economic Conference\" in September, focusing on asset quality and financial stability issues in Mainland banks. These conferences and seminars attracted participants from academia, the financial services sector, and central banks from various regions. During the year, the Research Centre also organized 21 public seminars on a wide range of economic, monetary, and financial topics.\n\n# Banknotes and Coins\n\nAs at the end of 2016, the total value of circulating banknotes (i.e., banknotes issued by note-issuing banks) was HK$407.8 billion, an increase of 13.2% over the previous year (Figures 6, 7, and 8). The total value of government-issued circulating banknotes and coins was HK$11.8 billion, an increase of 5.3% over the previous year (Figures 9 and 10). Among the government-issued banknotes and coins, the total value of HK$10 circulating banknotes was HK$4.4 billion, of which polymer banknotes accounted for 86%.", "terms": {"進": ["enter", "go", "proceed", "capitalising in", "leveraging on", "advance", "promote", "further"], "議題": ["subjects", "issues"], "支援": ["support", "technical support"], "體系": ["system", "banking system", "sector"], "「": ["“", "\""], "已舉": ["have been organised"], "預期": ["expectation", "expected", "anticipate", "forecasts", "projects"], "並與": ["and", "and"], "啟動": ["triggered", "launch", "initiation", "launching"], "信貸": ["credit"], "港": ["Hong Kong"], "升至": ["rose to", "increased to", "climbed to", "edged up to", "picked up to"], "為": ["for", "to", "as", "to help cope", "foster", "promote", "to be", "to render by", "tobe", "at", "of", "be", "become"], "科技": ["technology", "fintech", "Fintech", "technological", "tech", "It"], "建": ["developed", "build", "carry out", "built", "establish", "established"], "多項": ["several", "multiple"], "多家": ["several", "several"], "人才": ["talent", "talent"], "近年": ["over the years", "in recent years", "recent years"], "12": ["12", "December", "twelve"], "重點": ["priorities", "highlights", "key", "major"], "特別": ["especially", "special"], "針對": ["aimed at", "in combating", "with regard to"], "放程序": ["the payout process", "requirements and procedures"], "牆": ["barriers"], "德霖": ["Norman T.L.", "Norman Chan"], "人民": ["renminbi", "Renminbi", "RMB"], "流動": ["liquidity", "fund flows", "mobile", "liquid"], "價格": ["prices"], "之稱": ["known as"], "金融": ["financial", "finance", "fintech", "Fintech", "Finance"], "紛紛": ["several", "several"], "培訓": ["talent development", "personnel training", "training"], "銀行": ["banks", "banking", "bank", "banks’"], "申請": ["applications", "application", "apply"], "微升": ["a slight increase"], "上": ["in", "on", "upwards"], "令美股": ["led to an immediate plunge in the ...

{"zh": "# 銀行體系穩定\n\n儘管環球市場風險及震盪增加，香港銀行體系在2016年仍維持穩健。金管局在年內加強監管認可機構的風險管治架構，以及信用與流動性風險管理系統的成效。鑑於網絡攻擊日趨頻繁，金管局亦加強監管認可機構的科技風險管理。為貫徹金管局致力打擊金融罪行的目標，認可機構打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集監控措施的成效，繼續是金管局的監管重點。在監管認可機構的操守方面，金管局採取實質行動，推動以客為本的企業文化及促進普及金融，和應對海外中小企及初創企業在香港開立及維持銀行帳戶方面遇到的困難。金管局亦加強監管認可機構銷售投資及保險產品的手法，以進一步提升對客戶的保障。\n\n在監管政策方面，金管局就香港實施國際監管及會計標準的準備工作取得重大進展；當中包括穩定資金淨額比率、大額風險承擔限額、國際財務報告準則第9號及《金融機構（處置機制）條例》下的處置框架。\n\n# 2016年回顧\n\n# 監管工作概覽\n\n金管局在2016年共進行188次非現場審查，涵蓋範圍廣泛，包括認可機構的CAMEL評級、企業管治、業務運作及風險管理。金管局加強與認可機構董事局的聯繫，以強化銀行業的風險管治及企業文化。除與董事局或董事局委員會舉行會議外，亦另行與獨立非執行董事（獨立非執董）會面，就企業文化及風險管治事宜交換意見。金管局亦與認可機構及其外聘審計師舉行三方聯席會議。此外，金管局就認可機構的薪酬制度是否有助促進有效的風險管理進行評估。\n\n在資本充足水平方面，金管局審視認可機構的資本計劃，包括其未來數年的資本目標，以便就2019年全面實施《巴塞爾協定三》緩衝資本作好準備。認可機構的償付能力壓力測試亦因應當前宏觀經濟環境作出改進。金管局又審慎評估各主要零售銀行的恢復計劃，並就需要改善的環節提出意見。\n\n除了非現場審查工作外，金管局繼續以專題評估配合定期現場審查，而專題評估主要適用於被評定為較高風險的範疇。這種監管方法讓金管局更有效地調配監管資源，以應對認可機構所面對的各項新增及主要風險。金管局在2016年共進行377次現場審查及專題評估。這些審查與評估的重點仍是信用風險管理與監控，尤其涉及內地相關業務的信用風險；另一個重點是打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集監控措施。金管局又增加對流動性風險、業務操作風險及科技風險管理的現場審查及專題評估次數。年內專項審查小組亦對認可機構的證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（強積金）相關業務進行現場審查。\n\n表1載有金管局於2016年的監管工作概要。\n\n# 信用風險的監管\n\n# 信貸增長及資產質素\n\n銀行貸款在2016年增長溫和。未償還貸款總額全年增加6.5%；2015年的增幅則為3.5%（表2）。由於客戶存款的增幅超過銀行貸款的增幅，整體貸存比率由2015年底的70.1%降至2016年底的68.4%。\n\n表 2 貸款及墊款的增長\n\n內地相關貸款總額在2016年底增加7%至35,640億港元（表3），其中包括在香港註冊的銀行設於內地的附屬公司入帳的5,450億港元貸款。\n\n銀行業的資產質素在2016年維持穩健。儘管零售銀行的特定分類貸款比率由2015年底的0.69%微升至2016年底的0.72%，但仍遠低於2000年以來的長期平均水平2.4%。同期，整體銀行業的特定分類貸款比率由0.73%上升至0.85%。年內銀行業的內地相關貸款的資產質素呈相若走勢；同期，零售銀行這些貸款的特定分類貸款比率由0.78%微升至0.82%，整體銀行業的相關比率亦由一年前的0.77%微升至0.80%。\n\n金管局投入大量監管資源，以確保認可機構繼續採用審慎的信貸審批標準，並維持有效的貸款分類及撥備制度。金管局在監管過程中亦特別關注認可機構對中國內地民營企業的風險承擔持續增加，以及為增加收益而投資於債務證券所引起的信用風險。此外，金管局就認可機構分銷高風險投資產品的信用風險管理進行專題評估。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n金管局繼續密切留意認可機構的物業貸款業務。住宅物業價格於2015年9月開始出現調整，但其後於2016年3月再度上升，全年上升8%。新造住宅物業按揭貸款的平均按揭成數，由2009年9月金管局尚未推出首輪物業貸款逆周期措施時的64%，降至2016年12月的51%。新造住宅物業按揭貸款的平均供款與入息比率亦由2010年8月首度推出供款與入息比率上限時的41%，降至2016年12月的34%（圖1）。\n\n圖 1 新造住宅物業按揭貸款的平均按揭成數及供款與入息比率\n金管局推出首輪物業貸款逆周期措施前推出供款與入息比率上限\n\n根據金管局於2015年2月推出的第七輪逆周期措施，使用內部評級基準計算法計算信用風險資本要求的認可機構須將15%信用風險加權下限的應用，由新造按揭貸款延伸至整個住宅按揭貸款組合。這項規定於2016年6月生效。\n\n年內有更多地產發展商向物業買家直接提供按揭貸款，其按揭成數往往高於金管局對認可機構實施審慎要求下許可的水平。金管局密切留意有關發展，並定期與認可機構溝通，以評估銀行有否繼續有效管理對地產發展商的風險承擔。此外，土地註冊處應金管局要求，同意向認可機構提供電子提示服務。使用這項服務的認可機構，當有其他按揭文書就其承按的物業交付土地註冊處辦理註冊時，會收到該處發出的電子提示訊息。這項服務將有助應對按揭借款人未有事先獲得承按認可機構同意下，擅自以同一物業借取額外按揭貸款的情況。土地註冊處已於2017年第1季推出電子提示服務。\n\n# 業務操作及科技風險的監管\n\n與其他國際金融中心一樣，香港面對的網絡威脅與日俱增。金管局於2016年接到認可機構通報發現未經授權股票交易及試圖入侵其支付系統的個案，並隨即採取行動應對這些攻擊造成的風險。金管局發出電子銀行服務提示，提醒公眾慎防網上股票交易騙案，並建議公眾採取預防措施。金管局又向認可機構發出通告，就進一步加強網上銀行服務監控可採取的保安措施提供指引。有關試圖入侵銀行支付系統的個案，金管局在香港首次發現相關個案時已提醒認可機構留意這類騙案，並在警方協助下說明這類騙案的犯案手法，以及要求認可機構在加強支付操作的監控措施時須顧及有關手法。\n\n為進一步提升銀行體系應對網絡風險的能力，金管局於2016年5月推出網絡防衛計劃。此計劃由三項支柱組成，即網絡防衛評估框架、專業培訓計劃及網絡風險資訊共享平台（詳見「香港的國際金融中心地位」一章「金融科技促進辦公室」部分）。金管局在12月向認可機構發出通告，列載網絡防衛評估框架的實施時間表。\n\n金融科技在銀行業的應用於2016年長足發展，多間認可機構推出新的金融科技產品，其中個人小額支付服務、非接觸式流動支付及生物認證這幾個範疇的發展尤為顯著。金管局在9月推出「金融科技監管沙盒」，讓認可機構能在受控環境中就其金融科技項目先作試行，而無需完全符合金管局的監管規定。有關安排讓認可機構在正式推出金融科技服務前，可及早收集真實數據及用戶意見，以便作出適當修改。截至2016年底，共有6項使用金融科技監管沙盒的申請獲批，有關的新金融科技產品涉及生物認證、證券交易及用於按揭估值的區塊鏈。金管局又在11月上調無需雙重認證的網上銀行個人小額支付服務的交易上限至每個帳戶每日5,000港元，以應付日益增加的簡便個人支付服務需求。\n\n2016年發生多宗與物業相關的騙案，當中涉及騙徒假扮業主，試圖藉申請按揭貸款或出售有關物業謀取利益。雖然這些騙案並不涉及認可機構，但金管局仍與警方及香港銀行公會（銀行公會）緊密合作，就偵測及防止這些騙案在銀行業內發生向認可機構提供指引。年內金管局出版兩期《操作事故通訊》，與業界分享從認可機構發生過的操作事故中汲取的教訓。金管局亦對認可機構的業務操作風險管理制度、詐騙管理方法、信託╱託管業務操作及防範違規或未經授權交易活動的風險管理及監控措施進行現場審查及專題評估。\n\n# 財資業務及流動性風險的監管\n\n2016年發生數宗重大政治事件，引致金融市場在年內多次大幅波動。與此同時，美國利率繼續緩慢地正常化，聯邦公開市場委員會於12月決定調高聯邦基金利率，是全球金融危機以來的第二次。為應對這些政治事件作好準備，金管局與境外監管機構繼續保持緊密聯繫，並評估事件對香港銀行體系的影響，以及要求銀行保持警覺並加強其風險管理以應對不利的市場發展。\n\n在流動性風險管理方面，金管局進行額外的流動性壓力測試，以評估銀行體系應對可能發生的嚴峻壓力情境的能力，並對認可機構作出跟進，以加強其應對能力。金管局在2015年針對利率風險管理進行一輪現場審查後，再進行額外的現場審查，以評估認可機構的市場風險管理，並要求在監控方面存有不足的認可機構作出糾正。\n\n# 打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集活動\n\n金管局的風險為本打擊洗錢監管包括現場審查及非現場審查（包括就特定事件與認可機構進行的監管聯繫），主要針對洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險較高的範疇。審查內容涵蓋認可機構對洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險的評估、風險為本方法的落實情況，以及交易監察與制裁合規的制度和程序。金管局的專項監管人員在2016年共進行17次現場審查及30次非現場審查。\n\n在政策發展方面，金管局優先處理某些行業及人士在開立銀行帳戶方面遇到困難的情況，並發出指引與「常見問題」，以釐清若干客戶盡職審查的規定，以及金管局就風險為本方法的監管期望。與此同時，金管局繼續與業內公會緊密合作，發出指引以協助認可機構處理某些範疇的風險，例如貿易相關的洗錢活動。\n", "en": "# Stability of the Banking System\n\nDespite increased global market risks and volatility, the Hong Kong banking system remained robust in 2016. During the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) strengthened its supervision of the risk governance frameworks of authorized institutions, as well as the effectiveness of their credit and liquidity risk management systems. In view of the rising frequency of cyberattacks, the HKMA also enhanced its oversight of technology risk management at authorized institutions. To fulfill the HKMA’s commitment to combating financial crime, the effectiveness of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing controls at authorized institutions continued to be a supervisory focus. Regarding the conduct of authorized institutions, the HKMA took concrete actions to promote a customer-centric corporate culture and financial inclusion, and to address the difficulties faced by overseas small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and start-ups in opening and maintaining bank accounts in Hong Kong. The HKMA also strengthened its supervision of the sales practices of authorized institutions in relation to investment and insurance products, with a view to further enhancing customer protection.\n\nIn terms of regulatory policy, the HKMA made significant progress in preparing for the implementation of international regulatory and accounting standards in Hong Kong, including the Net Stable Funding Ratio, large exposure limits, International Financial Reporting Standard 9 (IFRS 9), and the resolution framework under the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance.\n\n# Review of 2016\n\n# Overview of Supervisory Work\n\nIn 2016, the HKMA conducted a total of 188 off-site examinations, covering a wide range of areas including the CAMEL ratings, corporate governance, business operations, and risk management of authorized institutions. The HKMA strengthened its engagement with the boards of directors of authorized institutions to reinforce risk governance and corporate culture in the banking sector. In addition to meetings with boards or board committees, separate meetings were held with independent non-executive directors (INEDs) to exchange views on corporate culture and risk governance matters. The HKMA also held tripartite meetings with authorized institutions and their external auditors. Furthermore, the HKMA assessed whether the remuneration systems of authorized institutions contributed to effective risk management.\n\nWith regard to capital adequacy, the HKMA reviewed the capital plans of authorized institutions, including their capital targets for the coming years, to prepare for the full implementation of the Basel III capital buffer in 2019. The solvency stress tests of authorized institutions were also refined in light of the prevailing macroeconomic environment. The HKMA prudently assessed the recovery plans of major retail banks and provided feedback on areas requiring improvement.\n\nIn addition to off-site examinations, the HKMA continued to complement regular on-site examinations with thematic reviews, which mainly focused on areas assessed as higher risk. This supervisory approach enabled the HKMA to allocate supervisory resources more effectively to address new and major risks faced by authorized institutions. In 2016, the HKMA conducted a total of 377 on-site examinations and thematic reviews. These examinations and reviews continued to focus on credit risk management and monitoring, particularly credit risk associated with Mainland-related business; another key focus was the effectiveness of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing controls. The HKMA also increased the number of on-site examinations and thematic reviews on liquidity risk, operational risk, and technology risk management. During the year, specialized examination teams also conducted on-site reviews of authorized institutions’ securities, investment products, insurance, and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses.\n\nTable 1 provides a summary of the HKMA’s supervisory work in 2016.\n\n# Supervision of Credit Risk\n\n# Credit Growth and Asset Quality\n\nBank lending grew moderately in 2016. The total outstanding amount of loans increased by 6.5% for the year, compared with a 3.5% increase in 2015 (see Table 2). As customer deposits grew at a faster pace than bank lending, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio declined from 70.1% at the end of 2015 to 68.4% at the end of 2016.\n\nTable 2 Growth of Loans and Advances\n\nThe total amount of Mainland-related loans increased by 7% to HK$3,564 billion at the end of 2016 (see Table 3), including HK$545 billion of loans booked by Mainland subsidiaries of banks incorporated in Hong Kong.\n\nThe asset quality of the banking sector remained sound in 2016. Although the classified loan ratio of retail banks edged up from 0.69% at the end of 2015 to 0.72% at the end of 2016, it remained well below the long-term average of 2.4% since 2000. Over the same period, the classified loan ratio for the overall banking sector rose from 0.73% to 0.85%. The asset quality of Mainland-related loans in the banking sector showed a similar trend during the year; the classified loan ratio of such loans for retail banks increased slightly from 0.78% to 0.82%, while the corresponding ratio for the overall banking sector rose marginally from 0.77% a year earlier to 0.80%.\n\nThe HKMA devoted substantial supervisory resources to ensure that authorized institutions continued to adopt prudent credit approval standards and maintained effective loan classification and provisioning systems. In its supervisory process, the HKMA also paid particular attention to the continued increase in risk exposures of authorized institutions to Mainland private enterprises, as well as the credit risk arising from investments in debt securities to boost returns. In addition, the HKMA conducted thematic reviews of the credit risk management of authorized institutions in the distribution of high-risk investment products.\n\n# Property Mortgage Loans\n\nThe HKMA continues to closely monitor the property lending business of authorized institutions. Residential property prices began to adjust in September 2015, but subsequently rebounded in March 2016, rising by 8% over the year. The average loan-to-value ratio of new residential mortgage loans decreased from 64% in September 2009, before the HKMA introduced the first round of countercyclical property lending measures, to 51% in December 2016. The average debt-to-income ratio of new residential mortgage loans also fell from 41% in August 2010, when the debt-to-income ratio cap was first introduced, to 34% in December 2016 (see Chart 1).\n\nChart 1  Average Loan-to-Value Ratio and Debt-to-Income Ratio of New Residential Mortgage Loans\nIntroduction of Debt-to-Income Ratio Cap before the First Round of Countercyclical Property Lending Measures by the HKMA\n\nAccording to the seventh round of countercyclical measures introduced by the HKMA in February 2015, authorized institutions using the internal ratings-based approach to calculate credit risk capital requirements are required to extend the application of the 15% credit risk-weighted floor from new mortgage loans to the entire residential mortgage loan portfolio. This requirement took effect in June 2016.\n\nDuring the year, more property developers directly offered mortgage loans to property buyers, with loan-to-value ratios often exceeding the prudent levels permitted for authorized institutions under HKMA requirements. The HKMA closely monitors these developments and regularly communicates with authorized institutions to assess whether banks continue to effectively manage their risk exposures to property developers. In addition, at the request of the HKMA, the Land Registry has agreed to provide an electronic alert service to authorized institutions. Under this service, when other mortgage documents relating to properties mortgaged to an authorized institution are submitted to the Land Registry for registration, the institution will receive an electronic alert from the Registry. This service will help address situations where mortgage borrowers obtain additional mortgage loans on the same property without the prior consent of the mortgagee institution. The Land Registry launched the electronic alert service in the first quarter of 2017.\n\n# Supervision of Operational and Technology Risks\n\nLike other international financial centres, Hong Kong faces increasing cyber threats. In 2016, the HKMA received reports from authorized institutions of unauthorized stock trading and attempted intrusions into their payment systems, and promptly took action to address the risks arising from these attacks. The HKMA issued e-banking service alerts to remind the public to guard against online stock trading scams and advised the public to take preventive measures. The HKMA also issued circulars to authorized institutions, providing guidance on security measures to further strengthen the monitoring of online banking services. Regarding attempted intrusions into bank payment systems, the HKMA alerted authorized institutions to such scams when they were first detected in Hong Kong, and, with police assistance, explained the modus operandi of these scams and required authorized institutions to take these methods into account when enhancing monitoring measures for payment operations.\n\nTo further enhance the banking system’s ability to respond to cyber risks, the HKMA launched the Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative in May 2016. This initiative comprises three pillars: the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework, a professional training programme, and a cyber risk information sharing platform (see the \"Fintech Facilitation Office\" section in the chapter \"Hong Kong as an International Financial Centre\"). In December, the HKMA issued a circular to authorized institutions setting out the implementation timetable for the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework.\n\nThe application of fintech in the banking sector made significant progress in 2016, with a number of authorized institutions launching new fintech products, particularly in the areas of personal small-value payment services, contactless mobile payments, and biometric authentication. In September, the HKMA launched the \"Fintech Supervisory Sandbox,\" allowing authorized institutions to conduct pilot trials of their fintech projects in a controlled environment without full compliance with HKMA regulatory requirements. This arrangement enables authorized institutions to collect real data and user feedback at an early stage before the official launch of fintech services, so that appropriate adjustments can be made. As of the end of 2016, a total of six applications to use the Fintech Supervisory Sandbox had been approved, involving new fintech products related to biometric authentication, securities trading, and blockchain for mortgage valuation. In November, the HKMA also raised the transaction limit for online banking personal small-value payment services that do not require two-factor authentication to HKD 5,000 per account per day, in response to the growing demand for convenient personal payment services.\n\nIn 2016, there were a number of property-related scams, in which fraudsters impersonated property owners in attempts to obtain mortgage loans or sell the properties for profit. Although these scams did not involve authorized institutions, the HKMA continued to work closely with the police and the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB) to provide guidance to authorized institutions on detecting and preventing such scams in the banking sector. During the year, the HKMA published two issues of the \"Operational Incidents Bulletin\" to share lessons learned from operational incidents at authorized institutions with the industry. The HKMA also conducted on-site examinations and thematic reviews of authorized institutions’ operational risk management systems, fraud management methods, trust/custody business operations, and risk management and control measures for preventing unauthorized or non-compliant transaction activities.\n\n# Supervision of Treasury Business and Liquidity Risk\n\nSeveral major political events occurred in 2016, resulting in significant volatility in the financial markets on multiple occasions throughout the year. At the same time, the normalization of US interest rates continued at a gradual pace, with the Federal Open Market Committee deciding in December to raise the federal funds rate—marking the second such increase since the global financial crisis. To prepare for these political events, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) maintained close communication with overseas regulatory authorities, assessed the impact of these events on the Hong Kong banking system, and required banks to remain vigilant and strengthen their risk management to address adverse market developments.\n\nIn terms of liquidity risk management, the HKMA conducted additional liquidity stress tests to assess the banking system’s ability to withstand potential severe stress scenarios, and followed up with authorized institutions to enhance their resilience. Following an on-site examination of interest rate risk management in 2015, the HKMA conducted further on-site examinations to assess the market risk management of authorized institutions, and required those with deficiencies in monitoring to take corrective action.\n\n# Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Activities\n\nThe HKMA’s risk-based anti-money laundering (AML) supervision includes both on-site and off-site examinations (including supervisory engagement with authorized institutions on specific events), focusing primarily on areas with higher risks of money laundering and terrorist financing. The scope of these examinations covers authorized institutions’ assessment of money laundering and terrorist financing risks, the implementation of risk-based approaches, as well as systems and procedures for transaction monitoring and sanctions compliance. In 2016, the HKMA’s dedicated supervisory staff conducted a total of 17 on-site examinations and 30 off-site examinations.\n\nIn terms of policy development, the HKMA prioritized addressing difficulties encountered by certain industries and individuals in opening bank accounts, and issued guidance and \"Frequently Asked Questions\" to clarify certain customer due diligence requirements and the HKMA’s supervisory expectations regarding the risk-based approach. At the same time, the HKMA continued to work closely with industry associations, issuing guidance to assist authorized institutions in managing risks in specific areas, such as trade-based money laundering activities.", "terms": {"進": ["enter", "go", "proceed", "capitalising in", "leveraging on", "advance", "promote", "further"], "議題": ["subjects", "issues"], "支援": ["support", "technical support"], "體系": ["system", "banking system", "sector"], "「": ["“", "\""], "已舉": ["have been organised"], "預期": ["expectation", "expected", "anticipate", "forecasts", "projects"], "並與": ["and", "and"], "啟動": ["triggered", "launch", "initiation", "launching"], "信貸": ["credit"], "港": ["Hong Kong"], "升至": ["rose to", "increased to", "climbed to", "edged up to", "picked up to"], "為": ["for", "to", "as", "to help cope", "foster", "promote", "to be", "to render by", "tobe", "at", "of", "be", "become"], "科技": ["technology", "fintech", "Fintech", "technological", "tech", "It"], "建": ["developed", "build", "carry out", "built", "establish", "established"], "多項": ["several", "multiple"], "多家": ["several", "several"], "人才": ["talent", "talent"], "近年": ["over the years", "in recent years", "recent years"], "12": ["12", "December", "twelve"], "重點": ["priorities", "highlights", "key", "major"], "特別": ["especially", "special"], "針對": ["aimed at", "in combating", "with regard to"], "放程序": ["the payout process", "requirements and procedures"], "牆": ["barriers"], "德霖": ["Norman T.L.", "Norman Chan"], "人民": ["renminbi", "Renminbi", "RMB"], "流動": ["liquidity", "fund flows", "mobile", "liquid"], "價格": ["prices"], "之稱": ["known as"], "金融": ["financial", "finance", "fintech", "Fintech", "Finance"], "紛紛": ["several", "several"], "培訓": ["talent development", "personnel training", "training"], "銀行": ["banks", "banking", "bank", "banks’"], "申請": ["applications", "application", "apply"], "微升": ["a slight increase"], "上": ["in", "on", "upwards"], "令美股": ["led to an immediate plunge in the ...

The tax amendments implemented last year have helped foster an enabling environment, attracting multinational corporations to establish corporate treasury centres in Hong Kong. To develop Hong Kong into an infrastructure financing centre and a fintech hub, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) established the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office and the Fintech Facilitation Office during the year. The HKMA also issued 13 licences to stored value facility issuers. Hong Kong's sound fiscal performance and substantial net external assets continue to be affirmed by credit rating agencies, with Standard & Poor's maintaining its AAA rating for Hong Kong.\n\n# Overview\n\nAmid global financial market volatility and uncertainty in the RMB exchange rate outlook, global offshore RMB business slowed in 2016. Nevertheless, Hong Kong maintained its role as the global offshore RMB business hub, handling approximately 70% of global RMB payment transactions. The launch of the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect in December marked another milestone in the Mainland's capital account liberalization and represented an important step in enhancing Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre. The HKMA also strengthened financial infrastructure by expanding RMB liquidity support to the market and introducing measures to increase transparency in RMB market liquidity.\n\nIn July, the HKMA established the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO) to bring together key stakeholders to promote infrastructure development and to develop Hong Kong as an infrastructure financing centre. As of the end of January 2017, over 60 institutions had joined IFFO as partners. During the year, the HKMA also successfully promoted the passage of legislative amendments to eliminate tax asymmetries and provide tax incentives, encouraging multinational and Mainland enterprises to set up corporate treasury centres in Hong Kong, thereby creating more business opportunities for the financial and professional services sectors. The number of institutional investors establishing a presence in Hong Kong has also gradually increased. Notably, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, the world's third-largest sovereign wealth fund, announced in October the establishment of an overseas office in Hong Kong—its only office outside Abu Dhabi.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF), in its Article IV consultation discussions last year, gave positive assessments of our efforts to consolidate Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre. Throughout the year, the HKMA actively participated in international discussions and worked to promote global and regional financial stability. The HKMA also maintained close communication with international credit rating agencies, which contributed to the affirmation of Hong Kong's credit ratings by major agencies in 2016.\n\nThe safe, efficient, and continuous operation and development of Hong Kong's financial infrastructure play a vital role in consolidating Hong Kong's competitiveness as an international financial centre and as a global offshore RMB business hub. The four Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems for interbank transactions and the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) system for debt instruments achieved 100% system availability in 2016, exceeding the target level of 99.95%.\n\nIn 2016, the HKMA further strengthened Hong Kong's retail payment financial infrastructure. During the year, a total of 13 stored value facility licences were issued under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (the \"Payment Ordinance\"), which came fully into effect in November 2016. The coverage of the e-cheque service was also extended to cross-border payments between Hong Kong and Guangdong Province (including Shenzhen).\n\nTo promote the development of fintech in Hong Kong, the HKMA established the Fintech Facilitation Office in March. A number of important measures implemented during the year made good progress.\n\nThe HKMA introduced a series of initiatives to enhance the soft power of the banking industry, including: (i) launching the Directors' Professionalism Programme; (ii) establishing an industry-wide banking practitioners' professional qualification framework; and (iii) implementing a consumer education programme.\n\n# Review of 2016\n\n# Offshore RMB Business\n\nIn 2016, global financial market volatility and uncertainty in the RMB exchange rate outlook led to a slowdown in global offshore RMB business. As at year-end, the total balance of RMB customer deposits and certificates of deposit in Hong Kong stood at RMB 625.1 billion, a decrease of 38% from the previous year (Figure 1). Offshore RMB bond issuance during the year fell to RMB 52.8 billion, and RMB trade settlement handled by Hong Kong banks also declined to RMB 4,542.1 billion. On the other hand, the RMB loan balance of Hong Kong banks at year-end was RMB 294.8 billion, similar to the previous year (Figure 2). The transaction volume of the RMB RTGS system remained high, with an average daily turnover of RMB 863.6 billion in 2016. This demonstrates that, despite a contraction in the RMB liquidity pool, Hong Kong continues to support a large volume of RMB financial intermediation activities. According to statistics from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), Hong Kong processed about 70% of global RMB payment transactions in 2016, underscoring its status as the global offshore RMB business hub.\n\nFigure 1: RMB Customer Deposits and Certificates of Deposit\n\nFigure 2: RMB Financing Activities\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA worked closely with Mainland authorities to secure greater policy space and advance Hong Kong's RMB business. Several new measures were introduced, including further opening up of the Mainland interbank bond market and foreign exchange market, as well as the launch of the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect in December. In response to increased demand for cross-border investment channels and liquidity management, the HKMA expanded the RMB liquidity facility arrangement. In October, the number of primary liquidity providers was increased from seven to nine, and the total facility size was raised from RMB 14 billion to RMB 18 billion. The transparency of the HKMA's RMB liquidity facility arrangement was also enhanced, enabling participating banks to manage their liquidity more effectively.\n\nIn March, the national \"13th Five-Year Plan\" reaffirmed Hong Kong's status as a global offshore RMB business hub, demonstrating the Central Government's support for Hong Kong's further development of offshore RMB business.\n\nAt the same time, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continued to strengthen cooperation with other economies to develop offshore RMB business. The HKMA also actively participated in various activities to promote Hong Kong as a global offshore RMB business hub and as a key platform for Mainland China's \"Go Out\" strategy. These activities included participation in local events organized by industry associations and private sector organizations, as well as overseas events in Mainland China, Germany, Kazakhstan, and the United Kingdom.\n\n# Mainland and Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement\n\nUnder the framework of the Mainland and Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA), a new agreement on basically achieving the liberalization of trade in services between the Mainland and Hong Kong was signed in 2015. The HKMA continues to closely monitor the implementation of measures under the current arrangement and collaborates with government authorities to explore further expansion of Mainland market access and facilitation measures for Hong Kong's financial industry.\n\n# Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO)\n\n# Mission of IFFO\n\nThe mission of IFFO is to bring together key stakeholders to jointly promote infrastructure investment and financing. The functions of IFFO are:\n- To provide a platform for information exchange and experience sharing;\n- To enhance skills and knowledge in infrastructure investment and financing;\n- To promote market and product development;\n- And to facilitate infrastructure investment and financing activities.\n\nMr. Norman Chan, Chief Executive of the HKMA (seventh from the left), toasts with other guests at the IFFO launch ceremony.\n\nThe HKMA established IFFO in July, with the mission of bringing together key stakeholders to jointly promote infrastructure investment and financing. As of the end of January 2017, more than 60 institutions from Mainland China, Hong Kong, and overseas had joined IFFO as partners, including multilateral financial institutions and development banks, public institutional investors, private institutional investors, asset management companies, banks, insurance companies, infrastructure project development and operation entities, professional services companies, and international trade associations (see Table 1).\n\nSince its establishment, IFFO has made good progress. To enhance skills, IFFO co-hosted an executive workshop in October with the International Finance Corporation (IFC) of the World Bank Group and Eastspring Investments, focusing on \"Private Capital Participation in Infrastructure Investment and Financing in Emerging Markets.\" The workshop received very positive feedback from participants and helped to increase knowledge and build networks. In November, IFFO organized a high-level seminar and invited Mr. Jin Liqun, President of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), to deliver a keynote speech and share experiences in infrastructure project planning, operation, and management. In July, IFFO signed memoranda of understanding (MOUs) with the IFC and the Global Infrastructure Hub, establishing cooperation frameworks. In December, IFFO also signed MOUs with the China Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank of China to facilitate infrastructure project financing for these two banks through the IFFO platform. These activities have helped to enhance Hong Kong's status and international image as an infrastructure financing centre.\n\nMr. Norman Chan, Chief Executive of the HKMA (front left), and Mr. Philippe Le Houérou, Executive Vice President and CEO of the International Finance Corporation (front right), sign a memorandum of understanding to facilitate cooperation between the two parties in leveraging the IFFO platform to foster a more efficient and enabling market environment for infrastructure investment and financing in the region.\n\nMr. Norman Chan, Chief Executive of the HKMA (front left), and Mr. Chris Heathcote, CEO of the Global Infrastructure Hub (front right), sign a memorandum of understanding to establish a strategic cooperation framework to promote infrastructure project financing.\n\nMr. Norman Chan, Chief Executive of the HKMA (left), and Mr. Hu Huaibang, Chairman of the China Development Bank, sign a memorandum of understanding to strengthen cooperation between the bank and the HKMA.\n\n# Corporate Treasury Centres\n\nTo further attract multinational corporations to establish corporate treasury centres in Hong Kong, the HKMA has worked with government authorities to foster a favorable tax environment for corporate treasury centres. Specifically, the Inland Revenue (Amendment) (No. 2) Ordinance 2016 (the \"Amendment Ordinance\") was passed in June, allowing enterprises that meet specified conditions to deduct interest expenses on intra-group financing business when calculating profits tax, and to enjoy a 50% profits tax concession (i.e., reduced to 8.25%) on qualifying profits from specified treasury activities of eligible corporate treasury centres. Table 2 summarizes some key points of the Amendment Ordinance:\n\nIn addition to legislative work, the HKMA has also actively promoted the advantages of establishing corporate treasury centres in Hong Kong to multinational and Mainland enterprises. By year-end, the HKMA had engaged with nearly 400 companies, financial institutions, and industry organizations. In November, the HKMA also signed a memorandum of understanding with the Hong Kong Chinese Enterprises Association to help Mainland enterprises in Hong Kong better understand and make greater use of our corporate treasury centre platform.\n\n# Promotion of Asset Management Business\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to promote Hong Kong as an asset management centre. According to the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), the number of licensed corporations engaged in asset management reached 1,300 at the end of 2016, representing an increase of nearly 15% year-on-year. According to the Asian Venture Capital Journal, the number of private equity fund companies in Hong Kong (including both SFC-licensed and non-SFC-licensed corporations) also rose by 4.6% in 2016, reaching 431. To date, nearly 70 of the world’s top 100 asset management companies, as well as the majority of the top 20 mutual fund companies from Mainland China, have established operations or affiliated companies in Hong Kong. The number of institutional investors with a presence in Hong Kong is also gradually increasing. Notably, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, the world’s third largest sovereign wealth fund, announced in October the establishment of an overseas office in Hong Kong, which is its only office outside Abu Dhabi.\n\n# Introduction of the Open-ended Fund Company Structure\n\nTo attract funds to register in Hong Kong, the HKMA continues to work with the government and the industry to foster a more favourable tax and regulatory environment. In June, the Securities and Futures (Amendment) Bill 2016 was passed, introducing the open-ended fund company structure, thereby diversifying Hong Kong’s fund registration platform and providing fund managers with a more flexible operating environment. This, in turn, enhances Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international asset management centre.\n\n# Islamic Finance\n\nThe HKMA remains committed to increasing market awareness and understanding of Islamic finance. This includes co-organising and participating in Islamic finance seminars and workshops with industry associations, as well as sharing experiences with market participants regarding the issuance of Sukuk (Islamic bonds) and encouraging them to make use of Hong Kong’s platform. Following the successful issuance of the previous two batches of Sukuk, the HKMA has been working closely with the government to launch a third batch of Islamic bonds when market conditions are appropriate.", "terms": {"進": ["enter", "go", "proceed", "capitalising in", "leveraging on", "advance", "promote", "further"], "議題": ["subjects", "issues"], "支援": ["support", "technical support"], "體系": ["system", "banking system", "sector"], "「": ["“", "\""], "已舉": ["have been organised"], "預期": ["expectation", "expected", "anticipate", "forecasts", "projects"], "並與": ["and", "and"], "啟動": ["triggered", "launch", "initiation", "launching"], "信貸": ["credit"], "港": ["Hong Kong"], "升至": ["rose to", "increased to", "climbed to", "edged up to", "picked up to"], "為": ["for", "to", "as", "to help cope", "foster", "promote", "to be", "to render by", "tobe", "at", "of", "be", "become"], "科技": ["technology", "fintech", "Fintech", "technological", "tech", "It"], "建": ["developed", "build", "carry out", "built", "establish", "established"], "多項": ["several", "multiple"], "多家": ["several", "several"], "人才": ["talent", "talent"], "近年": ["over the years", "in recent years", "recent years"], "12": ["12", "December", "twelve"], "重點": ["priorities", "highlights", "key", "major"], "特別": ["especially", "special"], "針對": ["aimed at", "in combating", "with regard to"], "放程序": ["the payout process", "requirements and procedures"], "牆": ["barriers"], "德霖": ["Norman T.L.", "Norman Chan"], "人民": ["renminbi", "Renminbi", "RMB"], "流動": ["liquidity", "fund flows", "mobile", "liquid"], "價格": ["prices"], "之稱": ["known as"], "金融": ["financial", "finance", "fintech", "Fintech", "Finance"], "紛紛": ["several", "several"], "培訓": ["talent development", "personnel training", "training"], "銀行": ["banks", "banking", "bank", "banks’"], "申請": ["applications", "application", "apply"], "微升": ["a slight increase"], "上": ["in", "on", "upwards"], "令美股": ["led to an immediate plunge in the ...

{"zh": "# 儲備管理\n\n2016年是充滿意外和黑天鵝事件的一年，環球金融市場出現大波動和震盪。2016年年初市場憂慮內地經濟硬着陸及全球增長放緩，促使環球股市大幅下挫。6月英國脫歐公投和11月美國大選結果亦出人意表。儘管投資環境困難，金管局在過去幾年已採取連串防禦措施，增強外匯基金的抗震能力，因此外匯基金在2016年仍錄得2% 的整體投資回報。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》，外匯基金的首要目的是直接或間接影響港元匯價，亦可運用於保持香港貨幣及金融體系穩定健全，藉此保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。外匯基金由財政司司長掌有控制權，並投資於其經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後認為合適的證券或其他資產。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標及組合結構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會為外匯基金制定下列投資目標：\n(a) 保障資本；\n(b) 確保整體貨幣基礎在任何時候都由流通性極高的美元資產提供十足支持；\n(c) 確保流動資金足以維持貨幣及金融穩定；以及\n(d) 在符合上述(a)至(c)項的前提下盡量爭取投資回報，以保障基金的長期購買力。\n\n以上目標全面顧及外匯基金的法定目的，並已於外匯基金的組合結構及目標資產分布中反映。\n\n外匯基金大致上分成兩個主要組合：支持組合及投資組合。支持組合持有流通性極高的美元資產，按照貨幣發行局制度的規定為貨幣基礎提供十足支持。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債市及股市，以保障資產的價值及長期購買力。這兩個組合整體債券與股票的長線目標分布比率為71比29。以目標貨幣比重計，91%的資產分配予美元及港元，其餘9%分配予其他貨幣。\n\n為能更妥善管理風險及提高中長期回報，金管局以審慎及循序漸進方式將外匯基金的部分資產分散投資至較多元化的資產類別，包括新興巿場及內地債券與股票、私募股權，以及海外投資物業。新興巿場及內地債券與股票由投資組合持有，私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合持有。長期增長組合的市值上限為外匯基金累計盈餘的三分之一，但因應部分未來基金投放於長期資產，市值上限還有增加的空間。\n\n策略性資產組合於2007年設立，以持有政府基於策略性目的而為外匯基金帳目購入的香港交易及結算所有限公司股份。由於這個組合性質獨特，因此外匯基金的投資表現評估並無將其包括在內。\n\n# 於外匯基金的存款\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定組織的存款，利率一般與投資組合的表現掛鈎2，惟未來基金存款則除外。未來基金存款的利率與投資組合及長期增長組合的表現掛鈎，實際利率視乎組合比重而定。於2016年底，未來基金在投資組合與長期增長組合的比重為80：20。預期截至2018年底，未來基金存款中與長期增長組合掛鈎的部分會逐步增加至約50%。\n\n# 投資程序\n\n外匯基金的投資程序分別以策略性資產分布及戰略性資產分布作基礎。策略性資產分布，即投資基準反映的分布情況，顯示外匯基金為達到投資目標而可以作出的最佳長線資產分布。外匯基金以策略性分布作為指引，對資產進行戰略性分布，以爭取超越基準的回報。因此，實際分布往往會與基準分布（亦即策略性分布）有所偏離，而實際與基準分布之間的差距稱為「戰略性偏離」。財政司司長經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後制定投資基準及戰略性偏離的限度，金管局獲授權決定戰略性資產分布。投資組合經理可在戰略性偏離的限度內選持倉盤，從短期市場變化中獲利。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局儲備管理部職員直接管理外匯基金約74%的投資，其中包括整個支持組合及部分投資組合。該部分投資組合投資於環球定息市場，並透過衍生工具執行外匯基金的宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 外聘投資經理\n\n除透過內部職員管理資產外，金管局亦僱用外聘投資經理負責管理外匯基金約26%的資產，其中包括所有上市股票組合及其他特別資產。僱用外聘投資經理的目的，是要運用市場上最佳的專業投資技術為外匯基金投資，並讓外匯基金受惠於多元化的投資方式，以及讓內部專業人員汲取市場知識與資訊。\n\n僱用外聘投資經理的相關支出包括基金管理與託管費、交易費、預扣稅及其他稅項。這些支出主要受市場因素影響而每年不同。\n\n金管局支持證券及期貨事務監察委員會於2016年3月7日發布的《負責任的擁有權原則》（《原則》）。《原則》屬自願性質，旨在協助投資者釐定如何以最佳方法履行其於香港上市公司的投資的擁有權責任。就外匯基金的管理而言，金管局鼓勵獲委任負責管理香港股票組合的外聘基金經理在管理有關投資時採納《原則》。\n\n# 風險管理及監察\n\n近年金融市場波動極大，凸顯風險管理的重要。金管局為內部及外聘投資經理所管理的投資組合均訂立嚴格管控措施及投資指引，並密切監察對指引及法規的遵守情況；另亦採用風險管控工具來評估在正常及極度不利市況下的市場風險。金管局亦進行詳細的投資表現因素分析，務求能最有效地運用內部及外聘投資經理的投資管理技術。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2016年的金融市場\n\n2016年環球金融市場出現大波動和震盪。股票市場方面，1月市場憂慮內地經濟硬着陸及全球增長放緩，促使香港及其他主要股市大幅下挫，直至2月中旬市場才穩定下來。6月英國脫歐公投及11月美國大選結果相繼出人意表，但股市在經歷短暫下挫後迅速收復失地。全年計，環球股市普遍表現理想。\n\n債券市場方面，第1季商品價格進一步下跌加深市場對全球增長放緩及低通脹的憂慮，加上第2季英國脫歐公投帶來的不明朗因素及市場對中央銀行維持寬鬆政策的預期，加大了市場對安全資產的需求，支持政府債市於2016年上半年有不俗表現。其中10年期美國國庫券收益率在7月跌至1.36%的歷史低位。然而，在下半年由於市場對美國加息的預期升溫，尤其在美國總統選舉後，美國國庫券收益率飆升。其他主要政府債券的收益率亦上升，但升幅較小。\n\n貨幣市場方面，美元在2016年繼續走強，美元匯價指數升至14年來的高位。美元持續強勢，是受到美元與其他主要貨幣的利率差距擴大所支持。雖然日圓兌美元於2016年上升約3%，歐元兌美元下跌約3%。在英國脫歐公投結果帶來的不明朗因素持續困擾下，英鎊兌美元於年內亦下跌16%，是自2008年以來的最大跌幅。\n\n表1列載主要貨幣、債巿及股市在2016年的表現。\n\n表1 2016年市場回報\n股市表現按照年內指數價格變動計算。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n儘管金融市場大幅波動，外匯基金在2016年仍錄得681億港元投資收入，包括外地股票收益286億港元、香港股票收益53億港元、債券收益331億港元、外匯基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資收益169億港元，以及非港元資產外匯估值下調158億港元。由於去年美元匯價急升，外匯基金非美元投資轉作港元時無可避免出現外匯估值下調。另一方面，策略性資產組合錄得7億港元估值虧損。\n\n於2016年年底，外匯基金的資產總額達36,187億港元。長期增長組合投資的市值總計1,818億港元，當中包括私募股權1,168億港元及房地產650億港元，已承擔但尚未提取作投資的總額為1,338億港元。\n\n儘管投資環境挑戰不絕，外匯基金在2016年仍錄得2%的投資回報率（不包括策略性資產組合）。長期增長組合自2009年開展投資以來的內部回報率年率約為12%。\n\n由於外圍投資環境持續惡化，過去幾年金管局已作出一系列防禦部署，包括縮短債券組合年期、增持現金及大幅減持非美元及非港元資產。我們亦加快多元化投資的步伐，特別是長期增長組合的投資。這些部署大大增強外匯基金的抗震能力。\n\n圖1列明外匯基金由1994至2016年的年度回報率。表2顯示外匯基金在2016年的投資回報率及不同年期的平均投資回報率。外匯基金在過去3年的平均回報率為0.9%、過去5年為2.0%、過去10年為2.6%，以及由1994年起為4.8%。表3列載外匯基金資產於2016年12月31日的貨幣比重。\n\n圖 1 外匯基金投資回報率（1994至2016年）\n\n1. 投資回報率的計算不包括策略性資產組合內的資產。\n2. 綜合消費物價指數以2014/2015年為基期的數列計算。\n\n表2 外匯基金投資回報率：以港元計\n\n1. 2001至2003年的投資回報率以美元計。2. 投資回報率的計算不包括策略性資產組合內的資產。3. 不同年期的平均數以複合年度方式計算。\n\n表3 外匯基金資產於2016年12月31日的貨幣比重（包括遠期交易）\n", "en": "# Reserve Management\n\n2016 was a year full of surprises and black swan events, with significant volatility and turbulence in global financial markets. At the beginning of 2016, concerns over a hard landing of Mainland China's economy and a global growth slowdown triggered sharp declines in global stock markets. The results of the Brexit referendum in June and the US presidential election in November were also unexpected. Despite the challenging investment environment, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) had implemented a series of defensive measures in recent years to enhance the resilience of the Exchange Fund. As a result, the Exchange Fund still recorded an overall investment return of 2% in 2016.\n\n# The Exchange Fund\n\nAccording to the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the primary objective of the Exchange Fund is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar. It may also be used to maintain the stability and soundness of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems, thereby preserving Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre. The Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary, who invests in such securities or other assets as he considers appropriate after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee.\n\n# Management of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Investment Objectives and Portfolio Structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n(a) Capital preservation;\n(b) Ensuring that the entire monetary base is at all times fully backed by highly liquid US dollar assets;\n(c) Ensuring sufficient liquidity to maintain monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) Subject to (a) to (c) above, seeking to achieve investment returns to preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Fund.\n\nThese objectives comprehensively address the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund and are reflected in the portfolio structure and target asset allocation of the Fund.\n\nThe Exchange Fund is broadly divided into two main portfolios: the Backing Portfolio and the Investment Portfolio. The Backing Portfolio holds highly liquid US dollar assets to provide full backing for the monetary base as required under the currency board system. The Investment Portfolio primarily invests in the bond and equity markets of member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to preserve asset value and long-term purchasing power. The long-term target allocation ratio between bonds and equities for these two portfolios is 71:29. In terms of target currency allocation, 91% of assets are allocated to the US dollar and Hong Kong dollar, with the remaining 9% allocated to other currencies.\n\nTo better manage risk and enhance medium- to long-term returns, the HKMA has prudently and progressively diversified part of the Exchange Fund’s assets into a wider range of asset classes, including emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity, and overseas real estate investments. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the Investment Portfolio, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio. The market value cap of the Long-Term Growth Portfolio is set at one-third of the accumulated surplus of the Exchange Fund, but there is room for further increase as part of the Future Fund is allocated to long-term assets.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio was established in 2007 to hold shares of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) acquired by the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes on behalf of the government. Due to the unique nature of this portfolio, its investment performance is not included in the overall assessment of the Exchange Fund’s investment performance.\n\n# Deposits with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund from time to time accepts deposits from fiscal reserves, government funds, and statutory bodies. The interest rates are generally linked to the performance of the Investment Portfolio, except for deposits from the Future Fund. The interest rate for Future Fund deposits is linked to the performance of both the Investment Portfolio and the Long-Term Growth Portfolio, with the actual rate depending on the portfolio allocation. At the end of 2016, the allocation ratio of the Future Fund between the Investment Portfolio and the Long-Term Growth Portfolio was 80:20. It is expected that by the end of 2018, the portion of Future Fund deposits linked to the Long-Term Growth Portfolio will gradually increase to about 50%.\n\n# Investment Process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is based on both strategic asset allocation and tactical asset allocation. Strategic asset allocation, as reflected in the investment benchmark, represents the optimal long-term asset allocation for achieving the Fund’s investment objectives. The Exchange Fund uses the strategic allocation as a guideline and implements tactical allocation to seek returns in excess of the benchmark. As a result, the actual allocation often deviates from the benchmark (i.e., the strategic allocation), and the difference between the actual and benchmark allocations is referred to as the \"tactical deviation.\" The Financial Secretary, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, sets the investment benchmark and the limits for tactical deviation, while the HKMA is authorized to determine the tactical asset allocation. Portfolio managers may select positions within the limits of tactical deviation to profit from short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment Management\n\n# Direct Investment\n\nStaff of the HKMA’s Reserves Management Department directly manage about 74% of the Exchange Fund’s investments, including the entire Backing Portfolio and part of the Investment Portfolio. This portion of the Investment Portfolio is invested in global fixed income markets, and macro risk management strategies for the Exchange Fund are implemented through derivative instruments.\n\n# External Investment Managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA also employs external investment managers to manage about 26% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all listed equity portfolios and other special assets. The purpose of employing external investment managers is to leverage the best professional investment expertise available in the market for the Exchange Fund, to benefit from diversified investment approaches, and to enable internal professionals to acquire market knowledge and information.\n\nExpenditures related to the engagement of external investment managers include fund management and custody fees, transaction fees, withholding tax, and other taxes. These expenses vary annually, primarily influenced by market factors.\n\nThe HKMA supports the Securities and Futures Commission’s publication of the Principles of Responsible Ownership (the \"Principles\") on 7 March 2016. The Principles are voluntary in nature and are intended to assist investors in determining how best to fulfill their ownership responsibilities in investments in companies listed in Hong Kong. In managing the Exchange Fund, the HKMA encourages external fund managers appointed to manage Hong Kong equity portfolios to adopt the Principles in the management of relevant investments.\n\n# Risk Management and Oversight\n\nIn recent years, the high volatility in financial markets has underscored the importance of risk management. The HKMA has established stringent control measures and investment guidelines for portfolios managed by both internal and external investment managers, and closely monitors compliance with these guidelines and regulations. In addition, risk control tools are employed to assess market risk under both normal and extremely adverse market conditions. The HKMA also conducts detailed performance attribution analysis to ensure the most effective use of the investment management expertise of both internal and external managers.\n\n# Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Financial Markets in 2016\n\nGlobal financial markets experienced significant volatility and turbulence in 2016. In the equity markets, concerns in January over a hard landing of the Mainland economy and a slowdown in global growth led to sharp declines in Hong Kong and other major stock markets, which only stabilized by mid-February. The outcomes of the Brexit referendum in June and the US presidential election in November were both unexpected, but after brief corrections, equity markets quickly recovered lost ground. Overall, global equity markets performed well for the year.\n\nIn the bond markets, further declines in commodity prices in the first quarter deepened concerns over global growth slowdown and low inflation. In addition, uncertainties arising from the Brexit referendum in the second quarter and expectations of continued accommodative central bank policies increased demand for safe-haven assets, supporting strong performance in government bond markets in the first half of 2016. The yield on 10-year US Treasuries fell to a historic low of 1.36% in July. However, in the second half of the year, expectations of US interest rate hikes intensified, especially after the US presidential election, causing US Treasury yields to surge. Yields on other major government bonds also rose, though to a lesser extent.\n\nIn the currency markets, the US dollar continued to strengthen in 2016, with the US dollar index reaching a 14-year high. The sustained strength of the US dollar was supported by widening interest rate differentials between the US dollar and other major currencies. The Japanese yen appreciated by about 3% against the US dollar in 2016, while the euro depreciated by about 3% against the US dollar. Amid ongoing uncertainties following the Brexit referendum, the pound sterling depreciated by 16% against the US dollar during the year, marking its largest annual decline since 2008.\n\nTable 1 sets out the performance of major currencies, bond markets, and equity markets in 2016.\n\nTable 1 2016 Market Returns\nEquity market performance is calculated based on index price changes during the year.\n\n# Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\nDespite significant volatility in financial markets, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$68.1 billion in 2016, including HK$28.6 billion from overseas equities, HK$5.3 billion from Hong Kong equities, HK$33.1 billion from bonds, HK$16.9 billion from other investments held by Exchange Fund investment holding subsidiaries, and a foreign exchange valuation adjustment (downward) of HK$15.8 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets. Due to the sharp appreciation of the US dollar last year, a foreign exchange valuation adjustment (downward) was inevitable when non-US dollar investments of the Exchange Fund were converted into Hong Kong dollars. On the other hand, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation loss of HK$0.7 billion.\n\nAt the end of 2016, the total assets of the Exchange Fund amounted to HK$3,618.7 billion. The market value of investments in the Long-Term Growth Portfolio totaled HK$181.8 billion, including HK$116.8 billion in private equity and HK$65.0 billion in real estate, with total committed but undrawn investment amounts of HK$133.8 billion.\n\nDespite persistent challenges in the investment environment, the Exchange Fund achieved an investment return rate of 2% in 2016 (excluding the Strategic Portfolio). Since the commencement of investments in 2009, the internal rate of return of the Long-Term Growth Portfolio has averaged about 12% per annum.\n\nGiven the continued deterioration of the external investment environment, the HKMA has implemented a series of defensive measures in recent years, including shortening the duration of the bond portfolio, increasing cash holdings, and significantly reducing non-US dollar and non-Hong Kong dollar assets. We have also accelerated the pace of diversified investments, particularly in the Long-Term Growth Portfolio. These measures have significantly enhanced the resilience of the Exchange Fund.\n\nChart 1 shows the annual return rates of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2016. Table 2 presents the investment return rates of the Exchange Fund in 2016 and the average investment return rates over different periods. The average return rate of the Exchange Fund over the past 3 years was 0.9%, over the past 5 years was 2.0%, over the past 10 years was 2.6%, and since 1994 was 4.8%. Table 3 sets out the currency composition of the Exchange Fund’s assets as at 31 December 2016.\n\nChart 1 Exchange Fund Investment Return Rates (1994–2016)\n\n1. The calculation of investment return rates excludes assets in the Strategic Portfolio.\n2. The Composite Consumer Price Index is calculated based on the 2014/2015 series as the base period.\n\nTable 2 Exchange Fund Investment Return Rates: In Hong Kong Dollar Terms\n\n1.

During the year, the HKMA continued to strengthen institutional governance, including promoting the professional development of staff, exercising strict financial control, and enhancing information technology security, to address the challenges brought by the implementation of new measures and an increasingly heavy workload.\n\n# Maintaining Public Engagement and Institutional Development\n\n# Public Communication\n\nThe HKMA maintains close contact with the media to increase its transparency and enhance public understanding of its policies and work. In 2016, the HKMA conducted a total of 81 public media activities, including 14 press conferences, 13 on-site interviews, and 54 other public events, and arranged 30 media interviews. During the year, 326 bilingual press releases were issued, and a large number of media enquiries were handled daily.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA established two important offices: the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO) and the Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO). To explain the functions and work plans of these two offices, the HKMA undertook a range of public communication initiatives. In addition, the HKMA organized media briefings and seminars to deepen public understanding of its operations and measures in areas such as financial inclusion, reserve management, the fintech regulatory sandbox, cybersecurity, and SME financing.\n\nIn December 2016, Mr. Norman Chan, Chief Executive of the HKMA, met with reporters during the Hong Kong Association of Banks’ annual visit to Beijing.\n\n# Public Enquiries\n\nThe public enquiry service is an effective channel for citizens to obtain information about the functions and work of the HKMA. In 2016, this service handled 10,170 enquiries, an increase of 12% over 2015. About half of the enquiries related to banking policies and regulations, monetary and economic matters, and banking consumer issues, particularly bank products and services, the coin collection scheme, banking guidelines and circulars, stored value facilities and retail payment systems, anti-money laundering and terrorist financing activities, as well as prudential regulatory measures for property mortgage loans.\n\nFigure 1 shows the number of public enquiries received annually since 2013, while Figure 2 sets out the proportion of each type of enquiry in 2016.\n\n# Publications\n\nIn addition to the HKMA Annual Report, the HKMA published two issues of the Monetary and Financial Stability Report and four issues of the Quarterly Bulletin during the year, and regularly updated the Monthly Statistical Bulletin, providing the latest and thematic information and analysis on Hong Kong’s monetary, banking, and economic affairs. Furthermore, the HKMA published 32 Insight articles in 2016, a significant increase from 14 in 2015, offering in-depth analysis on various topics related to the HKMA’s work.\n\nThe HKMA’s 2015 Annual Report received the Silver Award in the \"Non-profit and Charitable Organizations\" category at the Hong Kong Management Association’s 2016 Best Annual Reports Awards.\n\n# Public Education Programmes\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre, located on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre, introduces the work of the HKMA to the public and enhances public understanding of monetary and banking matters. The Information Centre comprises an exhibition hall and a library, and is open to the public six days a week. The exhibition hall presents the work of the HKMA and the development of Hong Kong’s currency and banking industry; it also provides reading materials and exhibits for research on Hong Kong’s monetary, banking, and financial affairs.\n\nThe policy exhibition area of the Information Centre, which explains the HKMA’s work and introduces relevant financial knowledge, underwent renovation in the fourth quarter of 2016 to enrich its content and add various interactive elements. In particular, interactive games that combine learning with play were introduced to explain financial concepts in simple terms, along with richly illustrated touch screens, providing a more comprehensive and in-depth introduction to the HKMA’s work and offering visitors a brand-new experience. In addition, the renovated Information Centre features a mosaic artwork depicting Victoria Harbour, created from over 130,000 Hong Kong coins. The newly revamped policy exhibition area was reopened to the public on 24 February 2017.\n\n# HKMA Website\n\nThe HKMA’s institutional website (www.hkma.gov.hk) provides over 50,000 pages of information in English, traditional Chinese, and simplified Chinese, making it convenient for the public to access the latest information about the HKMA. The website also contains the Register of Relevant Individuals of Authorized Institutions and the Register of Authorized Institutions and Local Representative Offices, maintained in accordance with section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the Register of Stored Value Facility Licensees, maintained in accordance with the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance. The website features thematic webpages and prominent quick links to alert the public to new HKMA measures, such as the stored value facility regulatory regime, IFFO and FFO, as well as important and timely matters, such as warnings about telephone scams and the locations of coin collection trucks.\n\nThe new look of the policy exhibition area at the Information Centre.\n\nA mosaic artwork of Victoria Harbour made from Hong Kong coins.\n\nThe Information Centre provides guided tour services for visitors. During the year, the Information Centre received over 56,200 visitors and provided more than 580 guided tours for schools and other groups (see Figure 3). Since its opening in December 2003, the Information Centre has received a cumulative total of over 586,600 visitors.\n\nThe library adjacent to the exhibition hall houses over 23,000 books, periodicals, and other publications for in-depth research on topics such as Hong Kong’s currency, banking, finance, and central banking affairs. The library also maintains electronic registers of authorized institutions and local representative offices, and relevant individuals of authorized institutions, as required under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nTo maintain engagement with the community and enhance public understanding of the work of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the HKMA continued to organize public education seminars. In 2016, the HKMA held three public seminars, attracting over 1,750 secondary school students and teachers. Topics included the Linked Exchange Rate System, banking system stability, Hong Kong banknotes, Smart Tips for using banking products and services, and the Deposit Protection Scheme. Since the launch of the education seminars in 1998, more than 56,400 members of the public have participated.\n\nStudents and teachers from secondary schools across various districts attended one of the public education seminars.\n\nFigure 3: Types of groups visiting the Information Centre in 2016\n\n# Human Resources\n\nThe HKMA recruits, trains, and maintains a highly professional workforce to fulfill its policy objectives and respond flexibly to changing work priorities. Although the HKMA is part of the government structure, it employs staff on non-civil service terms, attracting talent with appropriate experience and expertise. As a public institution, the HKMA is committed to maintaining a lean and flexible organizational structure and, as far as possible, implements new measures and copes with increasing workloads by redeploying existing staff.\n\n# Staff Establishment\n\nAt the beginning of 2016, the HKMA’s staff establishment stood at 875. In the second half of 2016, 12 new positions were created to fulfill the HKMA’s regulatory functions under the new insurance regulatory regime. As a result, the staff establishment at the end of 2016 was 887.\n\nTo ensure sufficient resources for implementing new legislation and policies, continuing ongoing pilot projects, and handling the increasing complexity and volume of existing work, the overall establishment of the HKMA was increased by 40 to 927 in 2017 (an increase of 4.5%). The new positions are responsible for the following functions:\n- Promoting the stability of the banking and financial systems, including:\n    - Enhancing supervisory capacity to manage the growing technology risks faced by banks and new fintech projects, as well as to address the expansion of banks’ regional and business operations;\n    - Strengthening the regulation and enforcement of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing activities, and preparing for the 2018 Financial Action Task Force (FATF) mutual evaluation exercise;\n    - Planning and preparing for the implementation of the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance to address the issue of \"too big to fail\" in the financial sector in accordance with international standards; and\n    - Enhancing supervisory capacity to comply with new international standards on capital and market risk, and allocating more resources to consumer protection matters and handling banking complaints.\n- Strengthening investment, risk management, and other related support in response to the increased investment activities arising from further diversification of Exchange Fund investment products, while also reinforcing strategic asset allocation and investment processes to meet the challenges of an increasingly complex investment environment.\n- Developing and implementing talent development plans and enhancing related resources to ensure the HKMA has the necessary human resources to meet market developments and future challenges.\n- Enhancing research on monetary policy and the handling of monetary statistics, as well as providing resources to handle enquiries and complaints related to the licensing/designation and regulation of stored value facilities and retail payment systems.\n\nTable 1 sets out the HKMA’s staff establishment and actual staff numbers by department.\nTable 1: HKMA Staff Establishment and Actual Staff Numbers as at 1 January 2017\n\nThe HKMA deploys temporary resources to meet other work demands and seconds staff to international or local organizations, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Services Development Council, to assist with work or policies in which Hong Kong or the HKMA is involved. In addition, the HKMA assigns staff to the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board and the Treasury Markets Association to provide full-time or supporting operational assistance.\n\n# Remuneration and Benefits Policy and Remuneration Review Mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary determines the remuneration and terms of service for HKMA staff, taking into account the advice of the Governance Sub-Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, as well as prevailing market pay levels and practices. The remuneration package includes cash remuneration and provident fund contributions, along with certain basic benefits. Cash remuneration comprises a fixed monthly salary (i.e., basic salary) and a variable remuneration paid annually based on individual performance.\n\nWhen reviewing HKMA staff remuneration each year, the Financial Secretary considers the recommendations of the Governance Sub-Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, the Committee’s assessment of the HKMA’s performance over the past year, the results of remuneration surveys conducted by independent human resources consultants in the financial sector, and other relevant factors. The remuneration of individual staff members with outstanding performance may also be specially adjusted to maintain remuneration competitiveness.\n\nThe HKMA allocates approved funds for annual fixed salary adjustments or variable remuneration based on individual staff performance. The variable remuneration scheme for professional investment staff is designed to strengthen the link between investment performance and remuneration. Adjustments to fixed remuneration or the granting of variable remuneration for staff at the level of Assistant Chief Executive or above are approved by the Financial Secretary after considering the advice of the Governance Sub-Committee, with the relevant staff recusing themselves from meetings when their remuneration is discussed. For staff at the level of Executive Director and below, adjustments to fixed remuneration or the granting of variable remuneration are determined by the Chief Executive of the HKMA under the authority delegated by the Financial Secretary, and in accordance with the approved overall remuneration budget.\n\n# Senior Staff Remuneration\n\nTable 2 sets out the remuneration data for senior staff in 2016.\n\n1. Except for accrued annual leave, the actual remuneration of staff with less than one year of service is annualized to calculate the average annual remuneration for the relevant rank. 2. The number of staff listed in this table includes those with less than one year of service. The number of staff at the rank of Senior Executive Director includes the Chief Executive of The Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation Limited. 3. Other benefits include provident fund, medical and life insurance, as well as annual leave accrued during the year. These benefits may vary depending on the terms of service of individual senior staff members.", "terms": {"進": ["enter", "go", "proceed", "capitalising in", "leveraging on", "advance", "promote", "further"], "議題": ["subjects", "issues"], "支援": ["support", "technical support"], "體系": ["system", "banking system", "sector"], "「": ["“", "\""], "已舉": ["have been organised"], "預期": ["expectation", "expected", "anticipate", "forecasts", "projects"], "並與": ["and", "and"], "啟動": ["triggered", "launch", "initiation", "launching"], "信貸": ["credit"], "港": ["Hong Kong"], "升至": ["rose to", "increased to", "climbed to", "edged up to", "picked up to"], "為": ["for", "to", "as", "to help cope", "foster", "promote", "to be", "to render by", "tobe", "at", "of", "be", "become"], "科技": ["technology", "fintech", "Fintech", "technological", "tech", "It"], "建": ["developed", "build", "carry out", "built", "establish", "established"], "多項": ["several", "multiple"], "多家": ["several", "several"], "人才": ["talent", "talent"], "近年": ["over the years", "in recent years", "recent years"], "12": ["12", "December", "twelve"], "重點": ["priorities", "highlights", "key", "major"], "特別": ["especially", "special"], "針對": ["aimed at", "in combating", "with regard to"], "放程序": ["the payout process", "requirements and procedures"], "牆": ["barriers"], "德霖": ["Norman T.L.", "Norman Chan"], "人民": ["renminbi", "Renminbi", "RMB"], "流動": ["liquidity", "fund flows", "mobile", "liquid"], "價格": ["prices"], "之稱": ["known as"], "金融": ["financial", "finance", "fintech", "Fintech", "Finance"], "紛紛": ["several", "several"], "培訓": ["talent development", "personnel training", "training"], "銀行": ["banks", "banking", "bank", "banks’"], "申請": ["applications", "application", "apply"], "微升": ["a slight increase"], "上": ["in", "on", "upwards"], "令美股": ["led to an immediate plunge in the ...

{"zh": "# 外匯基金\n\n# 審計署署長報告\n\n# 香港特別行政區政府審昇計毐署\n\n# 獨立審計師報告致財政司司長\n\n# 意見\n\n茲證明我已審計列載於第149至237頁外匯基金及其附屬公司（「集團」）的財務報表，該等財務報表包括外匯基金及集團於2016年12月31日的資產負債表與截至該日止年度的收支帳目、全面收益表、權益變動表和現金流量表，以及財務報表的附註，包括主要會計政策概要。\n\n我認為，該等財務報表已按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》真實而公平地反映外匯基金及集團於2016年12月31日的財務狀況及截至該日止年度的財務表現和現金流量，並已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》 （第66章）第7條下所發出的指示妥為擬備。\n\n# 意見的基礎\n\n我已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示及審計署的審計準則進行審計。我根據該等準則而須承擔的責任，詳載於本報告「審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任」部分。根據該等準則，我獨立於集團，並已按該等準則履行其他道德責任。我相信，我所獲得的審計憑證是充足和適當地為我的審計意見提供基礎。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項是根據我的專業判斷，對截至2016年12月31日止年度財務報表的審計最為重要的事項。我對整體財務報表進行審計及形成意見時處理了這些事項，而我不會對這些事項提供單獨的意見。\n\n# 審計署署長報告（續）\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n我在審計中如何處理有關事項\n\n# 按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.5、2.6及36.1。\n\n於2016年12月31日，集團按公平值列帳的金融資產共31,989.75億港元，金融負債共9,639.77億港元。\n\n95%的該等金融資產及所有該等金融負債的公平值為相同資產或負債於活躍市場的報價（第1級參數），或是以估值方法估計，而所用的參數是以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第2級參數）。\n\n其餘5%的該等金融資產的公平值，是以估值方法估計，而所用的參數並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第3級參數）。有關金融資產共1,758.86億港元，主要包括非上市投資基金。\n\n鑑於所涉數額龐大及涉及估計，按公平值列帳的金融資產及金 融負債的估值屬關鍵審計事項。\n\n就按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值，審計程序包括：\n- 了解不同類別金融資產及金融負債的估值程序，包括相關監控措施；\n- 評價及測試監控措施，包括電腦系統的相關應用程式監控措施；\n- 就金融資產及金融負債的估值、存在、權利與責任及完整性取得函證；\n- 若使用市場報價，根據獨立來源核實價格；\n- 若所用估值方法的參數是以可觀察市場數據為基礎，評價估值方法是否適合及有關假設是否合理，以及根據獨立來源核實參數；及\n- 若所用估值方法的參數並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎，評價估值方法是否適合，以及有關假設與參數是否合理。\n\n# 未來基金存款\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.6、2.16.1、4(b)、23及28。\n\n在以往年度，財政儲備的絕大部分存款均須於要求時償還，並按每年參考投資組合過去的投資回報釐定的固定息率計算利息。\n\n政府於2016年1月1日在財政儲備內設立未來基金。未來基金存款包含來自土地基金結餘的首筆資金（為數2,197.30億港元），以及從政府一般收入帳目轉撥的恆常注資（金額由財政司司長指示）。未來基金存款的利息按綜合息率計算，而該綜合息率是參考上文提及與投資組合的表現掛鈎的固定息率及與長期增長組合（持有私募股權及房地產投資）的表現掛鈎的年度回報率，每年在加權平均基礎上釐定。除財政司司長另有指示外，未來基金的存款連同所賺取的利息應在2025年12月31日償還。\n\n於2016年12月31日，未來基金的存款共2,245.30億港元。有關存款的累計利息為100.71億港元。由於涉及數額龐大及存款條件有重大改變，需要格外關注有關存款及所賺取的利息的計量、列報方式及披露資料。\n\n就未來基金存款，審計程序包括：\n- 評價計量有關存款及所賺取的利息所用的會計政策是否恰當；\n- 審視與長期增長組合的表現掛鈎的年度回報率的計算方法；\n- 核實參考投資組合以往的表現釐定的固定息率、與長期增長組合的表現掛鈎的年度回報率及參考該兩項息率釐定的綜合息率的計算；\n- 核實以綜合息率計算的應計利息數額；及\n- 審視有關存款及所賺取的利息在財務報表中的列報方式及披露資料。\n\n# 按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.12、17及18。\n\n集團的投資物業按公平值列帳，於2016年12月31日共值227.23億港元。集團亦於3間聯營公司及14間合營公司擁有權益，該等公司主要業務為持有海外投資物業，有關權益共值320.83億港元。不論是由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有，該等投資物業的公平值均主要根據獨立專業估值師的估值釐定。該等估值涉及重大判斷及估計，包括所用的估值方法及假設。\n\n就按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值，審計程序包括：\n- 獲取及審視由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有的投資物業的估值報告，並核實公平值是根據有關估值報告所列的估值釐定；\n- 評估估值師的獨立性及資歷；及\n- 評價估值方法是否適合，以及有關假設與參數是否合理。\n\n# 其他資料\n\n金融管理專員須對其他資料負責。其他資料包括金融管理局2016年年報內的所有資料，但不包括財務報表及我的審計師報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見並不涵蓋其他資料，我亦不對其他資料發表任何形式的鑒證結論。\n\n就財務報表審計而言，我有責任閱讀其他資料，從而考慮其他資料是否與財務報表或我在審計過程中得悉的情況有重大矛盾，或者似乎存有重大錯誤陳述。基於我已執行的工作，如果我認為其他資料存有重大錯誤陳述，我需要報告該事實。在這方面，我沒有任何報告。\n\n# 金融管理專員及外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會就財務報表而須承擔的責任\n\n金融管理專員須負責按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》及行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示擬備真實而公平的財務報表，及落實其認為必要的內部控制，使財務報表不存有因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在擬備財務報表時，金融管理專員須負責評估集團持續經營的能力， 以及在適用情況下披露與持續經營有關的事項，並以持續經營作為會計基礎。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會負責監督集團的財務報告過程。\n\n# 審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任\n\n我的目標是就整體財務報表是否不存有任何因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述取得合理保證，並發出包括我意見的審計師報告。合理保證是高水平的保證，但不能確保按審計署審計準則進行的審計定能發現所存有的任何重大錯誤陳述。錯誤陳述可以由欺詐或錯誤引起，如果合理預期它們個別或滙總起來可能影響財務報表使用者所作出的經濟決定，則會被視作重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在根據審計署審計準則進行審計的過程中，我會運用專業判斷並秉持專業懷疑態度。我亦會：\n- 識別和評估因欺詐或錯誤而導致財務報表存有重大錯誤陳述的風險；設計及執行審計程序以應對這些風險；以及取得充足和適當的審計憑證，作為我意見的基礎。由於欺詐可能涉及串謀、偽造、蓄意遺漏、虛假陳述，或凌駕內部控制的情況，因此未能發現因欺詐而導致重大錯誤陳述的風險，較未能發現因錯誤而導致者為高；\n- 了解與審計相關的內部控制，以設計適當的審計程序。然而，此舉並非旨在對集團內部控制的有效性發表意見；\n- 評價金融管理專員所採用的會計政策是否恰當，以及其作出的會計估計和相關資料披露是否合理；\n-

"en": "# Exchange Fund\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit\n\n# Audit Commission of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report to the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) set out on pages 149 to 237, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and the Group as at 31 December 2016, and the income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity, and cash flow statements for the year then ended, as well as the notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Exchange Fund and the Group as at 31 December 2016, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for Opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission’s auditing standards. My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the section of this report entitled “Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements.” In accordance with these standards, I am independent of the Group and have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these standards. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2016. I addressed these matters in the context of the audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit (continued)\n\n# Key Audit Matters\n\nHow I addressed the matter in the audit\n\n# Valuation of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Measured at Fair Value\n\nRefer to Notes 2.5, 2.6, and 36.1 to the financial statements.\n\nAs at 31 December 2016, the Group’s financial assets measured at fair value amounted to HK$3,198.975 billion, and financial liabilities measured at fair value amounted to HK$963.977 billion.\n\n95% of these financial assets and all of these financial liabilities were measured at fair value based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 inputs), or were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data (Level 2 inputs).\n\nThe remaining 5% of these financial assets were measured at fair value using valuation techniques with inputs that are not based on observable market data (Level 3 inputs). These financial assets amounted to HK$175.886 billion, mainly comprising unlisted investment funds.\n\nGiven the significant amounts involved and the use of estimates, the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value was a key audit matter.\n\nThe audit procedures for the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value included:\n- Understanding the valuation processes for different categories of financial assets and financial liabilities, including relevant control measures;\n- Evaluating and testing control measures, including relevant application controls in computer systems;\n- Obtaining confirmations regarding the valuation, existence, rights and obligations, and completeness of financial assets and financial liabilities;\n- For market-quoted prices, verifying prices against independent sources;\n- Where valuation techniques used inputs based on observable market data, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation techniques and the reasonableness of the assumptions, and verifying the inputs against independent sources; and\n- Where valuation techniques used inputs not based on observable market data, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation techniques and the reasonableness of the related assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Future Fund Deposits\n\nRefer to Notes 2.6, 2.16.1, 4(b), 23, and 28 to the financial statements.\n\nIn previous years, the vast majority of fiscal reserves deposits were repayable on demand and interest was calculated at a fixed rate determined annually with reference to the investment return of the investment portfolio in previous years.\n\nOn 1 January 2016, the Government established the Future Fund within the fiscal reserves. The Future Fund deposits comprise an initial capital injection from the balance of the Land Fund (amounting to HK$219.73 billion) and regular injections transferred from the Government’s General Revenue Account (amount as directed by the Financial Secretary). Interest on the Future Fund deposits is calculated at a composite rate, which is determined annually on a weighted average basis with reference to the aforementioned fixed rate linked to the performance of the investment portfolio and the annual rate of return linked to the performance of the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (which holds private equity and real estate investments). Unless otherwise directed by the Financial Secretary, the Future Fund deposits together with the interest earned thereon are to be repaid on 31 December 2025.\n\nAs at 31 December 2016, the Future Fund deposits amounted to HK$224.53 billion. The cumulative interest on these deposits was HK$10.071 billion. Due to the significant amounts involved and the substantial changes in the terms of the deposits, particular attention was required to the measurement, presentation, and disclosure of these deposits and the interest earned thereon.\n\nFor the Future Fund deposits, the audit procedures included:\n- Evaluating whether the accounting policies adopted for the measurement of the relevant deposits and the interest earned thereon were appropriate;\n- Reviewing the calculation method for the annual rate of return linked to the performance of the Long-Term Growth Portfolio;\n- Verifying the calculation of the fixed interest rate determined with reference to the historical performance of the reference portfolio, the annual rate of return linked to the performance of the Long-Term Growth Portfolio, and the composite interest rate determined with reference to both rates;\n- Verifying the amount of accrued interest calculated using the composite interest rate; and\n- Reviewing the presentation and disclosure of the relevant deposits and the interest earned thereon in the financial statements.\n\n# Valuation of Investment Properties Measured at Fair Value\n\nPlease refer to Notes 2.12, 17, and 18 to the financial statements.\n\nThe Group’s investment properties are measured at fair value, amounting to HK$22,723 million as at 31 December 2016. The Group also holds interests in three associate companies and fourteen joint ventures, whose principal business is the holding of overseas investment properties, with the relevant interests amounting to HK$32,083 million. Whether held directly by the Group or through associates or joint ventures, the fair value of these investment properties is primarily determined based on valuations performed by independent professional valuers. These valuations involve significant judgments and estimates, including the valuation methods and assumptions adopted.\n\nFor the valuation of investment properties measured at fair value, the audit procedures included:\n- Obtaining and reviewing the valuation reports of investment properties held directly by the Group or through associates or joint ventures, and verifying that the fair value was determined in accordance with the valuations set out in the relevant reports;\n- Assessing the independence and qualifications of the valuers; and\n- Evaluating whether the valuation methods were appropriate and whether the assumptions and parameters used were reasonable.\n\n# Other Information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises all the information included in the 2016 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact. In this regard, I have nothing to report.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the Financial Statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the directions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern, and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is inappropriate to do so.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\n\nMy objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission’s auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nIn conducting the audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. I also:\n- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error; design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks; and obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n- Evaluate the appropriateness of the accounting policies adopted by the Monetary Authority and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n- Conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to issue a qualified opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and\n- Obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.", "terms": {"進": ["enter", "go", "proceed", "capitalising in", "leveraging on", "advance", "promote", "further"], "議題": ["subjects", "issues"], "支援": ["support", "technical support"], "體系": ["system", "banking system", "sector"], "「": ["“", "\""], "已舉": ["have been organised"], "預期": ["expectation", "expected", "anticipate", "forecasts", "projects"], "並與": ["and", "and"], "啟動": ["triggered", "launch", "initiation", "launching"], "信貸": ["credit"], "港": ["Hong Kong"], "升至": ["rose to", "increased to", "climbed to", "edged up to", "picked up to"], "為": ["for", "to", "as", "to help cope", "foster", "promote", "to be", "to render by", "tobe", "at", "of", "be", "become"], "科技": ["technology", "fintech", "Fintech", "technological", "tech", "It"], "建": ["developed", "build", "carry out", "built", "establish", "established"], "多項": ["several", "multiple"], "多家": ["several", "several"], "人才": ["talent", "talent"], "近年": ["over the years", "in recent years", "recent years"], "12": ["12", "December", "twelve"], "重點": ["priorities", "highlights", "key", "major"], "特別": ["especially", "special"], "針對": ["aimed at", "in combating", "with regard to"], "放程序": ["the payout process", "requirements and procedures"], "牆": ["barriers"], "德霖": ["Norman T.L.", "Norman Chan"], "人民": ["renminbi", "Renminbi", "RMB"], "流動": ["liquidity", "fund flows", "mobile", "liquid"], "價格": ["prices"], "之稱": ["known as"], "金融": ["financial", "finance", "fintech", "Fintech", "Finance"], "紛紛": ["several", "several"], "培訓": ["talent development", "personnel training", "training"], "銀行": ["banks", "banking", "bank", "banks’"], "申請": ["applications", "application", "apply"], "微升": ["a slight increase"], "上": ["in", "on", "upwards"], "令美股": ["led to an immediate plunge in the ...

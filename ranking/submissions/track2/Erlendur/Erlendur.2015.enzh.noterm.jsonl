{"en": "# Highlights of 2015\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nEconomic growth in Hong Kong moderates, reflecting weaker domestic demand and subdued export performance. Local stock market sees large swings amid heightened volatility in global financial markets. The residential property market starts to soften after the announcement of the seventh round of prudential measures in February.\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector remains resilient. Locally incorporated authorized institutions (AIs) are well capitalised, and the liquidity positions of AIs continue to be sound. The asset quality of retail banks deteriorates slightly, but stays at healthy levels.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchang rate remains broadly stable against the US dollar, with the strong-side Convertibility Undertaking triggered repeatedly in April, September and October. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate market continues to operate in an orderly manner despite turbulent global financial market conditions, reflecting resilience of the Linked Exchange Rate System to external shocks.\n\nThe money market continues to function normally with ample interbank liquidity. Following the decision of the US Federal Reserve to raise the target range for the Federal Funds Rate, the Base Rate in Hong Kong is adjusted upwards by 25 basis points to 0.75% in December.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nSupervisory efforts on AIs’ risk governance, including credit and liquidity risk management systems, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing controls, and selling practices for investment and insurance products, have been stepped up.\n\nThe HKMA announces a countercyclical capital buffer for Hong Kong and designates five authorized institutions as domestic systemically important banks. Legislative proposals to establish a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong and enhance the Deposit Protection Scheme by achieving faster payouts are respectively introduced into the Legislative Council.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\nThe HKMA continues to actively participate in international and regional forums while sparing no effort in raising Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre. Legislative proposal to improve the tax environment for promoting Hong Kong as a hub for corporate treasury centres is introduced into the Legislative Council in December.\n\nHong Kong remains the global offshore renminbi business hub with a market of considerable depth and breadth. The Mainland-Hong Kong Mutual Recognition of Funds initiative is implemented in July, further expanding Hong Kong’s renminbi product offering.\n\nHong Kong’s financial infrastructure is further enhanced by the successful launch of the e-Cheque service in December, allowing customers to issue and deposit cheques online. A new regulatory regime which provides for licensing of multipurpose stored value facilities and designation of important retail payment systems commences operation in November.\n\n# Reserves Management\nAmid the challenging and difficult investment environment, the Exchange Fund records an overall investment return of -0.6%. Total assets of the Fund reach HK$3,422.9 billion at the end of 2015.\n\nthe HKMA quickens the pace of investment diversification, especially through investments under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). At the end of 2015, the market value of investments under the LTGP totals HK$142.1 billion, made up of HK$91.3 billion in private equity and HK$50.8 billion in real estate, with outstanding investment commitments amounting to HK$122.4 billion.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communications with the community and the market through the media, public education programmes, and various other channels to facilitate understanding of its policies and operations. Corporate governance is further improved by supporting professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline, enhancing it security, and realigning duties among senior management to help cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives and the increasing complexity of work.", "zh": "# 2015年重點回顧\n\n# 經濟及金融環境\n\n香港經濟增長放緩，反映本地需求疲弱及出口表現低迷。受全球金融市場波動加劇影響，本地股市出現大幅波動。自二月份第七輪審慎監管措施公布後，住宅物業市場開始轉趨疲軟。\n\n香港銀行業依然具備韌性。本地註冊認可機構（AIs）資本充足，流動性狀況持續穩健。零售銀行的資產質素略有下降，但仍維持在健康水平。\n\n# 貨幣穩定\n\n港元兌美元匯率大致保持穩定，強方兌換保證於四月、九月及十月多次被觸發。儘管全球金融市場動盪，港元匯率市場仍然有序運作，反映聯繫匯率制度對外來衝擊的韌性。\n\n貨幣市場繼續正常運作，銀行間流動性充裕。隨著美國聯邦儲備局決定上調聯邦基金利率目標區間，香港基本利率於十二月上調25個基點至0.75%。\n\n# 銀行穩定\n\n對認可機構風險管治的監管工作加強，包括信貸及流動性風險管理系統、反洗錢及打擊恐怖分子資金籌集控制，以及投資及保險產品銷售行為。\n\n金管局公布香港的逆周期資本緩衝，並指定五家認可機構為本地系統重要性銀行。分別就建立金融機構處置機制及加快存款保障計劃賠付速度的立法建議，提交立法會審議。\n\n# 國際金融中心\n\n金管局繼續積極參與國際及地區性論壇，並全力提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。為推動香港成為企業財資中心樞紐，改善稅務環境的立法建議於十二月提交立法會。\n\n香港繼續作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐，市場規模深廣。內地與香港基金互認計劃於七月實施，進一步擴展香港的人民幣產品供應。\n\n隨著十二月電子支票服務成功推出，香港的金融基礎設施進一步提升，讓客戶可於網上開立及存入支票。新的監管制度於十一月開始實施，為多用途儲值支付工具發牌及指定重要零售支付系統提供法律框架。\n\n# 儲備管理\n在充滿挑戰及困難的投資環境下，外匯基金錄得-0.6%的整體投資回報。截至2015年底，基金總資產達港幣34,229億元。\n\n金管局加快投資多元化步伐，特別是透過長遠增長組合（LTGP）進行投資。截至2015年底，LTGP下的投資市值合共港幣1,421億元，包括私募股權港幣913億元及房地產港幣508億元，尚未動用的投資承諾為港幣1,224億元。\n\n# 機構職能\n\n金管局透過媒體、公眾教育計劃及多元渠道，與社會及市場保持有效溝通，促進對其政策及運作的理解。透過支持員工專業發展、加強財務紀律、提升資訊科技安全，以及重整高層管理職責，進一步完善企業管治，以應對新措施推行及工作日益複雜所帶來的挑戰。"}
{"en": "# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nThe Hong Kong economy experienced slower growth in 2015 reflecting weaker domestic demand and poor export performance. Economic growth for 2016 is expected to remain soft amid stiff external headwinds and fragile financial market conditions.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Overview\n\nEconomic growth in Hong Kong moderated during the year, with real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth slowing to 2.4% from 2.6% in 2014 (Table 1). This reflected milder expansion in domestic demand, although net exports reverted to a positive contributor to GDP growth as total imports declined faster than total exports (Chart 1). Despite the modest economic performance, the labour market held broadly stable, with the unemployment rate staying low at about 3.3%. Inflation eased further due to subsiding pressures on domestic costs and import prices. Local stock prices saw large swings amid heightened volatility in global financial markets. The residential property market started to soften after the announcement of the seventh round of prudential measures in February, with housing prices showing further signs of consolidation towards the end of the year.\n\nChart 1 Real GDP growth by contribution\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\nTable 1 Real GDP growth by expenditure component (period-over-period)\n\nNote: The seasonally-adjusted quarter-on-quarter rates of change in the gross domestic fixed capital formation are not available.\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nOn the monetary front, exchange-rate stability was maintained in 2015, with the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate hovering near 7.75 against the US dollar. The strong-side Convertibility Undertaking was triggered in April due to equity-related inflows, and again in September and October reflecting conversions of the offshore renminbi into Hong Kong dollars and some commercial demand for Hong Kong dollars. With the enlarged Aggregate Balance, local interest rates continued to stay low, while the HKMA Base Rate was adjusted upwards from 0.5% to 0.75% following the US interest rate lift-off in mid-December. Because of softer credit demand, total loan growth in the banking sector slowed further to 3.5% in 2015 from 12.7% in 2014. The banking industry's overall loan quality weakened slightly, but the classified loan ratios remained at low levels.\n\n# Domestic demand\n\nDomestic demand grew at a slower pace in 2015. While broadly stable job and income conditions continued to provide support, weak consumer confidence and corrections in asset prices weighed on private consumption growth in the second half of the year. However, due to the relatively strong growth momentum in the first half, the full-year growth in private consumption increased to 4.8% from 3.3% in 2014. Government consumption increased slightly faster by 3.4%. In fact, the slower growth in domestic demand was mainly due to the 2.2% decline in gross domestic fixed capital formation (Chart 2). Private-sector machinery and equipment acquisition contracted for the second consecutive year amid deteriorating business sentiment, and building and construction activities also showed weaker growth momentum alongside slower progress in public projects.\n\n# External demand\n\nHong Kong’s export performance deteriorated in 2015 (Chart 3). Exports of goods recorded a broad-based 1.7% decline, the first time since 2009. Exports to Japan and the European Union declined, while those to the US recorded little growth. The feeble final demand from these advanced markets also weighed on regional industrial activities and intra-regional trade. As a result, Hong Kong’s exports to Mainland China, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan also decreased amid weak intermediate and final demand from these economies. Hong Kong’s exports of services continued to moderate from a high growth path in earlier years, which culminated in a 0.6% decline in 2015, mainly due to the slowdown in inbound tourism. Imports of goods also fell back alongside weaker domestic and export-induced demand. In contrast, growth in imports of services accelerated due to strong travel interest among local residents. On a net basis, the overall trade surplus improved slightly in 2015, leading to a modest positive contribution to GDP growth.\n\nChart 2 Domestic demand\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Inflation\n\nUnderlying inflation eased further in 2015 amid moderated domestic cost pressures and reduced import price inflation. After netting out the effects of the Government's one-off relief measures, the underlying inflation rate dropped to 2.5% from 3.5% in 2014 (Chart 4). With subdued economic activity, labour cost pressures remained steady, while commercial and industrial rental cost pressures eased, particularly in the second half. Thanks to softened global commodity prices and the strong Hong Kong dollar, import price pressures abated, while food inflation also stayed low. As the feed-through of fresh-letting housing rentals in earlier quarters had been moderate, the rental component of inflation remained contained.\n\nChart 3 Exports of goods and services\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\nChart 4 Underlying consumer price inflation\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\n# Labour market\n\nLabour market conditions remained stable in 2015. Labour demand held up, with the decline in employment in trade and tourism-related sectors being largely offset by the steady pace of hiring in other business sectors, resulting in an increase in total employment of 1.3% from a year earlier. With labour supply also picking up by 1.3%, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate stayed at around 3.3% throughout the year (Chart 5). Given the still-tight labour market, labour earnings in nominal terms rose by 4.7% in the first three quarters of the year, compared with 4.3% in 2014. With inflationary pressures easing, real labour earnings increased by 1.3% in the first three quarters, compared with a decline of 0.1% in 2014.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe Hong Kong stock market experienced a volatile year due to drastic changes in the external environment. After a flat first quarter, the local stock market was buoyant in the second quarter amid the bullish sentiment in the Mainland A-share market and capital inflows. The Hang Seng Index surged to a seven-year high in April, with the Southbound Daily Quota under the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect being exhausted for the first time since its inception in November 2014 (Chart 6). However, the local market reversed course starting from late June, with the Hang Seng Index plunging 28% to a year-low in September amid the sell-offs in the Mainland A-share market and global stock markets, the heightened volatility in the global foreign exchange market, and weaknesses in international commodity prices. The Hong Kong stock market recovered some ground in the last quarter as global and Mainland financial markets stabilised. For 2015 as a whole, the Hang Seng index recorded a decline of 7.2%, the worst performance since 2011, while the average daily turnover rose to HK$105.6 billion from HK$69.5 billion in 2014. Although fund-raising activities moderated in the second half, the overall equity funds raised from the local stock market increased to HK$1,115.6 billion from HK$942.7 billion a year earlier.\n\n# Property market\n\nSigns of consolidation emerged in the residential property market. After experiencing a buoyant period in early 2015, the residential property market softened following the announcement of the seventh round of prudential measures in February. With housing prices picking up at a slower pace before declining in the last quarter, the cumulative increase in housing prices in 2015 was 2.5%, smaller than the 13.5% increase in 2014 (Chart 6). Meanwhile, the transaction volume decreased by 12.3% from a year ago to 55,982 units as trading activities in the secondary market fell noticeably in the second half. Speculative transactions, including confirmor transactions and short-term flipping trades, continued to stay low. Despite this, household affordability remained stretched, with the price-to-income ratio reaching 15.7 and the income-gearing ratio remaining far above its long-term average. The commercial and industrial property markets were buoyant in the first half, but trading activities then softened, with both prices and rents registering declines in the last quarter. Rental yields remained broadly the same from a year earlier and stayed near their historical lows.\n\nChart 6 Asset prices\nSources: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nHong Kong’s economic growth for 2016 is expected to remain soft. Private-sector analysts project the economy to expand at a slower average rate of 1.7% while the Government forecasts growth in the range of 1–2%. More specifically, the lacklustre global growth prospects, sustained weakness in inbound tourism, and the negative spillovers from turbulent global financial market conditions will continue to restrain the performance of Hong Kong’s exports. Domestically, private consumption is anticipated to grow moderately, as labour market conditions will likely face some pressures amid weaker economic momentum, and local asset price adjustments may dent consumer confidence and induce negative wealth effects. Building and construction activities may hold up, but weak business sentiment and interest rate rises will weigh on private capital investment.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nInflationary pressures are expected to remain contained in 2016. Import price pressures will likely stay soft, while domestic cost pressures are expected to be modest amid moderate economic growth momentum. The rental component of inflation may also ease due to diminishing pressures in fresh-letting housing rentals towards the end of 2015. Market consensus predicts the headline inflation rate at 2.5% in 2016, while the Government projects the underlying inflation rate at 2.0%. The labour market may also soften somewhat due to the slowdown in inbound tourism and continued sluggishness in the export sector. Private-sector analysts now expect the unemployment rate to increase to 3.5% in 2016.\n\n# Uncertainties and risks\n\nThe economic outlook for 2016 is subject to a number of uncertainties and risks. In particular, the pace of further US interest rate rises, the global growth prospects and commodity price movements will continue to be the major sources of uncertainty. Any significant adverse developments could heighten volatilities in global financial markets and international capital flows, thereby tightening domestic monetary and financial conditions and casting a shadow over Hong Kong's growth prospects. The resulting impact of these external factors on the domestic economy will depend crucially on their impact on the property market through the wealth and balance-sheet effects. While the property market is facing increasing downside risks stemming from weakening sentiment in the global and domestic financial markets, the normalisation of US interest rates, and a narrowing housing demand-supply gap, more time is needed to establish whether the property market has entered a down-cycle. Although an abrupt adjustment in the property market could pose significant headwinds to the broader economy, the introduction of counter-cyclical macroprudential measures and other supervisory measures over the past few years has significantly enhanced the resilience of Hong Kong's banking system.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector remained resilient during the year, notwithstanding a further divergence in the monetary policies of advanced economies and the build-up of vulnerabilities in emerging market economies. The liquidity positions of authorized institutions (AIs) continued to be sound, and locally incorporated AIs were well capitalised. The asset quality of retail banks deteriorated slightly, but stayed at a healthy level.\n\n# Interest rate trends\n\nIn line with the US dollar interest rates, Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates were low throughout the year. The Hong Kong dollar funding cost of retail banks declined in the first half of the year as indicated by a downward trend in the composite interest rate, and remained stable in the second half (Chart 7).\n\nChart 7 HIBOR fixings, composite rate and best lending rate (BLR)\nNotes:\n1. HiBoR fixings refer to the Hong Kong Dollar interest Settlement Rates released by the Hong Kong Association of Banks and are monthly averages.\n\n2. BlR refers to the best lending rate quoted by the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (monthly averages).\n\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe profitability of the banking sector moderated in 2015. The aggregate pre-tax operating profits of retail banks' Hong Kong offices declined by 2.8%, as growth in fee and commission income (up 9.7%), foreign exchange and derivatives operation income (up 22.4%), and net interest income (up 1.3%) was offset by an 8.8% increase in operating expenses and a 76% increase in loan impairment charges. However, the post-tax profit of retail banks increased by 14.7%, mainly due to gains from disposals of strategic investments. The post-tax return on average assets of retail banks improved to 1.05% from 0.99% in 2014 (Chart 8).\n", "zh": "# 經濟及金融環境\n\n2015年，香港經濟增長放緩，反映本地需求疲弱及出口表現不佳。預計2016年經濟增長將繼續疲軟，主要受外圍逆風及金融市場狀況脆弱所影響。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 概覽\n\n年內，香港經濟增長有所放緩，實質本地生產總值（GDP）增長由2014年的2.6%降至2.4%（見表1）。這主要反映本地需求擴張力度減弱，儘管淨出口因總進口跌幅大於總出口，重新成為GDP增長的正面貢獻因素（見圖1）。儘管經濟表現溫和，勞動市場大致保持穩定，失業率維持在約3.3%的低水平。由於本地成本及進口價格壓力減退，通脹進一步緩和。受全球金融市場波動加劇影響，本地股價大幅波動。自二月份第七輪審慎措施公布後，住宅物業市場開始轉弱，年末樓價進一步呈現整固跡象。\n\n圖1 實質GDP按貢獻劃分的增長\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n表1 按開支項目劃分的實質GDP增長（按期比較）\n\n註：本地固定資本形成總額的經季節性調整按季變動率未有提供。\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 經濟及金融環境\n\n在貨幣方面，2015年匯率穩定，港元兌美元匯率維持在7.75附近。由於與股票相關的資金流入，強方兌換保證於四月被觸發，九月及十月則因離岸人民幣兌換為港元及部分商業需求再次觸發。隨著結餘總額擴大，本地利率持續偏低，而金管局基本利率於十二月中美國加息後由0.5%上調至0.75%。由於信貸需求減弱，銀行業總貸款增長由2014年的12.7%進一步放緩至2015年的3.5%。銀行業整體貸款質素略為轉弱，但分類貸款比率仍處於低水平。\n\n# 本地需求\n\n2015年，本地需求增長步伐放緩。雖然就業及收入狀況大致穩定，繼續提供支持，但消費者信心疲弱及資產價格調整，令下半年私人消費增長受壓。然而，受上半年較強增長動力帶動，全年私人消費增長由2014年的3.3%升至4.8%。政府消費增長亦略為加快至3.4%。事實上，本地需求增長放緩主要由於本地固定資本形成總額下跌2.2%（見圖2）。受商業氣氛轉差影響，私營機械及設備投資連續第二年收縮，建築工程活動增長動力亦因公共工程進度放緩而減弱。\n\n# 外部需求\n\n2015年，香港出口表現轉差（見圖3）。貨物出口錄得1.7%的全面下跌，為2009年以來首次。對日本及歐盟出口下跌，對美國出口則幾乎無增長。這些先進市場終端需求疲弱，亦拖累區內工業活動及區內貿易。因此，香港對中國內地、新加坡、南韓及台灣的出口亦因這些經濟體中間及終端需求疲弱而下跌。香港服務出口繼續自早年高增長軌道回落，2015年錄得0.6%跌幅，主要由於入境旅遊放緩。貨物進口亦因本地及出口帶動需求減弱而回落。相反，服務進口增長加快，反映本地居民旅遊意欲強勁。淨計下，2015年整體貿易順差略為改善，對GDP增長帶來溫和正面貢獻。\n\n圖2 本地需求\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 通脹\n\n2015年，隨著本地成本壓力緩和及進口價格通脹減退，基本通脹進一步回落。扣除政府一次性紓困措施影響後，基本通脹率由2014年的3.5%降至2.5%（見圖4）。經濟活動疲弱下，勞工成本壓力保持平穩，商業及工業租金壓力亦有所紓緩，特別是下半年。受惠於全球商品價格回落及港元強勢，進口價格壓力減退，食品通脹亦維持低水平。由於早前新租約住宅租金傳導效應溫和，通脹中的租金組成部分亦受控。\n\n圖3 貨物及服務出口\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n圖4 基本消費物價通脹\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 經濟及金融環境\n\n# 勞動市場\n\n2015年，勞動市場狀況保持穩定。勞動需求維持，貿易及旅遊相關行業就業下跌，惟其他行業招聘步伐穩定，令總就業人數按年增加1.3%。勞動供應亦上升1.3%，全年經季節性調整失業率維持約3.3%（見圖5）。在勞動市場仍然緊絀下，名義勞工收入於首三季上升4.7%，高於2014年的4.3%。隨通脹壓力減退，實質勞工收入於首三季上升1.3%，而2014年則下跌0.1%。\n\n# 股市\n\n受外圍環境劇變影響，香港股市全年波動劇烈。首季市況平穩，第二季受內地A股市場牛市及資金流入帶動，港股氣氛暢旺。恒生指數於四月升至七年新高，滬港通南向每日額度自2014年11月開通以來首次用盡（見圖6）。惟自六月下旬起，受內地A股及環球股市拋售、全球外匯市場波動加劇及國際商品價格疲弱影響，港股轉向下跌，恒生指數於九月急挫28%，跌至全年低位。隨著環球及內地金融市場穩定，港股於第四季回升部分失地。2015年全年，恒生指數下跌7.2%，為2011年以來最差表現，惟平均每日成交額由2014年的695億港元升至1,056億港元。雖然下半年集資活動放緩，全年本地股市集資總額仍由9427億港元增至1,1156億港元。\n\n# 物業市場\n\n住宅物業市場出現整固跡象。經歷了2015年初的暢旺期後，隨著2月第七輪審慎監管措施公布，住宅物業市場轉趨疲軟。樓價升幅在下跌前已經放緩，全年累計升幅為2.5%，遠低於2014年的13.5%（圖6）。同時，成交量按年下跌12.3%，至55,982宗，主要因下半年二手市場交投明顯減少。投機性交易，包括「確認者」交易及短期炒賣，仍然處於低水平。儘管如此，住戶負擔能力依然緊絀，樓價與收入比率達15.7，入息負擔比率亦遠高於長期平均水平。工商物業市場於上半年表現暢旺，但其後交投轉弱，第四季價格及租金均錄得下跌。租金回報率與去年大致持平，並維持在歷史低位附近。\n\n圖6 資產價格\n資料來源：差餉物業估價署及香港交易及結算所有限公司。\n\n# 經濟及金融環境\n\n# 經濟前景展望\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n預計2016年香港經濟增長將維持疲弱。私營機構分析員預測經濟平均增長率將放緩至1.7%，而政府則預測增長介乎1%至2%。具體而言，全球經濟增長前景乏力、入境旅遊持續疲弱，以及全球金融市場動盪帶來的負面溢出效應，將繼續抑制香港出口表現。在本地方面，私人消費預期將溫和增長，因勞動市場狀況在經濟動力減弱下或面臨壓力，而本地資產價格調整亦可能削弱消費者信心並產生負面財富效應。建築工程活動或可維持，但商業氣氛疲弱及利率上升將拖累私人資本投資。\n\n# 通脹及勞動市場\n\n預計2016年通脹壓力將維持受控。進口價格壓力料將保持溫和，而本地成本壓力亦因經濟增長動力溫和而預期僅屬適度。由於2015年底新租住宅租金壓力減退，通脹中的租金成分亦可能放緩。市場普遍預期2016年整體通脹率為2.5%，而政府則預測基本通脹率為2.0%。由於入境旅遊放緩及出口業持續疲弱，勞動市場亦可能略為轉弱。私營機構分析員現時預期失業率於2016年將上升至3.5%。\n\n# 不確定性與風險\n\n2016年經濟前景面臨多項不確定性與風險。特別是美國加息步伐、全球經濟增長前景及商品價格走勢，將繼續是主要的不確定因素。任何重大不利發展均可能加劇全球金融市場及國際資本流動的波動，從而收緊本地貨幣及金融狀況，並為香港增長前景蒙上陰影。這些外部因素對本地經濟的最終影響，將取決於其通過財富及資產負債表效應對物業市場的影響。雖然物業市場正面臨來自全球及本地金融市場氣氛轉弱、美國利率正常化及住屋供求差距收窄等下行風險，但仍需時間判斷物業市場是否已進入下行周期。儘管物業市場若出現急劇調整，可能對整體經濟構成重大阻力，但過去數年推行的逆周期宏觀審慎措施及其他監管措施，已大大提升香港銀行體系的抗逆力。\n\n# 銀行業表現\n\n儘管先進經濟體貨幣政策進一步分歧及新興市場經濟體脆弱性上升，香港銀行業於年內仍保持穩健。認可機構的流動資金狀況持續良好，本地註冊認可機構資本充足。零售銀行資產質素略為轉差，但仍處於健康水平。\n\n# 利率走勢\n\n與美元利率走勢一致，全年港元銀行同業拆息維持在低水平。綜合利率下行反映零售銀行港元資金成本於上半年下降，並於下半年保持穩定（圖7）。\n\n圖7 HIBOR定盤、綜合利率及最優惠貸款利率（BLR）\n註：\n1.

{"en": "# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained broadly stable throughout 2015 despite turbulent financial market conditions and the US interest rate lift-off in December. The money market also continued to function normally with ample interbank liquidity. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability over the past few decades, the Linked Exchange Rate System continued to be hiqhly resilient to external shocks.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong's monetary policy is currency stability. This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong's currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75 - 7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises\n\n* Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks\n* Government-issued notes and coins in circulation \n* the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of clearing account balances of banks kept with the HKMA \n* Exchange Fund Bills and Notes issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs). When the demand for Hong Kong dollars is greater than the supply and the market exchange rate strengthens to the strong-side CU of HK$7.75 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to sell Hong Kong dollars to banks for US dollars. The Aggregate Balance will then expand to push down Hong Kong dollar interest rates, creating monetary conditions that move the Hong Kong dollar away from the strong-side limit to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if the supply of Hong Kong dollars is greater than demand and the market exchange rate weakens to the weak-side CU of HK$7.85 to one US dollar, the HKMA will buy Hong Kong dollars from banks. The Aggregate Balance will then contract to drive Hong Kong dollar interest rates up, pushing the Hong Kong dollar away from the weak-side limit to stay within the Convertibility Zone.\n\nThe Certificates of Indebtedness and the government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation shown here are stated at Hong Kong dollar face values. The corresponding items shown in the balance sheet of the Exchange Fund in this Annual Report are in Hong Kong dollars equivalent to the US dollar amounts required for their redemption at the prevailing exchange rates on the balance sheet date. This arrangement is in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong.\n\nThe amount of EFBN shown here is different from that in the balance sheet of the Exchange Fund in this Annual Report. In accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong, the EFBN held by the HKMA on behalf of the Exchange Fund in relation to its trading of the EFBN in the secondary market are offset against the EFBN issued, and the net amount is recorded in the balance sheet.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\n# REVIEW OF 2015\n\n# Exchange-rate stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained broadly stable in 2015, trading within a narrow range of 7.7500 to 7.7657 against the US dollar (Chart 1). In the early part of 2015, the Hong Kong dollar was under slight weakening pressures amid market concerns about the US interest rate lift-off. However, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate strengthened close to 7.75 during the second quarter, with the strong-side CU being triggered repeatedly in April mainly due to a surge in equity-related demand for the Hong Kong dollar amid buoyant stock market activities. Moving into the second half of the year, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate continued to hover close to 7.75 against the US dollar in August, despite the notable sell-off in Hong Kong and Mainland’s equity markets, and increased volatilities in the global currency markets (including the renminbi). Driven by conversions of the offshore renminbi into the Hong Kong dollar, the strong-side CU was triggered again in September and October. While the US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) raised the target range for the Federal Funds Rate by 25 basis points in mid-December, the Hong Kong dollar continued to move within a tight range against the US dollar without notable outflow pressures. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market operated in an orderly manner throughout 2015, despite the turbulent global financial market conditions.\n\nChart 1 Market exchange rate in 2015\n\nAs the strong-side CU was repeatedly triggered in April, September and October, the HKMA passively purchased a total of US$29.3 billion from banks in exchange for HK$227.2 billion, in accordance with the Currency Board principles. This led to a corresponding expansion in the Aggregate Balance, with part of the expansion being offset by additional issuance of Exchange Fund Bills in response to banks’ strong demand for liquidity management (Chart 2). The additional issuance of Exchange Fund paper is consistent with Currency Board principles, as it represents a change in the composition of the Monetary Base with the Monetary Base fully backed by foreign exchange reserves. The total of Aggregate Balance and outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and notes increased to HK$1,221.0 billion at the end of 2015 from HK$992.5 billion a year earlier.\n\nChart 2 Aggregate Balance and outstanding Exchange Fund paper in 2015\n\n# Money market\n\nWith ample liquidity in the banking system, Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained low throughout 2015. As the target range for the US Federal Funds Rate was adjusted upwards from 0–0.25% to 0.25–0.5% on 16 December (US time), the Base Rate was also adjusted upwards from 0.5% to 0.75% on 17 December according to the pre-set formula. For 2015 as a whole, interbank interest rates for tenors from overnight to three months stayed below the Base Rate (Chart 3), with moderate fluctuations driven by banks’ seasonal liquidity needs and tightened liquidity amid volatile financial market conditions in August. Broadly tracking the spreads between the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) and the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), the Hong Kong dollar forward points turned to notable premiums in August amid tightened market liquidity, and then subsequently dipped into discounts towards the end of the year due to the broad-based increases in the US dollar interest rates (Chart 4). Overall, the money market continued to function normally. Discount Window borrowing was not active, amounting to only HK$2.8 billion in 2015.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nChart 3 Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates in 2015\n\nChart 4 Hong Kong dollar forward points in 2015\n\n# Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nSince its establishment in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has continued to function smoothly and contributed significantly to Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability over the past few decades. Given Hong Kong's small and open economy and its role as an international financial hub, the LERS remains the most suitable exchange rate regime for Hong Kong. The Hong Kong SAR Government is firmly committed to maintaining the LERS. Indeed, stability in the foreign exchange and money markets further reinforces the credibility of the Government's commitment, and the public continues to have strong confidence in the Hong Kong dollar as a means of payment and storage of value. In its 2015 Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) continued to endorse the LERS as the best monetary arrangement for Hong Kong, citing Hong Kong's robust institutional, legal and policy framework, ample fiscal reserves, flexible markets, and sound financial system as key factors supporting the smooth functioning of the LERS.\n\nGiven that a robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS, the HKMA continued to closely monitor banks' management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and stepped up its supervisory efforts on banks' corporate and property-related lending to enhance the resilience of the banking sector. In view of the rise in US interest rates, the HKMA reminded the public to make necessary preparations in managing risks, noting that any triggering of the weak-side CU and outflow of Hong Kong dollars are a natural and necessary step in the process of the normalisation of the Hong Kong dollar interest rates.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) moved within a narrow range of 106.3-107.5% during 2015, without touching the Upper or Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 106.3% on 31 December (Chart 5). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. The large amount of financial resources of the Fund provides a powerful backstop to protect Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability in the event of abrupt shocks.\n\nChart 5 Daily movement of the Backing Ratio in 2015\n\n# Other activities\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) Currency Board Sub-Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong. In 2015, the Sub-Committee considered issues including the supply of international US dollar loans by global banks, the international use of macro-prudential measures, the implications of US interest rate hikes for Hong Kong's property market, the formula for the determination of the Base Rate, macroeconomic implications of the Hong Kong dollar real effective exchange rate rise, and the sovereign risk of emerging market economies. Records of the Sub-Committee’s discussions and the reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the Sub-Committee are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research (HKIMR) continued to sponsor research in the fields of monetary policy, banking and finance. In 2015, the Institute hosted 16 research fellows and published 27 working papers.\n\nThe Institute organised five international conferences and workshops. The main ones included:\n\n* The Sixth Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy in January, under the title \"Leverage and Financial System Efficiency and Stability: Chinese and International Experiences\". 11 high quality research papers were presented at the conference, covering an extensive range of issues such as corporate leverage in China, China's credit boom and business cycle, banking competition and financial stability, as well as banking regulation and credit supply.\n* The HKIMR and the University of Hong Kong joint conference entitled \"HKIMR-HKU International Conference on Finance, Institutions and Economic Growth\" in May. The conference covered many different economic issues, including banking and monetary policy, international financing and cross border mergers and acquisitions, design of financial regulation, as well as macroeconomic environment and capital markets.\n* The HKIMR, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas joint conference in October on \"Diverging Monetary Policies, Global Capital Flows and Financial Stability\". The conference examined a wide range of issues including the relationship between monetary policies, international capital flows and exchange rates, divergent monetary policies and their implications for global financial stability, spillover of major central bank policies to other parts of the world, and the costs and benefits of global policy co-ordination.\n\nThe Institute also hosted its 13th HKIMR Summer Workshop in August, and the 13th HKIMR Conference on the Mainland Economy in September, addressing issues on fiscal reform and local government financing in Mainland China. The conferences and workshops were attended by participants from academia, the financial services industry and global central banks. In addition, the Institute held 24 public seminars during the year covering a broad range of economic, monetary and financial issues.\n\n# Notes and coins\n\nAt the end of 2015, the total value of banknotes in circulation was HK$360.2 billion, an increase of 5.3% from a year earlier (Charts 6, 7 and 8). The total value of government-issued notes and coins in circulation amounted to HK$11.2 billion, up 2.9% (Charts 9 and 10). The value of government-issued HK$10 notes in circulation was HK$4.0 billion, of which 85% were polymer notes.\n", "zh": "# 貨幣穩定\n\n儘管2015年金融市場動盪及美國於12月啟動加息，港元匯率全年仍大致保持穩定。貨幣市場亦繼續運作正常，銀行間流動資金充裕。作為過去數十年香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石，聯繫匯率制度繼續展現出對外部衝擊的高度韌性。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的首要目標是維持貨幣穩定。這是指港元對外匯市場美元匯率的外部價值保持穩定，匯率維持在每美元兌7.75至7.85港元的區間內。香港貨幣體系的結構以貨幣發行局安排為特點，要求貨幣基礎必須由外匯基金持有的美元儲備作最少100%支持，貨幣基礎的變動亦必須與美元儲備的相應變動完全一致。\n\n貨幣基礎（見表一）包括：\n\n* 貨幣發行票據，為三家發鈔銀行發行的鈔票提供全額支持\n* 政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣\n* 銀行在金管局開立結算賬戶的結餘總和（即結餘總額）\n* 金管局代表政府發行的外匯基金票據及債券。\n\n港元匯率的穩定是通過自動利率調整機制及金管局堅定履行兌換承諾（CUs）來維持的。當市場對港元需求大於供應，匯率升至強方兌換保證（每美元兌7.75港元）時，金管局準備好以港元向銀行購買美元。此舉將擴大結餘總額，壓低港元利率，從而令港元匯率由強方極限回落至7.75至7.85的兌換區間內。相反，若港元供應大於需求，匯率貶至弱方兌換保證（每美元兌7.85港元），金管局則會向銀行買入港元。結餘總額隨之收縮，推高港元利率，令港元匯率由弱方極限回升，維持在兌換區間內。\n\n此處所列的貨幣發行票據及政府發行的流通紙幣和硬幣以港元面值列示。外匯基金資產負債表中相應項目則以按結算日現行匯率兌換美元所需的港元金額列示。此安排符合香港普遍認可的會計原則。\n\n此處所列的外匯基金票據及債券（EFBN）金額與本年報外匯基金資產負債表所列不同。根據香港普遍認可的會計原則，金管局代表外匯基金於二級市場買賣EFBN時所持有的EFBN，會與已發行的EFBN相抵，並以淨額在資產負債表中列示。\n\n# 貨幣穩定\n\n# 2015年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n2015年，港元兌美元匯率大致穩定，於7.7500至7.7657的窄幅區間內波動（見圖一）。年初，市場憂慮美國加息，港元曾受輕微貶值壓力。然而，第二季期間，受股市活躍帶動港元相關需求急升，港元匯率於4月多次觸及強方兌換保證，匯率轉強至接近7.75。下半年，即使8月香港及內地股市大幅拋售，全球貨幣市場（包括人民幣）波動加劇，港元兌美元匯率仍維持接近7.75。受離岸人民幣兌換港元推動，9月及10月強方兌換保證再度被觸發。雖然美國聯邦公開市場委員會（FOMC）於12月中將聯邦基金利率目標區間上調25個基點，港元兌美元匯率仍維持窄幅波動，未見明顯資金流出壓力。總體而言，2015年港元外匯市場在全球金融市場動盪下仍有序運作。\n\n圖一 2015年市場匯率\n\n由於4月、9月及10月多次觸及強方兌換保證，金管局根據貨幣發行局原則，被動向銀行購入合共293億美元，並支付2,272億港元。這導致結餘總額相應擴大，部分增幅因應銀行對流動性管理需求強勁而額外發行外匯基金票據所抵銷（見圖二）。額外發行外匯基金票據符合貨幣發行局原則，因其僅改變貨幣基礎的組成，貨幣基礎仍獲外匯儲備全額支持。結餘總額及未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額由2014年底的9,925億港元增至2015年底的12,210億港元。\n\n圖二 2015年結餘總額及未償還外匯基金票據\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n銀行體系流動資金充裕，2015年港元銀行間利率全年維持低位。隨著美國聯邦基金利率目標區間於12月16日（美國時間）由0–0.25%上調至0.25–0.5%，基本利率亦按預設公式於12月17日由0.5%上調至0.75%。全年而言，隔夜至三個月期銀行間利率均低於基本利率（見圖三），波動主要受銀行季節性流動性需求及8月金融市場波動導致流動性收緊所影響。港元銀行間拆息（HIBOR）與倫敦銀行間拆息（LIBOR）息差變化下，8月市場流動性收緊，港元遠期點轉為明顯升水，年底隨美元利率全面上升而轉為貼水（見圖四）。整體而言，貨幣市場繼續運作正常。貼現窗借款並不活躍，2015年僅為28億港元。\n\n# 貨幣穩定\n\n圖三 2015年港元銀行間利率\n\n圖四 2015年港元遠期點\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n自1983年設立以來，聯繫匯率制度（LERS）一直運作順暢，並在過去數十年對香港的貨幣及金融穩定作出了重大貢獻。鑑於香港經濟規模小且高度開放，以及作為國際金融中心的角色，聯繫匯率制度仍然是最適合香港的匯率安排。香港特別行政區政府堅定承諾維持聯繫匯率制度。事實上，外匯及貨幣市場的穩定進一步加強了政府承諾的公信力，公眾對港元作為支付和儲值手段繼續充滿信心。國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）於2015年與香港進行第四條磋商時，繼續認同聯繫匯率制度是香港最佳的貨幣安排，並指出香港穩健的制度、法律及政策框架、充裕的財政儲備、靈活的市場及穩健的金融體系，是支持聯繫匯率制度順利運作的關鍵因素。\n\n鑑於穩健的銀行體系對聯繫匯率制度的正常運作至關重要，香港金融管理局（HKMA）繼續密切監察銀行對信貸、流動性及利率風險的管理及壓力測試結果，並加強對銀行企業及物業相關貸款的監管，以提升銀行業的抗逆能力。鑑於美國利率上升，金管局提醒公眾在風險管理方面作好必要準備，並指出觸發弱方兌換保證及港元流出，是港元利率正常化過程中自然且必要的一步。\n\n為提升貨幣發行局賬戶的透明度，自1998年10月起，部分外匯基金資產已專門撥作支持貨幣基礎之用。備用資產比率（即備用資產除以貨幣基礎）於2015年內在106.3%至107.5%之間窄幅波動，未曾觸及上限或下限。該比率於12月31日收報106.3%（圖表5）。在聯繫匯率制度下，雖然已指定特定外匯基金資產作為備用組合，但所有外匯基金資產均可用以支持港元匯率。基金龐大的財政資源為香港在面對突發衝擊時，提供了強大的後盾，以維護貨幣及金融穩定。\n\n圖表5 2015年備用資產比率每日變動\n\n# 其他工作\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）貨幣發行局小組負責監察及檢討與香港貨幣及金融穩定相關的議題。2015年，小組討論的議題包括全球銀行提供國際美元貸款的情況、宏觀審慎措施的國際應用、美國加息對香港樓市的影響、基準利率的釐定公式、港元實質有效匯率上升的宏觀經濟影響，以及新興市場經濟體的主權風險。小組討論紀錄及提交小組的貨幣發行局運作報告均已刊載於金管局網站。\n\n# 貨幣穩定\n\n香港貨幣研究院（HKIMR）繼續資助貨幣政策、銀行及金融領域的研究。2015年，研究院接待了16位研究員，並發表了27份工作論文。\n\n研究院舉辦了五個國際會議及工作坊，主要包括：\n\n* 1月舉行的第六屆中國經濟國際年會，主題為「槓桿與金融體系效率及穩定性：中國與國際經驗」。會議發表了11篇高質素研究論文，涵蓋中國企業槓桿、中國信貸繁榮與經濟周期、銀行競爭與金融穩定，以及銀行監管與信貸供應等廣泛議題。\n* 5月與香港大學合辦的「HKIMR-HKU國際金融、機構與經濟增長會議」。會議涵蓋多個經濟議題，包括銀行及貨幣政策、國際融資與跨境併購、金融監管設計，以及宏觀經濟環境與資本市場。\n* 10月與美國聯邦儲備系統理事會、歐洲中央銀行及達拉斯聯邦儲備銀行合辦的「貨幣政策分歧、全球資本流動與金融穩定」國際會議。會議探討了貨幣政策、國際資本流動與匯率的關係，貨幣政策分歧及其對全球金融穩定的影響，主要央行政策對全球其他地區的溢出效應，以及全球政策協調的成本與效益等廣泛議題。\n\n研究院亦於8月舉辦第十三屆HKIMR夏季工作坊，9月舉辦第十三屆中國內地經濟會議，討論中國內地財政改革及地方政府融資等議題。會議及工作坊吸引了來自學術界、金融服務業及全球央行的參與者。此外，研究院全年共舉辦24場公開研討會，涵蓋廣泛的經濟、貨幣及金融議題。\n\n# 鈔票及硬幣\n\n截至2015年底，流通鈔票總值為3,602億港元，較上一年增加5.3%（圖表6、7及8）。政府發行的紙幣及硬幣流通總值為112億港元，增長2.9%（圖表9及10）。流通中的政府發行10元紙幣總值為40億港元，其中85%為聚合物鈔票。"}
{"en": "# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA focused its supervisory efforts on authorized institutions risk governance, including credit and liquidity risk management systems, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing controls, and selling practices for investment and insurance products. With the build-up of systemic risks, the HKMA announced a 0.625% jurisdictional Countercyclical Capital Buffer for Hong Kong from 1 January 2016 (and 1.25% from 1 January 2017). Five authorized institutions were designated as Domestic Systemically Important Banks which will be subject to a Higher Loss Absorbency capital buffer. Significant progress was made on reforms for recovery and resolution with the introduction of the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Bill into the Legislative Council. The HKMA also stepped up its work with the banking industry on enhancing access to basic banking services, consumer education, and the skills and knowledge development of bank directors and financial practitioners.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2015\n\n# Overview\n\nAmid signs of a divergence in monetary policy stances among the major developed economies, emerging markets faced a higher risk of capital outflows and slower economic growth in 2015. In order to maintain the resilience of the banking sector against a possible abrupt deterioration in the macroeconomic environment, the HKMA continued to closely monitor the effectiveness of authorized institutions’ (AIs) risk governance and their systems for management of credit and liquidity risks.\n\n# Operational supervision\n\nIn 2015, the HKMA continued to adopt the supervisory approach where regular on-site examinations were supplemented by an increased number of thematic reviews. Thematic reviews are in-depth off-site reviews focusing on particular risk areas or specific activities of groups of selected AIs. This approach has allowed the HKMA to prioritise its supervisory resources to focus on emerging and more significant risks of AIs.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA performed a total of 193 on-site examinations. More in-depth thematic on-site examinations on credit risk management and asset quality were conducted, in view of the emerging signs of deterioration in the asset quality of AIs' loan portfolio. The HKMA increased the number of examinations on treasury related activities given market uncertainty amid the divergence of monetary policies in major advanced economies. On-site examinations were also conducted on Mainland-related business, stress testing and liquidity risk management, operational and technology risk management, capital planning, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML/CFT) controls and internal ratings-based (IRB) models of AIs. AIs' activities in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses were also subject to on-site examinations by specialist teams during the year.\n\nFurthermore, a total of 152 thematic off-site reviews were conducted covering similar areas as the thematic on-site examinations. Table 1 contains details of the operational supervision work.\n\nIn 2015, 196 off-site reviews were conducted to assess AIs’ corporate governance, financial position and business operations. Supervisory attention focused on risk governance, capital planning, corporate sector credit and monitoring of implementation of Basel III standards. The supervisory teams maintained frequent contact with the boards of directors and external auditors of selected AIs. 20 tripartite meetings were held with the senior management and external auditors of AIs, while 23 meetings were held with the full board or board-level committees of selected AIs.\n\nThe Banking Supervision Review Committee considered four cases, all concerning the authorization of AIs.\n\nTo better utilise its supervisory resources to deal with competing priorities, the HKMA continued to invoke powers under section 59(2) of the Banking Ordinance to require AIs to appoint external auditors to follow up on potentially material supervisory issues. The HKMA commissioned six reports under this provision in 2015. Two of the reports covered AML/CFT controls and another two of the reports covered private banking business, while the remaining were related to areas including securities related activities and loans classification system.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nNo AI breached the requirements of the Banking Ordinance relating to capital adequacy or liquidity ratio in 2015. There were 84 breaches under various sections of the Ordinance, but none affected the interests of depositors and they were rectified promptly by the AIs.\n\nTable 1 Operational supervision\n\n# Powers under section 52 of the Banking Ordinance\n\nMelli Bank Plc continues to be subject to the exercise of powers under section 52 of the Banking Ordinance. The directions imposed by the Monetary Authority on 25 June 2008 under section 52(1)(A) of the Banking Ordinance on the affairs, business and property of the Hong Kong Branch of Melli Bank Plc remained in force during the year. The HKMA will continue to communicate regularly with the relevant authorities to monitor developments related to the branch and its head office in the UK, and will keep in view the supervisory measures taken to protect the interests of the AI’s depositors.\n\n# CAMEL rating review\n\nThe CAMEL Approval Committee reviewed and determined the composite CAMEL ratings of AIs. The AIs were notified of the ratings and given the opportunity to request a review. There was no request for a review during the year.\n\n# Specialised supervisory work\n\n# Supervision of operational and technology risks\n\nThe HKMA continued to issue new or updated guidance on operational and technology risk management in the light of emerging risks and industry developments. In particular, the HKMA completed the revision of the Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module in relation to electronic banking (e-banking), which allows AIs more flexibility in offering new e-banking services. In addition, a circular was issued on cyber security, reiterating the importance for the boards and senior management of AIs to have oversight of effective cyber security risk management. The HKMA also published periodic issues of its “Operational Incidents Watch” highlighting the modus operandi of selected fraud cases or operational incidents and the control weaknesses identified.\n\nThe HKMA conducted risk-based thematic on-site and off-site supervisory reviews to evaluate selected AIs' operational and technology risk management at the enterprise level or in specific business lines. These covered selected areas in relation to AIs' operational risk management framework, cyber security risk management, controls for guarding against rogue trading activities, oversight of important outsourcing service providers, fraud risk management and technology controls for anti-money laundering. These supervisory reviews were supplemented by the annual independent compliance exercises covering operational risk management framework, technology risk management (including protection of customer data) and business continuity planning, where selected AIs were required to appoint independent and qualified assessors to examine the adequacy of their relevant controls and then rectify the weaknesses identified. The HKMA also identified and analysed the trend and key supervisory focus of AIs' operational and technology risks, with particular reference to the AIs that play an important role in the stability and effective functioning of Hong Kong's monetary and banking systems.\n\nThe HKMA monitored the final phase of the banking industry's implementation of the chip-based ATM technology through which AIs completed the card replacement process of pure credit cards by the end of 2015. The HKMA also required card issuing AIs to implement authentication controls to further improve the security over \"card-not-present\" credit card transactions. Separately, after receiving reports that the names of cardholders stored in some contactless credit cards could be accessed stealthily, the HKMA required the AIs concerned to take prompt action to notify and protect the affected cardholders. The HKMA devoted resources to publicise and explain the scale and implications of the incident to address public concern and to monitor AIs' remedial efforts, including the prompt replacement of affected cards.\n\nThe HKMA collaborated with the industry and other stakeholders on a number of initiatives, including public awareness programme on e-banking security precautions, establishing a platform for sharing cyber security intelligence, and providing support and advice to a crisis management exercise organised by the Hong Kong Financial Services Business Continuity Management Forum that involved AIs and other financial firms.\n\n# Supervision of wealth management and MPF-related businesses\n\nThe HKMA co-operated closely with other financial regulators in Hong Kong in providing guidance and supervising AIs’ selling of securities, investment products, insurance products and MPF schemes. Regular contact was maintained with the regulators through bilateral and multilateral meetings, as well as under the auspices of the Council of Financial Regulators. These meetings covered various issues involving financial groups or regulated entities with close business relationships across different sectors in the financial services industry to ensure more co-ordinated and effective supervisory action.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA conducted 25 on-site and offsite thematic examinations and 15 off-site surveillance of AIs. These covered the selling of investment products, handling the settlement of securities transactions and safe custody of client securities, and the selling of non-linked long term insurance (NLTI) products and MPF-related products involving retail, private banking and corporate banking customers.\n\nIn August, the HKMA issued a circular to AIs to provide guidance on suitability assessment and product information disclosure in the selling of NLTI products to customers. The guidance aimed to assist AIs in complying with regulatory standards, including relevant requirements issued in July by the Office of the Commissioner of Insurance and the Hong Kong Federation of Insurers.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA continued to work closely with the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB) in the legislative process for the Insurance Companies (Amendment) Bill 2014, to establish an independent Insurance Authority and a statutory licensing regime for insurance intermediaries. In July, the Insurance Companies (Amendment) ordinance 2015 was enacted by the Legislative Council, which provides, among other things, for the inspection and investigation powers, in respect of AIs’ insurance intermediary activities, of the Monetary Authority through delegation.\n\nThe HKMA processed six applications to become Registered Institutions (RIs) and one application from RIs to engage in additional regulated activities. It granted consent to 204 executive officers responsible for supervising the securities activities of RIs, and conducted background checks on 9,697 individuals whose information was submitted by RIs for inclusion in the register maintained by the HKMA.\n\n# Supervision of treasury activities\n\nAIs’ liquidity risk management remained one of the HKMA’s priority supervisory focuses, particularly in light of the anticipated normalisation of interest rates in the US and the potential subsequent reversal of fund flows that could have an impact on AIs’ liquidity positions. Throughout 2015, the HKMA continued to implement the enhanced Stable Funding Requirement for AIs to maintain sufficient stable funds to support their lending business. Since the implementation of the Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) from 1 January 2015, the HKMA has been monitoring the level and trend of LCRs of category 1 institutions, which generally maintained LCRs close to or over 100%, well above the statutory minimum of 60% for 2015 under the phase-in arrangement.\n\nSeparately, the HKMA conducted thematic on-site examinations on selected AIs’ control framework for managing the risks associated with the anticipated interest rate normalisation. Amid the market volatility, the HKMA also paid close attention to abrupt market changes and their impact on the banking sector as well as individual AIs, and undertook appropriate follow-up action.\n\n# Supervisor-driven stress testing programme\n\nThe HKMA continued to conduct the bottom-up supervisor-driven stress testing programme to better understand the resilience of locally incorporated retail banks under extreme and adverse economic conditions, and to encourage them to develop plans to address potential problems in times of stress. A number of improvements were introduced during the year to collect more granular information to gain a greater insight into the risk dynamics of selected areas.

{"en": "# International Financial Centre\n\nThe global economic and financial environment was fraught with challenges in 2015, calling for closer international collaboration and communication to maintain stability. During the year, the HKMA continued to actively participate in international and regional forums while sparing no effort in raising Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre, including enhancing our financial infrastructure, optimising the regulatory and tax regime, and capitalising on the internationalisation of the renminbi to further develop offshore renminbi business. Hong Kong’s strong economic fundamentals and robust fiscal performance continued to be recognised by credit rating agencies with Standard & Poor’s maintaining its top-rated AAA rating for Hong Kong.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nThe HKMA actively contributes to international discussions on issues of significance to global and regional financial stability. In July, it assumed co-chairmanship of the Financial Stability Board Regional Consultative Group for Asia (FSB RCG(A)) for a two-year period. The group’s aim is to promote interaction between FSB members and nonmembers on policy initiatives, encourage implementation of financial reforms and facilitate the exchange of views on financial stability issues. The HKMA continued to work closely with the ASEAN+3 authorities to strengthen the operations of the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO) — which has been upgraded to an international organisation — to monitor and analyse regional economies and support decision-making of the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralisation (CMIM).\n\nDuring the year, Hong Kong’s offshore renminbi pool and bond issuance experienced some contraction due to a number of market factors. However the market continued to function orderly, and renminbi trade settlement, bank lending and foreign exchange turnover maintained steady growth. In addition, the growing renminbi business conducted in and through Hong Kong contributed to the recognition of the renminbi by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as a freely usable currency. The iMF’s decision to include it in the Special Drawing Right (SDR) currency basket will add impetus to the internationalisation of the renminbi as well as the further development of the offshore market in Hong Kong.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong's financial infrastructure and its continued development play a significant role in reinforcing the competitive edge of Hong Kong as an international financial centre and the global offshore renminbi business hub. The turnover of the renminbi payment system in Hong Kong hit new highs in 2015, while the trade repository for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives continued to support entities to report their OTC derivatives transactions as required under the new OTC derivatives market regulatory regime, which was introduced in July.\n\nHong Kong's financial infrastructure was further enhanced by the HKMA in 2015 with new components and services, including the successful launch of the e-Cheque service in December, which means that over 150 banks are now capable of receiving and processing e-Cheques from their customers through the Internet and mobile channels. The electronic bill presentment and payment (EBPP) service, which was launched in 2013, continued to see growth in merchant participation in 2015. In July, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMu) launched a service under its Fund Order Routing Service to support the implementation of the Mainland - Hong Kong Mutual Recognition of Funds (MRF). And, the regulatory framework for retail payment products and services was improved with the commencement in November of the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO). Under the PSSVFO, the HKMA is empowered to implement a mandatory licensing regime for multi-purpose stored value facilities and perform relevant supervision and enforcement functions, as well as designating important retail payment systems to ensure their safe and efficient operation under prudential regulation.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\n# REVIEW OF 2015\n\n# International and regional co-operation\n\nWith increased connections among global financial markets, the HKMA proactively fosters co-operation with other jurisdictions in promoting sustainable economic growth and financial system stability through international and regional forums including the FSB, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC). The HKMA also continues to implement global financial regulatory reforms, including the recommendations of the G20, to help strengthen the resilience of the global financial system.\n\nThe HKMA became a co-chair of the FSB RCG(A) in July and hosted its ninth meeting in Hong Kong in October. The RCG(A) serves as an important platform for FSB members and non-FSB members to communicate and co-operate on financial stability issues. Senior representatives from finance ministries, central banks and financial regulators of 16 Asian jurisdictions attended the meeting to discuss risks facing the region, the implications of increasing asset management activities, misconduct risk and experience with deposit insurance schemes. The HKMA also co-chaired a workshop on macroprudential policies in Hong Kong in August. The workshop was organised by the Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS), and attended by representatives from 18 central banks from around the world. Participants shared their experiences in macroprudential policies, focusing on the calibration and evaluation of tools, their interaction with monetary policy, and possible spillover effects. The HKMA also co-hosted a conference with the Bank of England and the IMF, featuring discussions on the challenges that central banks and other policymakers face in choosing the optimal mix of monetary, macroprudential and microprudential policies. The conference was attended by over a hundred participants, including representatives from academia, central banks and international financial institutions.\n\n# Promoting monetary and financial stability in Asia\n\nThe HKMA maintained its commitment to regional cooperative initiatives to promote financial stability in Asia and to harness the region's collective voice in international financial affairs. As a co-ordinator of the macro-surveillance work for the Monetary and Financial Stability Committee established under the Executives' Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP), the HKMA continued to prepare the Committee’s half-yearly Macro-Monitoring Report to assess the region’s risks and vulnerabilities and the policy implications. As Chair of the EMEAP Working Group on Payment and Settlement Systems, the HKMA worked closely with the Deputy Chair to co-ordinate the Group’s effort in sharing experiences and exchanging information on risk management, oversight, standards and best practices, and developments in domestic and cross-border payment and settlement systems. It also led the Working Group’s sub-group on cross-border co-operation and development. The HKMA hosted meetings of the EMEAP/BIS Forum on Foreign Exchange Markets and the EMEAP Working Group on Financial Markets (WGFM) in Hong Kong in June. Attended by representatives from 17 authorities from the region and major economies, the meetings reviewed the latest developments in financial markets and financial regulatory reforms.\n\nFollowing the signing of the AMRO Agreement by Hong Kong and the ASEAN+3 authorities last year, AMRO was upgraded to an international organisation in February 2016 to support its pivotal role under the enhanced CMIM.\n\n# Hong Kong’s credit ratings\n\nThe HKMA continued to maintain close dialogue with international credit rating agencies to present a balanced assessment of Hong Kong's economic performance and fiscal strength. These efforts contributed to the affirmation of Hong Kong's credit ratings by all major credit rating agencies in 2015. Standard & Poor's affirmed its highest AAA rating for Hong Kong, reflecting the agency’s recognition of Hong Kong’s above-average growth prospects for a high-income economy, sizable fiscal reserves, consistently healthy fiscal performance and strong net external asset position. Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings also maintained Hong Kong’s ratings at Aa1 and AA+ respectively, just one notch below triple-A.\n\n# Development of Hong Kong as the offshore renminbi business centre\n\nIn 2015, market factors had an impact on Hong Kong's renminbi pool. At the end of the year, outstanding renminbi customer deposits and certificates of deposit stood at RMB 1,010 billion, as compared with RMB 1,158 billion a year ago (Chart 1). Offshore renminbi bond issuance moderated amid declining interest rates in the onshore market. As a result, issuance of renminbi bonds in Hong Kong dropped to RMB 75 billion. On the other hand, renminbi trade settlement transactions handled by banks in Hong Kong expanded by 9% to RMB 6,833 billion. The outstanding amount of renminbi bank loans also increased by 58% year-on-year to RMB 297 billion (Chart 2). Average daily turnover in the renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system increased to RMB 947 billion, up 29% from 2014. At the same time, the offshore renminbi foreign exchange market saw further growth in Hong Kong, with survey results indicating a daily turnover of some US$ 93 billion equivalent at the end of April 2015, an increase of 88% from April 2013 when the last BIS Triennial Survey was conducted. Hong Kong remained the largest offshore renminbi business hub with a market of considerable depth and breadth. Another significant development reinforcing this position was the implementation of the MRF initiative in July, which has expanded Hong Kong’s renminbi product offering.\n\nThe HKMA's policy initiative to expand channels for crossborder renminbi fund flows and its joint efforts with the industry to enhance Hong Kong's renminbi financial platform continued to bear fruit. In June, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) announced that offshore renminbi business clearing banks and participating banks would be allowed to conduct repo transactions in the onshore interbank bond market and remit proceeds offshore, to facilitate renminbi liquidity management by banks in the offshore market. In September, the PBoC relaxed the rules on cross-border renminbi cash pooling, enabling more multinational corporations to conduct intra-group cash transfers under streamlined arrangements. The Mainland authorities also granted foreign central banks, international financial institutions and sovereign wealth funds wider access to the onshore interbank bond market in July. They further opened up the Mainland’s foreign exchange market to these institutions in September.\n\nOn 30 november, the IMF announced its decision to include the renminbi in the SDR currency basket with effect from 1 October 2016. The decision affirms the renminbi’s status as a freely usable currency, and further promotes confidence in the use of the renminbi for global transactions. As an international financial centre and the global offshore renminbi business hub, Hong Kong will benefit from new business opportunities arising from the further internationalisation of the renminbi and the Mainland’s enhanced connection with the global economic and financial systems.\n\nHong Kong continued to reinforce its collaboration on renminbi business with other jurisdictions throughout the year. The HKMA co-hosted the third RMB Trade and Investment Dialogue with Australia and the fifth RMB Business Forum with London, and worked with Malaysia and Thailand for the second time in facilitating private sector discussions on renminbi business. Through these initiatives, banks in Hong Kong strengthened their renminbi business flows and linkages with other markets, which will bring more renminbi business to Hong Kong. The HKMA also stepped up its marketing efforts to promote the wider use of renminbi in trade, investment and financing among corporations and institutions through participation in industry events in Hong Kong and in overseas markets including Canada, Japan and Africa.\n\nDeputy Chief Executive of the HKMA, Mr Eddie Yue, speaks at a seminar during the fifth meeting of Hong Kong–London RMB Forum on 11 December 2015.\n\n# CEPA\n\nA new agreement to achieve basic liberalisation of trade in services between Mainland China and Hong Kong was signed in November under the framework of the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA). The agreement extends most of the pilot liberalisation measures introduced in Guangdong in 2014 nationwide. By according national treatment, in principle, to Hong Kong banks, the new agreement is expected to provide these banks with more policy certainty and greater flexibility when conducting business in Mainland China.\n\n# Training\n\nThe HKMA continued to provide training programmes for officials from the PBoC, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange and the China Banking Regulatory Commission. In addition to programmes dealing with central banking and general risk management, topics included consumer protection, credit reference, monetary and collateral management, financial soundness indicators analysis, and systemic risk monitoring. Ad hoc training sessions were also conducted for delegations from overseas banking and law enforcement agencies.\n\n# Government Bond Programme\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA arranged eight tenders of institutional government bonds amounting to HK$ 20.4 billion.

{"en": "# Reserves Management\n\n2015 was a turbulent year for the global financial markets, presenting unprecedented challenges to investment funds. Amid such challenging and difficult investment environment, the Exchange Fund recorded an overall investment return of -0.6% in 2015, but its loss was relatively mild as compared with major market indices and comparable investment funds, thanks to a series of defensive moves deployed by the HKMA over the past years which have enhanced the resilience of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary and may be invested in any securities or other assets he considers appropriate, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC).\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nEFAC has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(a) to preserve capital;\n(b) to ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, will be fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(c) to ensure that sufficient liquidity will be available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) subject to (a) — (c), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund.\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios — the Backing Portfolio and the Investment Portfolio. The Backing Portfolio holds highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of the assets. The long-term target bond-to-equity mix for the two portfolios as a whole is 72:28. In terms of target currency mix, 81% of the assets are allocated to the US dollar and the Hong Kong dollar, and the remaining 19% to other currencies.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA has been diversifying part of the Exchange Fund’s investment, in a prudent and incremental manner, into a greater variety of asset classes, including emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity and overseas investment properties. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the Investment Portfolio while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The cap for the net asset value of the HKMA’s investments under the LTGP is maintained at one-third of the Accumulated Surplus of the Exchange Fund. At the end of 2015, the market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$142.1 billion, made up of HK$91.3 billion in private equity and HK$50.8 billion in real estate, with outstanding investment commitments amounted to HK$122.4 billion.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007 to hold shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that were acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes, is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of the unique nature of this Portfolio.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation — the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation. The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents the long-term optimal asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This often means the actual allocation is different from the benchmark, or strategic, allocation. The differences between the actual and the benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and the limits for tactical deviations are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with EFAC, tactical decisions are made by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the limits allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may take positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nHKMA staff in the Reserves Management Department directly manage the investment of about 76% of the Exchange Fund, which includes the entire Backing Portfolio and part of the Investment Portfolio. This part of the Investment Portfolio includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers based in a number of international financial centres to manage about 24% of the Exchange Fund's assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised assets. The purpose of appointing external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to capture a diverse mix of investment styles, and transfer knowledge and information from the market to in-house professionals.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is primarily determined by market factors, and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe high volatility of the financial markets in recent years has highlighted the importance of risk management. Stringent controls and investment guidelines have been established for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and compliance with guidelines and regulations is closely monitored. Risk-control tools are deployed to assess market risks under both normal and adverse market conditions. The HKMA also conducts detailed performance attribution analyses to make the best use of the investment skills of both internal and external managers.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2015\n\nThe global financial markets were highly volatile in 2015. The equity markets, in particular, encountered exceptional turbulence. Major equity markets reached new highs in the first half of the year. However, market sentiment worsened drastically in the third quarter, arising from Mainland China growth concerns, with major equity markets reversing their year-to-date gains and registering significant quarterly losses. Global equity markets recovered somewhat along with improving market sentiment thereafter, but they worsened again towards the end of the year. With their close linkage with the Mainland economy, Hong Kong equities underperformed other major equity markets in 2015.\n\nOn sovereign bond markets, longer-term US Treasury yields rose moderately in 2015 despite expectation of US interest rate normalisation and the start of the US interest rate up-cycle, as positive sentiment was checked by concerns over global economic growth, lingering global disinflationary pressures and intensified geopolitical tensions. On the other hand, short-term European government bond yields declined and some even slipped into negative territory on the back of the European Central Bank’s aggressive monetary easing policy.\n\nOn currency markets, the US dollar continued to strengthen in 2015 with the US dollar index surging by almost 10%, amid expectation of the commencement of the US policy rate normalisation. The euro weakened significantly in the first quarter, posting the biggest single-quarter fall in the history of the euro since 1999, as the European Central Bank announced quantitative easing measures in January. On the other hand, the yen stayed largely flat against the US dollar in 2015.\n\nThe performance of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2015 is shown in Table 1.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nAgainst the backdrop of exceptionally volatile financial markets and difficult investment environment, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment loss of HK$15.8 billion in 2015, comprising gains of HK$7.1 billion on overseas equities, losses of HK$5 billion on Hong Kong equities, gains of HK$15.9 billion on bonds, a negative currency translation effect of HK$44.9 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets and gains of HK$11.1 billion on other investments held by the investment holding subsidiaries of the Fund. The negative currency translation effect was unavoidable when translating the Exchange Fund’s non-US dollar investments into Hong Kong dollar amid the sharp strengthening of the US dollar last year. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$2.2 billion.\n\nThe total assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$3,422.9 billion at the end of 2015. The investment return of the Exchange Fund (excluding the Strategic Portfolio) in 2015 was -0.6%. That notwithstanding, the Exchange Fund’s loss could be considered mild when compared with the underperforming major market indices and the investment fund community in general. In anticipation of a worsening investment environment, the HKMA has deployed a series of defensive moves over the past years, which include shortening the duration of bond portfolios, increasing cash holdings, and significantly reducing non-US dollar assets. We have also quickened the pace of investment diversification, especially through investments under the LTGP. These moves have enhanced the resilience of the Exchange Fund and helped mitigate some potential losses.\n\nThe annual return of the Fund from 1994 to 2015 is set out in Chart 1. Table 2 shows the 2015 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over a number of different time horizons. The average return was 1.2% over the past three years, 1.8% over the past five years, 3.3% over the past 10 years and 5.0% since 1994. Table 3 shows the currency mix of the Fund's assets on 31 December 2015.\n\nChart 1 Investment return of the Exchange Fund (1994 – 2015) \n1 investment return calculation excludes the holdings in the Strategic Portfolio. \n2 Composite Consumer price index is calculated based on the 2009/2010-based series.\n", "zh": "# 儲備管理\n\n2015 年，全球金融市場動盪不安，為投資基金帶來前所未有的挑戰。在如此艱難且充滿挑戰的投資環境下，外匯基金於 2015 年錄得整體投資回報率為 -0.6%，但相較於主要市場指數及同類投資基金，其虧損相對溫和。這得益於香港金融管理局（HKMA）過去數年採取的一系列防禦性措施，增強了外匯基金的抗逆力。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》，外匯基金的主要目標是直接或間接影響香港貨幣的匯率。此外，基金亦可用於維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定和完整性，協助鞏固香港作為國際金融中心的地位。外匯基金由財政司司長掌管，經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）後，可投資於其認為合適的任何證券或其他資產。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標及投資組合結構\n\nEFAC 為外匯基金訂立了以下投資目標：\n\n(a) 保本；\n(b) 確保貨幣基礎在任何時候均有高度流動性的美元資產作全額支持；\n(c) 確保有足夠流動性以維持貨幣及金融穩定；以及\n(d) 在符合 (a) 至 (c) 的前提下，取得有助於維持基金長遠購買力的投資回報。\n\n這些目標充分考慮了外匯基金的法定用途，並已納入基金的投資組合結構及目標資產配置中。\n\n大致而言，外匯基金分為兩大主要投資組合——外匯基金票據組合（Backing Portfolio）及投資組合（Investment Portfolio）。外匯基金票據組合持有高度流動性的美元資產，以根據貨幣發行局制度要求，為貨幣基礎提供全額支持。投資組合則主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織（OECD）成員國的債券及股票市場，以保值及維持資產的長遠購買力。兩個組合的長遠目標債券與股票比例為 72:28。在目標貨幣配置方面，81% 資產分配於美元及港元，其餘 19% 分配於其他貨幣。\n\n為更有效管理風險及提升中長期回報，金管局審慎且逐步地將部分外匯基金投資多元化，涵蓋更多資產類別，包括新興市場及內地債券與股票、私募股權及海外投資物業。新興市場及內地債券與股票納入投資組合，而私募股權及房地產投資則納入長遠增長組合（LTGP）。金管局於 LTGP 下的投資淨資產值上限維持為外匯基金累積盈餘的三分之一。截至 2015 年底，LTGP 下的投資市值合共為 1,421 億港元，其中 913 億港元為私募股權，508 億港元為房地產，尚未履行的投資承諾為 1,224 億港元。\n\n戰略組合（Strategic Portfolio）於 2007 年設立，持有政府以外匯基金名義收購的香港交易及結算所有限公司股份，作為策略性用途。由於該組合性質特殊，並不納入基金投資表現的評估範圍。\n\n# 儲備管理\n\n# 投資流程\n\n外匯基金的投資流程以兩類資產配置決策為基礎——策略性資產配置及戰術性資產配置。策略性資產配置體現在投資基準中，代表根據外匯基金投資目標而訂立的長遠最優資產配置。在策略性配置指引下，資產會進行戰術性配置，力求取得超越基準的回報。這通常意味著實際配置與基準（即策略性）配置有所不同。實際配置與基準配置之間的差異稱為「戰術性偏離」。基準及戰術性偏離的限額由財政司司長經諮詢 EFAC 後決定，戰術性決策則由金管局根據授權作出。在戰術性偏離的限額內，投資組合經理可因應短期市場變動而建立投資倉位。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局儲備管理部的員工直接管理約 76% 的外匯基金投資，包括整個外匯基金票據組合及部分投資組合。該部分投資組合涵蓋投資於全球固定收益市場的多個組合，以及執行宏觀風險管理策略的各類衍生工具組合。\n\n# 外聘基金經理的運用\n\n除內部管理資產外，金管局亦聘用駐於多個國際金融中心的外部基金經理，管理約 24% 的外匯基金資產，包括全部上市股票組合及其他專門資產。聘用外部基金經理旨在汲取市場上最佳的投資專業知識，捕捉多元化的投資風格，並將市場知識和資訊傳遞給內部專業人員。\n\n聘用外部基金經理相關開支包括基金管理及託管費用、交易成本，以及預扣及其他稅項。這些開支主要受市場因素影響，可能每年有所波動。\n\n# 風險管理及合規\n\n近年金融市場波動加劇，突顯風險管理的重要性。無論是內部或外部管理的投資組合，均已設立嚴格的監控及投資指引，並嚴密監察合規情況。金管局運用風險控制工具，評估正常及不利市況下的市場風險，並進行詳細的表現歸因分析，以充分發揮內部及外部經理的投資專長。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2015 年金融市場概況\n\n2015 年，全球金融市場波動劇烈，尤其股票市場出現異常動盪。主要股票市場於上半年創下新高，但第三季因內地經濟增長憂慮，市場情緒急劇惡化，主要股票市場全年升幅盡失，並錄得顯著季度虧損。隨後，隨著市場情緒改善，全球股票市場略有回升，但年末再度轉差。由於與內地經濟關聯密切，香港股票於 2015 年表現遜於其他主要股票市場。\n\n在主權債券市場方面，儘管市場預期美國利率正常化及加息週期展開，2015 年美國國債長期孳息率僅溫和上升，因全球經濟增長憂慮、全球通縮壓力持續及地緣政治緊張局勢加劇，抵消了正面情緒。另一方面，歐洲央行積極推行寬鬆貨幣政策，令歐洲短期國債孳息率下跌，部分更跌至負值區域。\n\n在外匯市場方面，2015年美元持續走強，美元指數大幅上升近10%，主要受市場預期美國將開始政策利率正常化的影響。歐元於第一季顯著走弱，錄得自1999年歐元誕生以來單季最大跌幅，原因是歐洲央行於一月宣布實施量化寬鬆措施。另一方面，日圓兌美元在2015年基本持平。\n\n2015年主要貨幣、債券及股票市場的表現見於表1。\n\n# 儲備管理\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n在極度波動的金融市場及艱難的投資環境下，外匯基金於2015年錄得投資虧損158億港元，包括海外股票盈利71億港元、本地股票虧損50億港元、債券盈利159億港元、非港元資產的負面貨幣兌換影響449億港元，以及基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資盈利111億港元。由於去年美元大幅升值，將外匯基金的非美元投資兌換為港元時產生的負面貨幣兌換影響實屬無可避免。此外，策略性投資組合錄得22億港元的估值收益。\n\n截至2015年底，外匯基金總資產達34,229億港元。2015年外匯基金（不包括策略性投資組合）的投資回報為-0.6%。儘管如此，與主要市場指數及整體投資基金界的表現相比，外匯基金的虧損可謂溫和。鑑於投資環境預期惡化，金管局過去數年已採取一系列防禦性措施，包括縮短債券組合久期、增加現金持有量，以及大幅減少非美元資產。我們亦加快投資多元化步伐，特別是透過長遠增長組合（LTGP）進行投資。這些措施提升了外匯基金的抗逆力，有助減輕部分潛在損失。\n\n基金自1994年至2015年的年度回報載於圖1。表2列出2015年投資回報及基金於不同期間的平均投資回報。過去三年平均回報為1.2%，過去五年為1.8%，過去十年為3.3%，自1994年以來為5.0%。表3則顯示截至2015年12月31日基金資產的貨幣分布。\n\n圖1 外匯基金投資回報（1994–2015）\n1 投資回報計算不包括策略性投資組合的持倉。\n2 綜合消費物價指數根據2009/2010年基期系列計算。"}

Notable examples included prudential measures for property mortgage loans, banking products and services, prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing, and the coin collection programme.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received since 2012 and Chart 2 provides a breakdown by nature of the enquiries in 2015.\n\nChart 1 Total number of public enquiries\n\n# Publications\n\nApart from the HKMA Annual Report, the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report, 4 issues of the Quarterly Bulletin, and released regular updates of the Monthly Statistical Bulletin over the past year to provide up-to-date and thematic information and analyses on monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. In addition, senior management of the HKMA published 14 inSight articles covering various topical and timely policy issues.\n\nThe HKMA Annual Report 2014 received a Bronze award in the “non-profit Making and Charitable Organisations” category in the Hong Kong Management Association’s 2015 Best Annual Reports Awards.\n\n# The HKMA website\n\nThe HKMA corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk), with over 50,000 pages in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, is the public access gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It also contains the Register of Securities Staff of Authorized Institutions (AIs) and the Register of AIs and Local Representative Offices, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance. With the implementation of the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, the website will also contain the register of stored value facility licensees under the Ordinance. Dedicated webpage and eye-catching short-cut links have been provided to draw the public's attention to important and timely information on issues such as reminders on the need to remain vigilant against bogus phone calls and the location of the coin carts in the coin collection programme.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\n# Public education programme\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre on the 55th Floor of Two International Finance Centre is an important resource for introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters. The Centre consists of the Exhibition Area and the Library, and is open to the public six days a week. The Exhibition Area introduces the work of the HKMA and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong. It includes reading materials and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong's monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nGuided tours of the Information Centre are organised for visitors. During the year, the Centre received more than 48,300 visitors and hosted over 630 quided tours for schools and other groups (Chart 3). Over 530,400 people have visited the Information Centre since it opened in December 2003.\n\nThe Library, situated next to the Exhibition Area, houses more than 23,000 books, journals and other publications for the detailed study of Hong Kong's monetary, banking and financial affairs and central banking topics. It also maintains an electronic register of AIs in Hong Kong as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nIn its ongoing programme to reach out to the community, the HKMA continued to organise public education seminars. In 2015, three seminars were held for some 2,300 secondary school students and teachers. Topics included the Linked Exchange Rate System, banknotes in Hong Kong, the smart use of credit cards and the Deposit Protection Scheme. More than 54,700 people have participated in the programme since its launch in 1998.\n\nChart 3 Types of group visits to the Information Centre\n\nYoung visitors learn about the development of money and banking in Hong Kong during a guided tour of the Information Centre.\n\nSecondary school students and teachers participate in a public education seminar.\n\n# HUMAN RESOURCES\n\nThe HKMA recruits, develops and maintains a highly professional workforce to support its policy objectives and respond flexibly to changing work priorities. While the HKMA is an integral part of the Government, it is able to employ staff on terms different from those of the civil service to attract personnel with the right experience and expertise. As a public organisation, the HKMA aims to maintain a lean and flexible structure and to redeploy staff resources to undertake new initiatives and meet increased workload.\n\n# Organisational changes\n\nFollowing the enactment of the payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, a new Retail Payment Oversight Division was formed under the Monetary Management Department (MMD) in December 2015 to carry out the HKMA’s new statutory duties in the licensing and day-to-day supervision of stored value facilities and other retail payment systems. To enhance synergy amongst departments and reprioritise staff resources in coping with the challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives as well as increasing workload and complexity of work, reshuffling of duties among a number of departments was planned in 2015 for implementation in early 2016. Details are as follows:\n\nThe Financial Infrastructure Department (FID) took over the administration of the Deposit Protection Scheme and the settlement function from the Enforcement Department (ENFD) and the Currency Division from MMD. It also took over from the Banking Departments certain banking-related work such as consumer education, directors’ development and enhanced competency framework for bank practitioners;\n\nThe External Department took over the market development function of MMD, while the latter will continue with its work relating to the Treasury Markets Association and financial benchmarks; and\n\nENFD took over the Anti-Money laundering (AML) and Financial Crime Risk Division from the Banking Supervision Department, and was retitled as Enforcement and AML Department.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\n# Staffing\n\nThe establishment of the HKMA in 2015 was 841. This is increased by 34 to 875 in 2016 (an increase of 4%) to ensure that sufficient resources are provided to cope with (i) the implementation of new legislation and initiatives, (ii) continuation of pilot projects proven necessary on an on-going basis, and (ii) the increasing complexity and volume of existing work. The new posts are deployed to the following functions:\n\nEnhancing banking and financial stability, which includes:\n\nstrengthening banking supervision work including on-site examination of banks' stress testing process, implementation of international banking standards and peer review exercises;\n\nstrengthening the supervision of banks' liquidity risk and cyber security risk management;\n\nimplementing the supervisory framework regarding over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives conducted through banks and approved money brokers under the newly effective OTC derivatives reporting and record-keeping rules;\n\nstrengthening supervisory and enforcement efforts in anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing;\n\ngearing up the planning and preparatory work for the implementation of the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Bill, which applies international standards to address the \"too big to fail\" problem of the financial industry;\n\npromoting capacity building in the banking sector through the development of a director empowerment programme for independent non-executive directors of banks to further improve the governance of banks and collaboration with the industry to promote enhanced competency frameworks for banking practitioners engaged in core areas of banking operations;\n\nstepping up the banking conduct policy and research capability in new banking, securities and insurance products;\n\nenhancing consumer protection and consumer education efforts; and\n\nstepping up the monitoring and analysis of developments in the onshore renminbi market and in the CNH market with a view to supporting the orderly operation of Hong Kong’s offshore renminbi market.\n\nStrengthening investment, risk management and legal support to the expanding investment activities associated with the establishment of the Future Fund and further diversification of the Exchange Fund’s investment products, and enhancing strategic asset allocation and investment processes in the light of an increasingly challenging investment environment.\n\nImplementing the new statutory regime which empowers the HKMA to regulate stored value facilities and retail payment systems under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance.\n\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nTemporary resources are deployed to meet other work demands. The HKMA transfers staff on secondment to other international or local organisations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Services Development Council to assist in activities or policy initiatives in which Hong Kong or the HKMA has an interest. Some staff members are deployed on a full-time or part-time basis to provide operational support to the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board and the Treasury Markets Association.\n\n# Remuneration policies and pay review mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary (FS) determines the pay and conditions of service for HKMA staff on the advice of the Governance Sub-Committee (GSC) through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC), taking into account the prevailing market rates and practices. Remuneration comprises a total cash package and a provident fund scheme, with minimal benefits in kind. The cash package consists of monthly fixed pay (or basic pay) and variable pay, which may be awarded to individual staff members as a lump sum once a year depending on performance.\n\nPay for HKMA staff is reviewed annually by the FS in the light of recommendations made to him by the GSC through EFAC, taking into account the GSC's assessment of the performance of the HKMA in the preceding year, the pay-survey findings of the financial sector conducted by independent human resources consultants and any other relevant factors. Special pay adjustments may be made from time to time for individual meritorious staff to maintain their pay competitiveness.\n\nAny approved annual adjustments to the fixed pay or any variable pay awards for the HKMA are distributed to individual staff based on their performance. Investment professionals in the HKMA are subject to a variable pay system that seeks to strengthen the linkage between their investment performance and remuneration award. The pay adjustments or awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Executive Director or above are approved by the FS on the advice of the GSC. The staff members concerned are not present at the meetings when their pay is discussed. The pay adjustments or awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Division Head and below are determined by the Chief Executive of the HKMA under delegated authority from the FS and within the approved overall pay awards.\n", "zh": "# 企業職能\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）通過媒體、公眾教育計劃及多種其他渠道，與社會及市場保持有效溝通，以促進公眾對其政策及運作的了解。2015年，金管局通過支持員工專業發展、實施嚴格的財務紀律、加強資訊科技安全，以及在高級管理層之間重新調整職責，以應對新計劃及系統實施帶來的挑戰及工作日益複雜的情況，從而提升了企業管治水平。\n\n# 與社會互動 企業發展\n\n# 媒體關係\n\n金管局與媒體緊密合作，以提升透明度並促進公眾對其政策及工作的認識。2015年，共舉辦了59場公開媒體活動，包括14場新聞發布會、14場即席訪問及31項其他公開活動。此外，安排了43次媒體專訪，發佈了325份雙語新聞稿，並每日處理大量媒體查詢。\n\n此外，為加深公眾對金管局主要職能的認識，分別組織了兩次媒體參觀活動，前往香港印鈔有限公司及香港銀行同業結算有限公司（HKICL），展示香港世界級的鈔票印刷技術及金融基礎設施。亦為媒體舉辦了有關貨幣發行局制度、人民幣業務及外匯基金的教育工作坊，深入介紹這些重要議題。\n\n金管局總裁陳德霖先生（中）及執行董事（貨幣管理）李達志先生（右）於媒體參觀香港印鈔有限公司期間，檢查鈔票的防偽特徵。\n\n於媒體參觀HKICL期間進行自動支票分類示範。照片中間（由左至右）分別為金管局總裁陳德霖先生、執行董事（金融基礎設施）李安東先生及HKICL行政總裁鄧慧詩女士。\n\n# 企業職能\n\n# 公眾查詢\n\n公眾查詢服務為市民提供有效途徑，從金管局獲取資訊，讓他們更深入了解本局的主要職能。2015年，該服務共處理了9,078宗查詢，約一半涉及銀行政策及規管、鈔票及硬幣，以及消費者銀行事務。較為顯著的例子包括物業按揭貸款的審慎措施、銀行產品及服務、防止洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集，以及硬幣收集計劃。\n\n圖表1顯示自2012年以來收到的公眾查詢總數，圖表2則列出2015年查詢的性質分類。\n\n圖表1 公眾查詢總數\n\n# 出版物\n\n除金管局年報外，金管局於過去一年出版了兩期《半年貨幣及金融穩定報告》、四期《季報》，並定期發佈《每月統計簡報》的最新資訊，以提供有關香港貨幣、銀行及經濟議題的最新及專題資訊與分析。此外，金管局高層管理人員亦發表了14篇inSight文章，涵蓋多個熱門及及時的政策議題。\n\n金管局2014年年報於香港管理專業協會2015年最佳年報獎中，獲得「非牟利及慈善機構」組別銅獎。\n\n# 金管局網站\n\n金管局企業網站（www.hkma.gov.hk）設有超過五萬頁英文、繁體及簡體中文內容，是公眾獲取金管局最新資訊的主要入口。網站亦載有《銀行業條例》第20條下維護的認可機構（AIs）證券從業員登記冊及認可機構及本地代表辦事處登記冊。隨著《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》的實施，網站亦將載有該條例下儲值支付工具持牌人登記冊。網站設有專頁及顯眼的快捷連結，提醒公眾留意如防範虛假電話騙案及硬幣收集計劃中硬幣車位置等重要及及時資訊。\n\n# 企業職能\n\n# 公眾教育計劃\n\n金管局位於國際金融中心二期55樓的資訊中心，是向社會介紹金管局工作及提升公眾對貨幣及銀行事務認識的重要資源。中心包括展覽區及圖書館，每週開放六天予公眾參觀。展覽區介紹金管局的工作及香港貨幣與銀行業的發展，並設有閱讀資料及展品，供研究香港貨幣、銀行及金融事務之用。\n\n資訊中心為訪客安排導賞團。年內，中心共接待超過48,300名訪客，並為學校及其他團體舉辦超過630場導賞團（見圖表3）。自2003年12月開放以來，已有超過530,400人次參觀資訊中心。\n\n圖書館位於展覽區旁，藏書逾23,000冊，涵蓋書籍、期刊及其他出版物，供深入研究香港貨幣、銀行及金融事務及中央銀行議題之用。圖書館亦根據《銀行業條例》第20條，維護香港認可機構的電子登記冊。\n\n金管局持續推行社區外展計劃，繼續舉辦公眾教育講座。2015年，舉辦了三場講座，約2,300名中學生及教師參加。主題包括聯繫匯率制度、香港鈔票、信用卡的精明使用及存款保障計劃。自1998年計劃推出以來，參與人數已超過54,700人。\n\n圖表3 資訊中心團體參觀類型\n\n年輕訪客於資訊中心導賞團期間，了解香港貨幣及銀行業的發展。\n\n中學生及教師參與公眾教育講座。\n\n# 人力資源\n\n金管局招聘、培訓及維持高度專業的員工隊伍，以支持其政策目標並靈活應對工作重點的變化。雖然金管局是政府不可分割的一部分，但可採用有別於公務員的聘用條款，以吸引具備合適經驗及專業知識的人才。作為公共機構，金管局致力維持精簡靈活的架構，並重新調配人手資源，以推行新措施及應付工作量增加。\n\n# 組織變動\n\n隨著《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》的通過，2015年12月於貨幣管理部（MMD）下設立了零售支付監管科，負責金管局在儲值支付工具及其他零售支付系統發牌及日常監管方面的新法定職責。為加強部門間協同效應及重新調整人手資源，以應對新措施實施及工作量和複雜性增加帶來的挑戰，2015年已計劃於2016年初進行多個部門職責調整。詳情如下：\n\n金融基礎設施部（FID）接手了存款保障計劃的管理及結算職能（由執法部ENFD及貨幣管理部MMD的貨幣科移交），同時亦從銀行部門接手部分與銀行相關的工作，如消費者教育、董事發展及銀行從業員能力提升框架；\n\n外事部接管了貨幣管理部（MMD）的市場發展職能，而貨幣管理部則繼續負責財資市場公會及金融基準相關工作；\n\n執法部（ENFD）接管了銀行監理部的反洗錢（AML）及金融罪行風險科，並更名為「執法及反洗錢部」。\n\n# 企業職能\n\n# 人手編制\n\n2015年香港金融管理局（HKMA）的編制為841人。2016年增加34人至875人（增幅4%），以確保有足夠資源應對：(i) 新法例及新措施的實施，(ii) 持續推行已證明有持續需要的試點項目，以及 (iii) 現有工作日益複雜及繁重。新增職位分配於以下職能：\n\n加強銀行及金融穩定，包括：\n\n加強銀行監管工作，包括對銀行壓力測試流程的現場檢查、國際銀行業標準的實施及同業評審；\n\n加強對銀行流動性風險及網絡安全風險管理的監管；\n\n根據新實施的場外衍生工具（OTC）申報及記錄保存規則，落實對銀行及獲批貨幣經紀人進行場外衍生工具業務的監管框架；\n\n加強反洗錢及打擊恐怖分子資金籌集的監管及執法工作；\n\n為實施《金融機構（處置）條例》進行規劃及準備工作，該條例按國際標準處理金融業「大而不能倒」問題；\n\n透過為銀行獨立非執行董事設計董事賦權計劃，推動銀行業能力建設，進一步提升銀行管治，並與業界合作推動銀行從業員核心業務範疇的能力框架；\n\n加強銀行業務政策及新型銀行、證券及保險產品的研究能力；\n\n加強消費者保障及消費者教育工作；\n\n加強對在岸人民幣市場及離岸人民幣（CNH）市場發展的監察與分析，以支持香港離岸人民幣市場的有序運作。\n\n加強與未來基金設立及外匯基金投資產品進一步多元化相關的投資、風險管理及法律支援，並在投資環境日益具挑戰性的情況下，提升策略性資產配置及投資流程。\n\n落實新法定制度，賦權金管局根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》規管儲值支付工具及零售支付系統。\n\n\n# 企業職能\n\n臨時資源會調配以應付其他工作需求。金管局亦會安排員工借調至其他國際或本地機構，如國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）及金融發展局，協助香港或金管局有興趣參與的活動或政策倡議。部分員工則以全職或兼職形式，為香港存款保障委員會及財資市場公會提供營運支援。\n\n# 薪酬政策及薪酬檢討機制\n\n金管局員工的薪酬及服務條件由財政司司長（FS）根據管治小組委員會（GSC）透過外匯基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）提出的建議，並參考現行市場薪酬水平及慣例決定。薪酬包括現金總薪酬及公積金計劃，實物福利極少。現金薪酬包括每月固定薪金（或基本薪金）及可變薪金，後者可根據個人表現每年一次性發放。\n\n金管局員工的薪酬每年由財政司司長根據GSC透過EFAC提出的建議進行檢討，考慮GSC對金管局過去一年表現的評估、獨立人力資源顧問就金融業進行的薪酬調查結果及其他相關因素。為保持薪酬競爭力，個別表現優異員工可不時獲特別薪酬調整。\n\n任何獲批的年度固定薪金調整或可變薪金獎勵，均按個人表現分配予員工。金管局的投資專業人員實行可變薪金制度，以加強其投資表現與薪酬獎勵的聯繫。執行董事或以上級別員工的薪酬調整或獎勵，須由財政司司長根據GSC建議批准，相關員工在討論其薪酬時不會出席會議。部門主管及以下級別員工的薪酬調整或獎勵，則由金管局總裁根據財政司司長授權及在獲批的整體薪酬範圍內決定。"}

I conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards. Those standards require that I comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.\n\nAn audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the Monetary Authority, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.\n\nI believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit (continued)\n\n# Opinion\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2015, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance.\n\nDavid Sun \nDirector of Audit\n\n7 April 2016\n\nAudit Commission \n26th Floor \nImmigration Tower \n7 Gloucester Road \nWanchai, Hong Kong\n\n# Contents\n\nINCOME AND EXPENDITURE ACCOUNT\nSTATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nBALANCE SHEET\nATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY\nATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:\n\n1.

The principal activities of the Fund are safeguarding the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong and maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong's monetary and financial systems.\n\nThe assets of the Fund are managed as four portfolios: the Backing Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio and the Strategic Portolio. The assets of the Backing Portolio fully match the Monetary Base, under Hong Kong's Currency Board system. The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The Long-Term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments. The Strategic Portfolio holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited acquired by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) for the account of the Fund for strategic purposes. Operating segment information is set out in note 31.\n\n# 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n# 2.1 Statement of compliance\n\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with all applicable Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRSs), which is a collective term that includes all applicable individual Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, Hong Kong Accounting Standards (HKASs) and Interpretations issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), and accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong. A summary of the significant accounting policies adopted by the Fund and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) is set out below.\n\nThe HKICPA has issued certain new and revised HKFRSs that are first effective or available for early adoption for the current accounting period. Note 3 provides information on the changes, if any, in accounting policies resulting from initial adoption of these developments to the extent that they are relevant to the Group for the current and prior accounting periods reflected in these financial statements.\n\n# Exchange Fund – Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)\n\n(Amounts expressed in millions of Hong Kong dollars, unless otherwise stated.)\n\n# 2.2 Basis of preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe Group financial statements include the financial statements of the Group as well as the Group's interests in associates and joint ventures. The principal activities of the principal subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are shown in notes 16 and 17.\n\nThe measurement basis used in the preparation of the financial statements is historical cost except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair values as explained in the accounting policies set out below:\n\ntrading financial instruments (note 2.6.2.1);\nfinancial assets and financial liabilities designated at fair value (note 2.6.2.2); available-for-sale securities (note 2.6.2.5);\ngold (note 2.11); and\ninvestment properties (note 2.12).\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with HKFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nNote 18 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of investment properties. Note 37 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of financial instruments. There are no critical accounting judgements involved in the application of the Group's accounting policies except for the valuation of certain financial instruments as set out in note 2.5.\n\n# 2.3 Subsidiaries and non-controlling interests\n\nA subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. When assessing whether the Group has power, only substantive rights (held by the Group and other parties) are considered.\n\n# Exchange Fund – Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)\n\n(Amounts expressed in millions of Hong Kong dollars, unless otherwise stated.)\n\nAn investment in a subsidiary is consolidated into the Group financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.\n\nIntra-group balances, transactions and cash flows and any unrealised profits and losses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in full in preparing the Group financial statements.\n\nNon-controlling interests represent the equity in a subsidiary not attributable directly or indirectly to the Fund, and in respect of which the Group has not agreed any additional terms with the holders of those interests which would result in the Group as a whole having a contractual obligation in respect of those interests that meets the definition of a financial liability. Non-controlling interests are presented in the Group balance sheet within equity, separately from equity attributable to the owner of the Fund. Non-controlling interests in the results of the Group are presented on the face of the Group income and expenditure account and the Group statement of comprehensive income as an allocation of the surplus or deficit and total comprehensive income or loss for the year between non-controlling interests and the owner of the Fund.\n\nIn the balance sheet of the Fund, its investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less impairment losses, if any (note 2.14).\n\n# 2.4 Associates and joint ventures\n\nAn associate is an entity in which the Group has significant influence, but not control or joint control, over its management, through its power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions.\n", "zh": "# 外匯基金\n\n審計署署長報告\n外匯基金財務報表\n\n# 審計署署長報告\n\n# 審計署\n# 香港特別行政區政府\n\n# 獨立審計報告\n\n# 致財政司司長\n\n本人證明，已審核載於第134至222頁的外匯基金及其附屬公司（「本集團」）的財務報表，包括截至2015年12月31日的外匯基金及本集團的資產負債表，以及截至該日止年度的收支帳、全面收益表、權益變動表及現金流量表，以及主要會計政策概要及其他說明資料。\n\n# 金融管理專員對財務報表的責任\n\n金融管理專員須根據《外匯基金條例》（第66章）第7條行政長官的指示及香港財務報告準則，編製真實而公平反映的財務報表，並負責其認為為編製不含重大錯誤陳述（無論因欺詐或錯誤而產生）的財務報表所需的內部控制。\n\n# 審計人員的責任\n\n本人之責任是根據審計所得對該等財務報表發表意見。本人已根據《外匯基金條例》第7條行政長官的指示及審計署審計準則進行審計。該等準則要求本人遵守道德規範，並策劃及執行審計，以合理確信財務報表是否不存在重大錯誤陳述。\n\n審計工作包括執行程序，以獲取有關財務報表金額及披露的審計證據。所選程序取決於審計人員的判斷，包括對財務報表因欺詐或錯誤而產生重大錯誤陳述風險的評估。在進行該等風險評估時，審計人員會考慮與編製真實而公平反映財務報表相關的內部控制，以設計適當的審計程序，但並非為對該實體內部控制的有效性發表意見。審計亦包括評估金融管理專員所採用的會計政策的恰當性及所作會計估計的合理性，以及評估財務報表的整體列報方式。\n\n本人相信，所獲得的審計證據足以作為發表審計意見的基礎。\n\n# 審計署署長報告（續）\n\n# 意見\n\n本人認為，該等財務報表已根據香港財務報告準則，真實而公平地反映外匯基金及本集團於2015年12月31日的財務狀況，以及截至該日止年度的財務表現及現金流量，並已根據《外匯基金條例》第7條行政長官的指示妥為編製。\n\n孫德基\n審計署署長\n\n2016年4月7日\n\n審計署\n26樓\n入境事務大樓\n香港灣仔告士打道7號\n\n# 目錄\n\n收支帳\n全面收益表\n資產負債表\n權益變動表\n現金流量表\n財務報表附註：\n\n1. 主要業務\n2. 主要會計政策\n3. 會計政策的變動\n4. 收入及支出\n5. 所得稅\n6. 金融資產及金融負債類別\n7. 現金及即期資金\n8. 銀行及其他金融機構存款\n9. 按公允價值指定的金融資產\n10. 可供出售證券\n11. 衍生金融工具\n12. 持有至到期證券\n13. 貸款組合\n14. 黃金\n15. 其他資產\n16. 附屬公司權益\n17. 聯營公司及合營企業權益\n18. 投資物業\n19. 物業、廠房及設備\n20. 貸款證明書、政府發行流通紙幣及硬幣\n21. 銀行體系結餘\n22. 銀行及其他金融機構存款\n23. 財政儲備存款\n24. 香港特別行政區政府基金及法定機構存款\n25. 發行的外匯基金票據及債券\n26. 銀行貸款\n27. 其他發行債務證券\n28. 其他負債\n29. 權益\n30. 現金流量表中現金及現金等價物分析\n31. 營運分部資料\n32. 抵押資產\n33. 承擔\n34. 或有負債\n35. 重大關聯方交易\n36. 財務風險管理\n37. 金融工具的公允價值計量\n38. 資產負債表日後非調整事項\n39. 截至2015年12月31日止年度尚未生效的修訂、新準則及詮釋可能產生的影響\n40. 財務報表的批准\n\n# 外匯基金－收支帳\n\n截至2015年12月31日止年度\n\n第140至222頁的附註屬本財務報表的一部分。\n\n# 外匯基金－全面收益表\n\n截至2015年12月31日止年度\n\n第140至222頁的附註屬本財務報表的一部分。\n\n# 外匯基金－資產負債表\n\n於2015年12月31日\n\n陳德霖\n金融管理專員\n2016年4月7日\n\n第140至222頁的附註屬本財務報表的一部分。\n\n# 外匯基金－權益變動表\n\n截至2015年12月31日止年度\n\n第140至222頁的附註屬本財務報表的一部分。\n\n# 外匯基金－現金流量表\n\n截至2015年12月31日止年度\n\n# 外匯基金－現金流量表（續）\n\n截至2015年12月31日止年度\n\n第140至222頁的附註屬本財務報表的一部分。\n\n# 外匯基金－財務報表附註\n\n（除另有說明外，金額以百萬港元列示。）\n\n# 1 主要業務\n\n金融管理專員根據財政司司長作為外匯基金（下稱「基金」）管理人的授權，依據《外匯基金條例》（第66章）管理基金。基金的主要業務為維護香港貨幣的匯率價值，以及維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定和完整。\n\n基金的資產分為四個投資組合管理：外匯基金票據組合、投資組合、長遠增長組合及策略性組合。票據組合的資產完全對應貨幣基礎，根據香港的貨幣發行局制度運作。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債券及股票市場。長遠增長組合持有私人股本及房地產投資。策略性組合則持有由香港特別行政區政府（「特區政府」）為基金帳戶策略性目的而購入的香港交易及結算所有限公司股份。有關營運分部資料載於附註31。\n\n# 2 主要會計政策\n\n# 2.1 合規聲明\n\n這些財務報表乃根據所有適用的《香港財務報告準則》（HKFRSs）編製。該術語包括所有適用的個別《香港財務報告準則》、《香港會計準則》（HKASs）及由香港會計師公會（HKICPA）頒布的詮釋，以及香港普遍認可的會計原則。基金及其附屬公司（統稱「本集團」）所採納的主要會計政策摘要如下。\n\n香港會計師公會已頒布若干於本會計期首次生效或可供提早採納的新訂及經修訂的香港財務報告準則。有關首次採納這些準則而導致會計政策變動（如有），以及其對本集團於本期及前期財務報表的影響，詳見附註3。\n\n# 外匯基金－財務報表附註（續）\n\n（除另有說明外，金額以百萬港元列示。）\n\n# 2.2 財務報表的編製基準\n\n本集團財務報表包括本集團的財務報表，以及本集團於聯營公司及合營企業的權益。主要附屬公司、聯營公司及合營企業的主要業務活動載於附註16及17。\n\n財務報表的編製以歷史成本為基礎，惟下列資產及負債則按其公允價值列賬，詳情見下文所載會計政策：\n\n- 交易性金融工具（附註2.6.2.1）；\n- 指定按公允價值計量的金融資產及金融負債（附註2.6.2.2）；可供出售證券（附註2.6.2.5）；\n- 黃金（附註2.11）；及\n- 投資物業（附註2.12）。\n\n根據香港財務報告準則編製財務報表，管理層需作出判斷、估計及假設，影響政策的應用及資產、負債、收入及支出的報告金額。這些估計及相關假設乃根據經驗及其他在當時情況下被認為合理的因素作出，其結果構成對資產及負債賬面價值作出判斷的基礎，而這些價值未必能從其他來源直接得知。實際結果可能與這些估計有所不同。\n\n這些估計及其所依據的假設會持續檢討。若會計估計有所修訂，則於修訂當期確認（如僅影響該期），或於修訂當期及未來期間確認（如同時影響當期及未來期間）。\n\n有關投資物業公允價值估值假設的資料載於附註18。有關金融工具公允價值估值假設的資料載於附註37。除附註2.5所述若干金融工具的估值外，於應用本集團會計政策時，並無涉及關鍵會計判斷。\n\n# 2.3 附屬公司及非控股權益\n\n附屬公司指由本集團控制的實體。當本集團因參與該實體而承擔可變回報的風險或享有相關權利，並有能力透過對該實體的權力影響該等回報時，即視為本集團控制該實體。在評估本集團是否擁有權力時，僅考慮實質性權利（由本集團及其他方持有）。\n\n# 外匯基金－財務報表附註（續）\n\n（除另有說明外，金額以百萬港元列示。）\n\n對附屬公司的投資自本集團取得控制權之日起，直至控制權終止之日止，納入本集團財務報表綜合賬目。\n\n集團內部的往來賬項、交易及現金流量，以及因集團內部交易產生的任何未實現利潤及虧損，於編製本集團財務報表時均予以全數抵銷。\n\n非控股權益指附屬公司中不直接或間接歸屬於基金的權益，且本集團與該等權益持有人未就該等權益訂立任何額外條款，致使本集團整體對該等權益承擔符合金融負債定義的合約義務。非控股權益於本集團資產負債表內的權益部分單獨列示，與歸屬於基金擁有人的權益分開列示。非控股權益於本集團收支結算表及本集團全面收益表內，作為本年度盈餘或虧損及全面收益或虧損於非控股權益及基金擁有人之間的分配。\n\n於基金的資產負債表內，對附屬公司的投資按成本減去減值虧損（如有）列賬（附註2.14）。\n\n# 2.4 聯營公司及合營企業\n\n聯營公司指本集團對其具有重大影響力（但不具控制權或共同控制權），即能參與其財務及營運政策決策的實體。"}

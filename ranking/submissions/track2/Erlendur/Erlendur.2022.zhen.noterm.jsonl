{"zh": "2022年是迎難而上的一年。\n\n2022年伊始，全球經濟環境一片暗淡。新冠病毒變異株Omicron肆虐，令全球經濟增長繼續受壓，通脹壓力亦持續上升。其後俄羅斯與烏克蘭爆發衝突，進一步推高通脹壓力，導致各主要央行採取前置式貨幣緊縮政策，擴大環球金融市場的波動，並加劇經濟增長放緩的風險。本地方面，第五波疫情爆發，感染個案急速上升，亦進一步打擊經濟。同時，圍繞防疫措施與檢疫限制的負面報道，更令外界對香港產生誤解，威脅香港作為國際金融中心的聲譽。全年計，香港實質本地生產總值收縮了3.5%。\n\n儘管面對重重挑戰，金管局繼續致力保障香港貨幣與金融穩定，並於主要策略範疇推進多項有利發展的措施，進一步鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位。經歷3年的旅遊限制後，我們成功向國際社會展示香港已全面復常，旅客亦能再次親身訪港體驗。金管局在去年11月舉辦「國際金融領袖投資峰會」，來自世界各地的金融領袖親身來港出席。外界如此熱烈的反應，成為印證香港全面復常最好不過的證明。\n\n展望未來，外圍環境仍然充滿前所未有的不確定性。儘管如此，內地經濟重啟會為香港以至整個地區重新注入動力。金管局將繼續緊守崗位，履行維持香港貨幣與銀行體系穩定的職能，並積極尋求更多有利香港發展的機會，展現及提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。我們亦會繼續為提升全球氣候應變能力及可持續發展出力。今年除《二零二二年年報》外，我們會另外發表《二零二二年可持續發展報告》，以便更詳細地介紹金管局在提升香港作為綠色和可持續金融樞紐的地位所進行的各項工作，以及金管局作為負責任投資者及可持續機構所作出的努力。\n\n# 貨幣及金融體系：堅穩如昔\n\n聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）自1983年實施至今，歷經多個經濟周期，成功抵禦各種各樣的外來衝擊。2022年再次見證聯匯制度的抗震能力。在美國聯邦儲備局（聯儲局）大幅收緊貨幣政策下，弱方兌換保證於2022年5月至11月期間被觸發41次，金管局按照既定機制，以有序及具透明度的方式從市場買入合共2,421億港元。其間港元匯率及貨幣市場繼續運作暢順，反映聯匯制度穩健有效。\n\n這份對聯匯制度的信心，來自於建立多年的穩固根基。正如國際貨幣基金組織在其《2022年對外部門報告》中重申，聯匯制度的公信力建基於多項因素，包括具高透明度的運作規則、充裕的外匯儲備、審慎的財政制度、穩健的金融監管，以及靈活的經濟結構。\n\n我們深信除了穩健的機制外，致力與公眾及市場溝通以加深其對聯匯制度的了解、進行有效的市場監察，以及就不同情景作出應變計劃，均有助鞏固各界對聯匯制度的信心。我們就聯匯制度運作機制推出的社交媒體宣傳活動，有助在年內弱方兌換保證多次被觸發的情況下，有效維護市場對聯匯制度的信心。內部方面，金管局亦善用數據分析技術加強市場監察，讓我們能適時回應最新市場形勢。\n\n年內，儘管面對宏觀層面的挑戰以及遞增的信用風險，香港銀行體系仍然維持穩健，資本及流動性均非常充裕。2022年底，本地銀行的綜合總資本充足比率為20.1%，遠高於國際最低要求的8%。2022年第4季，大型銀行的流動性覆蓋比率稍升至162.3%，亦遠高於法定最低要求的100%。鑑於信貸環境面對挑戰，銀行體系的資產質素略為轉差，特定分類貸款比率於2022年底升至1.38%，但有關水平仍屬穩健，並低於2000年以來的長期平均水平1.8%。\n\n# 銀行體系：有效監管確保運作穩健\n\n疫情持續3年，來自各方面的挑戰均有所加劇，例如地緣政治緊張局勢升溫及主要央行收緊貨幣政策。然而，全賴多年來妥善的風險管理及有效的監管，香港銀行體系得以維持穩健，繼續發揮支持經濟的重要作用。\n\n過去一年面對的一項主要監管挑戰，是在第五波新冠疫情後經濟仍充滿不確定性之下，確保銀行繼續為客戶提供所需支援的同時，維持穩健的信用風險管理。「預先批核還息不還本」計劃進一步展期，並加入自願性部分本金還款選項，讓借款人可以選擇開始償還部分本金，協助客戶就最終回復正常還款作好準備。\n\n因應主要經濟體大幅收緊貨幣政策令市場波動加劇，2022年金管局另一項主要監管工作是加強監察銀行的市場及流動性風險承擔。我們深入評估各經濟體同步收緊貨幣政策對銀行可能產生的影響，並就壓力測試引入新情景，以評估銀行應對長時間流動性壓力的韌性。\n\n與此同時，我們繼續採取具前瞻性的措施，促進在多個範疇的有效風險管理。在運作穩健性及網絡防衛能力方面，我們提供指引協助銀行制定綜合及全面的運作架構，以達致穩健經營，並就銀行具體的運作範疇提供詳盡監管指引，例如因應雲端技術普及而就使用雲端運算提供指引。此外，因應數碼化加速發展，我們亦加強了應對「網絡釣魚」騙案和推進消費者及投資者保障的工作。\n\n除了維持銀行體系穩健外，金管局亦致力推動普及金融及提高銀行服務的便利性。銀行對於金管局就提供基本銀行服務的呼籲反應正面，有銀行在新發展地區的大型公共屋邨增設分行及自助銀行服務設施。受到疫情相關的旅遊限制影響，許多香港市民無法使用其內地銀行戶口。有見及此，金管局與有關各方緊密合作，協助重新啓動約50萬個內地銀行戶口，受影響戶口持有人無需親身前往內地辦理。\n\n另一個對銀行業持續發展具策略重要性的範疇是提升專業能力。為擴展業務，銀行業對專業人才的需求仍然龐大。金管局在其人才發展策略 — 「連接人才與未來」— 的基礎上，在過去一年推出多項措施，協助銀行業吸引、培育及挽留人才，集中提升及再培訓現有從業員的技能，以及培育年輕一代，以建立可持續的人才庫。\n\n# 國際金融中心：香港重回國際舞台!\n\n實施多時的疫情相關旅遊限制於2022年逐步撤銷，我們作出了多方面的努力讓香港重回國際舞台。11月舉行的「國際金融領袖投資峰會」吸引超過200位來自環球金融機構的國際及地區負責人親臨香港，並獲得全球各地的關注及熱切迴響。儘管峰會舉行日期不巧遇上50年來首個在11月份發出的8號颱風訊號，峰會仍然十分成功，向世界傳遞了香港已全面復常並正展現無比朝氣與活力的有力訊息。我們很高興看到峰會產生了正面的漣漪效應，不少環球金融機構及國際組織現正或計劃在香港舉辦各類活動。\n\n除吸引各地訪客重臨香港外，我和金管局的同事體會到面對面交流聯繫的重要性，因此盡可能親身代表香港出席主要國際會議，積極參與全球政策討論，並藉外訪機會與環球金融機構的集團管理層會面，加深他們對香港穩健的金融體系以及在「一國兩制」下香港提供的各種機遇的了解。\n\n為確保香港保持作為國際金融中心的競爭力，我們在金融科技、內地機遇，以及綠色和可持續金融等策略性重點領域不斷開拓市場新界限。我們亦進一步加強本港的金融平台，提供頂尖的服務，吸引更多企業落戶香港。有關金管局在綠色和可持續金融方面的工作詳情，請參閱《二零二二年可持續發展報告》。\n\n# 金融科技\n\n繼2021年6月公布「金融科技2025」策略，2022年我們在五大範疇均取得顯著進展。\n\n我們在「全面推展銀行數碼化」方面的工作取得理想成果。根據金融科技應用評估的結果，香港銀行業在不同業務領域廣泛採用金融科技，而且所採用的科技類別亦持續增加。我們自2017年以來逐步推廣及支持數碼化的工作獲銀行積極回應，並持續取得成果，成續令人鼓舞。我們將繼續與業界緊密合作，根據評估的結果，進一步推動金融科技在特定銀行業務領域的應用及促進個別科技類別的發展。\n\n年內我們在央行數碼貨幣方面的工作邁進重要的新里程。「多種央行數碼貨幣跨境網絡」(mBridge)項目進入試行階段，並成為全球其中一個率先為企業跨境交易進行真實結算的央行數碼貨幣項目。在零售層面，數字人民幣跨境使用的技術測試已進入第二階段，主要測試通過「轉數快」為數字人民幣錢包增值。數碼港元方面，我們將採取三軌道方式為將來可能發行數碼港元作好準備，並推出第二軌道先導計劃，邀請業界深入研究數碼港元可行的應用場景。\n\n數據可全面釋放金融科技的潛力。我們於去年10月推出的「商業數據通」正是提升香港數據基建的重要一步。作為以數據擁有人授權為本的共享數據基建，「商業數據通」能方便金融機構提取企業的商業數據，使企業（尤其中小型企業）更容易獲得融資。截至2022年底，「商業數據通」已促成超過1,000宗中小企貸款，總額逾19億港元。\n\n最後，我們在擁抱金融創新和它帶來的好處的同時，亦明白有必要監察及處理好相關發展可能帶來的風險。我們正密切注視虛擬資產領域的發展，並參與相關監管事宜的國際討論。經考慮公眾諮詢收集到的意見及相關國際標準後，我們將採納「相同風險，相同監管」1 的方式制定穩定幣的監管制度及界定其監管範圍。未來我們率先規管的對象將是那些標榜與一種或以上法定貨幣的價值掛鈎的穩定幣，因為這類穩定幣可能對貨幣及金融穩定帶來更高及更迫切的潛在風險。我們相信在訂立適當的規範下，業界將可更安全穩妥地開拓數碼金融的潛力。\n\n科技正重塑我們的未來。金管局與銀行業界正積極準備迎向這個「新常態」。我們有信心我們正構建的金融科技生態圈將有助全面釋放金融科技的潛力，並提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。\n\n# 內地機遇\n", "en": "2022 was a year of rising to challenges.\n\nAt the beginning of 2022, the global economic environment was bleak. The Omicron variant of COVID-19 was rampant, continuing to weigh on global economic growth and driving persistent inflationary pressures. Subsequently, the outbreak of conflict between Russia and Ukraine further exacerbated inflation, prompting major central banks to adopt preemptive monetary tightening policies. This increased volatility in global financial markets and heightened the risk of an economic slowdown. Locally, the fifth wave of the pandemic saw a rapid surge in infections, further impacting the economy. At the same time, negative reports surrounding anti-epidemic measures and quarantine restrictions led to misunderstandings about Hong Kong, threatening its reputation as an international financial centre. For the year as a whole, Hong Kong’s real GDP contracted by 3.5%.\n\nDespite these formidable challenges, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) remained committed to safeguarding Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, and advanced a range of initiatives in key strategic areas to further consolidate Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre. After three years of travel restrictions, we successfully demonstrated to the international community that Hong Kong had fully returned to normal, and visitors could once again experience the city in person. In November last year, the HKMA hosted the International Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit, which saw financial leaders from around the world attend in person. The enthusiastic response from the international community served as the best testament to Hong Kong’s full resumption of normalcy.\n\nLooking ahead, the external environment remains fraught with unprecedented uncertainties. Nevertheless, the reopening of the Mainland economy will inject renewed impetus into Hong Kong and the wider region. The HKMA will continue to stay steadfast at its post, fulfilling its role in maintaining the stability of Hong Kong’s monetary and banking systems, while actively seeking further opportunities to benefit Hong Kong’s development and enhance its competitiveness as an international financial centre. We will also continue to contribute to strengthening global climate resilience and sustainable development. In addition to the 2022 Annual Report, we will also publish the 2022 Sustainability Report this year, providing a more detailed account of the HKMA’s efforts to enhance Hong Kong’s position as a green and sustainable finance hub, as well as our initiatives as a responsible investor and sustainable institution.\n\n# Monetary and Financial System: As Robust as Ever\n\nThe Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), implemented since 1983, has weathered multiple economic cycles and successfully withstood various external shocks. In 2022, the resilience of the LERS was once again demonstrated. Amid aggressive monetary tightening by the US Federal Reserve, the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking was triggered 41 times between May and November 2022. In accordance with established mechanisms, the HKMA purchased a total of HK$242.1 billion from the market in an orderly and transparent manner. During this period, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate and money markets continued to function smoothly, reflecting the robustness and effectiveness of the LERS.\n\nConfidence in the LERS is underpinned by a solid foundation built over many years. As reiterated by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in its 2022 External Sector Report, the credibility of the LERS is based on several factors, including highly transparent operating rules, ample foreign exchange reserves, a prudent fiscal system, robust financial regulation, and a flexible economic structure.\n\nWe firmly believe that, in addition to a sound mechanism, efforts to communicate with the public and the market to deepen understanding of the LERS, effective market surveillance, and contingency planning for different scenarios all help to reinforce confidence in the system. Our social media campaigns explaining the operation of the LERS were instrumental in maintaining market confidence during the multiple triggers of the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking throughout the year. Internally, the HKMA also leveraged data analytics technology to enhance market surveillance, enabling us to respond promptly to the latest market developments.\n\nDuring the year, despite macro-level challenges and rising credit risks, Hong Kong’s banking system remained sound, with strong capital and liquidity positions. At the end of 2022, the consolidated total capital adequacy ratio of local banks stood at 20.1%, well above the international minimum requirement of 8%. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the liquidity coverage ratio of major banks edged up to 162.3%, also well above the statutory minimum of 100%. Given the challenging credit environment, asset quality in the banking system deteriorated slightly, with the classified loan ratio rising to 1.38% at end-2022. However, this level remains healthy and below the long-term average of 1.8% since 2000.\n\n# Banking System: Effective Regulation Ensures Sound Operations\n\nThe pandemic has persisted for three years, intensifying challenges from various fronts, such as heightened geopolitical tensions and major central banks’ tightening of monetary policy. Nevertheless, thanks to years of prudent risk management and effective regulation, Hong Kong’s banking system has remained robust and continued to play a vital role in supporting the economy.\n\nOne of the main regulatory challenges faced over the past year was ensuring that banks continued to provide necessary support to customers while maintaining sound credit risk management amid the lingering economic uncertainty following the fifth wave of COVID-19. The Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme was further extended, with the addition of a voluntary partial principal repayment option, allowing borrowers to begin repaying part of the principal and helping customers prepare for a full return to normal repayment.\n\nIn response to heightened market volatility caused by significant monetary tightening by major economies, another key supervisory focus of the HKMA in 2022 was to strengthen the monitoring of banks’ market and liquidity risk exposures. We conducted in-depth assessments of the potential impact on banks arising from the synchronized monetary tightening across economies, and introduced new scenarios in our stress testing to evaluate banks’ resilience to prolonged liquidity stress.\n\nAt the same time, we continued to adopt forward-looking measures to promote effective risk management across multiple areas. In terms of operational resilience and cyber defense capabilities, we provided guidance to assist banks in establishing comprehensive and integrated operational frameworks to ensure sound operations, and issued detailed supervisory guidance on specific operational areas, such as the use of cloud computing in light of the growing adoption of cloud technologies. Furthermore, in response to the accelerated pace of digitalization, we enhanced our efforts to combat phishing scams and to advance consumer and investor protection.\n\nIn addition to maintaining the robustness of the banking system, the HKMA is also committed to promoting financial inclusion and enhancing the convenience of banking services. Banks have responded positively to the HKMA’s call to provide basic banking services, with some opening new branches and installing self-service banking facilities in large public housing estates in newly developed districts. Due to pandemic-related travel restrictions, many Hong Kong residents were unable to access their Mainland bank accounts. In view of this, the HKMA worked closely with relevant parties to help reactivate around 500,000 Mainland bank accounts, allowing affected account holders to complete the process without having to travel to the Mainland in person.\n\nAnother strategically important area for the sustainable development of the banking sector is the enhancement of professional capabilities. The demand for professional talent in the banking industry remains strong as business continues to expand. Building on its talent development strategy—\"Connecting Talent to the Future\"—the HKMA launched a number of initiatives over the past year to help the banking sector attract, nurture, and retain talent, with a focus on upskilling and retraining existing practitioners and cultivating the younger generation to build a sustainable talent pool.\n\n# International Financial Centre: Hong Kong Returns to the Global Stage!\n\nWith the gradual removal of pandemic-related travel restrictions in 2022, we made concerted efforts to bring Hong Kong back onto the international stage. The International Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit held in November attracted over 200 international and regional leaders from global financial institutions to Hong Kong, garnering worldwide attention and enthusiastic responses. Despite the summit coinciding with the first No. 8 typhoon signal issued in November in 50 years, it was a resounding success, sending a strong message to the world that Hong Kong has fully returned to normal and is demonstrating remarkable vitality and dynamism. We are pleased to see the summit generating a positive ripple effect, with many global financial institutions and international organizations now hosting or planning to host various events in Hong Kong.\n\nIn addition to attracting visitors back to Hong Kong, my colleagues and I at the HKMA recognize the importance of face-to-face engagement. We therefore made every effort to represent Hong Kong in person at major international conferences, actively participated in global policy discussions, and used overseas visits as opportunities to meet with the group management of global financial institutions, deepening their understanding of Hong Kong’s robust financial system and the diverse opportunities available under the \"One Country, Two Systems\" framework.\n\nTo ensure that Hong Kong maintains its competitiveness as an international financial centre, we continue to break new ground in strategic focus areas such as fintech, Mainland opportunities, and green and sustainable finance. We have also further strengthened Hong Kong’s financial platform, providing top-tier services to attract more enterprises to establish a presence in the city. For details of the HKMA’s work in green and sustainable finance, please refer to the 2022 Sustainability Report.\n\n# Fintech\n\nFollowing the announcement of the \"Fintech 2025\" strategy in June 2021, we made significant progress across all five key areas in 2022.\n\nOur efforts to promote comprehensive digitalization of banks have yielded positive results. According to the fintech adoption assessment, Hong Kong’s banking sector has widely adopted fintech across various business areas, with the range of technologies in use continuing to expand. Our phased promotion and support for digitalization since 2017 have been met with active responses from banks and have delivered encouraging outcomes. We will continue to work closely with the industry to further drive fintech adoption in specific banking business areas and foster the development of individual technology categories based on the assessment results.\n\nDuring the year, we made important new strides in central bank digital currency (CBDC) initiatives. The \"Multiple CBDC Bridge\" (mBridge) project entered the pilot phase, becoming one of the world’s first CBDC projects to conduct real settlement of cross-border transactions for corporates. At the retail level, technical testing for cross-border use of the digital RMB entered its second phase, focusing mainly on topping up digital RMB wallets via the Faster Payment System (FPS). Regarding the digital Hong Kong dollar, we will adopt a three-rail approach to prepare for a potential future issuance, and have launched the second-rail pilot scheme, inviting the industry to explore feasible use cases for the digital Hong Kong dollar.\n\nData can fully unlock the potential of fintech. The launch of the Commercial Data Interchange (CDI) in October last year marked an important step in enhancing Hong Kong’s data infrastructure. As a data owner consent-based data sharing infrastructure, the CDI enables financial institutions to access commercial data of enterprises, making it easier for businesses—especially SMEs—to obtain financing. By the end of 2022, the CDI had facilitated over 1,000 SME loans, with a total amount exceeding HK$1.9 billion.\n\nFinally, while we embrace financial innovation and the benefits it brings, we also recognize the necessity of monitoring and addressing the risks that may arise from related developments. We are closely observing developments in the virtual asset sector and participating in international discussions on relevant regulatory matters. Taking into account the feedback collected from public consultations and relevant international standards, we will adopt the principle of \"same risk, same regulation\" in formulating the regulatory regime for stablecoins and defining its regulatory scope. Going forward, our initial regulatory focus will be on those stablecoins that claim to be pegged to the value of one or more legal tenders, as these types of stablecoins may pose higher and more immediate potential risks to monetary and financial stability. We believe that with the establishment of appropriate regulations, the industry will be able to explore the potential of digital finance in a safer and more secure manner.\n\nTechnology is reshaping our future. The HKMA and the banking sector are actively preparing to embrace this \"new normal.\" We are confident that the fintech ecosystem we are building will help fully unlock the potential of financial technology and enhance Hong Kong's competitiveness as an international financial centre.\n\n# Mainland Opportunities"}

The labour market initially deteriorated but gradually improved thereafter, while inflation remained moderate. Benefiting from the full reopening of borders between the Mainland and Hong Kong, economic growth in Hong Kong is expected to recover from a low base in 2023.\n\nHong Kong’s banking system remained robust in 2022, with capital and liquidity positions staying strong and asset quality continuing at healthy levels.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nWith the US tightening its monetary policy, the Hong Kong dollar weakened, and the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking was triggered multiple times during the year. Nevertheless, the Hong Kong dollar foreign exchange and money markets continued to function smoothly and orderly, repeatedly demonstrating the robustness and effectiveness of the Linked Exchange Rate System.\n\n# Reserve Management\n\nThe investment environment in 2022 was exceptionally volatile, with prices of multiple asset classes declining simultaneously. The Exchange Fund recorded an overall investment return rate of -4.5%. Compared to most multi-asset funds in the market, the extent of the loss was relatively moderate.\n\nThe HKMA also continued to promote responsible investment and asset diversification. Meanwhile, since its inception in 2009, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio has achieved an annualized internal rate of return of 12.6%.\n\n# Banking System Stability\n\nIn the face of heightened financial market volatility, the HKMA strengthened its supervision of banks’ credit and market risk management, and worked closely with banks to enhance their operational resilience and cyber defense capabilities, in response to the increasing threat of cyberattacks and the accelerating pace of digital transformation in the banking sector.\n\nThe HKMA further introduced consumer protection measures for \"Buy Now Pay Later\" products and new property refinancing payment arrangements. In addition, the HKMA collaborated with other regulatory authorities to develop a regulatory framework for virtual assets, issued guidance on the distribution of investment products, and launched a new regulatory regime for trust business. The \"Credit Data Platform\" under the \"multiple credit reference agencies\" model for personal credit data was also launched during the year.\n\nThe HKMA continued to work with banks to enhance Hong Kong’s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML/CFT) ecosystem, strengthened responses to fraud, and further promoted the application of data and technology through the \"AML Regtech Lab\" series, accelerating the adoption of regulatory technology in the HKMA’s AML efforts.\n\nThe HKMA made good progress in the local implementation of international regulatory standards, such as capital adequacy and disclosure standards. The HKMA also worked with the banking industry to build a sustainable talent pool and enhance practitioners’ skills for future development.\n\nTo ensure Hong Kong has a credible resolution mechanism, the HKMA established new resolution standards, conducted regional crisis simulation exercises, and introduced a new layer of loss-absorbing capacity resources at all domestic systemically important banks, marking a significant milestone in the development of the resolution regime.\n\n# Hong Kong’s Status as an International Financial Centre\n\nThe successful Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit reinforced Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre and generated a positive ripple effect.\n\nThe currency swap agreement between the People’s Bank of China and the HKMA was enhanced during the year, further consolidating Hong Kong’s position as the world’s leading offshore RMB business hub. The HKMA also worked with other regulators and stakeholders to prepare for the launch of \"Swap Connect\" and introduced a dual-counter market maker mechanism to facilitate trading of RMB-denominated stocks in Hong Kong.

{"zh": "# 2023年工作重點及前瞻\n\n儘管香港經濟在2023 年初出現復甦跡象，但外圍環境仍然充滿挑戰及不確定性。近期美國和歐洲的銀行業受壓，個別美國本土銀行在2023 年3 月倒閉，對環球金融市場造成漣漪效應，而主要央行收緊貨幣政策，很有可能令2023 年全球經濟增長放緩甚或衰退。另一方面，地緣政治局勢緊張，以及去全球化的威脅持續，可能會繼續拖累全球貿易，並會令環球金融市場不時出現波動。儘管如此，香港金融體系憑藉多年來所建立穩健的抗震能力及充裕的緩衝，有足夠能力抵禦不利衝擊。\n\n金管局非常重視保障貨幣及金融穩定。展望未來，面對不明朗的宏觀經濟環境，金管局會保持警惕，力求迅速辨識正浮現的風險，並靈活應對。與此同時，金管局會繼續把握機遇及創造政策空間，進一步提升香港作為主要國際金融中心的地位。面對充滿挑戰的投資環境，金管局在管理外匯基金時會繼續審慎投資，同時保持足夠靈活性，按需要採取防禦措施，並維持高流動性。\n\n# 金融體系保持穩定健全\n\n環球經濟前景仍受制於重大的不確定因素。金管局會密切注視最新發展，提高警覺，防範各種潛在風險，以維持金融體系穩定健全；這是關乎持續提供關鍵金融服務的先決條件，因此亦是維繫香港經濟正常運作的命脈。\n\n# 對潛在風險保持警惕\n\n在2023年，美國利率未來走勢的不確定性，以及在先進經濟體銀行體系出現的壓力，可能會對主要先進經濟體的增長前景帶來下行風險。此外，持續的地緣政治風險，可能會繼續拖累全球貿易，並會令環球金融市場不時出現波動。然而，香港金融體系憑藉過去多年所建立的抗震能力及緩衝，有足夠能力抵禦不利衝擊。金管局亦有能力、資源及決心維持香港貨幣及金融穩定。\n\n金管局將繼續密切注視本地及外圍環境的風險與脆弱性，並會按需要採取適當措施維持香港的貨幣及金融體系穩定。金管局亦會研究對香港經濟有影響的事項，以及評估與這些事項相關的潛在風險。\n\n# 保持銀行體系穩定\n\n鑑於地緣政治緊張局勢升級，以及各主要央行大幅加息以遏抑通脹，預計2023年銀行業的經營環境仍然充滿挑戰。另一方面，科技發展迅速及數碼化對銀行業來說既有危又有機。面對瞬息萬變的金融環境，金管局致力透過持續的監管工作確保銀行具足夠能力抵禦衝擊。與此同時，金管局亦會參照國際標準及最佳做法，繼續加強及優化銀行監管架構與政策。\n\n# 風險為本的監管重點\n\n# 信用、流動性及市場風險\n\n在2023年，金管局將繼續密切注視認可機構的資產質素，並聚焦於認可機構的貸款分類及撥備做法，以及對財務狀況較差的借款人的管理。金管局亦會加強其監察系統，並採取積極措施確保銀行體系的整體信用風險水平維持可控。\n\n另一方面，金管局會繼續留意企業的營運環境，並與銀行業及商界保持緊密溝通，以就最終退出「預先批核還息不還本」計劃作好準備，並同時確保暫時面對困難的客戶仍然得到適切的信貸支援。\n\n此外，面對不明朗的宏觀經濟環境，金管局於2023年亦會加強監管認可機構的流動性及市場風險管理。\n\n# 業務操作及科技風險\n\n隨着銀行在業務營運中更廣泛應用科技，金管局會致力提升銀行業的運作穩健性及網絡防衛能力。繼5月發出《監管政策手冊》新單元「運作穩健性」後，金管局會與業界保持緊密聯繫，審視認可機構在制定運作穩健性框架方面的進度。同時，金管局將透過跟進認可機構在「網絡防衛評估框架2.0」評估下發現的問題以及檢視認可機構實施穩固三重數據備份的進展，提高銀行業的網絡防衛能力。\n\n隨着數碼化的步伐加快，金管局的其他監管重點包括加強對銀行的第三方服務供應商風險管理的監管，以及提升銀行業的數據管治能力。\n\n# 打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集\n\n在2023年，金管局的工作重點包括更新監管資訊、加強打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集（反洗錢）生態系統各持份者的合作以應對洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集（洗錢）風險，以及進一步推動反洗錢監管科技與合規科技的發展。金管局的《打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集指引》亦會作出修訂，並會就「政治人物」採取與風險相稱的措施發出具體指引，從而促進業界以有效及風險為本的方法落實法例的主要修訂。與此同時，金管局會擴大現有公私營夥伴合作的涵蓋範圍以加強訊息共享，以及支持推出銀行之間的訊息共享平台，藉以加快偵測可疑戶口及防範戶口被濫用，並加強對騙案受害人的保障和協助受害人追討損失。金管局亦會透過「反洗錢合規科技實驗室」及其他反洗錢合規科技項目，進一步集中推動採用合規科技（包括數據分析），並致力發展宏觀分析能力，以配合其數據為本的反洗錢監管工作。透過實施上述各項措施，金管局將能更迅速針對傀儡戶口網絡等系統性洗錢風險採取相應措施，以及靈活應對不斷轉變的威脅。\n\n# 財富管理業務\n\n金管局在2023年會加強有關認可機構在財富管理以及銷售證券、強制性公積金（強積金）與其他投資及保險產品方面的操守的現場審查及非現場監察。2023年的重點將會是「跨境理財通」計劃、數碼分銷及諮詢平台、虛擬資產、環境、社會及管治(ESG)投資產品及長期保險產品。金管局在有關過程中會參考市場最新發展及國際標準的修訂。\n\n金管局亦會與其他監管機構及銀行界緊密聯繫，並按需要就銷售投資、保險及強積金產品的監管標準向認可機構提供指引，其中亦會包括有關提供虛擬資產相關投資服務的指引。就此而言，為促進虛擬資產行業可持續及負責任地發展，金管局會積極參與相關國際組織，並與政府及其他金融監管機構合作，制定全面的虛擬資產監管架構。\n\n隨着「跨境理財通」順利推出，金管局會與業界及相關監管機構聯繫，以優化該計劃。此外，金管局亦會與證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）及業界合作，精簡投資產品銷售程序（包括適用於資深投資者的銷售程序），以及開始根據相關《監管政策手冊》新單元及新營運守則監管認可機構的信託業務。\n\n# 監察金融市場基建\n\n金管局的目標是按照《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（《支付條例》）、《金融市場基建的原則》（《基建原則》），以及支付及金融基建委員會發出的各項指引促進其所監察的金融市場基建的安全及效率，按需要參照最新的國際標準評估各項基建。金管局會參與支付及金融基建委員會與國際證監會組織對實施《基建原則》的監察及評估計劃，亦會參與國際標準制定組織的工作，並參照國際慣例或因應市場及科技發展加強本身的監察規定。同時，如有需要，金管局會與有關當局合作，進一步加強合作監察安排。\n\n# 制定政策\n\n金管局會因應國際標準及最佳做法，繼續加強及優化銀行監管架構與政策。\n\n# 在香港實施巴塞爾標準\n\n# 資本標準\n\n金管局會透過實施巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（巴塞爾委員會）近年發布的標準，進一步優化資本框架，當中包括：\n- 2017年12月《巴塞爾協定三：危機後改革的最終方案》、2019年1月（2019年2月修訂）《市場風險最低資本規定》，以及2020年7月《信用估值調整風險架構具針對性的修訂》所載的經修訂資本標準 — 上述經修訂資本標準統稱《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案，載明信用風險、市場風險、信用估值調整風險及業務操作風險的新監管處理方法，並引入出項下限規定，以及優化槓桿比率框架。經過2022年的多輪業界諮詢後，金管局計劃在2023年就《銀行業（資本）規則》（《資本規則》）的建議修訂進行法定諮詢，以實施上述各項規定及正值中性逆周期緩衝資本。有關修訂預計於同年內提交立法會進行先訂立後審議程序，並不早於2024年1月1日生效，作為最低要求。\n- 2022年12月《加密資產風險承擔的審慎處理方法》金管局計劃按照巴塞爾委員會的時間表，在2025年1月1日於本地實施有關標準，並打算於2023年就相關建議諮詢業界。\n\n# 風險承擔限度\n\n金管局於2023年3月就《銀行業（風險承擔限度）規則》的建議修訂諮詢業界。有關建議修訂主要是因應金管局實施上文提及的《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案下的經修訂資本標準而提出。諮詢文件亦包括就《資本規則》下有關官方實體集中風險的處理方法所作出的其他相應修訂。經修訂規則的目標實施日期將與落實《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案的經修訂《資本規則》中的信用風險部分的實施日期一致（即不早於2024年1月1日）。\n\n# 流動性標準\n\n金管局擬於2023年諮詢業界有關透過《2023年銀行業（流動性）（修訂）規則》（《2023年流動性修訂規則》）對《銀行業（流動性）規則》作出的建議修訂。相關修訂是因應同時期的《資本規則》建議修訂而作出，所以《2023年流動性修訂規則》的目標實施日期將與落實《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案的經修訂《資本規則》中的信用風險部分的實施日期一致（即不早於2024年1月1日）。\n\n# 披露標準\n\n《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案中與經修訂資本標準相關的新的及經修訂的披露規定，主要載於巴塞爾委員會分別於2018年12月及2021年11月發出的《第三支柱1 披露規定 — 更新框架》及《修訂市場風險披露規定》。巴塞爾委員會亦於2019年6月發出《修訂槓桿比率披露規定》，藉修訂槓桿比率的披露規定處理對潛在「粉飾櫥窗」（指銀行在報告日期前後減少某些交易的交易量，從而人為地提高報告及公開披露的槓桿比率）的關注。為在香港實施上述新的及經修訂的披露規定，金管局亦正擬備《銀行業（披露）規則》（《披露規則》）的相應修訂，以及經修訂後的標準披露模版及表格，並在過程中徵詢業界意見。預計《披露規則》的修訂將於2023年內連同《資本規則》的修訂一併提交立法會進行先訂立後審議程序。\n", "en": "# Key Work Areas and Outlook for 2023\n\nAlthough signs of economic recovery emerged in Hong Kong at the beginning of 2023, the external environment remains challenging and uncertain. Recently, pressures on the banking sector in the United States and Europe, including the collapse of certain U.S. regional banks in March 2023, have created a ripple effect in global financial markets. The tightening of monetary policy by major central banks is likely to slow global economic growth or even lead to a recession in 2023. Meanwhile, ongoing geopolitical tensions and the threat of deglobalization may continue to drag on global trade and cause periodic volatility in international financial markets. Nevertheless, Hong Kong’s financial system, with its robust resilience and ample buffers built up over the years, possesses sufficient capacity to withstand adverse shocks.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) attaches great importance to safeguarding monetary and financial stability. Looking ahead, in the face of an uncertain macroeconomic environment, the HKMA will remain vigilant, strive to promptly identify emerging risks, and respond flexibly. At the same time, the HKMA will continue to seize opportunities and create policy space to further enhance Hong Kong’s status as a major international financial center. In a challenging investment environment, the HKMA will continue to adopt a prudent investment approach in managing the Exchange Fund, while maintaining sufficient flexibility to take defensive measures as needed and ensuring high liquidity.\n\n# Maintaining a Stable and Sound Financial System\n\nThe global economic outlook remains subject to significant uncertainties. The HKMA will closely monitor the latest developments, heighten its alertness, and guard against various potential risks to maintain the stability and soundness of the financial system. This is a prerequisite for the continued provision of critical financial services and, therefore, the lifeline for the normal functioning of Hong Kong’s economy.\n\n# Remaining Vigilant Against Potential Risks\n\nIn 2023, uncertainties regarding the future path of U.S. interest rates and pressures in the banking systems of advanced economies may pose downside risks to the growth prospects of major advanced economies. In addition, persistent geopolitical risks may continue to drag on global trade and cause periodic volatility in international financial markets. However, Hong Kong’s financial system, with its resilience and buffers built up over the years, has sufficient capacity to withstand adverse shocks. The HKMA also has the capability, resources, and determination to maintain Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nThe HKMA will continue to closely monitor risks and vulnerabilities in both the domestic and external environments and will take appropriate measures as needed to maintain the stability of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial system. The HKMA will also study issues affecting Hong Kong’s economy and assess the potential risks associated with these issues.\n\n# Maintaining Banking System Stability\n\nGiven the escalation of geopolitical tensions and significant interest rate hikes by major central banks to curb inflation, the operating environment for the banking sector is expected to remain challenging in 2023. On the other hand, rapid technological development and digitalization present both risks and opportunities for the banking industry. In the face of an ever-changing financial environment, the HKMA is committed to ensuring that banks have sufficient capacity to withstand shocks through ongoing supervisory efforts. At the same time, the HKMA will continue to strengthen and enhance the banking supervisory framework and policies with reference to international standards and best practices.\n\n# Risk-Based Supervisory Focus\n\n# Credit, Liquidity, and Market Risks\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA will continue to closely monitor the asset quality of authorized institutions, focusing on their loan classification and provisioning practices, as well as the management of borrowers in weaker financial positions. The HKMA will also strengthen its monitoring systems and take proactive measures to ensure that the overall credit risk level of the banking system remains manageable.\n\nOn the other hand, the HKMA will continue to monitor the operating environment of corporates and maintain close communication with the banking sector and the business community to prepare for the eventual exit from the \"Pre-approved Principal Moratorium\" scheme, while ensuring that customers facing temporary difficulties continue to receive appropriate credit support.\n\nIn addition, in light of the uncertain macroeconomic environment, the HKMA will also strengthen its supervision of the liquidity and market risk management of authorized institutions in 2023.\n\n# Operational and Technology Risks\n\nAs banks increasingly adopt technology in their operations, the HKMA is committed to enhancing the operational resilience and cyber defense capabilities of the banking sector. Following the issuance of the new \"Operational Resilience\" module of the Supervisory Policy Manual in May, the HKMA will maintain close engagement with the industry to review the progress of authorized institutions in developing operational resilience frameworks. At the same time, the HKMA will enhance the cyber defense capabilities of the banking sector by following up on issues identified in the \"Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0\" and reviewing the progress of authorized institutions in implementing robust triple data backup.\n\nWith the acceleration of digitalization, other supervisory priorities of the HKMA include strengthening the supervision of banks’ third-party service provider risk management and enhancing the data governance capabilities of the banking sector.\n\n# Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing\n\nIn 2023, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will focus on updating regulatory information, strengthening collaboration among stakeholders in the anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML/CFT) ecosystem to address money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF) risks, and further promoting the development of AML regulatory technology and compliance technology. The HKMA’s “Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism” will also be revised, with specific guidance to be issued on adopting risk-proportionate measures for politically exposed persons (PEPs), thereby facilitating the industry’s effective and risk-based implementation of major legislative amendments. At the same time, the HKMA will expand the scope of existing public-private partnerships to enhance information sharing, and support the launch of an information sharing platform among banks to accelerate the detection of suspicious accounts, prevent account misuse, and strengthen the protection of scam victims and assist them in recovering losses. Through the “AML Compliance Technology Laboratory” and other AML compliance technology initiatives, the HKMA will further focus on promoting the adoption of compliance technology (including data analytics), and is committed to developing macro-analytical capabilities to support its data-driven AML supervisory work. By implementing the above measures, the HKMA will be able to respond more swiftly to systemic ML risks such as mule account networks, and flexibly address the ever-evolving threats.\n\n# Wealth Management Business\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA will strengthen both on-site examinations and off-site monitoring of the conduct of authorized institutions in wealth management, as well as in the sale of securities, Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) products, and other investment and insurance products. Key areas of focus for 2023 will include the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect scheme, digital distribution and advisory platforms, virtual assets, environmental, social and governance (ESG) investment products, and long-term insurance products. In this process, the HKMA will take into account the latest market developments and revisions to international standards.\n\nThe HKMA will also maintain close communication with other regulatory authorities and the banking sector, and will provide guidance to authorized institutions on regulatory standards for the sale of investment, insurance, and MPF products as needed, including guidance on the provision of virtual asset-related investment services. To promote the sustainable and responsible development of the virtual asset industry, the HKMA will actively participate in relevant international organizations and work with the government and other financial regulators to develop a comprehensive regulatory framework for virtual assets.\n\nWith the successful launch of the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect, the HKMA will engage with the industry and relevant regulatory authorities to optimize the scheme. In addition, the HKMA will collaborate with the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the industry to streamline investment product sales processes (including those applicable to professional investors), and will begin supervising the trust business of authorized institutions in accordance with new modules and codes of practice under the relevant Supervisory Policy Manual.\n\n# Supervision of Financial Market Infrastructure\n\nThe HKMA aims to promote the safety and efficiency of the financial market infrastructures it supervises in accordance with the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (the “Payment Ordinance”), the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (the “PFMI”), and various guidelines issued by the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures. Where necessary, the HKMA will assess infrastructures with reference to the latest international standards. The HKMA will participate in the monitoring and assessment program for the implementation of the PFMI by the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures and the International Organization of Securities Commissions, and will also participate in the work of international standard-setting bodies, strengthening its own supervisory requirements in line with international practices or in response to market and technological developments. Where necessary, the HKMA will also cooperate with relevant authorities to further enhance cooperative oversight arrangements.\n\n# Policy Development\n\nThe HKMA will continue to strengthen and optimize the banking regulatory framework and policies in accordance with international standards and best practices.\n\n# Implementation of Basel Standards in Hong Kong\n\n# Capital Standards\n\nThe HKMA will further enhance the capital framework by implementing standards recently issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the “Basel Committee”), including:\n- The revised capital standards set out in the December 2017 “Basel III: Finalising post-crisis reforms,” the January 2019 (revised in February 2019) “Minimum capital requirements for market risk,” and the July 2020 “Targeted revisions to the credit valuation adjustment risk framework”—collectively referred to as the final Basel III reform package. These standards specify new regulatory approaches for credit risk, market risk, credit valuation adjustment risk, and operational risk, introduce output floor requirements, and enhance the leverage ratio framework. Following multiple rounds of industry consultation in 2022, the HKMA plans to conduct statutory consultation in 2023 on proposed amendments to the Banking (Capital) Rules (the “Capital Rules”) to implement the above requirements and the countercyclical capital buffer at a neutral level. The relevant amendments are expected to be submitted to the Legislative Council within the same year for the negative vetting procedure, and will take effect no earlier than 1 January 2024 as minimum requirements.\n- The December 2022 “Prudential treatment of cryptoasset exposures.” The HKMA plans to implement these standards locally in accordance with the Basel Committee’s timeline on 1 January 2025, and intends to consult the industry on the relevant proposals in 2023.\n\n# Large Exposures Limit\n\nIn March 2023, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) consulted the industry on proposed amendments to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules. The main purpose of these proposed amendments is to align with the revised capital standards under the final Basel III reform package, as mentioned above. The consultation paper also includes other corresponding amendments regarding the treatment of sovereign concentration risk under the Capital Rules. The target implementation date for the revised rules will coincide with the implementation date of the credit risk component of the revised Capital Rules under the final Basel III reform package (i.e., no earlier than 1 January 2024).\n\n# Liquidity Standards\n\nThe HKMA intends to consult the industry in 2023 on proposed amendments to the Banking (Liquidity) Rules through the Banking (Liquidity) (Amendment) Rules 2023 (the \"2023 Liquidity Amendment Rules\"). These amendments are being made in response to the proposed amendments to the Capital Rules during the same period. Therefore, the target implementation date for the 2023 Liquidity Amendment Rules will coincide with the implementation date of the credit risk component of the revised Capital Rules under the final Basel III reform package (i.e., no earlier than 1 January 2024).\n\n# Disclosure Standards\n\nThe new and revised disclosure requirements related to the revised capital standards under the final Basel III reform package are mainly set out in the Basel Committee's \"Pillar 3 disclosure requirements — updated framework\" issued in December 2018 and \"Revised market risk disclosure requirements\" issued in November 2021. The Basel Committee also issued the \"Revised leverage ratio disclosure requirements\" in June 2019, which address concerns about potential \"window dressing\" (i.e., banks reducing the volume of certain transactions around reporting dates to artificially inflate reported and publicly disclosed leverage ratios) by revising the leverage ratio disclosure requirements. To implement these new and revised disclosure requirements in Hong Kong, the HKMA is preparing corresponding amendments to the Banking (Disclosure) Rules (the \"Disclosure Rules\"), as well as revised standard disclosure templates and forms, and is consulting the industry in the process.

Accordingly, the HKMA is committed to upholding a high standard of institutional governance.\n\nTo realize its commitment to good institutional governance, the HKMA:\n- Has established a clear and highly accountable governance framework;\n- Implements comprehensive and robust control measures to manage risks, ensuring that the conduct and daily operations of staff at all levels meet prescribed standards; and\n- Adopts a policy of transparency and openness, maintaining close contact with all stakeholders.\n\n# The HKMA and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government\n\nThe HKMA forms part of the structure of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government, but is able to employ staff on terms different from those of civil servants, in order to attract talent with the appropriate experience and specialized knowledge. The Chief Executive of the HKMA and its staff are public officers. The HKMA enjoys a high degree of autonomy in its day-to-day operations within the statutory powers conferred upon or delegated to the Monetary Authority.\n\nThe Financial Secretary is responsible for determining Hong Kong’s monetary policy objectives and monetary system. In a letter dated 25 June 2003 to the Monetary Authority, the Financial Secretary stipulated that monetary stability should be maintained through the Currency Board system, keeping the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate at around HK$7.80 to US$1. The Monetary Authority is responsible for achieving the monetary policy objectives, including determining the relevant strategies, instruments, and means of implementation, and for maintaining the stability and soundness of Hong Kong’s monetary system.\n\nWith the assistance of the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, the Financial Secretary is responsible for policies to maintain the stability and soundness of Hong Kong’s financial system and to maintain Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre. To implement these policies, the duties of the Monetary Authority include:\n- Promoting the overall stability and effective operation of the banking system;\n- Cooperating with other relevant institutions and organizations to develop the debt market;\n- Handling matters relating to the issuance and circulation of legal tender notes and coins;\n- Promoting the safety and efficiency of financial infrastructure by developing payment, clearing, and settlement systems, and, where appropriate, operating such systems; and\n- Cooperating with other relevant institutions and organizations to foster confidence in Hong Kong’s currency and financial system, and implementing appropriate market development measures to help enhance the international competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial services.\n\nThe Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary. The Monetary Authority is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund, in accordance with powers delegated by the Financial Secretary.\n\n# Accountability and Transparency\n\nThe HKMA maintains a high degree of autonomy in its daily operations and in the methods adopted to implement government policy objectives, while at the same time ensuring a high level of accountability and transparency.\n\nThe HKMA is committed to promoting monetary and banking system stability, effectively managing official reserves, and developing and overseeing a robust and diversified financial infrastructure, thereby consolidating Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre and supporting the city’s economic development.\n\nTo effectively discharge its responsibilities, the HKMA must earn the trust of the community. Therefore, the HKMA takes a rigorous approach to fulfilling its responsibility to explain its policies and work to the public, and strives to address matters of public concern that fall within its remit. In particular, the HKMA clarifies misinformation and rumors about its policies in a timely manner through both traditional and social media.\n\nThe Monetary Authority is appointed by the Financial Secretary, and thus the HKMA is accountable to the public through the Financial Secretary. As the HKMA’s powers are established by laws enacted by the Legislative Council, the HKMA is also accountable to the public through the Legislative Council. The HKMA also recognizes its broader responsibility to promote public understanding of its role and objectives, and to closely monitor issues of public concern. In carrying out its daily work and maintaining extensive engagement with the community, the HKMA is committed to enhancing transparency and maintaining an open policy. This policy has two main objectives:\n- To ensure, subject to statutory restrictions on the disclosure of market-sensitive, commercial, and confidential information, that the financial sector and the public are as fully informed as possible about the HKMA’s work; and\n- To keep a finger on the pulse of society and respond appropriately to public views.\n\nThe HKMA strives to achieve the highest international standards of transparency. In addition to maintaining extensive contact with the media, it publishes a range of periodicals and special publications in both Chinese and English. The HKMA’s bilingual website (www.hkma.gov.hk) features dedicated sections on economic research, statistics, supervisory resources, consumer information, and other topics, as well as a wealth of HKMA publications, press releases, speeches, and briefing materials. The HKMA also utilizes social media platforms to communicate more effectively with the public in the digital age. The HKMA Information Centre, comprising a library and an exhibition area, is open to the public six days a week. For details of the HKMA’s communication and engagement with the public, please refer to the chapter on \"Institutional Functions\" (pages 157–162).\n\nThe frequency and detail of the HKMA’s disclosure of Exchange Fund and Currency Board accounts have been progressively increased. Since 1999, the HKMA has participated in the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard for central banks. The HKMA also publishes the minutes of the Currency Board Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, as well as reports on the operation of the Currency Board system. Since 1996, the HKMA website has provided access to banking supervision policies and guidelines.\n\nThe relationship between the HKMA and the Legislative Council is crucial for enhancing accountability and transparency. The Chief Executive of the HKMA has committed to briefing the Legislative Council Panel on Financial Affairs three times a year on the HKMA’s various activities and policies, and to responding to related enquiries. In addition, HKMA representatives attend meetings of the Legislative Council’s panels and subcommittees from time to time to explain and discuss specific issues, as well as to assist members in scrutinizing bills.\n\n# Control Measures\n\nThe HKMA adopts robust and effective internal and external control mechanisms to ensure a high standard of staff conduct, prudent risk management, and appropriate checks and balances. Internal and external audit functions provide independent assessments of whether these control mechanisms are adequate and effective.\n\n# Code of Conduct\n\nThe Code of Conduct provides guidance on the ethical and legal responsibilities of staff, ensuring that the conduct of employees at all levels meets the prescribed standards.\n\n# Internal Controls\n\n# Operational Controls\n\nAs the first line of defense in risk management, all departments and divisions are responsible for assessing the risks in their workflows and establishing appropriate control measures to ensure the secure and reliable daily operations of the HKMA.\n\n# Institutional Risk Management\n\nRisk management is also conducted at the institutional level. The Risk Committee, chaired by the Chief Executive of the HKMA, is one of the cornerstones of the institution’s risk management framework.\n\nThe Risk Committee reviews and discusses potential and emerging risks identified by various departments, as well as the adequacy of related control measures and mitigation strategies, and determines appropriate follow-up actions.\n\n# Internal Audit\n\nThe Internal Audit Division of the HKMA independently assesses whether the governance procedures, risk management, and control measures of different departments are adequate and effective, and makes recommendations for improvement.\n\n# External Audit\n\nAccording to Section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the financial statements of the Exchange Fund are audited by the Audit Commission of the Hong Kong SAR Government. The Audit Commission does not charge a fee for this service. The audited financial statements of the Exchange Fund are published in the HKMA’s Annual Report."}

The labour market deteriorated for a period before gradually improving, while inflation remained moderate. Asset markets also came under pressure. Benefiting from the full resumption of cross-border travel between the Mainland and Hong Kong, economic growth in Hong Kong is expected to recover from its trough in 2023.\n\n# Economic Review\n\n# Real Economic Activity\n\nDragged down by various adverse domestic and external factors, Hong Kong’s economy contracted by 3.5% in 2022 (Table 1 and Chart 1). Domestically, the outbreak of the fifth wave of COVID-19 in Hong Kong led to a sharp decline in private consumption in the first quarter. Subsequently, private consumption recorded quarter-on-quarter growth again, benefiting from the gradual relaxation of social distancing measures and the government’s consumption voucher scheme. Under weak business sentiment and tightening financial conditions, overall investment expenditure fell significantly compared to 2021. Externally, as external demand weakened and cross-border land freight between the Mainland and Hong Kong was disrupted, Hong Kong’s goods exports slumped. Service exports remained generally weak, partly reflecting subdued inbound tourism activities. However, the situation improved somewhat in the fourth quarter after the government lifted mandatory quarantine requirements for arrivals in late September.\n\nChart 1: Contributions of Components to Real GDP Growth\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\nTable 1: Real GDP Growth by Expenditure Component (Quarter-on-Quarter Comparison)\nNote: Seasonally adjusted quarter-on-quarter changes in gross domestic fixed capital formation are not specified.\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\n# Inflation\n\nLocal inflationary pressures edged up slightly in 2022 but remained moderate. Specifically, the underlying year-on-year inflation rate gradually rose to a moderate level of 2% in December. The impact of elevated external energy and food prices was partly offset by mild local cost pressures, especially the softness in housing rents (Chart 2). In addition, amid weak economic activity, nominal wage growth and commercial property rents remained subdued, which also helped contain inflation. For the year as a whole, the underlying and headline inflation rates were 1.7% and 1.9%, respectively.\n\n# Labour Market\n\nThe labour market deteriorated rapidly at the beginning of 2022 due to the pandemic, but subsequently continued to improve. The unemployment rate rose to a high of 5.4% in April before falling significantly to 3.5% in December (Chart 3), with most sectors recording declines in unemployment rates. Total employment (Chart 3) and private sector job vacancies rebounded, reflecting a gradual recovery in overall labour demand, although total employment remained below pre-pandemic levels. The year-on-year growth in nominal wages and labour income also accelerated slightly. On the other hand, compared with the same period last year, the labour force in December decreased slightly by 1.5%, partly due to a slight decline in the labour force participation rate.\n\nChart 2: Underlying Consumer Price Inflation\nSource: Census and Statistics Department and HKMA staff estimates\n\nChart 3: Labour Market Conditions\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\n# Stock Market\n\nHong Kong’s stock market experienced significant volatility in 2022. Continuing the downward trend from 2021, the Hang Seng Index accelerated its decline, closing at 14,687 points on 31 October 2022, the lowest level since 2009 (Chart 4). The sharp market correction was initially triggered by heightened concerns over the local COVID-19 outbreak, US interest rate hikes, and the Russia-Ukraine situation. Subsequently, the tightening of global financial conditions and the COVID-19 outbreak in the Mainland, which worsened the global economic outlook, further amplified the market correction. The stock market regained some upward momentum in the last two months of the year, partly supported by the Mainland’s optimization of anti-epidemic measures. The Hang Seng Index closed at 19,781 points at year-end, representing a significant decline of 15.5% from the end of 2021, marking the third consecutive year of decline.\n\n# Property Market\n\nAmid tightening financial conditions and weak economic activity, the residential property market also came under pressure. Property prices fell by 15% in 2022 (Chart 4), while transaction volume shrank sharply by 39% to 45,050 cases, setting a new record low. Despite the decline in property prices, home affordability remained tight. The effective mortgage interest rate rose from about 1.6% to between 3.375% and 3.625% during the year, increasing the mortgage repayment burden for homeowners. The non-residential property market also softened further. With vacancy rates remaining high, prices declined and rents remained subdued.\n\nChart 4: Asset Prices\nSource: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited\n\n# Economic Outlook\n\n# Economic Environment\n\nBenefiting from the full resumption of cross-border travel between Mainland China and Hong Kong, Hong Kong’s economic growth in 2023 is expected to recover from its low point. Although the anticipated slowdown in advanced economies will continue to weigh on Hong Kong’s goods exports, the recovery of the Mainland economy and the removal of cross-border land freight restrictions should provide support to the local economy. The full reopening of the border between Mainland China and Hong Kong is also expected to significantly benefit inbound tourism and other service exports, as well as boost local business sentiment and capital expenditure. Private consumption is also expected to further improve as the labour market strengthens. The government forecasts that Hong Kong’s real GDP will record a significant increase in 2023, ranging from 3.5% to 5.5%. However, the outlook for Hong Kong’s economic growth remains subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and will largely depend on the policy interest rate trajectory of the US Federal Reserve, global growth prospects, ongoing geopolitical tensions, and the pace of recovery in inbound tourism.\n\n# Inflation and Labour Market\n\nLooking ahead, local inflation is expected to rise slightly but should remain moderate as various factors offset each other. Although external prices are likely to remain elevated, the momentum for further increases may weaken as economic activity slows in some major economies and upward pressure on commodity prices eases. Similarly, with the local economic recovery and improvement in the labour market, local cost pressures may rise slightly, but the softness in housing rents should continue to offset some of this impact. The government forecasts that the overall and underlying inflation rates for 2023 will be 2.9% and 2.5%, respectively. On the other hand, labour market conditions are expected to further improve as local economic activity normalizes.\n\n# Performance of the Banking System\n\nIn 2022, Hong Kong’s banking system faced a challenging macroeconomic environment, including the outbreak of the fifth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic at the beginning of the year, heightened geopolitical tensions, and significant interest rate hikes by major central banks in response to rising inflation. Despite these challenges, Hong Kong banks coped well, maintaining strong capital and liquidity positions. The banking system faced increased credit risk during the year, but overall asset quality remained healthy. At the same time, rising interest rates boosted banks’ net interest income, though the positive impact was partially offset by increased provisions for bad and doubtful debts and a decline in fee and commission income. Overall, retail bank profitability improved compared to 2021.\n\n# Asset Quality\n\nThe classified loan ratio of the banking system rose from 0.89% at the end of 2021 to 1.38% at the end of 2022, while the overdue and restructured loan ratio increased from 0.56% to 0.85% over the same period (Figure 5). The classified loan ratio for Mainland China-related loans was 2.21% at the end of 2022, up from 0.89% at the end of 2021. The increase in the classified loan ratio was mainly due to the downgrading of loans to certain Mainland property developers. Nevertheless, banks’ provisioning remained adequate. As of the end of 2022, the loan loss coverage ratio (i.e., provisions to classified loans) was maintained at around 80%. If the realizable value of collateral is deducted from the balance of bad and doubtful debts, the loan loss coverage ratio is about 140%. On the other hand, the delinquency ratios for residential mortgage loans and credit card loans remained low at the end of 2022, at 0.06% and 0.23%, respectively (Figure 6).\n\nFigure 5 Asset Quality of the Banking System\nNote: Figures cover Hong Kong offices, overseas branches, and major overseas subsidiaries.\nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority\n\nFigure 6 Delinquency Ratios for Residential Mortgage Loans and Credit Card Loans\nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority\n\n# Profitability Trends\n\nThe banking system continued to record profits in 2022. During the year, the overall pre-tax operating profit of retail banks increased by 19.0% (Figure 7). The improvement in profitability was driven by increases in net interest income (+34%) and income from foreign exchange and derivatives (+72%), though part of the increase was offset by higher provisions for bad and doubtful debts (+151%) and a decrease in fee and commission income (–19%). In a rising interest rate environment, the net interest margin widened from 0.98% in the previous year to 1.31% in 2022 (Figure 8). Increased market volatility during the year also boosted banks’ income from foreign exchange and derivatives business. The increase in provisions for bad and doubtful debts was due to the need to set aside special provisions for new classified loans, while the weak performance of financial markets led to a decrease in fee and commission income. The cost-to-income ratio of retail banks fell from 54.7% in 2021 to 48.0% in 2022 (Figure 9).\n\nFigure 7 Performance of Retail Banks\nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority\n\nFigure 8 Net Interest Margin of Retail Banks\nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority\n\nFigure 9 Cost-to-Income Ratio of Retail Banks\nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority\n\n# Balance Sheet Trends\n\nIn 2022, the banking system’s balance sheet expanded by 2.5%. The increase in assets was due to the mark-to-market valuation gains on foreign exchange and derivatives positions. Amid external uncertainties and rising interest rates, loan demand weakened during the year. Compared to a 3.8% increase in 2021, total loans decreased by 3.0% in 2022. Loans for use outside Hong Kong fell by 10.2%, trade finance dropped by 13.5%, while loans for use in Hong Kong edged up by 0.9%. Mainland China-related loans, after growing by 3.7% in 2021, declined by 4.4% in 2022.\n\nOn the liabilities side of the balance sheet, the banking system continued to record moderate growth in deposits. Total deposits increased by 1.7% in 2022, compared to a 4.6% increase in 2021. As total loans decreased while total deposits increased, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio declined slightly from 71.8% at the end of 2021 to 68.5% at the end of 2022 (Figure 10).\n\n# Capital Adequacy Levels\n\nBanks maintained robust capital positions in 2022. At the end of 2022, the consolidated total capital ratio of locally incorporated authorized institutions stood at 20.1%, compared to 20.2% in the previous year; the Tier 1 capital ratio was 18.1% (Figure 11). Both ratios were well above the relevant international minimum requirements. The Basel III leverage ratio was 7.9% at the end of 2022 (Figure 12).\n\nFigure 10 Loans and Deposits of the Banking System\nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority\n\nFigure 11 Consolidated Capital Ratios of Locally Incorporated Authorized Institutions\nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority\n\nFigure 12 Consolidated Leverage Ratios of Locally Incorporated Authorized Institutions\nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority\n\n# Liquidity Position\n\nThe liquidity position of the banking system remained sound, serving as an important pillar amid heightened uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment. The quarterly average liquidity coverage ratio for Category 1 institutions was 162.3% in the fourth quarter of 2022, while the quarterly average liquidity maintenance ratio for Category 2 institutions was 63.2% (Figure 13). Customer deposits continued to be the main source of funding for the banking system. At the end of 2022, the net stable funding ratio for Category 1 institutions and the core funding ratio for Category 2A institutions were 137.7% and 155.7%, respectively (Figure 14). All four of the above ratios were well above the statutory minimum requirements.\n\nFigure 13 Liquidity Ratios of Designated Authorized Institutions\nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority\n\nFigure 14 Funding Ratios of Designated Authorized Institutions\nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority"}

Driven by increased trading activity in the local stock market and seasonal year-end funding demand, the Hong Kong dollar began to strengthen in mid-November. Under the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong interbank offered rates generally tracked the movements of US dollar interbank rates. Due to the continued interest rate hikes in the US, Hong Kong interbank rates gradually rose throughout 2022. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar foreign exchange and money markets remained stable, with smooth and orderly trading. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, the Linked Exchange Rate System has consistently demonstrated a strong ability to withstand external shocks.\n\n# Objective\n\nThe primary objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is to maintain monetary stability, that is, to ensure the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, keeping it within the range of HK$7.75 to HK$7.85 per US dollar in the foreign exchange market. This monetary regime mainly adopts a Currency Board System, which requires that the US dollar reserves held by the Exchange Fund provide at least 100% backing for the monetary base; any change in the monetary base must be matched by a corresponding change in US dollar reserves, maintaining a 100% link with changes in the monetary base.\n\nThe monetary base (Table 1) includes:\n- Certificates of Indebtedness (providing full backing for banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks);\n- Government-issued circulating notes and coins;\n- The aggregate balance of settlement accounts maintained with the HKMA (i.e., the Aggregate Balance); and\n- Exchange Fund Bills and Notes issued by the HKMA on behalf of the government.\n\nThe HKMA maintains the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate through the Automatic Interest Rate Adjustment Mechanism and its firm commitment to honoring the Convertibility Undertaking. When the strong-side (or weak-side) Convertibility Undertaking is triggered, the HKMA, upon banks’ requests, will sell Hong Kong dollars and buy US dollars at HK$7.75 per US dollar (or buy Hong Kong dollars and sell US dollars at HK$7.85 per US dollar), thereby increasing (or decreasing) the Aggregate Balance, causing Hong Kong dollar interest rates to fall (or rise), and thus guiding the exchange rate back to the HK$7.75–7.85 range.\n\n# Review of 2022\n\n# Exchange Rate Stability\n\nDriven by adjustments in the local stock market, market expectations of further US interest rate hikes, and carry trades arising from the negative interest rate spread between Hong Kong interbank rates and LIBOR, the Hong Kong dollar weakened at the beginning of 2022 and remained close to the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking level in subsequent months. The weak-side Convertibility Undertaking was triggered 41 times between May and November. Supported by increased trading activity in the local stock market and seasonal year-end funding demand, the Hong Kong dollar began to strengthen in mid-November (Figure 1). Overall, the Hong Kong dollar foreign exchange market continued to operate normally throughout 2022.\n\nTo meet the ongoing demand from banks for Exchange Fund Bills, the HKMA issued an additional HK$40 billion of Exchange Fund Bills at the beginning of 2022. In addition, between May and November 2022, in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System, the HKMA, upon banks’ requests, purchased a total of HK$242.1 billion at the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking rate. The Aggregate Balance decreased from HK$377.5 billion at the end of 2021 to HK$96.3 billion at the end of 2022, reflecting the impact of the additional issuance of Exchange Fund Bills and the triggering of the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking. Meanwhile, the outstanding amount of Exchange Fund Bills and Notes increased slightly from HK$1,148.8 billion to HK$1,200.4 billion during the year. As a result, the sum of the Aggregate Balance and the outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and Notes decreased from HK$1,526.3 billion at the end of 2021 to HK$1,296.7 billion at the end of 2022 (Figure 2). The overall monetary base continued to be fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\nFigure 1: Market Exchange Rate in 2022\n\nFigure 2: Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window activities) and Outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and Notes in 2022\n\n# Money Market\n\nUnder the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong interbank offered rates generally tracked the movements of US dollar interbank rates. As the US continued to raise interest rates in 2022, Hong Kong interbank rates gradually increased (Figure 3). Over the year, overnight, 1-month, and 3-month HIBOR rose by 318, 419, and 473 basis points respectively, reaching 3.23%, 4.35%, and 4.99% at year-end.\n\nIn response to the upward adjustment of the US federal funds target range, the Base Rate was raised seven times, by a total of 4.25 percentage points (i.e., 425 basis points), from 0.5% to 4.75% (Figure 3). At the retail level, following the US policy rate hikes, several banks raised their prime lending rates by 12.5 basis points in late September, by a further 25 basis points in early November, and by another 25 basis points in mid-December. Some banks also raised the cap on new mortgage rates based on HIBOR during the year. Overall, the Hong Kong money market continued to operate normally. Discount Window borrowing increased from HK$6.8 billion in 2021 to HK$8.4 billion in 2022.\n\nFigure 3: Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates in 2022\n\n# Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nFor nearly 40 years, the Linked Exchange Rate System has been a vital pillar of Hong Kong’s financial system, demonstrating a strong capacity to respond to challenges. Despite the volatile global financial environment in 2022, the Hong Kong dollar’s foreign exchange and money markets continued to operate in an orderly manner, reflecting the robustness and effectiveness of the Linked Exchange Rate System. The government remains firmly committed to maintaining the system. In its 2022 External Sector Report, the International Monetary Fund reiterated that Hong Kong possesses transparent rules, substantial fiscal and foreign exchange reserves, robust financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy, and a prudent fiscal framework, all of which ensure the credibility of the Linked Exchange Rate System.\n\nA sound banking system is crucial to the normal operation of the Linked Exchange Rate System. Hong Kong’s banking sector continued to function smoothly, with liquidity and capital positions remaining very strong by international standards. To ensure that the banking system is resilient to shocks, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has been closely monitoring banks’ credit, liquidity, and interest rate risk management, as well as the results of stress tests, and maintains supervision over bank lending.\n\nTo enhance the transparency of the Currency Board accounts, since October 1998, a portion of the Exchange Fund’s assets has been designated to back the monetary base. The Backing Ratio (i.e., the ratio of backing assets to the monetary base) fluctuated between 109.3% and 111.0% in 2022, without reaching either the upper or lower limits. As of December 31, the ratio stood at 110.1% (see Chart 4). Under the Linked Exchange Rate System, although certain Exchange Fund assets are designated as the backing portfolio, all assets of the Exchange Fund can be used to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. The substantial fiscal resources of the Exchange Fund, together with Hong Kong’s robust banking system, provide a strong backing for safeguarding Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nChart 4 Daily Movements of the Backing Ratio in 2022\n\n# Currency Board Committee\n\nThe Currency Board Committee, under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, is responsible for monitoring and discussing issues related to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. In 2022, topics considered by the Committee included the Mainland China property market, the role of non-bank institutions in the residential mortgage market, the application of deep learning in credit risk assessment, and a monitoring framework for assessing Hong Kong dollar liquidity. The minutes of the Committee’s meetings and the HKMA’s reports on the operation of the Currency Board System submitted to the Committee are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Banknotes and Coins\n\n# Hong Kong Banknotes\n\nThe HKMA continued to organize seminars to educate bank counter staff, retail cashiers, and students on the design and anti-counterfeiting features of Hong Kong banknotes, enhancing their knowledge and skills in banknote authentication. In 2022, the HKMA held a total of 15 seminars, attracting over 4,200 participants.\n\n# Coin Collection Programme\n\nThe Coin Collection Programme continued to be well received by the public. Details of the programme are provided in the chapter \"Sustainable HKMA\" of the 2022 Sustainability Report.\n\n# Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\n\nThe Exchange Fund Bills and Notes Programme continued to operate smoothly. To meet the ongoing demand from banks for Exchange Fund Bills and in view of market conditions, the HKMA issued an additional HK$40 billion of Exchange Fund Bills in the first two months of 2022, resulting in a corresponding decrease in the Aggregate Balance. As at the end of 2022, the nominal outstanding amount of Exchange Fund Bills and Notes was approximately HK$1,207.5 billion (see Table 2).\n\nTable 2 Outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\n\n# Monetary Research\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (the Institute) completed three policy research reports, published 24 research papers, and organized 16 seminars/webinars, covering monetary and financial research topics of strategic importance to Hong Kong and the region. The Institute also made further arrangements to disseminate research findings through a new open-access e-journal, enabling a wider audience to access relevant information. In addition, the Institute launched a new publication series, \"Insights from Monetary Research Digest,\" on its website, providing the public with high-level, non-technical summaries of its recent research findings.\n\nIn addition to research outputs, the Institute organized two international conferences and three online expert seminars to promote dialogue and exchange on economic and financial affairs:\n\n- On April 12, co-hosted an online seminar with the Academy of Finance on \"Latest Macroeconomic Developments, US Federal Reserve’s Monetary Policy Tightening, and the Development of the Offshore RMB Market,\" featuring former HKMA Chief Executive Joseph Yam and Professor Huang Yiping, Deputy Dean and Chair Professor of Economics at the National School of Development, Peking University, as guest speakers. The seminar was broadcast live on multiple platforms, attracting a total of 840,000 online viewers in real time.\n\n- On June 24, held an online seminar on \"Transformation and Policy Choices in China’s Real Estate Industry,\" featuring Ms. Qin Hong, Senior Research Fellow at Renmin University of China and former Director of the Policy Research Center, Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, as guest speaker, and Dr. Wang Tao, Head of Asia Economic Research and Chief China Economist at UBS, as moderator. The seminar attracted nearly 1.13 million real-time online viewers from Mainland China, Hong Kong, and other parts of the world.\n\n- On August 25, co-hosted an online workshop with the Asian Development Bank and the Bank for International Settlements on the theme of \"Spillover Effects of Monetary Policy,\" with over 200 experts and scholars from central banks, international financial organizations, and academia around the world participating online.\n\n- As a side event of the International Financial Leaders' Investment Summit, an online seminar entitled \"Post-COVID-19 Inflation: Inevitable or Avoidable?\" was co-organized with the Academy of Finance on November 2. Dr. John Greenwood, founder and chief economist of International Monetary Watch and former chief economist at Invesco, was invited to provide an analysis. Nearly 200 economists participated in the seminar online.\n\n- The 12th Annual China Economic International Conference was held on November 23, with the theme \"A New Stage in China's Economic Development.\" Dr. Wang Yiming, Vice Chairman and Director of the Academic Committee of the China Center for International Economic Exchanges, delivered a keynote speech on the short- and long-term prospects of China's economy.

{"zh": "# 銀行體系穩定\n\n儘管宏觀環境充滿不確定性及挑戰，加上金融市場異常波動，香港銀行體系於2022年維持穩健。年內金管局亦加強對認可機構信用及市場風險管理的監管。此外，鑑於網絡威脅持續增加及銀行業數碼轉型步伐加快，金管局與認可機構緊密合作，提升認可機構的運作穩健性及網絡防衛能力。\n\n操守監管方面，金管局加強有關「先買後付」產品的消費者保障，並就物業轉按交易提供多一種支付安排。金管局又與其他監管機構合作，就虛擬資產的可持續發展制定監管架構，精簡投資產品銷售程序，以及推出全新的信託業務監管制度。年內有關個人信貸資料的「多間信貸資料服務機構」模式下的「信貸資料平台」啟用，並推出新的強制性背景查核計劃，以應對「滾動的壞蘋果」現象。此外，面對因疫情而實施的旅遊限制，金管局協助推出便利措施讓客戶重新啟動銀行戶口。\n\n因應最新的香港洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險評估，金管局與銀行透過公私營夥伴合作（包括反訛騙及洗黑錢情報工作組），鞏固香港的打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集生態圈，以及加強應對騙案。此外，金管局亦與策略夥伴合作，以能更充分了解及有效管理日益複雜的地緣政治環境所帶來的風險及不穩定因素。金管局又透過「反洗錢合規科技實驗室」系列進一步推動業界運用數據及科技，並同時加快金管局在反洗錢工作中採用監管科技的步伐。在國際事務方面，金管局積極參與財務行動特別組織的工作。\n\n在2022年，本地就有關資本充足標準及披露標準等國際監管標準的實施上取得良好進展。此外，金管局亦大力提升業界的軟實力，包括與銀行業合作建立可持續的人才儲備，以及提升現有從業員的技能。年內金管局一直與銀行業緊密合作，改進及精簡監管政策與程序。\n\n金管局亦繼續致力推進在本地及國際層面的工作，以確保香港備有具公信力的處置機制。具體工作包括制定新處置標準；進行地區危機模擬演習，以及在所有具本地系統重要性銀行建立一層新的吸收虧損能力資源，標誌着金管局在提升處置可行性上立下里程碑。\n\n# 目標\n\n金管局的整體目標之一是促進銀行體系的安全及穩定。要達致這個目標，實有賴建立及維持具高度應對能力且能為香港經濟提供所需關鍵金融服務的金融體系。\n\n銀行可能因營運方式，甚或在極端情況下因失序地倒閉而影響銀行體系的穩定。作為監管當局，金融管理專員在保障金融穩定方面擔當重要角色，確保銀行有能力抵禦衝擊及應對危機恢復常態，以最終有助防止出現倒閉。金融管理專員負責對銀行進行審慎監管，以及認可香港的持牌銀行、有限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司（統稱「認可機構」）。\n\n香港的審慎監管制度並非為確保「零風險」而設。作為其中一個處置機制當局，金融管理專員力求確保一旦有認可機構不再可持續經營，能有秩序地處理其倒閉。為此，香港已設立金融機構處置機制，金融管理專員在該機制下為認可機構（以及其他類型機構）的處置機制當局。為落實香港的處置機制，有必要制定處置規則及政策標準、進行處置規劃以排除認可機構處置可行性的障礙，以及建立金管局處置瀕臨倒閉認可機構的運作能力。為有效執行上述工作，金管局採納與國際一致及協調的方法。\n\n金融管理專員亦負責指定及監察某些金融市場基建。金管局監察金融市場基建的目的，是促進有關基建的整體安全及效率、控制系統性風險，以及提高透明度。提升金融市場基建的抗震能力，能保障香港的貨幣與金融體系，避免因金融市場基建運作中斷而可能影響其穩定。\n\n# 2022年回顧\n\n# 牌照事宜\n\n年內金管局核准6個境外交易平台成為貨幣經紀，另有5間持牌銀行及1間有限制牌照銀行被撤銷認可資格。\n\n有關香港的認可機構及本地代表辦事處的更多資訊，請參閱分別載於第283至286頁及第292至295頁的附錄及表D至F。\n\n# 監管工作概覽\n\n在2022年金管局共進行183次非現場審查，涵蓋範圍甚廣，包括認可機構的CAMEL評估、企業管治、風險管理及採用金融科技的情況。為繼續加強認可機構的風險管治水平，金管局與認可機構董事局、獨立非執行董事或董事局轄下委員會共舉行36次會議，並與認可機構及其外聘核數師共舉行38次三方聯席會議。\n\n除了非現場審查工作外，金管局亦對認可機構的各項業務進行定期現場審查。從審慎監管角度而言，信用風險管理為主要監管重點之一。同時，由於銀行運用科技的情況日趨普及，業務操作風險及科技風險管理是另一個監管重點。隨着綠色及可持續銀行業在香港急速發展，金管局亦已進行一輪以氣候風險管理為重點的專題審查。在操守監管方面，金管局對認可機構的證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（強積金）相關業務進行現場審查，並以專題評估作為配合，以審視被評估為屬較高風險的範疇。\n\n表1載有金管局於2022年的監管工作概要。\n\n表1 監管工作概要\n\n# 信用風險\n\n# 信貸增長及資產質素\n\n2022年貸款總額減少3.0%，2021年則增加3.8%。表2列載各類貸款及墊款的增長情況。2022年內地相關貸款總額亦減少4.4%至45,220億港元（表3）。\n\n年內銀行體系受到來自各方面的挑戰和衝擊，包括第五波新冠疫情、地緣政治局勢升溫、主要央行進取的加息步伐及部分內地房地產發展商的財務狀況惡化等。儘管面對上述各種挑戰，銀行體系依然保持穩定及健全。\n\n銀行體系的資產質素在年內惡化，但仍然維持在健康水平。銀行業的特定分類貸款比率於2022年底為1.38%，高於2021年底的0.89%。內地相關貸款的特定分類貸款比率由一年前的0.89%上升至2.21%。\n\n年內金管局提升其風險監察的廣度與深度，並與認可機構緊密聯繫，以便對經濟及市場形勢，以至認可機構的風險管理措施及時作出評估。銀行體系面對的整體信用風險仍屬可控。金管局的償債壓力測試結果顯示，銀行體系繼續維持充足資本緩衝，能承受極端壓力。\n\n金管局在年內進行專題評估，檢視認可機構的信用風險管理，重點放在資產質素、對較易受影響行業的風險承擔、香港以外分行的信用風險，以及提供予私人銀行及財富管理客戶的有抵押貸款。\n\n另一方面，在充滿挑戰的宏觀經濟環境下，越來越多企業面對財政困難，金管局鼓勵認可機構按照《香港企業財務困難處理守則》所載的原則處理企業出現還款困難的情況，從而使個別認可機構能夠從有關貸款機構的共同利益角度出發協調合作。\n\n表3 內地相關貸款增長\n\n# 紓緩客戶的資金周轉壓力\n\n考慮到第五波新冠病毒疫情的打擊，加上外圍與本港經濟的前景仍然複雜多變，金管局聯同「銀行業中小企貸款協調機制」延長「預先批核還息不還本」計劃至2023年7月底。此外，該計劃亦推出及其後優化部分本金還款選項，協助客戶就最終回復正常還款作好準備。\n\n截至2022年底，銀行共批出108,000多宗企業客戶貸款展期及其他支援措施的個案，涉及金額超過1.1萬億港元。個人客戶方面，銀行亦批出81,000多宗住宅按揭還息不還本及其他個人應急貸款的個案，涉及金額超過650億港元。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n金管局自2009年起先後推出多輪逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施，已經加強銀行的風險管理及香港銀行體系抵禦本港樓市一旦逆轉的能力。新批出住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數於2022年12月為57%，而有關按揭成數於2009年9月推出首輪逆周期措施前為64%。新批出按揭的平均供款與入息比率維持在低水平，於2022年12月為39%，而在2010年8月首度推出有關比率上限時為41%（圖1）。\n\n金管局在9月將物業按揭貸款壓力測試的假設按揭利率上升幅度由300基點下調至200基點。金管局作出此決定時已考慮目前的利率環境，以及按揭息率走勢與其過往的長期平均水平。金管局認為此水平已經足夠確保銀行按揭業務風險得到妥善管理。\n\n圖1 新批出住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數及供款與入息比率\n\n# 業務操作及科技風險\n\n過去一年金管局推出多項措施加強銀行體系的運作穩健性。有關措施包括在5月發出《監管政策手冊》新單元「運作穩健性」，載明金管局預期認可機構為確保運作穩健而應維持的管治及管控架構，並舉辦兩場業界對話，增進業界對新標準的了解，以及促進業內的經驗交流（圖示1）。\n\n金管局又就銀行營運的具體範疇提供詳細監管指引，包括客戶資料保障、支付系統運作、雲端運算、支付卡保安及分散式阻斷服務攻擊防禦機制等。\n\n因應不斷轉變的網絡威脅，金管局透過推動銀行採納穩固三重數據備份安排、監察認可機構實施「網絡防衛評估框架」2.0的進度，以及評估銀行應對供應鏈攻擊的能力，力求提升銀行體系的網絡防衛能力。\n\n因應「網絡釣魚」騙案及其他網上詐騙的風險明顯增加，金管局與香港銀行公會（銀行公會）於9月聯合推出以「數碼KEY睇緊啲，撳LINK前要三思！」為主題的新一輪大型推廣活動，提高公眾的防範意識，又在7月與香港警務處合辦工作坊，向銀行講解騙徒的最新犯案手法。\n\n以「數碼KEY睇緊啲，撳LINK前要三思！」為主題的宣傳活動的海報\n\n圖示1 業界對話「邁向運作穩健之旅」\n\n# 流動性及市場風險\n\n面對主要經濟體進一步收緊貨幣政策導致市場波動加劇，金管局加強監察銀行的市場及流動性風險承擔。金管局進行審查，以檢視認可機構的流動性風險管理是否足夠，並聚焦於分散資金來源及集團內部流動性風險管理的制度及管控措施。此外，金管局亦進行審查，以評估認可機構的市場風險管理架構及財資業務管控措施的成效。\n", "en": "# Stability of the Banking System\n\nDespite uncertainties and challenges in the macroeconomic environment, coupled with abnormal volatility in financial markets, Hong Kong’s banking system remained robust in 2022. During the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) also strengthened its supervision of credit and market risk management for authorized institutions. Furthermore, in view of the persistent increase in cyber threats and the accelerating pace of digital transformation in the banking sector, the HKMA worked closely with authorized institutions to enhance their operational resilience and cyber defense capabilities.\n\nIn terms of conduct supervision, the HKMA strengthened consumer protection for \"Buy Now, Pay Later\" products and provided an additional payment arrangement for property refinancing transactions. The HKMA also collaborated with other regulatory bodies to establish a regulatory framework for the sustainable development of virtual assets, streamline the sales process for investment products, and launch a new regulatory regime for trust business. During the year, the \"Credit Data Platform\" under the \"Multiple Credit Reference Agencies\" model for personal credit data was launched, along with a new mandatory background check scheme to address the phenomenon of \"rolling bad apples.\" In addition, in response to travel restrictions imposed due to the pandemic, the HKMA facilitated measures to help customers reactivate their bank accounts.\n\nIn light of the latest assessment of Hong Kong’s money laundering and terrorist financing risks, the HKMA and banks, through public-private partnerships (including the Anti-Fraud and Anti-Money Laundering Intelligence Task Force), strengthened Hong Kong’s ecosystem for combating money laundering and terrorist financing, and enhanced responses to fraud. The HKMA also worked with strategic partners to better understand and effectively manage the risks and instabilities arising from an increasingly complex geopolitical environment. Through the \"AML Regtech Lab\" series, the HKMA further promoted the use of data and technology in the industry, while accelerating the adoption of regulatory technology in its own anti-money laundering efforts. Internationally, the HKMA actively participated in the work of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).\n\nIn 2022, significant progress was made locally in implementing international regulatory standards, such as capital adequacy and disclosure standards. In addition, the HKMA made substantial efforts to enhance the industry’s soft power, including collaborating with the banking sector to build a sustainable talent pool and upskilling existing practitioners. Throughout the year, the HKMA worked closely with the banking industry to improve and streamline regulatory policies and procedures.\n\nThe HKMA also continued to advance work at both local and international levels to ensure that Hong Kong has a credible resolution mechanism. Specific initiatives included formulating new resolution standards, conducting regional crisis simulation exercises, and establishing a new layer of loss-absorbing capacity resources at all locally systemically important banks, marking a milestone in enhancing the feasibility of resolution by the HKMA.\n\n# Objectives\n\nOne of the HKMA’s overall objectives is to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this goal relies on establishing and maintaining a highly resilient financial system capable of providing the critical financial services required by Hong Kong’s economy.\n\nBanks may affect the stability of the banking system through their operations, or, in extreme cases, by failing in a disorderly manner. As the regulatory authority, the Monetary Authority plays a vital role in safeguarding financial stability, ensuring that banks are able to withstand shocks and recover from crises, ultimately helping to prevent failures. The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks and for authorizing licensed banks, restricted license banks, and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong (collectively referred to as \"authorized institutions\").\n\nHong Kong’s prudential supervisory regime is not designed to ensure \"zero risk.\" As one of the resolution authorities, the Monetary Authority strives to ensure that, should an authorized institution become non-viable, its failure can be managed in an orderly manner. To this end, Hong Kong has established a financial institution resolution regime, under which the Monetary Authority acts as the resolution authority for authorized institutions (and other types of institutions). Implementing Hong Kong’s resolution regime requires the formulation of resolution rules and policy standards, resolution planning to remove impediments to the resolvability of authorized institutions, and the development of the HKMA’s operational capability to resolve failing authorized institutions. To effectively carry out these tasks, the HKMA adopts an internationally consistent and coordinated approach.\n\nThe Monetary Authority is also responsible for designating and overseeing certain financial market infrastructures. The HKMA’s oversight of financial market infrastructures aims to promote their overall safety and efficiency, control systemic risk, and enhance transparency. Strengthening the resilience of financial market infrastructures helps safeguard Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems, preventing disruptions in their operations from affecting overall stability.\n\n# Review of 2022\n\n# Licensing Matters\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA approved six offshore trading platforms as money brokers, while five licensed banks and one restricted license bank had their authorization revoked.\n\nFor more information on Hong Kong’s authorized institutions and local representative offices, please refer to the appendices and Tables D to F on pages 283–286 and 292–295, respectively.\n\n# Overview of Supervisory Work\n\nIn 2022, the HKMA conducted a total of 183 off-site reviews, covering a wide range of areas including CAMEL assessments, corporate governance, risk management, and the adoption of fintech by authorized institutions. To further strengthen the risk governance of authorized institutions, the HKMA held 36 meetings with the boards of directors, independent non-executive directors, or board committees of authorized institutions, and 38 tripartite meetings with authorized institutions and their external auditors.\n\nIn addition to off-site reviews, the HKMA also conducts regular on-site examinations of the various business operations of authorized institutions. From a prudential supervision perspective, credit risk management remains one of the primary supervisory focuses. At the same time, as banks increasingly adopt technology, operational risk and technology risk management have become another key area of supervision. With the rapid development of green and sustainable banking in Hong Kong, the HKMA has also conducted a round of thematic reviews focusing on climate risk management. In terms of conduct supervision, the HKMA carries out on-site inspections of authorized institutions’ securities, investment products, insurance, and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) related businesses, supplemented by thematic assessments to review areas assessed as higher risk.\n\nTable 1 provides an overview of the HKMA’s supervisory work in 2022.\n\nTable 1: Overview of Supervisory Work\n\n# Credit Risk\n\n# Credit Growth and Asset Quality\n\nIn 2022, total loans decreased by 3.0%, compared to an increase of 3.8% in 2021. Table 2 sets out the growth of various types of loans and advances. Mainland-related loans also declined by 4.4% to HKD 4,522 billion in 2022 (see Table 3).\n\nDuring the year, the banking system faced challenges and shocks from various sources, including the fifth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, escalating geopolitical tensions, aggressive interest rate hikes by major central banks, and the deteriorating financial conditions of some Mainland property developers. Despite these challenges, the banking system remained stable and sound.\n\nThe asset quality of the banking system deteriorated during the year but remained at a healthy level. The classified loan ratio of the banking sector was 1.38% at the end of 2022, up from 0.89% at the end of 2021. The classified loan ratio for Mainland-related loans rose from 0.89% a year earlier to 2.21%.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA enhanced both the breadth and depth of its risk monitoring and maintained close communication with authorized institutions to enable timely assessment of economic and market conditions, as well as the risk management measures of authorized institutions. Overall credit risk faced by the banking system remained manageable. The HKMA’s debt repayment stress test results indicated that the banking system continued to maintain adequate capital buffers and could withstand extreme stress.\n\nThe HKMA conducted thematic assessments during the year to review the credit risk management of authorized institutions, focusing on asset quality, risk exposures to more vulnerable sectors, credit risk in overseas branches, and secured lending to private banking and wealth management clients.\n\nOn the other hand, in a challenging macroeconomic environment, an increasing number of corporates are facing financial difficulties. The HKMA encourages authorized institutions to handle cases of corporate repayment difficulties in accordance with the principles set out in the Hong Kong Corporate Financial Difficulty Handling Code, thereby enabling individual authorized institutions to coordinate and cooperate from the perspective of the collective interests of the lending institutions involved.\n\nTable 3: Growth of Mainland-related Loans\n\n# Alleviating Customers’ Liquidity Pressure\n\nIn view of the impact of the fifth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, coupled with the still complex and volatile external and local economic outlook, the HKMA, together with the Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism, extended the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme to the end of July 2023. In addition, the scheme introduced and subsequently enhanced certain principal repayment options to help customers prepare for the eventual resumption of normal repayments.\n\nAs at the end of 2022, banks had approved over 108,000 cases of loan extensions and other support measures for corporate customers, involving more than HKD 1.1 trillion. For individual customers, banks also approved over 81,000 cases of residential mortgage principal payment holidays and other emergency personal loans, involving more than HKD 65 billion.\n\n# Property Mortgage Loans\n\nSince 2009, the HKMA has introduced several rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures, which have strengthened banks’ risk management and enhanced the Hong Kong banking system’s resilience to a potential reversal in the local property market. The average loan-to-value ratio of newly approved residential mortgage loans was 57% in December 2022, compared to 64% before the first round of countercyclical measures was introduced in September 2009. The average debt service-to-income ratio of new mortgages remained low, at 39% in December 2022, compared to 41% when the cap was first introduced in August 2010 (see Figure 1).\n\nIn September, the HKMA lowered the assumed interest rate increase in the mortgage stress test from 300 basis points to 200 basis points. In making this decision, the HKMA took into account the current interest rate environment and the trend of mortgage rates relative to their long-term historical average. The HKMA considers that this level is sufficient to ensure that banks’ mortgage business risks are properly managed.\n\nFigure 1: Average Loan-to-Value Ratio and Debt Service-to-Income Ratio of Newly Approved Residential Mortgage Loans\n\n# Operational and Technology Risk\n\nOver the past year, the HKMA introduced a number of measures to strengthen the operational resilience of the banking system. These measures included the issuance in May of a new module in the Supervisory Policy Manual on \"Operational Resilience,\" which sets out the HKMA’s expectations for the governance and control frameworks that authorized institutions should maintain to ensure operational resilience. Two industry dialogues were also held to enhance industry understanding of the new standards and to facilitate experience sharing within the sector (see Illustration 1).\n\nThe HKMA also provided detailed supervisory guidance on specific areas of bank operations, including customer data protection, payment system operations, cloud computing, payment card security, and defenses against distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.\n\nIn response to the ever-evolving cyber threats, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has promoted the adoption of robust triple data backup arrangements by banks, monitored the progress of authorized institutions in implementing the \"Cyber Defense Assessment Framework\" 2.0, and assessed banks' capabilities in countering supply chain attacks, all with the aim of enhancing the cyber defense capabilities of the banking system.\n\nIn light of the significant increase in phishing scams and other online fraud risks, the HKMA and the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB) jointly launched a new large-scale promotional campaign in September themed \"Keep an eye on your digital key, think twice before clicking any link!\" to raise public awareness of prevention. In July, the HKMA also co-hosted a workshop with the Hong Kong Police Force to brief banks on the latest tactics used by fraudsters.\n\nPoster for the promotional campaign themed \"Keep an eye on your digital key, think twice before clicking any link!\"\n\nFigure 1: Industry Dialogue – \"Journey Towards Operational Resilience\"\n\n# Liquidity and Market Risk\n\nIn the face of increased market volatility resulting from further monetary tightening by major economies, the HKMA has strengthened its monitoring of banks' market and liquidity risk exposures. The HKMA has conducted reviews to assess whether authorized institutions' liquidity risk management is adequate, with a focus on the diversification of funding sources and the systems and controls for intra-group liquidity risk management. In addition, the HKMA has also conducted reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of authorized institutions' market risk management frameworks and treasury business controls."}

This not only consolidated Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre but also generated a positive ripple effect.\n\nSignificant progress was made in consolidating Hong Kong’s role as a global offshore RMB business hub across multiple areas. These included optimizing the existing currency swap agreement between the HKMA and the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), as well as the HKMA’s RMB liquidity arrangements, ensuring sufficient RMB liquidity to further promote the development of offshore RMB products and markets; jointly announcing the launch of \"Swap Connect\" with the PBOC and the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC); collaborating with the SFC and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) to introduce a dual-counter market maker mechanism to facilitate RMB-denominated stock trading in Hong Kong; and launching a multi-year plan to further enhance financial market infrastructure and develop the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) into a major international central securities depository platform in Asia. Benefiting from ample RMB liquidity, world-class market infrastructure, and various mutual market access mechanisms between the Mainland and Hong Kong, the city has become the preferred platform for Mainland funds entering international markets and for international investors seeking exposure to the rapidly growing Mainland market.\n\nThe HKMA also made good progress in strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, covering areas such as bond issuance, asset and wealth management, corporate treasury centres, as well as green and sustainable finance. To promote Hong Kong’s financial services, the HKMA stepped up market outreach to overseas and Mainland stakeholders, raising awareness of Hong Kong’s robust financial system and its promising prospects.\n\nAt the same time, the HKMA continued to implement the \"Fintech 2025\" strategy, fostering broader adoption of fintech in the financial sector to fully consolidate Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub. The Faster Payment System (FPS) continued its steady growth, with registrations surpassing 10 million in March and average daily transaction volumes exceeding 1 million in September.\n\nThe HKMA remained actively engaged in international and regional central banking and regulatory organizations, contributing to global efforts to maintain financial stability and promote market development.\n\n# Overview\n\nThe HKMA continued to proactively enhance Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre. In November, the HKMA hosted the \"Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit,\" implementing the plan announced by the Financial Secretary in the 2022-23 Budget. The three-day summit brought together leading figures from the international financial sector to share unique perspectives on seizing opportunities amid various uncertainties. The event received an enthusiastic response, attracting over 200 distinguished guests from around 120 international financial institutions, fully reflecting the global financial community’s support for Hong Kong.\n\nHong Kong further consolidated its position as an offshore RMB hub, with robust growth in offshore RMB business during the year. The city played a key role in facilitating capital flows between Mainland and international financial markets, with mutual market access mechanisms between Hong Kong and the Mainland recognized as the preferred channels for international investors entering onshore capital markets and for Mainland investors allocating to offshore assets. In 2022, Bond Connect (Northbound) accounted for 61% of total trading volume by overseas investors in China’s interbank bond market. Bond Connect (Southbound) and Wealth Management Connect have both operated smoothly since their launch in 2021. The HKMA, together with the PBOC and the SFC, jointly announced the launch of \"Swap Connect,\" further expanding financial cooperation between Hong Kong and the Mainland into the derivatives market and strengthening Hong Kong’s role as a major offshore RMB business hub and risk management centre. The optimization of the existing currency swap agreement between the HKMA and the PBOC in July marked another important milestone in reinforcing Hong Kong’s status as an offshore RMB business hub.\n\nTo provide a more diversified range of RMB-denominated products in Hong Kong, a working group comprising the HKMA, the SFC, and HKEX completed a feasibility study on expanding the use of RMB in the Hong Kong stock market. The group has commenced preparatory work, including the introduction of a dual-counter market maker mechanism to optimize trading in dual-currency (HKD and RMB) stocks.\n\nThe HKMA remains committed to enhancing the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. Specifically, to increase Hong Kong’s attractiveness as a preferred fund management centre, the HKMA has worked closely with the government and the financial industry to create a more facilitative tax and regulatory environment. Significant progress has also been made in promoting innovation in Hong Kong’s bond market and consolidating the city’s position as a regional hub for green and sustainable finance. Meanwhile, the HKMA has intensified market promotion efforts to introduce Hong Kong’s financial services to overseas and Mainland stakeholders.\n\nThe HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office continued to collaborate with various banking sectors to implement the \"Fintech 2025\" strategy, promoting the widespread adoption of fintech within the industry and enhancing Hong Kong's position as a fintech hub in Asia. Major initiatives launched during the year included:\n- Promoting the application of Regtech and conducting fintech adoption assessments;\n- Advancing work on wholesale central bank digital currency (CBDC) to improve cross-border payments;\n- Deepening research on the issuance of retail CBDC in Hong Kong (i.e., the \"digital Hong Kong dollar\" or e-HKD);\n- Launching the Commercial Data Interchange (CDI);\n- Strengthening talent development;\n- Leveraging policy resources to support the fintech ecosystem;\n- Enhancing cross-border fintech cooperation; and\n- Promoting broader use of the Faster Payment System (FPS).\n\nThe reliable and efficient operation of financial infrastructure is key to consolidating Hong Kong's status as a major international financial centre. In 2022, the four real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems for interbank transactions, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU), and the Hong Kong Trade Repository all achieved 100% system availability, exceeding the target level of 99.95%. Settlement services for Bond Connect's Northbound and Southbound channels remained smooth. By year-end, the outstanding amount of Exchange Fund Bills and Notes held in the CMU system stood at HK$1,207.5 billion, while the outstanding amount of other bonds increased to HK$1,573.3 billion, the highest level since 2013.\n\nUsage of FPS continued to grow in 2022. As of end-2022, there were 11.48 million registrations, with the average daily transaction volume up 40% compared to 2021. In addition to steady growth in person-to-person and business payments, the use of FPS for paying government bills, merchant payments, and topping up stored value facility (SVF) e-wallets or bank accounts continued to increase, which was the main driver of the significant growth in FPS transaction volume.\n\nTo promote the safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA supervises six designated retail payment systems and regulates 17 licensed SVFs (of which four are issued by licensed banks) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (the \"Payment Ordinance\"). During the year, to continue supporting the smooth implementation of the government's consumption voucher scheme, the HKMA coordinated and facilitated communication and cooperation between relevant government departments and the SVF licensees appointed for the scheme.\n\nIn January 2023, the HKMA published a summary of the discussion paper on crypto-assets and stablecoins, consolidating the feedback received and the HKMA's responses. The summary confirmed that the HKMA will regulate stablecoins in a risk-based and flexible manner, and outlined the expected regulatory scope, key requirements, and next steps.\n\nAt the international level, the HKMA actively participated in central banking affairs and played a leadership role in various regional and international committees. Since 2018, the HKMA has served three consecutive terms as Chair of the EMEAP Financial Markets Working Group. In addition, the HKMA co-chairs the Policy and Standards Group under the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, as well as the Non-bank Monitoring Experts Group and the Financial Innovation Network under the Financial Stability Board. The HKMA also leads the group responsible for monitoring and following up on regulatory matters related to the transition of financial benchmarks under the Financial Stability Board.\n\n# 2022 Review\n\n# Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit\n\nThe \"Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit\" was held from November 1 to 3.\n\nFollowing the announcement by the Financial Secretary in the 2022-23 Budget, the HKMA hosted the \"Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit\" in November. The three-day summit received an enthusiastic response, bringing together 26 leading figures in the financial industry to share unique insights and perspectives on addressing economic, financial, technological, and geopolitical uncertainties, as well as how to seize the opportunities arising from them. The summit attracted over 200 participants from around 120 global financial institutions, with more than 40 institutions represented by their group chairmen or chief executive officers. Participating institutions included some of the world's largest banks, securities firms, asset managers, sovereign wealth funds, private equity and venture capital firms, hedge funds, and insurance companies.\n\nThe summit sent a clear message to the world that Hong Kong has fully returned to normal. Global financial leaders were able to experience first-hand Hong Kong's unique resilience and vibrancy, and to understand the opportunities Hong Kong offers for developing business in Asia.\n\n# Hong Kong as the Primary Gateway to Mainland China and the Global Offshore RMB Business Hub\n\nHong Kong is committed to consolidating its position as the global offshore RMB business hub, including enhancing offshore liquidity, further strengthening connectivity with Mainland financial markets, and upgrading financial market infrastructure. During the year, RMB business—including bank deposits, trade settlement, payments, and offshore bond issuance—continued to record steady growth. Encouraging progress and results were achieved in enhancing liquidity, product development, and expanding mutual market access mechanisms. The 2022 triennial survey of foreign exchange and derivatives market turnover by the Bank for International Settlements once again confirmed Hong Kong's leading position as an RMB foreign exchange centre.\n\nBond Connect Northbound continued to be the main channel for international investors to access the Mainland bond market through Hong Kong's market infrastructure and financial services. In 2022, the average daily turnover of Bond Connect Northbound reached RMB 32.2 billion (an increase of 25% over 2021), accounting for 61% of the total turnover by overseas investors in the China interbank bond market.\n\nIn July, Bond Connect (Northbound) introduced technical enhancements, including the digitization of the process for investors to participate in the primary market issuance of onshore bonds and the reduction of service fees. These market-based optimization measures have improved the operational efficiency of Bond Connect (Northbound) and reduced transaction costs for investors.\n\nTo further enhance the supporting measures for Bond Connect (Northbound) and facilitate international investors in managing interest rate risks associated with their investments in Mainland bonds, Hong Kong and the Mainland announced in July the launch of mutual access between the two interest rate swap markets (\"Swap Connect\"). Swap Connect will initially open with Northbound trading, allowing international investors to trade Mainland interest rate swap products through the connectivity between Hong Kong and Mainland infrastructure institutions, thereby strengthening Hong Kong's position as a risk management centre. Preparatory work for Swap Connect is progressing in an orderly manner, with the aim of launching Northbound trading as soon as possible. The HKMA will continue to work with relevant authorities and institutions to explore the provision of more diversified risk management tools, including the introduction of offshore government bond futures, to further support international investors in accessing the Mainland bond market.\n\nSince its launch in 2021, Bond Connect (Southbound) has received a positive market response and has operated smoothly, with transactions covering major bond products that can be traded in the Hong Kong market and denominated in multiple currencies.

{"zh": "# 儲備管理\n\n2022年的投資環境異常動盪，多種資產類別的價格同時下挫，不僅打破同時持有股票與債券可產生緩減風險作用的傳統投資智慧，更成為近半世紀以來唯一一次股票、債券及主要非美元貨幣匯兌同時錄得負回報的一年。在如此惡劣的投資環境下，外匯基金在2022年錄得投資回報率負4.5%。與年內大部分多元資產基金蒙受重大虧損的情況相比，外匯基金的表現反映金管局的多元化長期資產配置，以及因應外圍最新局勢變化而作出的防禦性部署及戰略性調整，有效減低市場風暴帶來的衝擊。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》，外匯基金的首要目的是直接或間接影響港元匯價，亦可運用於保持香港貨幣及金融體系穩定健全，藉此保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。金管局根據財政司司長轉授的權力及轉授權力的條款，就外匯基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標及組合架構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會為外匯基金制定下列投資目標：\n(i) 保障資本；\n(ii) 確保整體貨幣基礎在任何時候都由流通性極高的美元資產提供十足支持；\n(iii) 確保流動資金足以維持貨幣及金融穩定；以及\n(iv) 在符合上述(i)至(iii)項的前提下盡量爭取投資回報，以保障外匯基金的長期購買力。\n\n以上目標全面顧及外匯基金的法定目的，並已於外匯基金的組合架構及目標資產配置中反映（圖示1）。\n\n圖示1 外匯基金的投資組合類別\n\n外匯基金大致上分成兩個主要組合：支持組合及投資組合。支持組合持有流通性極高的美元資產，按照貨幣發行局制度的規定為貨幣基礎提供十足支持。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員經濟體的債市及股市，以保障資產的價值及長期購買力。\n\n為能更妥善管理風險及提高中長期回報，金管局以審慎及循序漸進方式將外匯基金的部分資產配置於較多元化的資產類別，包括新興巿場及內地債券與股票、私募股權（包括基建）及房地產。新興巿場及內地債券與股票由投資組合持有，私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合持有。長期增長組合的目標資產配置與其他資產類別的配置，按審慎的風險管理原則及資產組合多元化策略一起制定。\n\n策略性資產組合於2007年設立，一直持有政府基於策略性目的而為外匯基金帳目購入的香港交易及結算所有限公司股份。由於這個組合性質獨特，因此外匯基金的投資表現評估並無將其包括在內。\n\n# 於外匯基金的存款\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定組織的存款，利率一般與投資組合的表現掛鈎，但未來基金屬主要個別例子。未來基金存款的利率與投資組合及長期增長組合的回報掛鈎，實際利率視乎組合比重而定。未來基金在投資組合與長期增長組合的比重於2022年約為35：65。\n\n# 投資程序\n\n外匯基金的投資程序分別以策略性資產配置及戰略性資產配置作基礎。策略性資產配置以投資基準方式反映，亦即外匯基金為達到投資目標而可作出的長線資產配置。外匯基金以策略性配置作為指引，透過戰略性的資產配置，以爭取超越基準的回報。因此，實際配置往往會與基準配置（亦即策略性配置）有所偏離，而實際與基準配置之間的差距稱為「戰略性偏離」。財政司司長經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後制定投資基準及循跡誤差限額，金管局獲授權決定戰略性資產配置及定出戰略性偏離的容許範圍。投資組合經理可在戰略性偏離的容許範圍內管理倉盤，從短期市場變化中獲利。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局的外匯基金投資辦公室專責外匯基金的投資及相關風險管理職能。該辦公室職員負責直接管理外匯基金約70%的投資，包括整個支持組合及部分投資組合。該部分內部管理的投資組合包括不同的環球定息市場投資，並透過衍生工具執行外匯基金的宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 外聘投資經理\n\n除透過內部職員管理資產外，金管局亦僱用外聘投資經理負責管理外匯基金約30%的資產，包括所有上市股票組合及其他特別資產類別。僱用外聘投資經理的目的是要運用市場上最佳的專業投資專才為外匯基金投資，獲取可持續回報，並讓外匯基金受惠於多元化及互補的投資方式，以及汲取市場心得與專門的投資知識。\n\n僱用外聘投資經理的相關支出包括基金管理與託管費、交易費、預扣稅及其他稅項。這些支出主要受市場因素影響而每年不同。\n\n# 風險管理及監察\n\n投資環境越趨複雜，風險管理的重要性不言而喻。金管局為內部及外聘投資經理所管理的投資組合均訂下嚴格管控措施及投資指引，並設立嚴謹的風險監察及合規制度。金管局為投資相關活動設有三重防線，以實施有效的風險管理及管治。金管局定期監察主要投資風險類別（包括信用、市場、流動性及業務操作風險），而風險管理程序的設置為外匯基金的策略性規劃及多元化投資提供穩健的框架。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n金管局相信透過適度強調負責任投資及考慮各項投資的可持續長期表現，可更有效達致外匯基金的投資目標，並且減低投資活動涉及的環境、社會及管治(ESG)相關風險。當ESG投資與其他投資項目的經風險調整長期收益相若時，金管局一般會按既定指導性原則優先考慮ESG投資，並已將ESG因素併入外匯基金的公開市場及私募市場的投資管理過程中。有關金管局的負責任投資框架及落實情況，詳見《二零二二年可持續發展報告》之「負責任投資」一章。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2022 年的金融市場\n\n2022年環球金融市場異常波動，債市及股市分別累計下跌16.2%及19.8%，跌幅顯著。\n\n受累於全球通脹飆升、緊縮貨幣政策及經濟增長放緩，年內主要股市指數大幅下挫。儘管環球股市因市場出現通脹及利率見頂的憧憬而於年末稍作反彈，年內美國標準普爾500指數仍下跌19.4%，香港恒生指數則下跌15.5%。\n\n由於各國央行進取加息以對抗通脹，觸發主要市場國債收益率持續飆升。美國10年期國債收益率從2022年初的1.63%一直攀升，至第4季升穿4%，達2008年以來最高水平。美國國債收益率曲線自年中開始已出現倒掛，幅度不斷擴大，加深市場對經濟衰退的憂慮。\n\n貨幣市場方面，在美國聯邦儲備局連續加息帶動下，美元在2022年大幅走強。其他主要貨幣，包括歐元、英鎊、日圓及人民幣兌美元匯率大幅貶值，其中英鎊及日圓兌美元分別貶值10.7%及12.2%。\n\n表1列載主要貨幣、債巿及股市在2022年的表現。\n\n表1 2022年市場回報\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n外匯基金在2022年錄得2,054億港元的投資虧損，其中包括債券投資虧損532億港元、股票投資虧損805億港元（其中包括境外股票投資虧損610億港元及香港股票投資虧損195億港元）、非港元資產外匯估值下調400億港元，以及外匯基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資虧損317億港元。另一方面，策略性資產組合錄得87億港元估值虧損。\n\n於2022年年底，外匯基金的資產總值達40,080億港元。長期增長組合投資的總市值為4,847億港元，其中私募股權為3,700億港元，房地產為1,147億港元。長期增長組合中已承擔但尚未提取作投資的總額為2,708億港元。\n\n外匯基金（不包括策略性資產組合）在2022年的投資回報率為負4.5%，其中投資組合的回報率為負8.6%，支持組合為負0.4%。長期增長組合自2009年開展投資以來的內部回報率年率為12.6%。\n\n圖1列明外匯基金由1994至2022年的年度回報率。表2顯示外匯基金在2022年的投資回報率及不同年期的平均投資回報率。外匯基金在2020至2022年的平均回報率為1.5%、2018至2022年為2.3%、2013至2022年為2.4%，以及自1994年起計為4.5%。表3列載外匯基金資產於2022年12月31日的貨幣比重。\n\n有關外匯基金的經審計2022年度財務報表，見第173至281頁。\n\n圖1 外匯基金投資回報率（1994至2022年）\n", "en": "# Reserve Management\n\nThe investment environment in 2022 was exceptionally volatile, with prices across multiple asset classes declining simultaneously. This not only shattered the traditional investment wisdom that holding both equities and bonds can provide risk mitigation, but also marked the only year in nearly half a century in which equities, bonds, and major non-US dollar currencies all recorded negative returns. In such an adverse investment environment, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment return of -4.5% in 2022. Compared to the significant losses suffered by most multi-asset funds during the year, the performance of the Exchange Fund reflects the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s (HKMA) diversified long-term asset allocation, as well as its defensive deployment and strategic adjustments in response to the latest external developments, which effectively reduced the impact of market turmoil.\n\n# The Exchange Fund\n\nAccording to the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the primary objective of the Exchange Fund is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar. It may also be used to maintain the stability and soundness of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems, thereby preserving Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre. The HKMA, under the authority delegated by the Financial Secretary and in accordance with the terms of such delegation, is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# Management of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Investment Objectives and Portfolio Structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n(i) Capital preservation;\n(ii) Ensuring that the entire monetary base is at all times fully backed by highly liquid US dollar assets;\n(iii) Ensuring sufficient liquidity to maintain monetary and financial stability; and\n(iv) Subject to (i) to (iii) above, seeking to maximize investment returns to preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Exchange Fund.\n\nThese objectives comprehensively address the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund and are reflected in the portfolio structure and target asset allocation of the Fund (see Diagram 1).\n\nDiagram 1: Types of Exchange Fund Investment Portfolios\n\nBroadly, the Exchange Fund is divided into two main portfolios: the Backing Portfolio and the Investment Portfolio. The Backing Portfolio holds highly liquid US dollar assets to provide full backing for the monetary base as required under the currency board system. The Investment Portfolio primarily invests in the bond and equity markets of member economies of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), with the aim of preserving asset value and long-term purchasing power.\n\nTo better manage risk and enhance medium- to long-term returns, the HKMA has prudently and progressively allocated part of the Exchange Fund’s assets to a more diversified range of asset classes, including emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the Investment Portfolio, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio. The target asset allocation of the Long-Term Growth Portfolio, together with the allocation to other asset classes, is determined in accordance with prudent risk management principles and a diversification strategy.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio was established in 2007 and has since held shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) acquired by the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes. Due to the unique nature of this portfolio, its performance is not included in the evaluation of the Exchange Fund’s investment performance.\n\n# Deposits Placed with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund from time to time accepts deposits from fiscal reserves, government funds, and statutory bodies. The interest rates on these deposits are generally linked to the performance of the Investment Portfolio, with the Future Fund being a major exception. The interest rate on Future Fund deposits is linked to the returns of both the Investment Portfolio and the Long-Term Growth Portfolio, with the actual rate depending on the weighting of each portfolio. In 2022, the weighting of the Future Fund in the Investment Portfolio and the Long-Term Growth Portfolio was approximately 35:65.\n\n# Investment Process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is based on both strategic asset allocation and tactical asset allocation. Strategic asset allocation is reflected in the investment benchmark, which represents the long-term asset allocation that the Exchange Fund may adopt to achieve its investment objectives. The strategic allocation serves as a guideline, while tactical asset allocation is employed to seek returns in excess of the benchmark. As a result, the actual allocation often deviates from the benchmark (i.e., the strategic allocation), and the difference between the actual and benchmark allocations is referred to as the \"tactical deviation.\" The Financial Secretary, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, sets the investment benchmark and tracking error limit. The HKMA is authorized to determine the tactical asset allocation and set the permissible range for tactical deviation. Portfolio managers may manage positions within the permissible range of tactical deviation to profit from short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment Management\n\n# Direct Investment\n\nThe Exchange Fund Investment Office of the HKMA is responsible for the investment and related risk management functions of the Exchange Fund. Staff of the office directly manage about 70% of the Exchange Fund’s investments, including the entire Backing Portfolio and part of the Investment Portfolio. The internally managed portion of the Investment Portfolio includes various global fixed income market investments, and macro risk management strategies for the Exchange Fund are implemented through derivative instruments.\n\n# External Investment Managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA also employs external investment managers to manage about 30% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all listed equity portfolios and other special asset classes. The purpose of employing external investment managers is to leverage the best professional investment expertise available in the market for the Exchange Fund, to achieve sustainable returns, and to enable the Exchange Fund to benefit from diversified and complementary investment approaches, as well as to gain market insights and specialized investment knowledge.\n\nExpenditures related to the engagement of external investment managers include fund management and custody fees, transaction costs, withholding tax, and other taxes. These expenses vary from year to year, primarily influenced by market factors.\n\n# Risk Management and Monitoring\n\nAs the investment environment becomes increasingly complex, the importance of risk management is self-evident. The HKMA has established stringent control measures and investment guidelines for portfolios managed by both internal and external investment managers, and has implemented rigorous risk monitoring and compliance systems. The HKMA has instituted a three lines of defense framework for investment-related activities to ensure effective risk management and governance. The HKMA regularly monitors major categories of investment risk, including credit, market, liquidity, and operational risks. The risk management procedures provide a robust framework for the strategic planning and diversified investment of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# Responsible Investment\n\nThe HKMA believes that by appropriately emphasizing responsible investment and considering the sustainable long-term performance of each investment, the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund can be achieved more effectively, while reducing environment, social, and governance (ESG) risks associated with investment activities. When the risk-adjusted long-term returns of ESG investments are comparable to those of other investment projects, the HKMA generally gives priority to ESG investments in accordance with established guiding principles, and has incorporated ESG factors into the investment management processes for both public and private markets of the Exchange Fund. For details on the HKMA’s responsible investment framework and its implementation, please refer to the \"Responsible Investment\" chapter in the 2022 Sustainability Report.\n\n# Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Financial Markets in 2022\n\nGlobal financial markets were exceptionally volatile in 2022, with the bond and equity markets recording cumulative declines of 16.2% and 19.8% respectively, both significant drops.\n\nMajor stock indices fell sharply during the year, weighed down by surging global inflation, tight monetary policy, and slowing economic growth. Although global equity markets rebounded slightly towards the end of the year on hopes that inflation and interest rates had peaked, the S&P 500 Index still declined by 19.4% for the year, while the Hang Seng Index fell by 15.5%.\n\nAs central banks around the world aggressively raised interest rates to combat inflation, yields on major government bonds surged. The yield on the US 10-year Treasury note climbed from 1.63% at the beginning of 2022 to over 4% in the fourth quarter, reaching its highest level since 2008. The US Treasury yield curve became inverted from mid-year onwards, with the inversion deepening and heightening market concerns over a potential economic recession.\n\nIn the currency markets, the US dollar strengthened significantly in 2022, driven by consecutive rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. Other major currencies, including the euro, pound sterling, Japanese yen, and renminbi, depreciated sharply against the US dollar, with the pound and yen depreciating by 10.7% and 12.2% respectively.\n\nTable 1 sets out the performance of major currencies, bond markets, and equity markets in 2022.\n\nTable 1: Market Returns in 2022\n\n# Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment loss of HK$205.4 billion in 2022, including a loss of HK$53.2 billion from bond investments, a loss of HK$80.5 billion from equity investments (comprising a loss of HK$61.0 billion from overseas equities and HK$19.5 billion from Hong Kong equities), a foreign exchange valuation loss of HK$40.0 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets, and a loss of HK$31.7 billion from other investments held by Exchange Fund investment holding subsidiaries. In addition, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation loss of HK$8.7 billion.\n\nAt the end of 2022, the total assets of the Exchange Fund amounted to HK$4,008 billion. The total market value of investments in the Long-Term Growth Portfolio was HK$484.7 billion, of which private equity accounted for HK$370.0 billion and real estate for HK$114.7 billion. The total amount committed but not yet drawn for investment in the Long-Term Growth Portfolio was HK$270.8 billion.\n\nThe Exchange Fund (excluding the Strategic Portfolio) recorded an investment return of -4.5% in 2022, with the Investment Portfolio returning -8.6% and the Backing Portfolio -0.4%. Since the commencement of investments in 2009, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio has achieved an annualized internal rate of return of 12.6%.\n\nFigure 1 shows the annual rates of return of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2022. Table 2 presents the investment returns of the Exchange Fund in 2022 and the average investment returns over different periods.

It serves as an important facility for introducing the work of the HKMA to the public and enhancing public understanding of monetary and banking matters. The Information Centre comprises two sections: an exhibition hall and a library. The exhibition hall uses interactive displays to introduce the work of the HKMA and the development of Hong Kong’s monetary and banking sectors; it also provides materials and exhibits for research on Hong Kong’s currency, banking, and financial affairs. Adjacent to the exhibition hall, the library houses over 26,000 books, periodicals, and other publications covering topics such as Hong Kong’s currency, banking, finance, and central banking.

In 2022, the HKMA held online seminars that attracted over 2,200 teachers and students from 82 secondary schools.

To date, more than 65,000 participants have attended the public education seminars.\n\nThe HKMA educates and engages the public to remind them how to be smart and responsible consumers of financial services.

The HKMA also conducted radio and social media campaigns to provide tips on the smart use of credit cards, personal loans, online shopping, and other payment methods (including \"buy now, pay later\" products).\n\nA new short video titled \"Keep an eye on your digital key, think twice before clicking a link!\"\n\nTo help the public keep pace with developments in fintech services, the HKMA used social media and radio promotions to encourage the public to give out electronic lai see during Lunar New Year. The HKMA produced animated videos explaining open APIs and highlighting important considerations when using banking services via mobile applications of third-party service providers (such as online shopping platforms and mortgage service companies). The videos also introduced the App-to-App and Web-to-App payment features and benefits of the Faster Payment System (FPS).\n\nAnimated videos help enhance public knowledge of digital finance.\n\nThe HKMA is also committed to deepening public understanding of the financial industry and increasing young people’s interest in joining the HKMA and the sector.

This year’s theme was green and sustainable finance. Students gained new knowledge through an online quiz competition (with a record number of participants), webinars, and a design thinking competition.\n\nStudents present innovative solutions with green and sustainable elements in the design thinking competition to address personal financial management needs.\n\nDuring the 2021-22 academic year, the HKMA launched the \"Little Financial Planner\" online parent-child financial education activity during the March special holiday and the August summer break. Through animated videos, storytelling, simple toy making, and sharing sessions with financial and early childhood education experts, kindergarten and lower primary students learned about the basics of banknotes and coins, banking and payment services, and financial literacy.\n\nChildren learn financial concepts and skills online.\n\n# Financial Disclosure\n\nTo maintain a high level of transparency, the HKMA adopts international financial disclosure standards applicable to central banking operations, including the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and other relevant reporting requirements (such as the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard). With the assistance of independent auditors and other accounting professionals, the Finance Division prepares the Exchange Fund financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards. In addition, the HKMA’s Annual Report provides detailed disclosure and in-depth analysis of each expenditure item and budget data.\n\n# Accountability and Oversight\n\n# Risk Management\n\nManaging risks to the monetary and banking systems is one of the HKMA’s most important tasks. Risk management is reflected not only in strategic planning but also in daily operations. The HKMA’s risk management framework includes two high-level committees: the Macro Surveillance Committee and the Risk Committee, both chaired by the Chief Executive of the HKMA.\n\nThe Macro Surveillance Committee’s terms of reference are as follows:\n- Identify potential risks and threats to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems and discuss possible countermeasures;\n- Review existing risk management measures for the monetary and financial systems, identify possible loopholes, and ensure the adequacy of these measures; and\n- Encourage cross-departmental sharing of macro surveillance information to enhance the HKMA’s macro surveillance capability.\n\nThe terms of reference of the Risk Committee are as follows:\n- To identify potential risks and threats faced by the HKMA and formulate strategies to mitigate their impact;\n- To review the existing risk management systems of various departments, identify possible loopholes and significant risks, and ensure that appropriate measures are in place to address such situations;\n- To standardize risk assessment criteria and methodologies, and to determine resource management priorities for the identified risks; and\n- To encourage and strengthen the risk management culture within the HKMA, promoting appropriate authorization and monitoring.\n\nThe HKMA has established a robust operational risk management framework that covers both institutional-level and departmental-level organizational structure risks. Institutional-level risks refer to medium-term risks faced by the organization as a whole, or risks that require cross-departmental collaboration. In practice, each department is required to review and report its potential and emerging risks, as well as the proposed control measures and mitigation strategies, on a quarterly basis. This is complemented by a top-down institutional risk management approach, whereby senior management of each department identifies major risks with broader impact and recommends mitigation measures. These assessments are regularly reviewed by the Risk Committee, which determines appropriate follow-up actions.\n\n# Internal Audit\n\nThe Internal Audit Division independently and objectively assesses whether the HKMA’s governance, risk management, and control procedures are adequate and effective. Functionally, the division reports to the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, and administratively to the Chief Executive of the HKMA. The Internal Audit Division adopts a risk-based approach in conducting audits of business operations and information systems, covering all major risk areas.

My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the \"Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\" section of this report. In accordance with these standards, I am independent of the Group and have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these standards. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2022. These matters were addressed in the context of the audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Valuation of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Measured at Fair Value\n\nPlease refer to Notes 2.5, 2.6, and 38.1 to the financial statements.\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, the Group’s financial assets measured at fair value amounted to HK$3,836.182 billion, and financial liabilities measured at fair value amounted to HK$1,207.498 billion.\n\n87% of these financial assets and all of these financial liabilities were measured at fair value based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 inputs), or were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data (Level 2 inputs).\n\nThe remaining 13% of these financial assets, amounting to HK$487.694 billion, were measured at fair value using valuation techniques with significant inputs that are not based on observable market data (Level 3 inputs), mainly comprising unlisted investment funds.\n\nGiven the magnitude of the amounts involved and the estimation required, the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value was a key audit matter.\n\nThe audit procedures for the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value included:\n- Understanding the valuation processes for different categories of financial assets and financial liabilities, including relevant monitoring controls;\n- Evaluating and testing the monitoring controls, including relevant application controls of the computer systems;\n- Obtaining confirmations regarding the valuation, existence, rights and obligations, and completeness of financial assets and financial liabilities;\n- For market-quoted prices, verifying prices against independent sources;\n- For valuation techniques using inputs based on observable market data, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation techniques and the reasonableness of the assumptions, and verifying the inputs against independent sources; and\n- For valuation techniques using significant inputs not based on observable market data, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation techniques and the reasonableness of the related assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Valuation of Investment Properties Measured at Fair Value\n\nPlease refer to Notes 2.11, 18, and 19 to the financial statements.\n\nThe Group’s investment properties measured at fair value amounted to HK$23.394 billion as at 31 December 2022. The Group also held interests in 4 associate companies and 22 joint venture companies, whose principal business is holding overseas investment properties, with such interests amounting to HK$39.631 billion. Whether held directly by the Group or through associate or joint venture companies, the fair value of these investment properties was mainly determined based on valuations performed by independent professional valuers. These valuations involved significant judgments and estimates, including the valuation techniques and assumptions used.\n\nThe audit procedures for the valuation of investment properties measured at fair value included:\n- Obtaining and reviewing valuation reports for investment properties held directly by the Group or through associate or joint venture companies, and verifying that the fair value was determined in accordance with the valuations stated in the reports;\n- Assessing the independence and qualifications of the valuers; and\n- Evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation techniques and the reasonableness of the related assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Other Information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises all the information included in the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s 2022 Annual Report, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee in Relation to the Financial Statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for preparing financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the directions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for implementing such internal controls as he deems necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern, and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is inappropriate to do so.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\n\nMy objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission’s auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nIn conducting an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission’s auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. I also:\n- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error; design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks; and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls;\n- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n- Conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and\n- Obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nProfessor Chiyuen Lam\nAuditor General\n\nAudit Commission\nHong Kong\n66 Queensway\n\n11 April 2023"}

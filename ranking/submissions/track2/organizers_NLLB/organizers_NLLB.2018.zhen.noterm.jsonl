{"zh": "# 總裁報告\n\n2018年是全球金融危機發生十周年，十年間國際政經形勢經歷巨大轉變，當中不乏一幕幕超乎最佳編劇所能想像的場景。我在去年的年報指出，2017年金融市場表現是「喜出望外」，同時提到前景「潛藏隱憂」。回顧2018年，或許可形容為「先喜後悲」。環球多個股票指數在1月創出歷史新高後不久，熾熱的投資情緒旋即遇上中美貿易摩擦的冷鋒，加上英國脫歐談判一直拉鋸、地緣政治惡化、美聯儲四次加息等因素，市場樂觀氣氛急劇逆轉，資產價格在年內大幅下跌。MSCI全球指數從高點至低點曾下跌20.3%，全年累跌約一成，是2008年環球金融危機以來表現最差的一年。恒生指數從高點最多曾下跌26.7%，全年下挫13.6%，錄得七年來最大年度跌幅。\n\n# 聯匯穩健 信心所繫\n\n儘管外圍形勢波動難測，香港金融體系仍然保持穩健，貨幣市場運作暢順無阻。實施三十五年的聯繫匯率制度成功應對了資金流出港元的考驗。自環球金融危機爆發以來，累積約10,000億港元等值的資金流入港元。去年，隨着美國息率上升，港美息差持續擴闊，「沽港元、買美元」套息活動增加，港元兌美元匯率在年初轉弱，2005年制訂的「弱方兌換保證」，自4月首度觸發後，年內再觸發26次。金管局按照既定機制，履行「買港元、沽美元」的弱方兌換保證，有序、透明地在市場承接1,035億港元的港元沽盤。隨着資金流走，一個月香港銀行同業拆息在2018年內累升了105基點，而銀行亦在去年9月美國加息後，上調了最優惠利率。金管局多次和適時通過不同渠道向公眾闡釋「弱方兌換保證」的運作機制，令公眾了解資金流出港元是香港利率正常化的必經過程，也是聯匯制度的正常運作。國際貨幣基金組織在去年年底重申支持香港聯匯制度的立場，特區政府也強調聯匯是香港貨幣穩定的基石。這都有助於穩定香港市民對聯繫匯率的信心。\n\n# 銀行體系 穩中有進\n\n2008年環球金融危機暴露了全球金融系統潛藏的種種弊端及隱患，促使國際間在過去十年協調推出一系列針對金融市場、金融機構的改革，包括在銀行業監管方面，提升企業管治和風險管理。金管局的銀行監管工作重點針對兩方面：一是着眼於銀行資產負債風險的審慎監管，二是銀行的行為操守，二者不可偏廢。資產負債風險監管方面，金管局作為巴塞爾銀行監管委員會(Basel Committee on Banking Supervision)及二十國集團轄下金融穩定理事會(FinancialStability Board)成員，有責任全面落實國際監管標準，確保香港銀行業穩健審慎地經營業務。去年底香港銀行資本充足率達20.3%，不但遠高於國際最低標準要求的8%，也較環球金融危機時的14.7%水平顯著提升。大型銀行去年第四季平均流動覆蓋比率達167.6%，同樣遠高於法定最低要求的90%。與此同時，為避免重蹈環球金融危機時需動用公帑拯救「大得不能倒」金融機構的覆轍，金融穩定理事會制訂了關於金融機構處置機制的國際標準。香港是亞洲區內少數已經全面落實符合機制要求的地區之一，金管局下設的處置機制辦公室正落實該機制的操作細則，要求銀行推行結構性變動令處置預案在需要時能有效實施，去年亦推出了《吸收虧損能力規則》，未來還會陸續推出更多相關規則。\n\n鑑於樓價持續上升，金管局未雨綢繆，在2009至2017年間共推出八輪逆周期措施，確保一旦地產市況逆轉，本港銀行體系有足夠的抗震能力應對衝擊。這些措施成效顯著：新造住宅平均按揭成數由2009年的64%降至2018年底的46%；平均供款與入息比率亦由2010年的41%下調至2018年底的34%。年內銀行信貸錄得4.4%的溫和增長，整體資產質素維持良好，零售銀行不良貸款比率進一步降至0.5%，遠低於國際及本港歷史平均水平。去年銀行業盈利持續增長，整體股東權益回報率連升兩年至13%；多家國際性銀行集團在本港的業務交出了不俗的成績表，成為集團盈利的重要支柱。\n\n# 穩善文化 上行下效\n\n在監管銀行的行為操守方面，金管局在2010年增設銀行操守部，促進銀行公平待客，並加強保障消費者權益。要做到標本兼治，除了訂出各種針對銀行營運基本操守的監管要求外，我們近年來大力推動改革銀行文化，鼓勵銀行循管治、獎勵制度、評估與回饋機制三方面推動穩善文化，務求銀行內部做到上行下效，在根本上恢復、提升客戶對銀行的信任和尊重。繼2017年金管局向全港銀行提供具體的指引，金管局在2018年底進一步推出銀行文化的監管措施，包括要求銀行就企業文化和落實有關措施作出自我評估等，令穩善銀行文化的三大支柱能有效執行。\n\n雖然互聯網和移動金融是全球趨勢，金管局去年仍繼續促進普及金融，照顧未能應用新科技的社群。例如我們連同香港銀行公會推動便利店推出長者透過「易辦事」免購物提款服務，有關便利店網絡已增至逾300家；我們並聯絡香港郵政在7家主要位於離島和新界的郵政局推出長者提款易服務。銀行業界響應金管局的建議，年內積極增加無障礙設施，提供傷健共融的銀行服務，例子之一是設有聲音導航的自動櫃員機數目一年內增加逾十倍至超過700部。另外，在金管局積極推動下，我們預期將會陸續有銀行在偏遠地區開設更多實體分行和增設流動銀行服務，便利市民。\n\n# 智慧銀行 嶄新體驗\n\n金管局與銀行和科技業界緊密合作，在2017年9月啟動「智慧銀行新紀元」，推動香港金融科技發展和創新，為市民帶來嶄新的支付和銀行服務體驗。2018年的亮點，無疑是在9月正式開通的「轉數快」。它是全球獨一無二的零售快速支付系統，打破香港各種電子支付工具和銀行帳戶之間的屏障，讓市民享受全年無休的港元和人民幣即時轉帳服務。金管局還同步推出全球首個「共用二維碼」標準和應用程式，商戶可憑單個二維碼接通多個電子支付系統。「轉數快」推出以來深受市民歡迎，短短半年，登記紀錄已逾258萬個，日均交易量達6萬宗，平均每宗金額分別20,700港元和38,000元人民幣。\n\n去年5月，金管局發出虛擬銀行的認可指引，隨即有33家機構提交虛擬銀行牌照的申請。截至今年四月中，四個牌照已經發出，預期它們將於年內正式投入營運。虛擬銀行有助推動香港金融科技發展和創新，為個人和中小企提供嶄新服務和體驗，並促進普及金融。\n\n此外，金管局在7月發布開放應用程式介面(OpenAPI)框架，銀行將分四階段開放產品和服務的對外接口，開創更靈活、更開放的金融科技環境，讓銀行客戶更便捷地整合帳戶資料、獲取資訊，選取貼合自己需要的服務。年內，共有42項新科技產品使用金管局的金融科技監管沙盒進行測試，當中28項完成試行，有關產品和服務已順利推出市場。\n\n金管局聯同多家銀行研發的「貿易聯動」去年10月正式啟用，這個採用「分布式分類帳技術」的貿易融資平台，將提升銀行審批貿易融資的效率。「貿易聯動」目前正在測試連接其他地區相關平台，以促進跨境貿易融資活動。\n\n金融科技不但廣泛應用於日常生活，近年更走進合規和監管領域。金管局鼓勵銀行運用合規科技(Regtech)協助處理日常營運如監察涉嫌洗錢和恐怖分子資金籌集的可疑活動。與此同時金管局正研究使用監管科技(Suptech)，進一步提升監管工作的效率和成效。\n\n# 金融實力 鞏固提升\n\n國際金融中心之間是軟實力的較量，我們要不斷順應經濟社會和科技發展的變化，把握機遇，不斷為香港金融業開拓新的發展空間。綠色金融就是香港開拓債券和項目融資市場的一個重大機遇。金管局支持和配合特區政府發展綠色金融，除了配合特區政府籌備1,000億港元的政府綠色債券發行計劃，我們去年還舉辦多場綠色金融研討會，包括兩場國際大型會議，以提升市場對綠色金融的認識、了解和參與，並鼓勵發行機構參與政府去年推出的綠色債券資助計劃和香港的綠色金融認證服務。去年在港發行綠色債券規模逾110億美元，相等於2017年的三倍多。\n\n近年來投資界對基建和相關項目興趣日濃。金管局於2016年成立基建融資促進辦公室(IFFO)，合作夥伴至今已倍增至95家機構，成為區內基建融資的重要交流平台。去年金管局與國務院國有資產監督管理委員會（國資委）首次合辦高層圓桌會議，討論香港為中央國有企業「走出去」的獨特優勢和作用，為央企與香港金融、專業服務界日後共拓發展機遇奠下良好基礎。", "en": "# President reports\n\n\"The 2018 season will be the 10th anniversary of the global financial crisis, and the 10th season of the international political situation, with a dramatic turn of events beyond what the best scriptwriters could have imagined\".\n\n# Link is strong, trust is strong\n\nHong Kong's financial system has remained stable and the money market has been operating smoothly despite the unpredictable external environment. The implementation of the 35 year old pegged rate system has successfully withstood the test of the outflow of funds from the HKD. Since the global financial crisis, funds worth about HKD 10,000 billion have accumulated in the HKD. Last year, as the US interest rate rose, the HKD interest rate gap continued to expand, the \"Hong Kong dollar buy\" package interest rate activity increased, the HKD pegged to the US dollar peg weakened at the beginning of the year, and the \"weak link exchange guarantee\" issued in 2005 was issued again 26 times since the first touch in April. The Hong Kong government has been able to maintain its position in the Hong Kong market by regulating the weak link exchange guarantee in accordance with the established mechanism, implementing the \"Hong Kong dollar buy\" pegged to the US dollar, in an orderly and transparent manner.\n\n# Banking system is stable\n\nThe global financial crisis of 2008 exposed the hidden flaws and risks of the global financial system, prompting international coordination over the past decade to launch a series of reforms aimed at financial markets and financial institutions, including improving corporate governance and risk management in banking supervision. The Banking Supervision Authority's banking supervision work focuses on two aspects: one is the prudential supervision of the risk of bank assets and liabilities, and the other is the conduct of banks, both of which are irrevocable. As for the supervision of the risk of asset and liabilities, the Banking Supervision Authority, as a member of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the Financial Stability Board under the Group of Twenty, is responsible for the comprehensive implementation of international regulatory standards and ensuring the sound operation of Hong Kong banks.\n\nIn view of the continuing rise in house prices, the KBA has launched eight rounds of countercyclical measures between 2009 and 2017 to ensure that the banking system in Hong Kong has sufficient earthquake resistance to deal with the impact of a reversal in the real estate market. These measures have been effective: the average mortgage rate for new homes decreased from 64% in 2009 to 46% at the end of 2018; the average supply and interest rate also decreased from 41% in 2010 to 34% at the end of 2018. Bank credit recorded a moderate growth of 4.4% during the year, overall asset quality remained good, the retail bank bad loan ratio gradually decreased to 0.5%, far below the international average and the historical level of Hong Kong. Last year, the banking industry continued to grow, and the overall shareholder return rose to 13% for the second year in a row.\n\n#Culture is good and stable\n\nIn 2010, we added the Banking Conduct Department to regulate the conduct of banks, promote bank fairness and hospitality, and strengthen consumer rights. In addition to setting various regulatory requirements for the basic conduct of banking operations, we have strongly promoted the reform of banking culture in recent years, encouraging banks to promote a culture of stability in three aspects of governance, reward system, evaluation and feedback mechanism, and seeking to achieve internal efficiency, fundamentally restoring and enhancing customer trust and respect for banks. Following the guidance of the Banking Conduct Department to the whole banking system in 2017, the Banking Conduct Authority will gradually introduce banking culture supervision measures at the end of 2018, including the requirement to provide self-evaluation on the implementation of measures related to banking enterprises and culture, and the effective implementation of the three pillars of banking culture.\n\nAlthough Internet and mobile finance are global trends, the KIC continued to promote financial inclusion last year, taking care of communities that were unable to apply new technologies. For example, we partnered with the Hong Kong Banking Association to launch convenience stores, which have grown to over 300 stores through the \"easy to manage\" free shopping withdrawal service. We also contacted the Hong Kong Post Office to launch convenience stores in 7 mainly remote and new border post offices.\n\n#SmartBank is a new experience\n\nThe Ministry of Finance, in close cooperation with the banking and technology industry, launched the \"New Era of Smart Banking\" in September 2017, promoting the development and innovation of financial technology in Hong Kong, bringing a new payment and banking experience to citizens. The highlight of 2018 was undoubtedly the \"Quick Transfer\" which was officially opened in September. It is the world's unique retail quick payment system, breaking the barriers between various electronic payment tools and bank accounts in Hong Kong, allowing citizens to enjoy the Hong Kong and RMB instant transfer service all year round.\n\nThe virtual banking licensing guidelines issued by the CBA in May last year were followed by 33 applications for virtual banking licenses. As of mid-April, four licenses have been issued and they are expected to be operational within the year. Virtual banks help drive the development and innovation of financial technology in Hong Kong, providing new services and experiences for individuals and SMEs, and promoting financial inclusion.\n\nIn addition, the Bank will open the external interface of products and services in four phases, creating a more flexible and open financial technology environment, allowing bank customers to more easily integrate account information, access information, and choose the services that suit their needs. In total, 42 new technology products were tested using the Fintech Supervisory Sandbox of the Bank in July.\n\nTrade Connect, a platform developed by the Ministry of Finance in collaboration with several banks and launched in October last year, uses \"distributed ledger technology\" to improve the efficiency of banks approving trade finance. Trade Connect is currently testing connections to other platforms in other regions to facilitate cross-border trade finance activities.\n\nIn addition to its widespread application in everyday life, Fintech has also moved into the field of compliance and regulation in recent years. The Fintech Authority encourages banks to use regulated technology (Regtech) to help handle daily operations such as monitoring suspected money laundering and terrorist fundraising activities. At the same time, the Fintech Authority is studying the use of supervisory technology (Suptech) to further improve the efficiency and effectiveness of regulatory work.\n\n#Financial strengths are growing stronger\n\nGreen finance is a major opportunity for Hong Kong to develop bond and project finance markets. In addition to supporting the HK$100 billion government green bond issuance program, we held several green finance seminars last year, including two major international conferences, to raise awareness, understanding and participation in the green finance market, and encourage issuers to participate in the government's green bond funding program launched last year and Hong Kong's green financial certification service. Last year, more than $11 billion worth of green bonds were issued in Hong Kong, equivalent to more than three times the size of 2017.\n\nIn recent years, the interest in infrastructure and related projects has increased. The IFFO, which was established in 2016 and has grown to 95 partners, has become an important platform for exchanging information on infrastructure financing in the region. Last year, the IFFO and the State Council's State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SEASAC) held the first high-level roundtable meeting to discuss the unique advantages and role of \"going out\" of Hong Kong's central state-owned enterprises, laying a good foundation for the future development opportunities of central enterprises and Hong Kong's financial and professional services industry."}

{"zh": "# 金管局簡介\n\n香港金融管理局是香港的中央銀行機構，主要職能有4項：在聯繫匯率制度的架構內維持貨幣穩定；促進金融體系（包括銀行體系）的穩定與健全；協助鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位，包括維持與發展香港的金融基建；以及管理外匯基金。\n\n# 金管局的法定授權\n\n立法會（前稱立法局）於1992年通過《外匯基金條例》修訂條文，授權財政司司長（前稱財政司）委任金融管理專員，金管局隨後在1993年4月1日成立。\n\n金融管理專員的權力、職能及責任由《外匯基金條例》、《銀行業條例》、《金融機構（處置機制）條例》、《存款保障計劃條例》、《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》及其他有關條例明文規定。財政司司長與金融管理專員於2003年6月25日的互換函件，列載彼此在貨幣與金融事務方面的職能與責任的分配，亦披露財政司司長將若干權力轉授金融管理專員。有關函件為公開文件，可於金管局網站查閱。\n\n外匯基金根據《外匯基金條例》設立，由財政司司長掌有控制權。該條例規定外匯基金須主要運用於影響港元匯價。財政司司長亦可運用外匯基金以保持香港貨幣金融體系的穩定與健全，藉此保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。\n\n金融管理專員根據《外匯基金條例》委任，以協助財政司司長執行其根據該條例獲授予的職能，以及執行其他條例及財政司司長所指派的職能。金融管理專員的辦公室稱為金管局，金融管理專員即為金管局總裁。\n\n金融管理專員根據《銀行業條例》賦予的職責及權力，規管及監管銀行業務與接受存款業務。根據《銀行業條例》，金融管理專員負責處理香港持牌銀行、有限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司的認可資格事宜。\n\n《金融機構（處置機制）條例》指定金融管理專員為銀行界實體的處置機制當局。該條例賦予金融管理專員一系列權力，對有關實體進行有秩序處置，以減低有關實體不可持續經營對香港金融體系的穩定及有效運作構成的風險。\n\n《證券及期貨條例》及《強制性公積金計劃條例》賦予金融管理專員若干有關銀行證券及強制性公積金業務的權力。\n\n《保險業條例》訂明可就銀行的保險業務向金融管理專員轉授查察及調查權力。\n\n《打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集條例》賦權金融管理專員監管銀行遵守該條例的規定。\n\n《存款保障計劃條例》授予金融管理專員責任，就存款保障計劃的運作提供協助，以及啟動從存款保障計劃基金向無力償付銀行的存款人發放補償。\n\n金融管理專員在《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》的法定架構下，可指定及監察對香港貨幣或金融穩定或對香港發揮作為國際金融中心的功能事關重要的結算及交收系統。該條例亦授權金融管理專員管理儲值支付工具發牌制度，及指定零售支付系統並監察該等系統的運作是否安全及有效率。\n\n# 金管局與香港特別行政區政府\n\n金管局是香港特別行政區政府架構的一部分，但可以按與公務員不同的聘用條款聘請員工，以吸引具適當經驗與專門知識的人才。金管局總裁及其員工均為公職人員。金管局的日常運作，在金融管理專員所獲賦予或轉授的法定權力範圍內高度自主。\n\n財政司司長負責釐定香港的貨幣政策目標及貨幣體制：財政司司長於2003年6月25日致金融管理專員的函件中，訂明應透過貨幣發行局制度維持貨幣穩定，將港元匯率保持在約7.80港元兌1美元的水平。金融管理專員須自行負責達成貨幣政策目標，包括決定有關的策略、工具及執行方式，並負責維持香港貨幣制度的穩定與健全。\n\n財政司司長在財經事務及庫務局局長的協助下，負責維持香港金融體系穩定與健全，以及保持香港的國際金融中心地位的政策。為推行這些政策，金融管理專員的職責包括：\n- 促進銀行體系的整體穩定與有效運作\n- 與其他有關機構與組織合作，發展債務市場\n- 處理與法定紙幣及硬幣的發行及流通有關的事宜\n- 透過發展支付、結算及交收系統，以及在適當情況下負責操作有關系統，促進金融基建的安全與效率\n- 與其他有關機構與組織合作，促進對香港貨幣及金融體系的信心，並推行適當的發展市場措施，以協助加強香港金融服務的國際競爭力。\n\n外匯基金由財政司司長掌有控制權。金融管理專員須根據財政司司長轉授的權力，就外匯基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 問責性與透明度\n\n就日常運作及推行政府政策目標所採用的方法，金管局一直保持高度自主，並同時輔以高問責性及透明度。\n\n金管局致力促進貨幣與銀行體系穩定，有效管理官方儲備，發展與監察穩健及多元化的金融基建，從而鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位，推動香港經濟發展。\n\n金管局要有效履行職責，便必須取得社會人士的信心。因此，金管局以嚴謹的態度，履行向公眾解釋其政策及工作的責任，並盡力處理社會上備受關注而涉及金管局職責範圍的事項。\n\n金融管理專員由財政司司長委任，因此金管局透過財政司司長向公眾負責；而由於金管局的職權由立法會通過的法律制訂，因此金管局亦透過立法會向公眾負責。此外，金管局亦明白本身肩負更廣泛的責任，就是促進公眾對金管局角色及目標的認識，並密切留意社會人士所關注的事項。金管局在執行日常工作及與社會保持廣泛聯繫時，堅守盡力提高透明度及保持開放的政策。這項政策有兩大目標：\n- 在顧及市場敏感性、商業秘密及機密資料披露的法定限制下，盡量使金融界及公眾充分了解金管局的工作；\n- 確保金管局掌握社會脈搏，並對公眾意見作出適當回應。\n\n金管局在透明度方面致力達致國際最高標準，與傳媒保持廣泛聯繫之餘，亦出版各種中英文期刊及專題刊物。金管局的雙語網站(www.hkma.gov.hk)除有專門環節列載經濟研究、統計資料、消費者資訊及其他課題外，還載有金管局出版的刊物、新聞稿、演辭及簡報會資料文件。此外，金管局又利用社交媒體平台，以能在數碼時代中更有效與公眾溝通。金管局辦事處設有資訊中心，分為圖書館及展覽館兩部分，每星期開放6日予公眾參觀及使用。金管局亦舉辦公眾教育活動，透過講座及資訊中心導賞服務，向公眾人士（特別是學生）講解金管局的工作，以及增進市民的金融知識。有關金管局的傳媒聯繫工作、刊物及公眾教育活動的詳細資料，見「機構職能」一章。\n\n金管局公布外匯基金及貨幣發行局帳目資料的次數，一直逐步增加，內容亦越趨詳細。金管局於1999年開始參與國際貨幣基金組織的中央銀行「數據公布特殊標準」計劃。金管局亦公布外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下貨幣發行委員會的會議紀錄，以及貨幣發行局制度運作報告。自1996年起，金管局網站亦載有銀行業監管政策及指引。\n\n金管局與立法會的關係對提高問責性及透明度非常重要。金管局總裁承諾每年3次向立法會財經事務委員會簡報金管局各項工作及政策，並回答有關查詢。此外，金管局代表亦會不時出席立法會財經事務委員會及法案委員會會議，闡釋及商討特別事項，以及協助議員審閱條例草案。\n\n# 諮詢委員會及其他委員會\n\n# 外匯基金諮詢委員會\n\n財政司司長行使外匯基金的控制權時，會聽取外匯基金諮詢委員會的意見。外匯基金諮詢委員會根據《外匯基金條例》第3(1)條成立。該項條文訂明財政司司長行使對外匯基金的控制權時，須諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會的意見。財政司司長為外匯基金諮詢委員會的當然主席，其他委員（包括金融管理專員）則以個人身分，由財政司司長根據香港特別行政區行政長官的授權委任。委員因各具專業知識及經驗而獲委任，他們的加入讓外匯基金諮詢委員會廣受裨益。委員的專業知識及經驗涵蓋貨幣、金融、經濟、投資、會計、管理、商業及法律等範疇。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會下設5個專責委員會，負責監察金管局特定環節的工作，並透過外匯基金諮詢委員會向財政司司長報告及提出建議。外匯基金諮詢委員會在2018年共舉行5次會議，討論各項與金管局工作有關的事宜，其中大部分事項均由有關的專責委員會事先進行討論。\n\n管治委員會監察金管局的表現，以及就金管局薪酬與服務條件、人力資源政策、財政預算、行政及管治事務，向外匯基金諮詢委員會提出建議。該委員會在2018年共召開5次會議，內容涵蓋金管局的開支預算、表現評估、年度薪酬檢討及策略性規劃事宜。該委員會亦審議金管局定期提交的工作報告。\n\n審核委員會檢討金管局的財政匯報程序，並評核其內部管控制度是否足夠和有效，以及提交報告。審核委員會負責檢視金管局的財務報表，編製該等報表的組成項目與會計原則，並聯同外部及內部審計師查核其審計範疇與結果。審核委員會各委員在金管局並沒有任何行政職能。該委員會在2018年共召開2次會議，並審議風險委員會及內部審核處的工作報告。\n\n貨幣發行委員會監察貨幣發行局制度的運作，並匯報這個作為香港聯繫匯率制度支柱的情況。該委員會負責確保貨幣發行局制度按照既定政策運作、提出改進該制度的建議，以及確保該制度的運作維持高透明度。金管局定期公布貨幣發行委員會的會議紀錄及提交該委員會的貨幣發行局制度運作報告。該委員會在2018年共召開4次會議。", "en": "# The Gold Board brief\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is the central banking institution of Hong Kong. Its main functions are to maintain monetary stability within the framework of the pegged exchange rate system; to promote the stability and soundness of the financial system (including the banking system); to help consolidate Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre, including maintaining and developing Hong Kong's financial infrastructure; and to manage the foreign exchange reserves.\n\n#Government of Gold has legal authority\n\nThe Legislative Council (formerly the Legislative Bureau) passed the 1992 Amendment to the Coat of Arms Fund Regulations, authorizing the Director of the Department of Finance (formerly the Department of Finance) to appoint a Financial Management Officer. The Gold Authority was subsequently established on 1 April 1993.\n\nThe powers, duties and responsibilities of the Financial Controller are set out in the OTC Funds Regulations, the Banking Regulations, the Financial Institutions (Custody) Regulations, the Deposit Guarantee Scheme Regulations, the Payment Systems and the Payment Instruments Regulations, and other relevant regulations. The Exchange of Letters between the Director of Finance and the Financial Controller dated 25 June 2003 lists the allocation of duties and responsibilities in respect of monetary and financial affairs, and discloses that the Director of Finance has delegated certain powers to the Financial Controller. The corresponding letter is a public document, available on the website of the Financial Administration.\n\nThe Fund is established under the Fund Regulations and controlled by the Chief Financial Officer. The Chief Financial Officer may also use the Fund to maintain the stability and soundness of the monetary financial system in Hong Kong, thereby maintaining Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre.\n\nThe Financial Controller is appointed by the President of the Board of Governors of the United States Federal Reserve System under the Overseas Funds Act to assist the Director of Finance in the exercise of the functions conferred upon him by that Act, and to perform such other functions as may be assigned to him by the Director of Finance. The office of the Financial Controller is called the Gold Board, and the Financial Controller is the President of the Gold Board.\n\nThe Financial Controller is responsible for regulating and supervising banking and deposit-taking activities in Hong Kong, in accordance with the Hong Kong Banking Regulations. The Financial Controller is responsible for handling the licensing of Hong Kong banks, limited-licensed banks and deposit-taking companies.\n\nThe Financial Institutions (Settlement Mechanism) Ordinance designates the Financial Controller as the settlement mechanism authority for banking sector entities. The Ordinance gives the Financial Controller a series of powers to conduct orderly settlement of entities in order to reduce the risks to the stability and efficient functioning of the Hong Kong financial system related to the unsustainable operation of entities.\n\nThe Securities and Futures Regulations and the Mandatory Public Deposit Scheme Regulations confer certain powers on the Financial Controller with respect to the securities and compulsory deposit operations of banks.\n\nThe Insurance Regulations of the Bank of China (RIA) amended the RIA to transfer the power of inspection and investigation of the insurance business of the bank to the Financial Management Commissioner.\n\nThe Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is the government agency responsible for enforcing the Financial Conduct Authority (FCMA) regulations on money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\nThe Deposit Guarantee Scheme Regulations conferred on the Financial Management Officer the responsibility of assisting in the operation of the Deposit Guarantee Scheme and initiating the issuance of compensation from the Deposit Guarantee Scheme Fund to the depositor of the bank who is unable to pay.\n\nUnder the legal framework of the Payment Systems and Value Added Instruments Regulations, the Financial Regulator may designate and supervise settlement and delivery systems that are important to the monetary or financial stability of Hong Kong or to Hong Kong's function as an international financial centre. The Regulations also authorise the Financial Regulator to manage the licensing system for value added payment instruments, and to designate retail payment systems and supervise the operation of such systems for safety and efficiency.\n\n#Government and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region\n\nThe Directorate is part of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government structure, but can hire staff on different terms from civil servants to attract talent with appropriate experience and expertise. The Directorate's President and staff are all civil servants. The day-to-day operations of the Directorate are highly autonomous within the scope of the statutory powers granted or delegated to the Financial Management Commissioner.\n\nThe Director of Finance is responsible for determining Hong Kong's monetary policy objectives and monetary system. In a letter to the Financial Management Committee dated 25 June 2003, the Director of Finance clarified that the monetary policy objective of Hong Kong is to maintain monetary stability through the monetary board system, maintaining the HKD exchange rate at around 7.80 HKD to the dollar. The Financial Management Committee is responsible for determining the monetary policy objectives, including the relevant strategies, tools and methods of implementation, and for maintaining the stability and soundness of the Hong Kong monetary system.\n\nThe Director of Finance, assisted by the Director of the Office of Financial Affairs and Treasury, is responsible for maintaining the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's financial system and policies to maintain Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre. To implement these policies, the Financial Management Officer's duties include: - promoting the overall stability and effective functioning of the banking system - cooperating with other relevant institutions and organizations, developing the debt market - handling issues related to the issuance and circulation of legal tender and coins - promoting the safety and efficiency of the financial base through the development of the payment, settlement and delivery system, and, where appropriate, the operation of the relevant system - cooperating with other relevant institutions and organizations, promoting confidence in Hong Kong's currency and financial system, and implementing appropriate market development measures to help strengthen the international competitiveness of Hong Kong's financial services.\n\nThe Director of Finance has control over the foreign exchange fund. The Financial Management Officer is responsible to the Director of Finance for the operation and investment management of the foreign exchange fund, subject to the authority of the Director of Finance.\n\n# Accountability and transparency\n\nThe KIM has maintained a high degree of autonomy in its day-to-day operations and in the approach it takes to implement government policy objectives, while maintaining a high degree of accountability and transparency.\n\nThe Board is committed to promoting monetary and banking stability, effectively managing official reserves, developing and overseeing a stable and diversified financial infrastructure, and thereby consolidating Hong Kong's position as an international financial centre and driving Hong Kong's economic development.\n\nThe Board of Finance must earn the trust of the public to effectively carry out its duties. Therefore, the Board of Finance is rigorous in its approach to explaining its policies and work to the public and in dealing with matters of concern to the public that are within the scope of the Board's duties.\n\nThe Financial Controller is appointed by the Director of Finance, and therefore the Financial Controller is accountable to the public through the Director of Finance; and since the functions of the Financial Controller are regulated by laws passed by the Legislative Assembly, the Financial Controller is also accountable to the public through the Legislative Assembly. In addition, the Financial Controller understands that it has a broader responsibility to promote public awareness of the role and objectives of the Financial Controller and to keep a close eye on the concerns of the public.\n\nIn addition to its bilingual website (www.hkma.gov.hk), the HMAS also publishes special sections listing economic research, statistics, consumer information and other topics, as well as publications, press releases, presentations and briefing documents published by the HMAS. In addition, the HMAS uses social media platforms to communicate more effectively with the public in the digital age. The HMAS has an information center, divided into two sections of libraries and galleries, open to the public for viewing and use 6 days a week. The HMAS also organizes public education events, conducting lectures and information center services to the public, awarding prizes to students, especially students.\n\nThe Ministry of Finance has published the accounts of the OTC Funds and the Money Issuing Office (MEA) more and more frequently. The Ministry of Finance has been participating in the International Monetary Fund's Central Bank \"Special Standard for Data Publication\" program since 1999. The Ministry of Finance also publishes the minutes of the meetings of the Committee on Money Issuing under the OTC Funds Advisory Committee, as well as the report on the operation of the MEA system. Since 1996, the Ministry of Finance website also contains banking supervision policies and guidelines.\n\nThe relationship between the Treasury and the Legislature is important for accountability and transparency. The Treasury President undertakes to brief the Legislature's Finance Committee three times a year on the Treasury's work and policies and to respond to inquiries. In addition, Treasury representatives also attend the Legislature's Finance Committee and Bill Committee meetings from time to time to explain and discuss special matters and to assist the Legislature in reviewing draft regulations.\n\n# Advisory Committee and other committees\n\n# Advisory Committee of the Export Fund\n\nThe Director of Finance is the Chairman of the Advisory Committee of the Outer Rim Fund, and the other members (including the Financial Management Committee) are appointed by the Director of Finance on the basis of the authorization of the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. The members of the Advisory Committee of the Outer Rim Fund are appointed by the Director of Finance on the basis of their expertise and experience, which makes them a valuable asset to the Outer Rim Fund Advisory Committee. The expertise and experience of the members of the Advisory Committee of the Outer Rim Fund covers the fields of monetary, financial, economic, investment, management, accounting, business and legal affairs.\n\nThe OFC Advisory Board has five specialized committees that oversee the work of the OFC's specific areas and report and make recommendations to the Director of Finance through the OFC Advisory Board. The OFC Advisory Board held five meetings in 2018 to discuss matters related to the work of the OFC, most of which were discussed in advance by the relevant specialized committees.\n\nThe Board of Governors monitors the performance of the Board of Governors and makes recommendations to the Advisory Board of the OTC Fund on the Board's remuneration and conditions of service, human resources policy, financial budgeting, and administrative and governance matters. The Board of Governors held five meetings in 2018 to cover the Board's expenditure budget, performance evaluation, annual remuneration review, and strategic planning matters. The Board also reviews the Board's regularly submitted work reports.\n\nThe Audit Committee reviews the financial reporting procedures of the Gold Authority and evaluates the adequacy and effectiveness of its internal control system, and submits reports. The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing the financial statements of the Gold Authority, formulating the composition and accounting principles of such statements, and reviewing its audit scope and results in conjunction with external and internal auditors. The Audit Committee has no administrative functions at the Gold Authority. The Committee held two meetings in 2018 and reviewed the work reports of the Risk Committee and the Internal Audit Bureau.\n\nThe Committee on Currency Issues monitors and reports on the functioning of the CBMS as the backbone of the Hong Kong's contactless exchange rate system.

{"zh": "# 經濟及金融環境\n\n2018年香港經濟持續擴張，不過隨着金融狀況收緊及貿易保護主義升溫令不明朗因素增加，增長動力於年內有所減弱。隨着全球經濟增長轉弱，預期2019年香港經濟增長亦會減慢。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 實體經濟活動\n\n2018年香港經濟進一步擴張，不過按年增長速度由第1季的4.6%，逐步減慢至第4季的1.3%（表1），並拖累全年增長率由2017年的3.8%下降至3.0%。經濟擴張轉弱，反映本地需求增長減慢以及經濟持續受淨出口所拖累（圖1）。本地方面，私人消費在第1季強勁增長，但其後增長動力減弱，部分反映貿易保護主義升溫令不明朗因素增加，以及本地資產價格調整帶來的財富減值效應。由於營商信心脆弱，整體投資支出的增長速度亦放緩。外圍方面，貨品出口於首3季大致保持平穩，但在第4季隨着中美貿易摩擦加劇而顯著轉差。貨品進口亦因為出口帶動的需求轉弱而放緩。相比之下，服務輸出錄得較快的全年增長，部分是受惠於訪港旅遊業表現蓬勃，而服務輸入則由於運輸、商業及其他服務增長而得以大致維持增長動力。按淨額計，貿易差額由2017年的順差轉為2018年的小幅逆差，並拖累本地經濟增長。\n\n表1 按開支項目計的實質本地生產總值增長（比對上期）\n\n註：本地固定資本形成總額經季節因素調整的按季增減幅度不詳。\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n圖1 組成部分對實質本地生產總值增長的貢獻\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 貨幣狀況\n\n主要受到港元與美元負息差下的套息活動所影響，港元兌美元匯率在2018年大致回軟。尤其弱方兌換保證在4月、5月及8月被觸發，促使金管局按照聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）所定，在7.85港元兌1美元的水平，向銀行購入港元及沽出美元。按照聯匯制度的設計，港元貨幣基礎因而收縮，表示銀行同業流動性減少，再加上市場預期美國加息，導致港元銀行同業拆息整體上升。由於銀行體系資金成本上升，銀行於9月下旬在美國聯邦基金利率目標區間上調後，調高最優惠貸款利率12.5至25基點。信貸增長方面，部分由於本地經濟增長放緩以及對外貿易表現轉弱，整體銀行貸款的增幅由2017年的16.1%，顯著減慢至2018年的4.4%。\n\n# 通脹\n\n通脹壓力於2018年略為增加。剔除政府一次性紓緩措施的影響後，基本通脹率由2017年的1.7%低位，升至2018年的2.6%，不過仍屬於溫和水平。當中的住屋租金組成項目增幅較快，反映較早前新簽訂私人住宅租金上升的影響（圖2）。更廣泛的分析顯示，名義勞工成本及商用物業租金增長略為加快，令本地成本壓力更趨明顯。隨着香港部分主要進口來源地通脹上升，進口價格通脹亦因而攀升。\n\n圖2 基本消費物價通脹\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 勞工市場\n\n勞工市場狀況在2018年保持穩健（圖3）。失業率由2017年全年的3.1%下降至2018年的2.8%，是自1997年以來的最低水平。當中大部分主要服務行業的失業率都有所回落，特別是住宿及膳食服務業的跌幅更為顯著。隨着總就業人數及私營機構職位空缺進一步增加，整體勞工需求持續增強，而且勞動人口參與率亦輕微上升。在勞工市場狀況趨緊下，實質工資及收入進一步增加。\n\n圖3 勞工市場狀況\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 股市\n\n香港股市走勢在2018年大幅逆轉。恒生指數在2017年強勁的上升動力帶動下，於2018年1月升上33,484點的歷史高位（圖4）。然而，隨着主要中央銀行收緊貨幣政策、中美貿易摩擦加劇及本地經濟增長放緩引起投資者的憂慮，市場的樂觀情緒急劇逆轉。恒生指數在10月下挫至24,586點的低位，在年底則收報25,846點，較一年前下跌13.6%。然而，平均每日成交額則由2017年的882億港元上升至1,074億港元，本港首次公開招股集資總額亦因數間從事新興及創科產業的企業上市而大幅增加。\n\n圖4 資產價格\n資料來源：差餉物業估價署及香港交易及結算所有限公司。\n\n# 物業市場\n\n住宅物業市場在2018年上半年保持暢旺，不過在下半年隨着中美貿易摩擦加劇、環球股市調整及本港最優惠利率上升而有所降溫。整體樓價在7月至12月期間由高位回落9%，然而全年計仍錄得2%的升幅（圖4）。由於一手及二手市場的買賣活動於下半年顯著減少，所以物業成交量在2018年亦較前一年下跌7%至57,247宗。此外，置業負擔能力仍然偏緊，樓價與收入比率以及收入槓桿比率分別為17.0及75.7，兩者均遠高於長期平均水平。另一方面，非住宅物業價格在2018年整體上升，惟接近年底時稍見回落。全年計，價格及租金均進一步上升，租金回報率則維持在低位。\n\n# 經濟前景\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n由於全球經濟增長放緩，預期2019年香港經濟增長將會減慢。尤其外圍環境充滿挑戰，預期香港出口表現仍會受壓。本地方面，雖然失業率低企及家庭收入增加將繼續支撐私人消費，但部分由於消費信心減弱及較早前的資產價格調整帶來的財富減值效應的影響，預期私人消費增長步伐會放緩。固定資本形成方面，雖然隨着房屋供應增加，樓宇及建造活動應會穩步增長，但面對經濟不明朗因素增加，企業對於資本投資可能會變得更為審慎。政府預測2019年實質本地生產總值增長率介乎2至3%之間，私營機構分析員的最新預測增幅則平均為2.3%。\n\n# 通脹及勞工市場\n\n由於包括香港在內的全球增長放緩，外圍物價及本地成本壓力或會得到紓緩，因此預期通脹壓力在2019年仍保持溫和。近期新簽訂住宅租金回落，亦會對通脹產生壓抑作用。市場共識預測2019年整體通脹率為2.2%，政府預期基本通脹率則為2.5%。預期在經濟持續增長及訪港旅遊業維持暢旺下，勞工市場狀況會繼續偏緊。私營機構分析員預計失業率於2019年會維持於約3%的水平。\n\n# 不明朗因素及風險\n\n2019年經濟前景受貿易摩擦、美國貨幣政策未來方向、內地經濟表現、英國脫歐及其他地緣政治局勢等不明朗因素及風險所影響。另外，一旦上述的不明朗因素加劇並長期持續，金融市場情緒及營商信心或會大受影響，對本地資產市場及實體經濟活動構成下行壓力。\n\n另外，住宅物業市場受眾多外圍及本地因素所影響，其前景並不明朗。外圍方面，中美貿易摩擦的不確定性將有可能影響市場情緒、經濟前景及金融狀況，使香港物業市場前景繼續蒙上陰影。本地方面，雖然經濟增長放緩，但就業情況及收入增長仍大致穩定，或可支持住宅物業需求。本港利率的走勢某程度上視乎美國未來的政策利率變動，惟後者走勢並不明確。長遠而言，由於過去幾年住宅落成量有所增加，加上政府致力增加土地及房屋供應，預期房屋供求缺口或會收窄。\n\n# 銀行體系表現\n\n儘管外圍不利因素增加，例如中美貿易衝突、英國脫歐及利率正常化，令金融市場波動加劇，香港銀行體系在2018年仍然穩健。銀行體系的資本及流動性狀況穩健，資產質素保持良好。利率趨升令息差擴闊，刺激銀行盈利顯著增加。\n\n# 資產負債表走勢\n\n2018年銀行體系繼續穩步增長，資產負債表擴大5.9%。面對經濟不明朗因素持續，例如主要經濟體之間的貿易衝突及加息等，企業在獲取新貸款方面變得較為保守。年內貸款總額增幅放緩至4.4%，而2017年為16.1%。有關增長受在香港使用的貸款（+6.5%）及在香港境外使用的貸款（+2%）同告增加帶動。另一方面，由於環球貿易環境不明朗，貿易融資下跌7.6%。中國內地相關貸款的增長亦由2017年的17.5%放緩至2018年的1.4%。\n\n銀行體系持有的債務證券總額在2018年底繼續佔總資產的22%，與2017年一樣。由於這些債務證券大部分為政府及銀行發行的投資級別債務證券，因此有關信用風險維持在低水平。\n\n就負債方而言，存款總額在2018年增加5%，較2017年（+8.7%）的增幅小。由於預期美國持續加息，部分銀行上調定期存款利率，吸引存戶將往來及儲蓄存款轉為定期存款，從而鎖定資金。往來及儲蓄存款佔存款總額的比例由對上一年的57.4%，降至2018年底的51.4%，導致資金成本上升。由於存款總額的增長較貸款總額快，整體貸存比率由2017年底的73%稍降至2018年底的72.6%（圖5）。\n\n圖5 銀行體系的貸款及存款\n\n# 資本充足水平\n\n銀行體系資本相當充裕，表示其具備強大緩衝以抵禦潛在衝擊。資本比率處於自實施《巴塞爾協定三》以來的歷史高位；本地註冊認可機構的綜合總資本比率由2017年底的19.1%，增加至2018年底的20.3%（圖6）。\n\n圖6 本地註冊認可機構的綜合資本比率\n\n《巴塞爾協定三》槓桿比率於2018年1月1日生效；該比率是一項非風險為本規定，旨在限制銀行體系過度累積槓桿。於2018年底，槓桿比率為8.0%，遠高於3%的法定最低要求（圖7）。\n\n圖7 本地註冊認可機構的綜合槓桿比率\n\n# 流動性狀況\n\n銀行體系的流動性狀況維持穩健，反映其具備強大能力，可有效承受來自潛在金融及經濟壓力的衝擊。短期流動性（涵蓋1個月期資金）方面，第1類機構的平均流動性覆蓋比率在第4季為167.6%，遠高於2018年適用的90%法定最低要求。第2類機構的平均流動性維持比率為54.3%，亦遠高於25%的法定最低要求（圖8）。", "en": "#Economic and financial environment\n\nThe economy continued to expand in 2018, but the growth momentum weakened over the year as financial conditions tightened and trade protectionism heated up. Growth in 2019 is expected to slow as global growth weakens.\n\n# Economic reflection\n\n# Physical economic activity\n\nThe Hong Kong economy continued to expand in 2018, but the annual growth rate decreased from 4.6% in Q1 to 1.3% in Q4 (Table 1), and the annual growth rate decreased from 3.8% in 2017 to 3.0%. The economic expansion weakened, reflecting the slowdown in domestic demand growth and the continued drag on net exports (Figure 1). Domestically, private consumption grew strongly in Q1, but the growth momentum weakened afterwards, partly reflecting the increase in trade protectionism and uncertain factors, as well as the depreciation effect of adjusted domestic asset prices. The growth rate of investment expenditure slowed down in the first three quarters of the year.\n\nTable 1 Growth of real gross domestic product by item of expenditure (over the previous period)\n\nNote: The quarterly increase or decrease in the gross domestic product (GDP) of the country adjusted for seasonal factors is not known. Source: Government Statistics Bureau.\n\nFigure 1 shows the contribution of the sector to the growth of real GDP. Source: Office of Government Statistics.\n\n# The state of the currency\n\nThe HKD dollar appreciation was largely affected by the hedge activity in the HKD/USD interest rate differential. In particular, weak swap guarantees were triggered in April, May and August, prompting the MDA to buy HKD and sell HKD to banks at the level of HKD $1.75 as set by the linkage rate system (linkage system). According to the design of the linkage system, the HKD currency base shrank, indicating reduced banking and liquidity, coupled with market expectations of US interest rate increases, leading to an overall rise in HKD banking and interest rate discounting. Due to the rising cost of the banking system, the bank raised its subsidized loan rate to 12.5 to 25 basis points in late September, after the US Federal Reserve target zone.\n\n# The Gathering\n\nThe inflation pressure increased slightly in 2018 in Hong Kong. After the impact of the government's one-off easing measures, the underlying inflation rate rose from a low of 1.7% in 2017 to 2.6% in 2018, but remained at a moderate level. The increase in the housing rental component was faster, reflecting the impact of the rise in private residential rentals signed earlier (Figure 2).\n\nFigure 2 Inflation in basic consumer goods Source: Office of Government Statistics\n\n# The labour market\n\nThe unemployment rate fell from 3.1% in the whole of 2017 to 2.8% in 2018, the lowest level since 1997. The decline was most pronounced in the major service industries, especially in the lodging and catering industry. The overall demand for labour continued to increase, and the participation rate of the labour force also increased slightly.\n\nFigure 3 Situation of the labour market. Source: Government Statistics\n\n# The stock market\n\nHong Kong stock market reversed sharply in 2018; the Hong Kong Stock Exchange Index rose to a record high of 33,484 points in January 2018 (Figure 4) driven by strong upward momentum in 2017; however, as major central banks tightened monetary policy, increased trade friction between China and the United States, and slowing local economic growth caused investor concern, the market's optimism reversed dramatically; the Hong Kong Stock Exchange Index fell to a low of 24,586 points in October, and at the end of the year it reported 25,846 points, down 13.6% from a year earlier; however, the average daily turnover rose from HK$8.2 billion in 2017 to HK$1.074 billion, and the total capital raised in Hong Kong's initial public offering increased significantly due to the number of enterprises and start-ups in the market.\n\nFigure 4 Asset prices Source: The Hong Kong Property Valuation Agency and the Hong Kong Trading and Settlement Ownership Limited\n\n# The property market\n\nThe residential property market remained buoyant in the first half of 2018, but cooled in the second half with increased trade friction between China and the United States, global stock market adjustments and the rise in the most favorable interest rate in Hong Kong. Overall, house prices fell from a high of 9% between July and December, but still recorded a 2% increase in the year as a whole (Figure 4). Due to the significant decline in buying and selling activity in the first-hand and second-hand markets in the second half of the year, the volume of property sales fell by 7% to 57,247 units in 2018 compared to a year earlier. In addition, the affordability of the real estate industry is still skewed, with house price-to-income ratio and income growth rate of 17.0 and 5.77, both well above the long-term average. On the other hand, non-residential property prices rose in 2018 as a whole, but fell slightly towards the end of the year.\n\n# Economic Prospects\n\n# The economic environment\n\nThe growth rate of private consumption is expected to slow down due to the slowdown in global economic growth. The external environment is particularly challenging, and Hong Kong's export performance is expected to remain depressed. On the local level, although low unemployment and increased household income will continue to support private consumption, the pace of private consumption growth is expected to slow down due to the impacts of reduced consumer confidence and the impacts of wealth depreciation brought by earlier asset price adjustments.\n\n#Community and the labour market\n\nWith global growth slowing, external price and local cost pressures may ease, inflationary pressures are expected to remain moderate in 2019. Recently, the rental of newly signed homes will also have a depressing effect on inflation. Market consensus forecasts an overall inflation rate of 2.2 percent in 2019, while the government forecasts a basic inflation rate of 2.5 percent. The labor market situation is expected to continue to be favorable as the economy continues to grow and tourism continues to flourish.\n\n# Unknown factors and risks\n\nThe 2019 economic outlook is affected by uncertainties and risks such as trade frictions, the future direction of U.S. monetary policy, domestic economic performance, Brexit and other geopolitical developments. In addition, once the above uncertainties intensify and persist for a long time, financial market sentiment and business confidence may be greatly affected, putting downward pressure on the composition of local asset markets and physical economic activity.\n\nIn addition, the housing market is affected by many external and local factors, and its outlook is unclear. On the external side, the uncertainty of China-US trade friction is likely to affect market sentiment, economic prospects and financial conditions, leaving the prospects of the Hong Kong property market in the shade. Although economic growth is slowing, employment and income growth are still largely stable or can support housing demand.\n\n# Banking system performance\n\nDespite the increase in external adverse factors such as the Sino-US trade conflict, Brexit and the normalization of interest rates, which has increased financial market volatility, the banking system in Hong Kong remained stable in 2018. The capital and liquidity situation of the banking system is stable, and the asset quality remains good. The trend of rising interest rates has widened the interest rate differential, stimulating significant increases in bank profits.\n\n# The asset and liability index is moving\n\nThe banking system continued to grow steadily, with the asset-liability ratio expanding by 5.9% in 2018. In the face of continued economic uncertainties, such as trade conflicts between major economies and interest rate hikes, enterprises became more conservative in obtaining new loans. The total loan growth slowed to 4.4% in the year, compared to 16.1% in 2017. The growth was driven by loans used in Hong Kong (+6.5%) and loans used outside Hong Kong (+2%) and the growth of trade finance fell by 7.6% due to the uncertain global trade environment. The growth of related loans in China also slowed from 17.5% in 2017 to 1.4% in 2018 and the growth of loans used outside Hong Kong (+6.5% in 2018).\n\nThe total amount of debt securities held by the banking system continued to account for 22% of total assets at the end of 2018, as in 2017. Since these debt securities are mostly investment-grade debt securities issued by governments and banks, the associated credit risk remains low.\n\nIn terms of debtors, total deposits increased by 5% in 2018 compared to 2017 (+8.7%). Due to the expected continuation of interest rates in the United States, some banks raised the interest rate on periodic deposits, attracting depositors to transfer future and savings deposits to periodic deposits, thereby locking the funds. The ratio of past and savings deposits to total deposits decreased from 57.4% compared to the previous year to 51.4% at the end of 2018, leading to an increase in the cost of capital. Due to the rapid growth of total deposits compared to total loans, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio decreased slightly from 73% at the end of 2017 to 72.6% at the end of 2018 (Figure 5).\n\nFigure 5 Loans and deposits in the banking system\n\n# Capital is sufficient\n\nThe banking system is well capitalized, indicating that it has strong buffers to withstand potential shocks. The capital ratio is at an all-time high since the implementation of the Basel III; the combined total capital ratio of locally registered accredited institutions increased from 19.1% at the end of 2017 to 20.3% at the end of 2018 (Figure 6).\n\nFigure 6 Capital ratio of locally registered accredited institutions\n\nThe Basel III leverage ratio came into effect on 1 January 2018; the ratio is a non-risk-based provision designed to limit excessive accumulation of leverage in the banking system. At the end of 2018, the leverage ratio was 8.0%, well above the statutory minimum requirement of 3% (Figure 7).\n\nFigure 7 Cement ratio of locally registered certified organizations\n\n# Mobility\n\nThe liquidity situation of the banking system remained stable, reflecting its strong capacity to effectively withstand the impact of potential financial and economic stresses. In terms of short-term liquidity (covering 1-month funds), the average liquidity coverage ratio of Category 1 institutions was 167.6% in Q4, well above the 90% statutory minimum requirement applicable in 2018. The average liquidity retention ratio of Category 2 institutions was 54.3%, well above the 25% statutory minimum requirement (Figure 8)."}
{"zh": "# 貨幣穩定\n\n2018年港元利率普遍上升，而港元現貨匯率則回軟，並貼近弱方兌換保證匯率的水平。儘管如此，港元外匯及貨幣市場運作仍然暢順有序。聯繫匯率制度是香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石，並繼續展現其承受強大衝擊的能力。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的主要目標是維持貨幣穩定，即確保港元匯價穩定，使港元在外匯市場兌美元的匯率保持在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的區間內。該貨幣體制主要採用貨幣發行局制度，規定由外匯基金所持的美元儲備向貨幣基礎提供最少百分之百的支持；貨幣基礎若有變動，美元儲備亦必須作出相應增減，與貨幣基礎的變動百分之百配合。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n- 負債證明書（為3間發鈔銀行發行的銀行紙幣提供十足支持）\n- 政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣\n- 銀行在金管局所持結算戶口的結餘總額（即總結餘）\n- 金管局代表政府發行的外匯基金票據及債券。\n\n金管局透過自動利率調節機制及履行兌換保證的堅決承諾來維持港元匯率的穩定。若市場對港元的需求大過供應，令市場匯率轉強至7.75港元兌1美元的強方兌換保證匯率，金管局會向銀行沽出港元、買入美元，使總結餘增加及港元利率下跌，從而令港元匯率從強方兌換保證匯率水平回復至7.75到7.85的兌換範圍內。相反，若港元供過於求，令市場匯率轉弱至7.85港元兌1美元的弱方兌換保證匯率，金管局會向銀行買入港元，使總結餘減少及推高港元利率，港元匯率隨之由弱方兌換保證匯率水平回復至兌換範圍內。\n\n# 2018年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n在港元與美元負息差擴闊帶動套息活動的背景下，港元匯率自年初以來逐步轉弱。於4月12日，弱方兌換保證在2005年訂於7.85水平以來首度被觸發。全年計，弱方兌換保證在2018年合共被觸發27次，分別在4月被觸發13次，5月6次，以及8月8次。儘管如此，港元交易仍然暢順有序，港元匯率於4月中至9月中在弱方兌換保證匯率7.85附近徘徊（圖1）。其後港元匯率略為轉強，部分反映假期、季結及年結臨近，銀行同業流動性收緊，帶動部分套息交易平倉。同時，某程度上港元亦受到11月初股市氣氛好轉支持。整體而言，港元外匯市場在2018年全年正常運作。\n\n圖1 2018年市場匯率\n\n由於弱方兌換保證被觸發，總結餘與未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額由2017年底的12,268億港元，下降至2018年底的11,362億港元（圖2）。年內，金管局按照聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）的設計，應銀行要求於弱方兌換保證匯率7.85的水平，購入合共1,035億港元，總結餘因而由2017年底的1,798億港元下降至2018年底的764億港元。年內未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額沒有明顯變動。貨幣基礎仍然由外匯儲備提供十足支持。\n\n於2018年底，總結餘與未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額為11,362億港元。\n\n圖2 2018年總結餘及未償還外匯基金票據及債券\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n由於觸發弱方兌換保證後銀行同業流動性減少，以及市場預期美國加息，香港銀行同業拆息在2018年內普遍上升。受新股集資活動相關的資金需求增加及季節性流動資金需求帶動，短期銀行同業拆息更出現較大波幅（圖3）。整體而言，短期銀行同業拆息在2018年大致維持在低於基本利率的水平。鑑於銀行體系資金成本上升，在9月下旬美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍上調後，銀行調高最優惠貸款利率12.5至25基點。\n\n因應年內美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍4次合共上調100基點，由1.25至1.50厘上調至2.25至2.50厘，基本利率於3月22日、6月14日、9月27日及12月20日合共上調100基點，由1.75厘上調至2.75厘。基本利率的調整是按照2009年3月26日宣布的經修訂計算公式作出。按照該公式，基本利率定於美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍下限加50基點的水平，或隔夜與1個月香港銀行同業拆息的5天移動平均數的平均值水平，以兩者中較高者為準。\n\n圖3 2018年香港銀行同業拆息\n\n港元遠期匯率折讓在首4個月擴大，大致跟隨港元與美元息差的走勢，其中12個月港元遠期匯率點子在4月中達到負620點子（圖4）。其後隨着港元與美元的負息差收窄，港元遠期匯率折讓略為縮小，然後在第4季再度擴大。整體而言，香港貨幣市場繼續正常運作。貼現窗借貸由2017年的103億港元增至2018年的402億港元。\n\n圖4 2018年美元兌港元遠期匯率點子\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n聯匯制度自1983年實施以來，直是維持香港貨幣及金融穩定的重要基石；並在多次區內以至全球金融危機考驗下，展現其承受強大衝擊的能力。由於港元轉弱，作為聯匯制度設計一部分的弱方兌換保證於4月、5月及8月被多次觸發。資金流出港元，是香港利率正常化的必經過程，亦是聯匯制度下的正常運作。為增進各界對有關操作及聯匯制度機制的了解，金管局致力向公眾闡釋聯匯制度的技術細節，並展示香港金融體系應對衝擊的能力。政府亦堅決維持聯匯制度。外匯及貨幣市場保持穩定，進一步鞏固公眾對政府的承擔，以及港元作為支付及保值貨幣的信心。國際貨幣基金組織在與香港進行2018年第四條磋商時，重申對聯匯制度的支持，並指出聯匯制度仍然是最適合香港的貨幣制度，是維持穩定的支柱，有助確保經濟持續增長、維持競爭力及促進龐大的金融服務業暢順運作。\n\n鑑於穩健的銀行體系對聯匯制度的正常運作具關鍵作用，金管局繼續密切監察銀行的信用、流動性及利率風險管理，以及壓力測試結果，並維持對銀行的企業、物業相關及內地相關貸款的監管，以確保銀行體系具備承受衝擊的能力。銀行持有大量外匯基金票據及債券，可經貼現窗用作換取港元流動資金，為利率大幅波動的情況提供有效緩衝。金管局隨時準備透過調整外匯基金票據及債券的發行量以提供額外流動性，以應對資金可能急劇流出港元的情況。金管局亦提醒市民審慎管理市場及利率風險，並為可能出現的市場波動作好準備。\n\n為提高貨幣發行局帳目的透明度，自1998年10月起，外匯基金已有部分資產被指定用作支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（即支持資產相對貨幣基礎的比率）於2018年在107.8至109.9%之間上落，並無觸及上限或下限。該比率於12月31日為109.9%（圖5）。在聯匯制度下，雖然已指定某些外匯基金資產作為支持組合，但外匯基金的全部資產均可用作支持港元匯率。外匯基金的龐大財政資源，能在面對突如其來的衝擊時為保障香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供強力後盾。\n\n圖5 2018年支持比率每日變動\n\n# 貨幣發行委員會\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的貨幣發行委員會（貨幣發行委員會）負責監察和探討與香港貨幣及金融穩定有關的課題。在2018年，貨幣發行委員會探討的課題包括多國央行聯合退出非常規貨幣政策對在香港的境外銀行美元貸款供應造成的潛在影響、港元貨幣需求的利率敏感度，以及聯匯制度自3項優化措施以來的運作機制及理論。貨幣發行委員會會議紀錄及金管局向其呈交的貨幣發行局制度運作報告，均載於金管局網站。\n\n# 研究\n\n香港金融研究中心（研究中心）繼續支持貨幣政策、銀行業及金融範疇的研究工作。過去4年，研究中心更着重政策方面的研究，從所舉辦的研討會及訪問學者計劃尤其可見一斑。一方面，研究中心與主要中央銀行及政策研究機構合作，聯合舉辦更多政策相關的研討會。另一方面，在2016年推出專題研究學者計劃，支持更多與金管局政策制定相關的研究項目。\n\n在2018年，研究中心合共邀請16位研究學者到訪，並發表了25份研究論文。年內研究中心亦舉辦了4場國際研討會：\n- 於1月舉行的「第9屆中國經濟年度國際研討會」，主題為「中國房地產市場及其對經濟與金融穩定的影響」。研討會由研究中心、國務院發展研究中心市場經濟研究所及中國人民銀行金融研究所合辦，集中討論內地房地產市場相關的課題及風險。\n- 於10月舉行由金管局及國際結算銀行合辦的「匯率與貨幣政策框架」研討會。研討會為國際結算銀行於香港的亞太區辦事處成立20周年的慶祝活動之一，旨在探討匯率在貨幣政策框架中的角色。\n- 於11月舉行的「2018年中央銀行金融市場微結構的年度研討會」。研討會討論金融市場微結構理論研究、實證研究結果及近期發展相關的政策影響。\n- 於11月舉行由金管局、歐洲中央銀行及美國聯邦儲備委員會合辦的「中國經濟的新時代」中國專家網絡研討會。研討會討論內地經濟正面對的迫切問題及其對全球經濟的影響，並特別着重與中央銀行決策者相關的政策議題。這是中國專家網絡研討會首次在歐洲以外地區舉行。", "en": "# Currency is stable\n\nThe HKD interest rate generally rose in 2018, while the HKD spot rate softened and approached the level of the weak-side conversion guarantee rate. Despite this, the HKD foreign exchange and money market operations remained smooth and orderly. The pegged rate system is the cornerstone of Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability and continues to demonstrate its ability to withstand strong shocks.\n\n# Goals\n\nThe main objective of Hong Kong's monetary policy is to maintain monetary stability, i.e. to ensure that the HKD is stable against the US dollar in the foreign exchange market, so that the HKD's exchange rate remains within the range of 7.75 to 7.85 HKD to US$1. The monetary system mainly adopts the money issuing bureau system, which provides for a minimum of 100 percent support to the currency base by the dollar reserves held by the foreign exchange fund; if the currency base changes, the dollar reserves must be increased and decreased in proportion to the percentage change in the currency base.\n\nThe monetary base (Table 1) includes: - certificates of debt (providing adequate support for the banknotes issued by the three issuing banks) - circulating banknotes and coins issued by the government - the balance of the bank's account at the Gold Board (i.e. the total balance) - foreign currency bills and bonds issued by the Gold Board on behalf of the government.\n\nThe HKMA maintains the HKD exchange rate stable through an automatic rate adjustment mechanism and a firm commitment to implement exchange guarantees. If the market demand for the HKD is greater than the supply, causing the market exchange rate to strengthen to 7.75 HKD to the strong side's exchange guarantee rate of 1 USD, the HKMA will withdraw HKD from the bank, buying USD, causing the total balance to increase and the HKD interest rate to fall, thereby restoring the HKD exchange rate from the strong side's exchange guarantee rate level to the exchange rate range of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if the HKD is oversupply, causing the market exchange rate to weaken to 7.85 HKD to the weak side's exchange guarantee rate of 1 USD, the HKMA will buy HKD from the bank, reducing the total balance and the interest rate into the HKD, causing the weak side to withdraw the HKD to the strong side's exchange guarantee rate and restoring it to the exchange rate range of 7.75 to 7.85 USD.\n\n# Looking back on 2018\n\n# The rate of inflation is stable\n\nIn the context of the spread of the HKD to the US dollar, the HKD exchange rate has gradually weakened since the beginning of the year. On April 12, the weak side exchange guarantee was triggered for the first time since it was set at 7.85 in 2005. For the whole year, the weak side exchange guarantee was triggered 27 times in 2018, 13 times in April, 6 times in May, and 8 times in August. Despite this, the HKD exchange rate remained smooth, with the weak side exchange guarantee rate hovering around 7.85 in mid-April to September.\n\nFigure 1 Market rate of profit in 2018\n\nAs a result of the weak-side swap guarantee being triggered, the total balance and outstanding foreign exchange fund notes and bonds decreased from HK$12.268 billion at the end of 2017 to HK$11.362 billion at the end of 2018 (Figure 2). During the year, the SBA purchased HK$103.5 billion of the combined balance of the weak-side swap guarantee at HK$7.85 billion, as required by the bank's design of the linkage rate system (linkage system). The total balance decreased from HK$179.8 billion at the end of 2017 to HK$764 billion at the end of 2018 (linkage system). The total amount of unpaid foreign exchange fund notes and bonds did not change significantly during the year.\n\nAt the end of 2018, the total balance of outstanding and unpaid shell fund notes and bonds was HK$11.362 billion.\n\nFigure 2 Summary of outstanding and unpaid shell fund notes and bonds for 2018\n\n# The money market\n\nShort-term bank inter-branch lending fell in 2018 due to the decline in bank inter-branch liquidity following the weak swap guarantee and the market expectation of a US rate hike. The increase in capital demand related to new equity capital raising activities and the seasonal fluctuation in capital demand led to a larger fluctuation in short-term bank inter-branch lending in 2018 overall.\n\nThe Fed's target range was increased by 100 basis points four times during the year, from 1.25 to 1.50 to 2.25 to 2.50. The base rate was increased by 100 basis points from 1.75 to 2.75 on March 22, June 14, September 27 and December 20. The base rate adjustment was made according to the revised calculation formula announced on March 26, 2009. According to the formula, the base rate is determined by adding 50 basis points to the lower end of the US Fed's target range, or the average of the five-day moving average of the Hong Kong banking industry divided by 1 month, whichever is higher.\n\nFigure 3: Bank of Hong Kong and its subsidiaries demolished in 2018\n\nThe HKD long-term yield spread expanded in the first four months, roughly following the trend of the HKD-USD interest rate differential, with the 12-month HKD yield spread reaching negative 620 points in mid-April (Figure 4). Subsequently, as the negative interest rate differential between the HKD and the USD narrowed, the HKD long-term yield spread was slightly reduced, then expanded again in Q4. Overall, the Hong Kong money market continued to operate normally.\n\nFigure 4 Long-term interest rate tips for the US dollar and the Hong Kong dollar in 2018\n\n#Contact rate system\n\nSince its implementation in 1983, the HKD has been an important pillar of monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong; and has been tested by the global financial crisis in several regions. Due to the weakening of the HKD, the weak exchange guarantee as part of the design of the HKD was triggered several times in April, May and August. The flow of funds out of the HKD is a normal and necessary process of Hong Kong's interest rate and the normal operation of the HKD. In order to increase the understanding of the operation and mechanism of the HKD, the HKD is committed to explaining the technical details of the HKD to the public and demonstrating the ability of the HKD to withstand the impact of the HKD. The Government is also determined to maintain the HKD.\n\nIn view of the critical role of a stable banking system in the proper functioning of the Fed, the Bank continues to closely monitor the credit, liquidity and interest rate risk management of banks, as well as the results of stress tests, and maintains supervision of the bank's corporate, real estate-related and domestic-related loans to ensure that the banking system is able to withstand shocks. The bank holds a large number of overseas fund notes and bonds, which can be used as a window for exchange of funds in the Port of Hong Kong, and the large fluctuation in interest rates provides an effective impetus. The Bank is ready at any time to provide external liquidity by adjusting the volume of funds in the Port of Hong Kong and bond issues to meet the possibility of a dramatic outflow of funds from the Port of Hong Kong. The Bank also reminds citizens to be prudent in managing market interest rate risks and to prepare for possible market movements.\n\nIn order to improve transparency of the purpose of the money issuing agency accounts, since October 1998, some of the assets of the shell fund have been designated as supporting currency base. The support ratio (the ratio of support assets to the currency base) rose between 107.8 and 109.9% in 2018, without touching the upper or lower limits. The ratio was 109.9% on December 31 (Figure 5). Under the unified system, although some shell fund assets have been designated as supporting units, all of the assets of the shell fund can be used to support the Hong Kong dollar. The huge financial resources of the shell fund can provide a strong backing for the currency and financial stability of Hong Kong in the face of sudden shocks.\n\nFigure 5 Daily changes in the support ratio in 2018\n\n# The Committee for the issuance of currency\n\nThe Monetary Issuance Committee (MIC) under the Foreign Exchange Advisory Committee (FEC) is responsible for monitoring and addressing issues related to Hong Kong's currency and financial stability. In 2018, the MIC's topics include the potential impact of the MCC's exit from the Special Monetary Policy on the supply of dollar loans to foreign banks in Hong Kong, the interest rate sensitivity of the HKD demand, and the mechanisms and theory of the federal system since the three optimization measures. The minutes of the MIC meeting and the report of the MIC to the MIC are available on the MIC website.\n\n# Research\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute of Finance Research (HIFR) continues to support research in the fields of monetary policy, banking and finance. In the past four years, the Institute has focused on policy research, particularly through its seminars and visiting scholar programs. The Institute has partnered with major central banks and policy research institutions to host more policy-related seminars.\n\nIn 2018, the research center in the Chinese city of Guangzhou, Guangzhou, and Guangzhou, held four international symposia: - the 9th China Economic Year International Symposium, held in January, on the subject \"China's real estate market and its impact on the economy and financial stability\". The symposium was organized by the Research Center, the State Council Development Research Center for Economic Research and the People's Bank of China Financial Institute in Guangzhou, China.

{"zh": "# 銀行體系穩定\n\n儘管環球經濟及金融市場的不確定性增加，2018年香港銀行體系維持穩健。認可機構的流動性及信用風險管理制度的成效繼續是金管局年內的監管重點。鑑於網絡威脅持續增加，以及銀行業更廣泛使用金融科技，金管局加強對認可機構科技風險管理及業務操作恢復能力的監管。金管局亦於5月發出《虛擬銀行的認可》指引修訂本，並開始處理虛擬銀行認可申請。在操守監管方面，金管局採取進一步措施，加強監管認可機構銷售投資及保險產品的手法、促進為殘疾人士提供無障礙銀行服務，以及推動以客為本的企業文化。\n\n隨着金融罪行越趨複雜及全球化，金管局繼續借助新科技及風險為本方法，加強香港打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度的應對能力。金管局在香港落實國際監管標準方面進展理想，其中包括資本充足標準、披露標準、流動性標準及大額風險承擔限額。此外，金管局亦加強與銀行業的溝通接觸，確保在監管成效與市場發展兩者間取得適當平衡。\n\n與此同時，金管局繼續致力確保香港備有具公信力的認可機構處置機制，其中包括推出最低吸收虧損能力規定的規則，以解決認可機構處置可行性面對的一大障礙。\n\n# 目標\n\n金管局的整體目標之一是促進銀行體系的安全及穩定。要達致這個目標，實有賴建立及維持具高度應對能力且能為香港經濟提供所需關鍵金融服務的金融體系。\n\n銀行可能因其營運方式，甚或在極端情況下因失序地倒閉而影響銀行體系的穩定。作為監管當局，金融管理專員在保障金融穩定方面擔當重要角色，確保銀行有能力抵禦衝擊、對危機作出應對，並自危機中恢復常態，以最終有助防止出現倒閉。金融管理專員負責對銀行進行審慎監管，以及認可香港的持牌銀行、有限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司（統稱「認可機構」）。金融管理專員亦負責某些金融市場基建的指定及監管。\n\n然而，金融管理專員不能確保金融體系全無風險，香港的審慎監管制度亦非為了確保「零風險」而設。作為其中一個處置機制當局，金融管理專員力求確保一旦有認可機構不再可持續經營，即能有序地處理其倒閉。為此，香港已設立金融機構處置機制，金融管理專員於該機制之下作為包括認可機構在內的若干金融機構的處置機制當局。為建立運作暢順的香港處置機制，必須制定處置法例及政策標準、進行處置規劃以清除認可機構處置可行性的障礙，以及建立金管局處置無法經營的認可機構的運作能力。為有效執行上述工作，金管局需要採納與國際一致及協調的方法。\n\n# 2018年回顧\n\n# 監管工作概覽\n\n金管局在2018年共進行187次非現場審查，涵蓋範圍廣泛，包括認可機構的CAMEL評級、企業管治、業務操作及風險管理，以及認可機構應對金融科技發展的業務策略。為繼續加強認可機構的風險管治水平，金管局與認可機構董事局或董事局轄下委員會共舉行27次會議，並跟進認可機構實施企業管治指引的進度。此外，金管局與認可機構及其外聘核數師共舉行28次三方聯席會議。\n\n除了非現場審查工作外，金管局繼續進行定期現場審查，並以專題評估作為配合，以審視被評估為較高風險的範疇。金管局於年內共進行392次現場審查及專題評估，並繼續以信用風險管理作為審查與評估的主要重點。其他重點為科技風險及業務操作風險管理，以及打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集管控措施。金管局亦增加針對流動性與市場風險管理，以及巴塞爾資本充足架構的實施情況的現場審查及專題評估次數。專項審查小組亦對認可機構的證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（強積金）相關業務進行現場審查。\n\n表1載有金管局於2018年的監管工作概要。\n\n# 信用風險的監管\n\n# 信貸增長及資產質素\n\n2018年信貸增長放緩，全年貸款總額增加4.4%，2017年的增幅則為16.1%（表2）。貿易融資於2018年減少7.6%。貸款增長放緩，主要是因為全球經濟及貿易環境越趨不明朗，以致信貸需求收縮。\n\n表2 貸款及墊款的增長\n\n內地相關貸款總額在2018年底增加1.4%至42,490億港元，低於2017年的增幅（表3）。\n\n表3 內地相關貸款增長\n\n認可機構的資產質素在2018年維持穩健。零售銀行的特定分類貸款比率由2017年底的0.56%下降至2018年底的0.50%，遠低於2000年以來的長期平均水平2.1%；同期，整體銀行業的特定分類貸款比率則由0.68%下降至0.55%。內地相關貸款方面，零售銀行的特定分類貸款比率由0.75%下降至2018年的0.63%，整體銀行業的相關比率亦由一年前的0.67%下降至0.54%。\n\n年內金管局加強監管，確保認可機構繼續採取審慎的信用風險管理準則。尤其金管局更主動了解大型企業的背景及結構，從而加強企業信用風險的監察制度。此外，金管局亦進行以主要信用風險管理監控措施為重點的專題評估，例如大型企業貸款的批核準則及風險管理、貸款分類及撥備制度、信用風險管治架構、地產發展商貸款的風險管理、有抵押貸款及保單抵押貸款等。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n住宅物業價格在2018年7月到達歷史高位，但在下半年出現緩和跡象。金管局自2009年10月以來推出的8輪逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施，已增強香港銀行體系應對本港樓市可能逆轉的抵禦能力。新造住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數由2009年9月金管局推出首輪逆周期措施前的64%，降至2018年12月的46%。平均供款與入息比率亦由2010年8月首度推出有關比率上限時的41%，降至2018年12月的34%（圖1）。\n\n圖1 新造住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數及供款與入息比率\n\n# 業務操作及科技風險的監管\n\n銀行業面對的科技風險仍然偏高。金管局於2016年推出「網絡防衛評估框架」。第一期實施安排涵蓋包括所有大型銀行在內的30間認可機構，該等認可機構已完成3個階段的評估，即自身風險程度評估、成熟程度評估及（如適用）風險資訊主導網絡攻防模擬測試。有關評估有助認可機構查找需要改進的運作範疇及採取補救措施，加強網絡防衛。與此同時，金管局已制定第二及第三期實施安排的時間表，這兩期實施安排將涵蓋其餘認可機構。年內金管局進行現場審查，集中檢視認可機構的網絡保安管控措施、外判安排及資訊科技管治。\n\n# 智慧銀行\n\n金管局繼續就2017年9月公布的7項推動智慧銀行的措施與銀行業合作，以促進金融科技在香港的發展。在監管層面，金管局於5月發出《虛擬銀行的認可》指引修訂本。此外，金管局在「銀行易」措施下，已經精簡有關遙距開戶、網上貸款及網上財富管理的監管要求。這些優化的監管要求有助銀行提供更佳的網上銀行用戶體驗。「銀行易」措施的工作範疇在9月擴大至促進銀行採用金融合規科技(Regtech)，而當中3個新的工作重點包括打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集的監察科技、用於審慎風險管理和合規的金融合規科技，以及「機器可讀」的監管要求。\n\n金管局副總裁阮國恒先生在香港銀行學會主辦的「香港銀行家峰會2018」上發表演辭，題為「智慧銀行新紀元下的金融合規科技」。\n\n# 流動性及市場風險的監管\n\n隨着美國貨幣政策持續正常化，金管局加強了流動性風險的監管，以確保認可機構審慎及有效地管理其流動性風險。年內金管局進行了一輪專題評估，以評估認可機構為美元流動性可能收緊所作的準備，以及其內部流動性壓力測試的能力。此外，金管局亦監察認可機構遵守於1月生效的「穩定資金淨額比率」要求的情況。\n\n金管局除檢視認可機構的債券組合的市場風險管理外，亦進行了針對《環球外匯守則》及非中央結算場外衍生工具的保證金和風險緩解標準的專題現場審查，以審視認可機構在財資業務中遵行新國際標準的情況。\n\n# 打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集\n\n政府於4月發表的《香港洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險評估報告》指出，香港銀行體系面對高洗錢威脅，這與其他國際金融中心一樣，亦反映金融服務日趨全球化及複雜。香港面對的洗錢威脅除源自本地犯罪活動外，在更大程度上也來自境外活動。該等境外活動包括來自境外貪污活動的非法得益、跨國犯罪集團的詐騙活動、逃稅及基於香港作為支付及貿易樞紐的地位而引致與制裁相關的風險。在金管局協助下，政府制定打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集政策聲明，列載對該等威脅的回應，目標是在提高打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度的應對能力的同時，又能吸引及便利正當企業。\n\n《2018年打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集（金融機構）（修訂）條例》於3月1日生效，引入的修訂包括在核實客戶身分方面賦予靈活性，以配合認可機構利用科技方便客戶開戶的發展。新法例亦擴大適用範圍，規定律師、會計師、地產代理及信託或公司服務提供者須負上打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集的責任，從而全面強化打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度。該等修訂連同《公司條例》為提高企業實益擁有權透明度而作出的修訂，有助認可機構執行打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集方面的工作。\n\n為鞏固及進一步強化與認可機構就打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集政策與監管方法的溝通，金管局在10月發出《監管政策手冊》下的全新單元「打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集的監管方法」，及配合相關法例修訂的《打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集指引（認可機構適用）》，以能更有效實施風險為本的方法，並減少認可機構就打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度採用新科技的障礙。\n\n資訊交流在打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度中的作用日見重要；在金管局與香港銀行公會（銀行公會）的支持下，銀行業積極參與反訛騙及洗黑錢情報工作組（情報工作組），並已取得實質成果。有關情報工作組先導計劃的檢討工作於2018年末展開，並會於2019年初完成。", "en": "# Banking system is stable\n\nDespite the increased uncertainty in the global economy and financial markets, Hong Kong's banking system remained stable in 2018. The liquidity of licensed institutions and the effectiveness of the credit risk management system remained the regulatory focus of the Hong Kong Banking Authority during the year. In light of the continuing increase in cyber threats and the wider use of financial technology in the banking industry, the Hong Kong Banking Authority strengthened its supervision of licensed institutions' risk management and operational recovery capabilities. In May, the Hong Kong Banking Authority also issued the revised guidelines for licensing virtual banks and began processing applications for virtual bank licensing.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has made progress in implementing international regulatory standards, including capital adequacy standards, disclosure standards, liquidity standards and large-value risk limits. In addition, the KMA has strengthened its communication with the banking industry to ensure that the regulatory effectiveness is balanced with market development.\n\nAt the same time, the KIM continues to work to ensure that Hong Kong has a credible regulatory regime for the treatment of licensed institutions, including the introduction of a minimum loss absorbing capacity rule to address one of the major obstacles to the viability of the treatment of licensed institutions.\n\n# Goals\n\nOne of the overall objectives of the MRA is to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this objective relies on the establishment and maintenance of a highly resilient financial system that can provide the critical financial services needed by the Hong Kong economy.\n\nA bank's financial stability may be affected by the way it operates or, in extreme cases, by its disorderly failure. As a regulatory authority, the Financial Supervisory Authority plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability, ensuring that banks are able to withstand shocks, respond to crises, and recover from crises, ultimately helping to prevent a failure. The Financial Supervisory Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks, and for the designation and supervision of certain financial market infrastructures.\n\nHowever, financial regulators cannot ensure that the financial system is risk-free, and Hong Kong's system of prudential supervision is not designed to ensure \"zero risk\". As one of the regulatory authorities, the Financial Regulatory Authority seeks to ensure that once an authorized institution is no longer viable, it can be orderly dealt with. To this end, Hong Kong has established a Financial Institution Settlement System, under which the Financial Regulators act as the authorities of several financial institutions including authorized institutions. To establish a smoothly functioning Hong Kong settlement system, it is necessary to develop settlement laws and policy standards, conduct settlement planning to remove viable barriers to the settlement of authorized institutions, and establish the ability of authorized institutions to deal with the money management system that cannot operate. To effectively carry out the above work, the money management system needs a consistent and coordinated approach with the international community.\n\n# Looking back on 2018\n\n# Overview of the work of the regulator\n\nThe FSA conducted 187 off-site audits in 2018, covering a wide range of issues, including the CAMEL rating of accredited institutions, corporate governance, business operations and risk management, and the business strategy of accredited institutions to respond to the development of financial technology. In order to continue to strengthen the level of risk regulation of accredited institutions, the FSA held 27 meetings with the Board of Directors or the Board of Directors of the Accredited Institutions, and the progress of the implementation of the corporate governance guidelines of the accredited institutions. In addition, the FSA held 28 meetings with the Accredited Institutions and external auditors.\n\nIn addition to the non-site audits, the CMA continues to conduct regular site audits and subject-matter assessments to support the assessment of areas assessed as high risk. The CMA conducted a total of 392 site audits and subject-matter assessments during the year, and continues to focus on credit risk management as the main focus of its audits and assessments. Other focuses are on technology risk and operational risk management, and on combating money laundering and terrorist fundraising control measures.\n\nTable 1 provides an overview of the regulatory work of the Gold Authority in 2018.\n\n#Credit risk regulation is a big deal\n\n#Credit growth and asset quality\n\nCredit growth slowed to 4.4 percent in 2018, compared to 16.1 percent in 2017 (Table 2). Trade finance declined to 7.6 percent in 2018. The slowdown in credit growth was mainly due to the uncertain global economic and trade environment, which has led to a contraction in credit demand.\n\nTable 2 Growth in loans and deposits\n\nTotal land-related lending increased by 1.4% to HK$42.49 billion at the end of 2018, lower than the increase in 2017 (Table 3).\n\nTable 3 Growth in land-related lending\n\nThe asset quality of accredited institutions remained stable in 2018. The specific classification loan ratio of retail banks decreased from 0.56% at the end of 2017 to 0.50% at the end of 2018, well below the long-term average of 2.1% since 2000; the specific classification loan ratio of the banking industry as a whole decreased from 0.68% to 0.55% during the same period. In the case of domestic related loans, the specific classification loan ratio of retail banks decreased from 0.75% to 0.63 in 2018 and the specific classification loan ratio of the banking industry as a whole decreased from 0.67% to 0.54% a year ago.\n\nDuring the year, the Bank of China Regulatory Authority strengthened supervision to ensure that the approved institutions continue to adopt prudent credit risk management standards. In particular, the Bank of China Regulatory Authority is more proactive in understanding the background and structure of large enterprises, thereby strengthening the supervision system of enterprise credit risk management. In addition, the Bank of China Regulatory Authority also conducts specialized evaluations focusing on the main credit risk management monitoring measures, such as the approval criteria and risk management of large enterprise loans, loan classification and reserve system credit risk management structure, risk management of real estate development loans, mortgages and secured mortgages, etc.\n\n# Mortgage loans for property\n\nResidential property prices reached a record high in July 2018, but showed signs of easing in the second half of the year. The eight-round reverse cycle macro-prudential regulation introduced by the Gold Council since October 2009 has strengthened the resilience of the Hong Kong banking system against the potential reversal of the Hong Kong property market. The average mortgage ratio of new residential mortgage loans decreased from 64% before the first round reverse cycle measure was introduced by the Gold Council in September 2009 to 46% in December 2018. The average supply to interest rate ratio also decreased from 41% when the ratio was first introduced in August 2010 to 34% in December 2018.\n\nFigure 1 Average mortgage rates and supply to installment rates for new residential mortgages\n\n#Regulation of business operations and technology risks\n\nThe banking industry is still facing high technological risks. The CBI launched the \"Cyber Defense Assessment Framework\" in 2016. The first phase of the implementation arrangement covers 30 accredited institutions, including all large banks. The accredited institutions have completed three phases of evaluation, namely their own risk assessment, maturity assessment and risk information-led cyber defense simulation (if applicable). The assessment helps the accredited institutions identify the scope of operations that need to be improved and take remedial measures to strengthen network defense. At the same time, the CBI has developed the timetable for the second and third phases of the implementation arrangement, which will cover the remaining accredited institutions. The CBI conducts on-site audits, centrally inspects the cyber security control measures of the accredited institutions, and arranges for the external governance of information and technology.\n\n#Wisdom Bank\n\nThe Banking Authority continues to work with the banking industry on the 7 measures to promote smart banking announced in September 2017 to promote the development of financial technology in Hong Kong. At the regulatory level, the Banking Authority issued a revised guide for licensing virtual banks in May. In addition, the Banking Authority has streamlined the regulatory requirements for remote accounts, online lending and online wealth management under the Banking Ease measure. These streamlined regulatory requirements help banks provide a better online banking user experience.\n\nHuang Huang, Vice President of the Hong Kong Banking Association, delivered a speech at the Hong Kong Bankers Summit 2018 on the topic \"Financial and legal technologies in the new era of smart banking\".\n\n# Liquidity and market risk regulation\n\nAs U.S. monetary policy continued to normalize, the Fed increased its supervision of liquidity risk to ensure that accredited institutions prudently and effectively managed their liquidity risks. During the year, the Fed conducted a series of special assessments to assess accredited institutions' preparedness for the possible tightening of U.S. dollar liquidity and their ability to test internal liquidity pressures. In addition, the Fed also supervised accredited institutions' compliance with the \"stable net capital ratio\" requirements that took effect in January.\n\nIn addition to the market risk management of the bond pool of the accredited institution, the Financial Supervisory Authority has conducted a dedicated on-site review of the collateral and risk mitigation standards for the global outer-shell code and non-centrally cleared OTC derivatives to review the compliance of the accredited institution with the new international standards in financial operations.\n\n# Fighting money laundering and terrorist financing\n\nThe Hong Kong Government's April Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment Report states that the banking system in Hong Kong faces a high threat of money laundering, which, like other international financial centres, reflects the increasing globalization and complexity of financial services. The money laundering threat facing Hong Kong stems not only from domestic criminal activity but also, to a greater extent, from overseas activities. Such overseas activities include illegal profits from overseas corrupt activities, fraud by transnational criminal groups, tax evasion and the associated risks of sanctions based on Hong Kong's status as a payment and trade hub.\n\nThe new law also expands the scope of application, requiring lawyers, accountants, real estate agents and trust or corporate service providers to assume responsibility for combating money laundering and terrorist financing, thereby strengthening the overall anti-money laundering and terrorist financing system. The amendment links the amendments made to the Company Law to improve transparency in the ownership of beneficial ownership, and helps the licensed entity to carry out its work in combating money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\nIn order to strengthen and further strengthen communication with authorized entities on AML/CFT policies and regulatory approaches, the State Council issued a new unit under the AML/CFT Policy Manual in October, \"Methods of Supervision for AML/CFT\", and the revised AML/CFT Guidelines for Authorized Entities (\"Applicable to Authorized Entities\") in order to implement risk-based approaches more effectively and reduce barriers to the adoption of new technologies by authorized entities for AML/CFT.\n\nThe role of information sharing in the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing is increasingly important. The banking industry is actively involved in the Information Task Force on Fraud and Money Laundering (ITTF), supported by the Hong Kong Gold Authority and the Hong Kong Banking Council (HKBC), and has achieved tangible results. The review of the ITTF's leadership plan is underway and will be completed in early 2019."}
{"zh": "# 香港的國際金融中心地位\n\n鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位是金管局主要職責之一。旨在促進銀行及支付業界開發與應用金融科技的7項措施，於年內取得良好進展，最佳例子是快速支付系統「轉數快」成功推出。\n\n中國內地與香港資本市場的互聯互通計劃推出優化措施，以及粵港澳大灣區的發展，令香港作為進入中國內地主要門戶的獨特地位進一步加強。香港作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位亦更為穩固，本港人民幣金融活動蓬勃發展。\n\n與此同時，金管局致力開拓新機遇，進一步提升香港金融平台的競爭力，包括基建融資、企業財資中心及綠色債券市場。金管局亦加強向海外及內地持份者宣傳香港優勢的市場推廣計劃。在國際層面，金管局於多個區內及國際委員會扮演領導角色，明確體現了香港在相關國際工作的專業知識及承擔。\n\n# 概覽\n\n為加強香港作為亞洲金融科技樞紐的地位，金管局致力落實於2017年9月公布、旨在促進銀行及支付行業開發與應用金融科技的7項措施。該7項推動智慧銀行的措施於年內取得的主要進展包括：\n\n- 成功推出快速支付系統「轉數快」，全面接通不同銀行及儲值支付工具（統稱「電子錢包」）\n- 發布銀行業開放應用程式介面（開放API）框架及促進業界落實開放API；\n- 提升金融科技研究及人才培訓；\n- 加強跨境金融科技合作；\n- 修訂《虛擬銀行的認可》指引，並處理虛擬銀行牌照申請；\n- 「金融科技監管沙盒」升級版（FSS 2.0）運作順暢；及\n- 擴展「銀行易」以促進銀行採用金融合規科技。\n\n金管局轄下金融科技促進辦公室(FFO)，聯同金管局各銀行部門在推動落實上述措施方面擔當重要角色。\n\n隨着中國內地與香港資本市場的互聯互通計劃優化措施的落實，香港作為進入中國內地主要門戶的獨特地位進一步加強。「債券通」全面實施即時貨銀兩訖(DvP)結算模式及國務院宣布境外投資者投資中國境內債券市場的稅務寛免安排，進一步提升計劃的效率及吸引力。金管局亦與內地當局緊密合作，探討及實施多項金融配套措施，便利在粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）生活、工作及營商的個人和企業。香港離岸人民幣業務繼續蓬勃發展，人民幣存款資金池全年上升6%至6,577億元人民幣；人民幣即時支付結算(RTGS)系統平均每日交易額達到10,101億元人民幣的高水平。\n\n金管局積極開拓進一步提升香港金融平台競爭力的新機會。為促進香港債券市場的發展，金管局落實《財政預算案》所提出的「債券資助先導計劃」，為首次在香港發行債券的機構提供資助，並與政府緊密合作修訂法例，擴大「合資格債務票據計劃」下可獲稅務豁免的債券投資收入範圍。金管局亦加強市場推廣活動，向海外及內地持份者宣傳香港的優勢，包括舉辦多項大型及專題外展活動推廣香港為綠色金融、基建融資及企業財資中心樞紐。\n\n在國際層面，金管局領導多個區內及國際委員會。金管局現正擔任金融穩定理事會轄下監管合作常設委員會主席、巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（巴塞爾委員會）轄下監管及實施準則小組，以及東亞及太平洋地區中央銀行會議(EMEAP) 轄下金融市場工作小組主席。\n\n香港金融基建的安全及有效運作，為香港作為國際金融中心的地位奠定穩固基礎。處理銀行同業交易的4個RTGS系統、債務工具中央結算系統（CMU系統）及香港交易資料儲存庫（香港儲存庫）在2018年達到100%的系統可供使用率，高於99.95%的目標水平。透過於內地兩個中央證券託管機構的帳戶，CMU系統繼續協助結算「債券通」北向通交易，以及替相關CMU系統成員持有內地債務證券。\n\n為促進零售支付業的整體安全及效率，金管局於8月根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（《支付條例》）指定多兩個零售支付系統，使其運作受到金管局監察。迄今受金管局監察的指定零售支付系統增至6個。金管局亦對16個儲值支付工具持牌人進行監管。有關持牌人積極推出新產品及服務，致力為客戶提供更多選擇及更佳的用戶體驗。與此同時，電子支票與電子帳單及繳費服務涵蓋範圍，進一步擴展至包括香港與整個廣東省的跨境支付交易。\n\n# 2018年回顧\n\n# 香港作為亞洲的金融科技樞紐\n\n# 推動智慧銀行的措施\n\n金管局於2017年9月公布7項推動智慧銀行的措施，旨在協助銀行業提升至更高層次，並把握銀行與科技結合帶來的龐大機遇。金管局於年內在落實這些措施及為香港金融生態轉型方面，進展良好。\n\n# 「轉數快」\n\n「轉數快」於9月成功啟動，方便銀行及儲值支付工具用戶隨時隨地進行港元及人民幣的跨行即時資金轉帳，用戶只需輸入收款人的手機號碼或電郵地址。共有21間銀行（包括大部分零售銀行）及10間儲值支付工具營運商已加入該系統，為客戶提供即時支付服務及╱或帳戶綁定服務。\n\n「轉數快」在3.5個月內已接獲超過200萬個登記，相對香港人口比例27%。該系統自推出以來處理超過480萬宗交易，涉及總額逾1,049億港元及27.5億元人民幣。\n\n金管局於同月推出香港零售支付共用二維碼標準及相關流動應用程式「香港共用二維碼」(HKQR)，是全球首創將多個二維碼整合成為個綜合二維碼的流動應用程式，方便商戶尤其中小企以同一個二維碼接受不同支付服務營運商的支付方案，無需向客戶展示多個二維碼。\n\n# 開放應用程式介面\n\n開放API是指透過向第三方服務供應商開放銀行的相關數據，更好更方便地融合銀行與其他行業的服務。用家單用一個系統就能在安全環境下享受綜合服務。為促進銀行界研發及提供開放API，金管局於7月發布開放API框架。該框架採用風險為本原則，並分4個階段落實各項開放API功能。截至2019年1月底，20間銀行已開放第一階段約500個開放API接口，涵蓋逾1,000項產品及服務的資料。\n\n# 科研及人才培訓\n\n建基於金管局主導的貿易融資概念驗證成果由香港多間銀行組成的聯盟於10月啟動以分布式分類帳技術(DLT)為基礎的貿易融資平台「貿易聯動」。該平台旨在透過數碼化貿易文件及自動化貿易融資流程，減低失誤及詐騙風險。截至2018年底，已有12間銀行加入成為該聯盟成員。「貿易聯動」與歐洲貿易融資平台「we.trade」於10月簽署《諒解備忘錄》，進行對接雙方平台的概念驗證。金管局亦同步探討「貿易聯動」與其他地區對接的機會，包括與新加坡金融管理局合作推出「全球貿易連接網絡」。\n\n金管局總裁陳德霖先生（左）於「貿易聯動」啟動儀式上。\n\n為培育更多金融科技專才，金管局於1月與香港應用科技研究院（應科院）合作推出「金融科技人才培育計劃」升級版(FCAS 2.0)。FCAS 2.0設有4個項目，適合處於不同職涯發展階段的年輕人才。計劃下有200多名學生受惠。\n\n金管局總裁陳德霖先生（左二）與數碼港主席林家禮博士（左一）、香港應科院主席王明鑫先生（右二）及香港科技園公司行政總裁黃克強先生（右一）出席FCAS 2.0啟動儀式。\n\n# 跨境合作\n\n繼於2017年與深圳市人民政府金融發展服務辦公室（深圳金融辦）簽署《諒解備忘錄》後，金管局繼續加強與深圳的金融科技合作。當中包括金管局贊助「深圳金融科技暑期實習計劃」，讓50名學生到深圳多間著名公司進行為期6星期的實習，體驗當地的金融科技生態；另與深圳金融辦第二次合辦「深港金融科技創新獎」。\n\n金管局副總裁李達志先生（右二）與首批深圳金融科技暑期實習生交談。\n\n金管局亦於2018年與瑞士金融市場監督管理局、波蘭金融監管局、阿布扎比國際金融中心金融服務監管局及巴西中央銀行簽署金融科技合作協議，促進金融科技合作。\n\n在8月，金管局與11間金融監管當局和相關機構公布「全球金融創新網絡」計劃。該網絡旨在為創新型公司提供更有效方式與監管機構進行互動，並促進監管機構之間就創新相關議題的合作。\n\n# 虛擬銀行\n\n引入虛擬銀行將會為香港金融科技應用增添新動力，並為數碼銀行客戶帶來嶄新體驗。虛擬銀行以個人或中小企等零售客戶為對象，因此亦有助促進普及金融。經公眾諮詢，金管局於5月發出《虛擬銀行的認可》指引修訂本，並於8月底接獲約30宗申請。\n\n# 金融科技監管沙盒\n\n年內沙盒的使用穩步上升。為協助建立金融合規科技的生態系統，沙盒於9月起開放予金融合規科技的項目。\n\n截至2018年底，共有42項金融科技或科技產品獲准使用沙盒進行測試，其中28項已完成試行，有關產品亦已於其後推出市場。金管局另接獲220項使用「金融科技監管聊天室」的個案，希望在金融科技項目構思初期取得監管反饋意見。其中有約70%的個案來自科技公司。", "en": "Hong Kong's status as an international financial center is a matter of debate.\n\nThe seven measures aimed at promoting the development and application of financial technology in the banking and payments industry made good progress during the year, the best example being the successful launch of the fast-payment system \"Transfer Fast\".\n\nThe launch of the China-Hong Kong Capital Markets Connectivity Plan and the development of the Hong Kong-Hong Kong Bay Area further strengthened Hong Kong's unique position as a major gateway to mainland China. Hong Kong's position as a global hub for offshore RMB operations is also more stable, and RMB financial activity in Hong Kong is booming.\n\nAt the same time, the KBA is committed to opening new opportunities and further enhancing the competitiveness of Hong Kong's financial platforms, including infrastructure financing, corporate finance centers and green bond markets. The KBA is also strengthening its marketing program to promote Hong Kong's strength to overseas and domestic stakeholders. At the international level, the KBA plays a leadership role in several regional and international committees, clearly reflecting Hong Kong's expertise and commitment to relevant international work.\n\n# Summary\n\nIn order to strengthen Hong Kong's position as a financial technology hub in Asia, the KIM is committed to implementing the seven measures announced in September 2017 to promote the development and application of financial technology in the banking and payments industry. The seven measures to promote smart banking have made significant progress during the year, including:\n\n- Successfully launching the Fast Payment System \"Fast Transfer\" and full connectivity between different banks and the payment of value (colloquially known as \"e-wallet\") - Releasing the Open Application Interface (Open API) framework for the banking industry and promoting the implementation of Open API in the industry; - Promoting Fintech research and talent training; - Strengthening cross-border Fintech cooperation; - Revising the licensing guidelines for virtual banks and processing applications for virtual banking licenses; - Upgrading the Fintech Supervisory Sandbox (FSS 2.0) to operate smoothly; and - Expanding the Banking Ease to promote the adoption of Fintech by banks.\n\nThe FFO, which is the financial technology promotion office of the Gold Authority, and the Gold Authority's banking departments have a key role to play in the implementation of the measures.\n\nWith the implementation of the measures to improve the interconnection plan between the mainland and Hong Kong capital markets, Hong Kong's unique position as the main gateway to mainland China has been further strengthened. The full implementation of the \"bond-through\" instant bank two-fold payment model and the State Council's announcement of the tax exemption scheme for foreign investors to invest in China's domestic bond market further enhances the efficiency and attractiveness of the scheme. The Finance Authority also works closely with local authorities to explore and implement a number of financial support measures to facilitate the lives, work and business of individuals and enterprises in Hong Kong. Offshore renminbi business continues to thrive, with the renminbi deposit pool increasing by 67.7 percent to 67.5 billion yuan throughout the year; the renminbi instant payment RTGS system has reached an average of 10.10 billion yuan per day.\n\nThe Hong Kong Bond Authority has actively pursued new opportunities to further enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong's financial platforms. To promote the development of Hong Kong's bond market, the Hong Kong Bond Authority has implemented the \"Bond Financing Pioneer Plan\" proposed by the Finance Budget Bill, providing funding to institutions that issue bonds for the first time in Hong Kong, and working closely with the government to revise the law, expanding the scope of bond investment income that is exempt from tax under the \"Qualified Debt Base Plan\".\n\nAt the international level, the Bank leads a number of regional and international committees. The Bank is currently the Chair of the Standing Committee on Regulatory Cooperation under the Financial Stability Board, the Group on Supervision and Enforcement under the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), and the Financial Markets Working Group under the East Asia and Pacific Council of Central Banks (EMEAP).\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong's financial infrastructure has laid a solid foundation for Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre. The four RTGS systems for processing bank-to-bank transactions, the Central Settlement System for Debt Instruments (CMU System) and the Hong Kong Transaction Data Storage (HKDTS) reached 100% system availability in 2018, above the target level of 99.95%. Through the accounts of the two mainland central securities depository institutions, the CMU System continues to facilitate the settlement of \"bond transit\" northbound transactions, and the holding of domestic debt securities by the relevant CMU members.\n\nIn order to promote the overall safety and efficiency of the retail payment industry, the Zhonghua Administration designated two retail payment systems in August under the Zhonghua Payment Systems and Cash Value Payment Instruments Regulations (Zhonghua Payment Regulations), bringing the number of retail payment systems under Zhonghua's supervision to six. The Zhonghua Administration also supervises 16 holders of cash value payment instruments. The license holders are actively introducing new products and services, and are committed to providing customers with more choices and better user experiences.\n\n# Looking back on 2018\n\nHong Kong is the financial technology hub of Asia\n\n#Measures to promote smart banks\n\nThe Banking Authority announced seven measures to promote smart banking in September 2017 to help the banking industry move to the next level and seize the huge opportunities that the combination of banking and technology brings. The Banking Authority made good progress in implementing these measures and transforming Hong Kong's financial ecosystem during the year.\n\n♪ Turn the clock fast ♪\n\n\"Quick Transfer\" was successfully launched in September, allowing banks and depository users to transfer funds instantly in HKD and RMB, anywhere and anytime, by simply entering the recipient's phone number or email address. A total of 21 banks (including most retail banks) and 10 depository operators have joined the system, providing customers with instant payment services and checking or account binding services.\n\nThe system has received over 2 million registrations in 3.5 months, which is 27% of Hong Kong's population. The system has processed over 4.8 million transactions since its launch, involving a total of over HK$104.9 billion and RMB2.75 billion.\n\nThe HKQR, a mobile application that integrates multiple digital tokens into a single unified digital token, is the first mobile application in the world to integrate multiple digital tokens into a single unified digital token, making it easier for merchants, especially small businesses, to accept payment from different payment service operators using the same digital token without having to show multiple digital tokens to customers.\n\n#Open the app interface\n\nOpen API is a framework for open API development and provision in the banking industry. The framework adopts the risk-based approach and implements open API features in four phases. As of the end of January 2019, 20 banks have opened up about 500 open API interfaces in the first phase, covering more than 1,000 products and services.\n\n#Research and talent training\n\nThe trade finance platform Trade Union, based on the DLT technology (DLT), was launched in October by a consortium of Hong Kong banks. The platform aims to reduce the risk of errors and fraud by digitizing trade documents and automating the trade finance process. As of the end of 2018, 12 banks have joined the consortium. Trade Union and the European trade finance platform we.trade signed a memorandum of understanding in October to conduct a concept test of the two-way platform.\n\nMr. Meng Cheng, President of the State Administration of Finance (left) at the opening ceremony of the Trade Engagement.\n\nIn January, the FCA launched the FCA Talent Development Program (FCAS 2.0) in partnership with the Hong Kong Institute of Applied Sciences (HASAS) to develop more financial technology professionals. FCAS 2.0 has four programs for young talents at different stages of their career development.\n\nThe launch ceremony was attended by the President of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Mr. Cheng Xu (left 2) and the Chairman of Digital Port, Dr. Lin Jiayi (left 1), the President of the Hong Kong Academy of Sciences, Mr. Wang Minghui (right 2) and the Executive President of Hong Kong Science and Technology Park, Mr. Wong Keqiang (right 1).\n\n# Cross-border cooperation\n\nFollowing the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding with the Shenzhen People's Government Financial Development Service Office (Shenzhen Finance Office) in 2017, the Ming Administration continued to strengthen its cooperation with Shenzhen in the field of financial technology. Among other things, the Ming Administration sponsored the Shenzhen Fintech Summer Internship Program, which allowed 50 students to go to Shenzhen to work in several prominent companies for six weeks to experience the local Fintech ecosystem.\n\nMr. Li Dazhi, Vice President of the Financial Administration (right) talks to the first group of Fintech summer interns in Shenzhen.\n\nIn 2018, the FSA signed a financial technology cooperation agreement with the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, the Polish Financial Supervisory Authority, the Abu Dhabi International Financial Centre Financial Services Authority and the Central Bank of Brazil to promote financial technology cooperation.\n\nIn August, the CFI and 11 financial regulators and related institutions announced the Global Financial Innovation Network, which aims to provide innovative companies with a more effective way to interact with regulators and to promote cooperation between regulators on innovation-related issues.\n\n#Virtual banks\n\nThe introduction of virtual banks will add new impetus to the application of financial technology in Hong Kong and bring a new experience for digital banking customers. Virtual banks are targeted at retail customers such as individuals or SMEs, and therefore also help promote financial inclusion. Following public consultations, the Financial Conduct Authority issued a revised guide to the licensing of virtual banks in May and received about 30 applications by the end of August.\n\n#Fintech and regulatory sandbox\n\nThe use of sandboxes has been steadily increasing over the years. In order to help create an ecosystem of financial regulatory technologies, the sandbox was opened to financial regulatory technologies in September.\n\nAs of the end of 2018, 42 fintech or technology products have been approved for sandbox testing, 28 of which have completed trials and have been subsequently launched on the market. The FSA has also received 220 cases of the use of the \"Fintech Regulatory Chat Room\" to obtain regulatory feedback at the beginning of the financial project's technology vision. About 70% of these cases are from technology companies."}
{"zh": "# 儲備管理\n\n2018年對投資者而言是困難的一年，投資環境備受多項風險因素困擾，包括美國利率持續正常化引發金融狀況收緊、主要經濟體之間的貿易摩擦升級，以及全球多處民粹主義抬頭及地緣政治風險加劇。環球股市普遍向下，美國國庫券收益率亦隨着美國聯邦儲備局4次加息而上升。在美息趨升下，美元轉強。部分新興市場面對國內嚴峻的政治及經濟壓力，其貨幣顯著下挫。儘管投資環境充滿挑戰，外匯基金在2018年仍錄得109億港元投資收入。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》，外匯基金的首要目的是直接或間接影響港元匯價，亦可運用於保持香港貨幣及金融體系穩定健全，藉此保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。金管局根據財政司司長轉授的權力及轉授權力的條款，就外匯基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標及組合架構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會為外匯基金制定下列投資目標：\n\n(a) 保障資本；\n(b) 確保整體貨幣基礎在任何時候都由流通性極高的美元資產提供十足支持；\n(c) 確保流動資金足以維持貨幣及金融穩定；以及\n(d) 在符合上述(a)至(c)項的前提下盡量爭取投資回報，以保障基金的長期購買力。\n\n以上目標全面顧及外匯基金的法定目的，並已於外匯基金的組合結構及目標資產配置中反映。\n\n外匯基金大致上分成兩個主要組合：支持組合及投資組合。支持組合持有流通性極高的美元資產，按照貨幣發行局制度的規定為貨幣基礎提供十足支持。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債市及股市，以保障資產的價值及長期購買力。\n\n為能更妥善管理風險及提高中長期回報，金管局以審慎及循序漸進方式將外匯基金的部分資產分散投資至較多元化的資產類別，包括新興巿場及內地債券與股票、私募股權（包括基建）及房地產。新興巿場及內地債券與股票由投資組合持有，私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合持有。長期增長組合的市值上限為外匯基金累計盈餘的三分之一及未來基金與外匯基金附屬公司存款中與長期增長組合掛鈎部分的總和。\n\n策略性資產組合於2007年設立，以持有政府基於策略性目的而為外匯基金帳目購入的香港交易及結算所有限公司股份。由於這個組合性質獨特，因此外匯基金的投資表現評估並無將其包括在內。\n\n# 於外匯基金的存款\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定組織的存款，利率一般與投資組合的表現掛鈎，但主要以未來基金除外。未來基金存款的利率與投資組合及長期增長組合的表現掛鈎，實際利率視乎組合比重而定。於2018年底，未來基金在投資組合與長期增長組合的比重約為50:50。\n\n# 投資程序\n\n外匯基金的投資程序分別以策略性資產配置及戰略性資產配置作基礎。策略性資產配置，即投資基準反映的配置情況，顯示外匯基金為達到投資目標而可作出的長線資產配置。外匯基金以策略性配置作為指引，對資產進行戰略性配置，以爭取超越基準的回報。因此，實際配置往往會與基準配置（亦即策略性配置）有所偏離，而實際與基準配置之間的差距稱為「戰略性偏離」。財政司司長經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後制定投資基準及循跡誤差限額，金管局獲授權決定戰略性資產配置及定出戰略性偏離的容許範圍。投資組合經理可在戰略性偏離的容許範圍內選持倉盤，從短期市場變化中獲利。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局於8月成立外匯基金投資辦公室，專責投資及相關風險管理職能。該辦公室職員負責直接管理外匯基金約72%的投資，包括整個支持組合及部分投資組合。該部分的投資組合投資於環球定息市場，並透過衍生工具執行外匯基金的宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 外聘投資經理\n\n除透過內部職員管理資產外，金管局亦僱用外聘投資經理負責管理外匯基金約28%的資產，包括所有上市股票組合及其他特別資產。僱用外聘投資經理的目的是要運用市場上最佳的專業投資技術為外匯基金投資，以取得可持續回報，並讓外匯基金受惠於多元化及互補的投資方式，以及汲取市場心得與專業投資技術知識。\n\n僱用外聘投資經理的相關支出包括基金管理與託管費、交易費、預扣稅及其他稅項。這些支出主要受市場因素影響而每年不同。\n\n# 風險管理及監察\n\n投資環境越趨複雜，突顯風險管理的重要。金管局為內部及外聘投資經理所管理的投資組合均訂立嚴格管控措施及投資指引，並密切監察對指引及法規的遵守情況。金管局已加強風險評估，以配合外匯基金越趨多元化的投資；另採用風險管控工具來評估在正常及極度不利市況下的市場風險。金管局亦進行詳細的投資表現因素分析，以識別促成不同表現的成因，藉此評估如何充分利用內部及外聘投資經理的投資管理技術。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n金管局支持負責任投資。例如，金管局已採納證券及期貨事務監察委員會公布的《負責任的擁有權原則》。該套原則旨在協助投資者釐定如何以最佳方法履行其於香港上市公司投資的擁有權責任。就外匯基金的管理而言，金管局已就環境、社會及管治因素制定內部指引，適用於外聘基金經理的甄選、委任及監察程序。獲委任負責主動式管理香港股票組合的外聘基金經理，須在管理有關投資時遵守《負責任的擁有權原則》。整體而言，金管局已將環境、社會及管治因素納入投資及相關監察活動的內部程序。金管局會密切注視環境、社會及管治因素的相關標準的發展，並評估如何能夠將這些標準進一步融入投資程序。此外，為促進負責任投資的國際合作，金管局已成為非牟利組織FCLTGlobal的成員，該組織旨在推動長遠目標為本的業務及投資決定。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2018年的金融市場\n\n在2018年，原先被市場低估的多項風險因素一一浮現，包括美國利率正常化的步伐、美國政府外貿政策和保護主義對全球貿易的衝擊，以及地緣政治的風險，環球金融市場因而出現大幅波動及調整。\n\n中美貿易爭議升級，令投資者非常憂慮，新興市場及香港股市自1月底開始反覆下跌，恒生指數自該月份的高位最多下跌27%。自第4季起，主要歐美股市亦大幅下滑，錄得雙位數字跌幅。就2018年整體而言，全球股市普遍下跌，涵蓋已發展國家股市的MSCI全球指數下跌10.4%，MSCI新興市場指數亦下跌16.6%。\n\n債市方面，由於美國貨幣政策正常化，美國國庫券收益率於2018年大致向上。然而，年內債市仍有波動。例如10年期美國國庫券收益率由年初約2.5%上升至11月3.2%的7年新高，但至年底時受投資者憂慮中美貿易爭議及趨向避險投資所影響而回軟至2.7%。\n\n貨幣市場方面，年內美元跟隨美國加息轉強。美匯指數上升4.4%，歐元及人民幣等主要貨幣兌美元下跌約5%。此外，部分新興市場受到國內政局及經濟不穩影響，其貨幣進一步受挫。例如，阿根廷披索及土耳其里拉兌美元分別下跌約五成及三成。相比之下，避險投資需求帶動日圓兌美元上升2.7%。\n\n表1列載主要貨幣、債巿及股市在2018年的表現。\n\n表1 2018年市場回報\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n外匯基金在2018年錄得109億港元投資收入，當中包括債券投資收益574億港元、香港股票投資虧損207億港元、其他股票投資虧損387億港元、非港元資產外匯估值下調90億港元，以及外匯基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資收益219億港元。另一方面，策略性資產組合錄得5億港元估值下調。\n\n於2018年年底，外匯基金的資產總值達40,549億港元。長期增長組合投資的總市值為2,836億港元，當中私募股權為1,911億港元，房地產為925億港元。已承擔但尚未提取作投資的總額為2,024億港元。\n\n外匯基金（不包括策略性資產組合）在2018年的投資回報率為0.3%，其中投資組合的回報率為負2.4%，支持組合為2.1%。長期增長組合自2009年開展投資以來的內部回報率年率為12.9%。\n\n圖1列明外匯基金由1994至2018年的年度回報率。表2顯示外匯基金在2018年的投資回報率及不同年期的平均投資回報率。外匯基金在過去3年的平均回報率為3.2%、過去5年為2.1%、過去10年為2.8%，以及自1994年起計為4.7%3。表3列載外匯基金資產於2018年12月31日的貨幣比重。", "en": "# Reserves management\n\n2018 was a difficult year for investors, with a number of risks in the investment environment, including the continued normalization of interest rates in the United States leading to tightening financial conditions, increased trade friction between major economies, and the rise of populism and geopolitical risk in many parts of the world. Global stock markets were generally down, and US Treasury bond yields were up as the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates four times. The US dollar strengthened as interest rates rose. Some emerging markets faced severe domestic political and economic pressures, and their currencies weakened. Despite the challenging investment environment, foreign funds recorded HK$10.9 billion in investment income in 2018\".\n\n# The Outdoor Fund\n\nAccording to the regulations of the Hong Kong Sovereign Wealth Fund, the primary purpose of the Sovereign Wealth Fund is to influence the value of the Hong Kong dollar, either directly or indirectly, and may be used to maintain the stability of Hong Kong's monetary and financial system, thereby maintaining Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre. The Gold Authority is responsible to the Finance Minister for the operation and investment management of the Sovereign Wealth Fund under the terms of the delegated powers and delegated powers of the Chief Financial Officer.\n\n# Managing the foreign exchange fund\n\n# Investment goals and syndicate structure\n\nThe following investment objectives have been set by the OTC Advisory Board for the OTC Fund:\n\n(a) safeguarding the capital; (b) ensuring that the overall monetary base is adequately supported at all times by highly liquid dollar assets; (c) ensuring that there is sufficient liquidity to maintain monetary and financial stability; and (d) seeking the best return on investment to secure the long-term purchasing power of the Fund, subject to the conditions set out in subparagraphs (a) to (c) above.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the legal purpose of the fund and are reflected in the composition and target asset allocation of the fund.\n\nThe funds are broadly divided into two main groups: support groups and investment groups. Support groups hold highly liquid dollar assets and provide adequate support on a currency basis in accordance with the rules of the monetary authority system. Investment groups invest primarily in the bond and stock markets of the member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to secure the value of the assets and their long-term purchasing power.\n\nIn order to better manage risk and improve medium-term returns, the FSA has prudently and progressively diversified the assets of some of the hedge funds into more diversified asset classes, including emerging market and inland bonds and stocks, private equity (including infrastructure) and real estate. Emerging market and inland bonds and stocks are held by the investment group, while private equity and real estate investments are held by the long-term growth group. The market cap of the long-term growth group is one-third of the cumulative surplus of the hedge fund and the sum of the future fund and the portion of the long-term growth of the hedge fund's subsidiary deposits.\n\nThe Strategic Asset Pool was established in 2007 to hold the shares of Hong Kong Trading and Settlement Limited, which the government purchased for the account of the shell fund for strategic purposes. Due to the unique nature of the pool, the investment performance assessment of the shell fund does not include it.\n\n# Deposits to the shell fund\n\nOTFs sometimes accept deposits from financial reserves, government funds, and legal entities. The interest rate is generally pegged to the performance of the investment group, but mainly excludes futures funds. The interest rate on the future fund deposit is pegged to the performance of the investment group and the long-term growth group, and the actual interest rate is determined by the ratio of the group. At the end of 2018, the ratio of the future fund to the investment group and the long-term growth group was about 50:50\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment procedures of hedge funds are based on strategic asset allocation and strategic asset allocation respectively. Strategic asset allocation, which is the allocation reflected in the investment criteria, shows the long-term asset allocation that the hedge fund can make to achieve the investment objective. Hedge funds use strategic allocation as a guide to strategically allocate assets in order to obtain returns beyond the criteria. Therefore, the actual allocation tends to deviate from the standard allocation (also known as strategic allocation), and the difference between the actual and standard allocation is called \"strategic deviation\". The Director of Finance, after consulting the Advisory Committee of Hedge Funds, develops investment criteria and trace error limits, and the Financial Conduct Authority is authorized to determine the strategic allocation and allocation of strategic deviations.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nThe Office of Investment in Hedge Funds (OIF) was established in August 2011 to provide investment and risk management functions. The OIF staff directly manages approximately 72% of the investment of the OIF, including the entire support group and some of the investment groups. The investment groups invest in the global interest rate market and implement the macro risk management strategy of the OIF through derivatives.\n\n# Outsourcing investment managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets through internal staff, the CMA also employs an external investment manager responsible for managing approximately 28% of the assets of the shell fund, including all listed stock combinations and other special assets. The purpose of employing an external investment manager is to use the best professional investment technology in the market for investment in the shell fund, to achieve sustainable returns, and to allow the shell fund to benefit from diversified and complementary investment methods, as well as to draw on market interest and professional investment technology knowledge.\n\nThe associated expenses of hiring an outsourced investment manager include the management and custody fees, transaction fees, withholding taxes and other taxes. These expenses vary from year to year, mainly due to market factors.\n\n# Risk management and surveillance\n\nThe investment environment is becoming more complex, highlighting the importance of risk management. The IAM has established strict controls and investment guidelines for investment groups managed by internal and external investment managers, and closely monitors compliance with guidelines and regulations. The IAM has strengthened risk assessment to accommodate the increasingly diversified investment of shell funds.\n\n#Responsible investing\n\nThe Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKX) is a non-profit organization founded in Hong Kong in 1993 by Hong Kong-based investment firm Hong Kong Investment Group Limited (HKX) Ltd. and its subsidiary Hong Kong Investment Group Limited (HKXL) Ltd. with the aim of promoting international investment by investing in Hong Kong and Hong Kong. The Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKXL) Ltd. is a non-profit organization founded in 1994 by Hong Kong-based investment firm Hong Kong Investment Group Ltd. and its subsidiary Hong Kong Investment Group Ltd. with the aim of promoting international investment by investing in Hong Kong and Hong Kong.\n\n# Performance of the foreign exchange fund\n\nThe financial markets in 2018\n\nIn 2018, a number of previously undervalued risk factors emerged, including the pace of normalization of US interest rates, the impact of US government foreign trade policy and protectionism on global trade, and geopolitical risks, which led to significant volatility and adjustment in global financial markets.\n\nThe emerging markets and Hong Kong stock market have been in a steady decline since late January, with the HONG KONG index down by a maximum of 27% since its peak in the month. Since Q4, major European and American stock markets have also fallen sharply, recording double-digit declines. Global equity markets generally fell in 2018, with the MSCI Global Index for developed countries falling 10.4%, and the MSCI Emerging Markets Index falling 16.6%.\n\nBond yields rose in 2018 as U.S. monetary policy normalized. However, the yields of 10-year Treasury bonds remained volatile. For example, the yield of 10-year Treasury bonds rose from about 2.5% at the beginning of the year to a seven-year high of 3.2% in November, but by the end of the year it had softened to 2.7% due to investor concerns about the U.S. trade dispute and the trend of hedge funds.\n\nIn the money market, the dollar strengthened in the year following the US rate hike. The US dollar index rose by 4.4%, and major currencies such as the euro and the renminbi fell by about 5% against the dollar. In addition, some emerging markets were affected by domestic political and economic instability, and their currencies were further weakened. For example, the Argentine peso and the Turkish lira fell by about 50% and 30% respectively against the dollar. In comparison, the need for safe-haven investment moved the yuan to 2.7% above the dollar.\n\nTable 1 shows the performance of the major currencies, bonds and stock markets in 2018.\n\nTable 1 Market performance in 2018\n\n# Performance of the foreign exchange fund\n\nThe foreign exchange fund recorded HK$10.9 billion in investment income in 2018, including HK$57.4 billion in bond investment income, HK$20.7 billion in equity investment losses, HK$3.87 billion in other equity investment losses, HK$9 billion in devaluation of non-HK assets, and HK$21.9 billion in other investment income held by the subsidiaries of the foreign exchange fund investment holding company. On the other hand, strategic asset combinations recorded HK$5 billion in devaluation.\n\nAt the end of 2018, the total assets of the OTC funds amounted to HK$40.54 billion. The total market value of long-term growth combined investments was HK$283.6 billion, of which private equity was HK$191.1 billion, real estate was HK$92.5 billion. The total amount of HK$202.4 billion has been undertaken but not yet drawn as investments.\n\nThe return on investment of venture capital funds (excluding strategic asset groups) in 2018 was 0.3%, with negative returns of investment groups of 2.4%, and support groups of 2.1% ❚ The internal rate of return of long-term growth funds since the start of investments in 2009 was 12.9% ❚\n\nTable 1 shows the return on investment of hedge funds from 1994 to 2018 for the period. Table 2 shows the return on investment of hedge funds in 2018 and the average return on investment for different periods. The average return on investment of hedge funds over the past 3 years was 3.2%, over the past 5 years was 2.1%, over the past 10 years was 2.8%, and since 1994 it has been 4.7%3. Table 3 shows the monetary weight of hedge fund assets as of 31 December 2018."}

{"zh": "# 外匯基金\n\n- 審計署署長報告\n- 外匯基金財務報表\n\n# 審計署署長報告\n\n# 獨立審計師報告致財政司司長\n\n# 意見\n\n茲證明我已審計列載於第167至273頁外匯基金及其附屬公司（「集團」）的財務報表，該等財務報表包括外匯基金及集團於2018年12月31日的資產負債表與截至該日止年度的收支帳目、全面收益表、權益變動表和現金流量表，以及財務報表的附註，包括主要會計政策概要。\n\n我認為，該等財務報表已按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》真實而中肯地反映外匯基金及集團於2018年12月31日的財務狀況及截至該日止年度的財務表現和現金流量，並已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》（第66章）第7條下所發出的指示妥為擬備。\n\n# 意見的基礎\n\n我已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示及審計署的審計準則進行審計。我根據該等準則而須承擔的責任，詳載於本報告「審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任」部分。根據該等準則，我獨立於集團，並已按該等準則履行其他道德責任。我相信，我所獲得的審計憑證是充足和適當地為我的審計意見提供基礎。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項是根據我的專業判斷，對截至2018年12月31日止年度財務報表的審計最為重要的事項。我對整體財務報表進行審計及形成意見時處理了這些事項，而我不會對這些事項提供單獨的意見。\n\n# 按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.5、2.6及40.1。\n\n於2018年12月31日，集團按公平值列帳的金融資產共36,935.89億港元，金融負債共11,338.29億港元。\n\n93%的該等金融資產及所有該等金融負債的公平值為相同資產或負債於活躍市場的報價（第1級參數），或是以估值方法估計，而所用的參數是以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第2級參數）。\n\n其餘7%的該等金融資產的公平值，是以估值方法估計，而所用的參數並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第3級參數）。有關金融資產共2,756.31億港元，主要包括非上市投資基金。\n\n鑑於所涉數額龐大及涉及估計，按公平值列帳的金融 資產及金融負債的估值屬關鍵審計事項。\n\n就按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值，審計程序包括：\n\n- 了解不同類別金融資產及金融負債的估值程序，包括相關監控措施；\n- 評價及測試監控措施，包括電腦系統的相關應用程式監控措施；\n- 就金融資產及金融負債的估值、存在、權利與責任及完整性取得函證；\n- 若使用市場報價，根據獨立來源核實價格；\n- 若所用估值方法的參數是以可觀察市場數據為基礎，評價估值方法是否適合及有關假設是否合理，以及根據獨立來源核實參數；及\n- 若所用估值方法的參數並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎，評價估值方法是否適合，以及有關假設與參數是否合理。\n\n# 按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.12、20及21。\n\n集團的投資物業按公平值列帳，於2018年12月31日共值253.21億港元。集團亦於3間聯營公司及20間合營公司擁有權益，該等公司主要業務為持有海外投資物業，有關權益共值443.36億港元。不論是由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有，該等投資物業的公平值均主要根據獨立專業估值師的估值釐定。該等估值涉及重大判斷及估計，包括所用的估值方法及假設。\n\n就按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值，審計程序包括：\n\n- 獲取及審視由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有的投資物業的估值報告，並核實公平值是根據有關估值報告所列的估值釐定；\n- 評估估值師的獨立性及資歷；及\n- 評價估值方法是否適合，以及有關假設與參數是否合理。\n\n# 其他資料\n\n金融管理專員須對其他資料負責。其他資料包括金融管理局2018年年報內的所有資料，但不包括財務報表及我的審計師報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見並不涵蓋其他資料，我亦不對其他資料發表任何形式的鑒證結論。\n\n就財務報表審計而言，我有責任閱讀其他資料，從而考慮其他資料是否與財務報表或我在審計過程中得悉的情況有重大矛盾，或者似乎存有重大錯誤陳述。基於我已執行的工作，如果我認為其他資料存有重大錯誤陳述，我需要報告該事實。在這方面，我沒有任何報告。\n\n# 金融管理專員及外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會就財務報表而須承擔的責任\n\n金融管理專員須負責按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》及行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示擬備真實而中肯的財務報表，及落實其認為必要的內部控制， 使財務報表不存有因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在擬備財務報表時，金融管理專員須負責評估集團持續經營的能力，以及在適用情況下披露與持續經營有關的事項，並以持續經營作為會計基礎。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會負責監督集團的財務報告過程。\n\n# 審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任\n\n我的目標是就整體財務報表是否不存有任何因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述取得合理保證，並發出包括我意見的審計師報告。合理保證是高水平的保證，但不能確保按審計署審計準則進行的審計定能發現所存有的任何重大錯誤陳述。錯誤陳述可以由欺詐或錯誤引起，如果合理預期它們個別或滙總起來可能影響財務報表使用者所作出的經濟決定，則會被視作重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在根據審計署審計準則進行審計的過程中，我會運用專業判斷並秉持專業懷疑態度。我亦會：\n\n- 識別和評估因欺詐或錯誤而導致財務報表存有重大錯誤陳述的風險；設計及執行審計程序以應對這些風險；以及取得充足和適當的審計憑證，作為我意見的基礎。由於欺詐可能涉及串謀、偽造、蓄意遺漏、虛假陳述，或凌駕內部控制的情況，因此未能發現因欺詐而導致重大錯誤陳述的風險，較未能發現因錯誤而導致者為高；\n- 了解與審計相關的內部控制，以設計適當的審計程序。然而，此舉並非旨在對集團內部控制的有效性發表意見；\n- 評價金融管理專員所採用的會計政策是否恰當，以及其作出的會計估計和相關資料披露是否合理；\n- 判定金融管理專員以持續經營作為會計基礎的做法是否恰當，並根據所得的審計憑證，判定是否存在與事件或情況有關，而且可能對集團持續經營的能力構成重大疑慮的重大不確定性。如果我認為存在重大不確定性，則有必要在審計師報告中請使用者留意財務報表中的相關資料披露。假若所披露的相關資料不足，我便須發出非無保留意見的審計師報告。我的結論是基於截至審計師報告日止所取得的審計憑證。然而，未來事件或情況可能導致集團不能繼續持續經營；\n- 評價財務報表的整體列報方式、結構和內容，包括披露資料，以及財務報表是否中肯反映交易和事項；及\n- 就集團中實體或業務活動的財務資料獲取充足和適當的審計憑證，以對財務報表發表意見。我負責指導、監督和執行集團審計。我對我的審計意見承擔全部責任。\n\n我會與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通計劃的審計範圍和時間以及重大審計發現等事項，包括我在審計期間識別出內部控制的任何重大缺陷。\n\n我亦會向外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會提交聲明，說明我已符合有關獨立性的相關道德要求，並與他們溝通所有被合理認為可能會影響我獨立性的關係和其他事項，以及在適用的情況下，相關的防範措施。\n\n從與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通的事項中，我會決定哪些事項對本期財務報表的審計最為重要，因而構成關鍵審計事項。我會在審計師報告中描述這些事項，除非法律法規不允許對某件事項作出公開披露，或在極端罕見的情況下，因為有合理預期在我報告中溝通某事項而造成的負面後果將會超過其產生的公眾利益而我決定不應在報告中溝通該事項。\n\n審計署署長\n朱乃璋\n\n2019 年 4 月 4 日", "en": "# The Outdoor Fund\n\n- Audit report of the Director-General - Financial statements of the Fund for External Aid\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit\n\n#Independent Auditor reports to the Finance Minister\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the shell fund and its subsidiaries (\"Group\") as set out on pages 167 to 273, which include the statement of assets and liabilities of the shell fund and the Group as at 31 December 2018 and the balance sheet for the year ended that date, the comprehensive income statement, the statement of changes in equity and cash flows, and the notes to the financial statements, including the summary of the main accounting policies.\n\nI consider that the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Chartered Accountants and have faithfully reflected the financial position of the Fund and the Group as at 31 December 2018 and the financial performance and cash flows for the year ended that date, and have been prepared in accordance with the instructions issued by the Executive Director under Article 7 of the Fund Regulations (Chapter 66);\n\n# Based on opinion\n\nI have conducted my audit in accordance with the instructions of the Executive Director under Section 7 of the Shell Fund Regulations and the Audit Bureau's audit standards. My responsibilities under these standards are set out in the section \"Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of financial statements\" of this report. I am independent of the Group and have fulfilled other ethical responsibilities under these standards. I believe that the audit certificates I have obtained provide an adequate and appropriate basis for my audit opinion.\n\n# Key accounting issues\n\nI have identified the matters that, in my professional judgment, are of the greatest importance to the audit of the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018. I have dealt with these matters in the course of auditing and forming opinions on the financial statements as a whole, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value\n\nPlease refer to the financial statements annexes 2.5, 2.6 and 40.1.\n\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Group had financial assets at fair value of HK$36,935.89 billion and financial liabilities of HK$11,338.29 billion.\n\n93% of the fair value of such financial assets and all such financial liabilities is the price of the same asset or liability in an active market (Class 1 parameter) or is estimated by valuation methods using parameters based on observable market data (Class 2 parameter).\n\nThe remaining 7% of the fair value of these financial assets is estimated by the valuation method, and the parameters used are not based on observable market data (the \"Tier 3\" parameters). The total value of the financial assets is HK$275.631 billion, mainly including non-listed investment funds.\n\nIn view of the large amount involved and the estimates involved, the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities accounted for at fair value is a critical matter for the audit.\n\nThe audit procedures for the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value include:\n\n- Understand the valuation procedures for different classes of financial assets and financial liabilities, including the related monitoring measures; - Evaluate and test the monitoring measures, including the relevant application monitoring measures for computer systems; - Obtain documentation on the valuation, existence, rights and liabilities and integrity of financial assets and financial liabilities; - Verify the price based on independent sources if market quotes are used; - Evaluate the appropriateness of the valuation method if the parameters used are based on observable market data, and the appropriateness of the relevant assumptions, and the appropriateness of the relevant benchmarks based on independent sources; and - Evaluate the appropriateness of the valuation method and the appropriateness of the relevant assumptions and the relevant parameters if the parameters used are not based on observable market data.\n\n#Valuation of investment properties at fair value\n\nPlease see the financial statements appendices 2.12-20 and 21\n\nThe Group's investment properties are listed at fair value, with a total value of HK$25.321 billion as at 31 December 2018. The Group also owns interests in 3 subsidiaries and 20 associate companies, whose main business is to hold overseas investment properties, with a total value of HK$44.336 billion. Whether held directly by the Group or by associates or affiliates, the fair value of such investment properties is based primarily on the valuation of independent professional appraisers. Such valuations involve significant judgments and estimates, including the valuation methods and assumptions used.\n\nThe audit process for valuation of investment property at fair value includes:\n\n- obtain and review the valuation reports of investment properties owned directly by the group or by associates or joint ventures and verify that the fair value is based on the valuation set out in the relevant valuation reports; - assess the independence and qualifications of the valuers; and - assess the appropriateness of the valuation method and the reasonableness of the relevant assumptions and parameters.\n\n# Other\n\nThe Financial Controller is responsible for all other information. All other information is contained in the Financial Controller's 2018 Annual Report, except for the financial statements and my auditor's report.\n\nI am not making any kind of expert opinion on the other material.\n\nWhereas, in the context of an audit of the financial statements, I am responsible for reading other material and thereby considering whether there is a material inconsistency with the financial statements or with the circumstances of which I became aware in the course of the audit, or whether there appears to be a material misstatement. Based on the work that I have performed, I am required to report the fact that if I believe that there is a material misstatement in other material. In this regard, I have no report.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Audit Committee under the Financial Management Committee and the OTC Advisory Committee on Financial Statements\n\nThe financial controller shall be responsible for preparing the financial statements of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Chartered Accountants and the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under Article 7 of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange Fund Regulations, and for implementing the internal controls he deems necessary to ensure that the financial statements do not contain material misstatements caused by fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing financial statements, the financial manager shall be responsible for assessing the Group's ability to operate in a sustainable manner and, where applicable, for disclosing matters related to sustainable operation and taking account of sustainable operation as a basis for accounting.\n\nThe Audit Committee, under the auspices of the Advisory Committee of the Overseas Fund, is responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process of the group.\n\n# Accountability of auditors for auditing financial statements\n\nThat my objective is to obtain reasonable assurance that there is no material misstatement in the overall financial statements resulting from fraud or error and to issue an auditor's report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but it is not guaranteed that an audit conducted in accordance with the audit standards of the Audit Bureau will reveal any material misstatement. Misstatements can be caused by fraud or error and are considered to be material misstatements if it is reasonably expected that, individually or in aggregate, they could affect the economic decisions made by users of the financial statements.\n\nI will use professional judgment and professional skepticism in the course of my audit in accordance with the Audit Bureau's audit standards. I will also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of financial statements due to fraud or error; design and implement audit procedures to address these risks; and obtain adequate and appropriate audit certificates as the basis for my opinion. Since fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, false statements, or overstepping internal controls, the risk of material misstatement of financial statements due to fraud is higher than the risk of failure to detect errors; - understand the internal controls associated with auditing and design appropriate audit procedures. However, the audit team is not intended to provide an effective opinion on the effectiveness of the internal controls within the group. - assess whether the audit team is aware of the policies adopted by the financial manager and whether the audit team is prepared to disclose the relevant information and reports; - assess the ability of the auditor to continue to use the information and reports as the basis for the continuing audit activity of the financial management body, and to use the information and reports as the basis for the continuing audit activity to determine the existence of material misstatements and to determine whether the financial report is not in my control, and if there is material evidence of material misstatements or material events, including financial statements, or material misstatements, or material, material, material or material, material, material, material or material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material, material,\n\nI communicate with the audit committee under the advisory board of the hedge fund the scope and timing of the audit plan and the significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal controls that I identify during the audit.\n\nI will also make a statement to the Audit Committee under the auspices of the Advisory Committee on Outer Banks that I have met the relevant ethical requirements for independence and communicate to them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be considered to affect my independence and, where applicable, the relevant safeguards.\n\nFrom my communications with the audit committee under the advisory committee of the OTC Fund, I determine which matters are most important to the audit of the financial statements for the current period and therefore constitute critical audit matters. I describe these matters in the auditor's report unless the law or regulation does not permit public disclosure of a matter, or in extremely rare circumstances where there is a reasonable expectation that the negative consequences of communicating a matter in my report will outweigh the public interest it generates and I decide not to communicate the matter in the report.\n\nThe Director of the Audit Office, Jun Jian\n\nThe following is a list of the most commonly used verbs."}

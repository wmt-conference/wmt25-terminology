{"zh": "# 總裁報告\n\n2020年可謂是超乎想像的一年。\n\n新冠病毒疫情肆虐全球，令人措手不及，世界各地的經濟活動幾乎陷於停頓。在疫情的打擊下，香港經濟繼2019年後連續第二年收縮，本地生產總值錄得有紀錄以來的最大跌幅。失業率飆升至16年高位，部分行業尤其受到重創。\n\n然而，困境往往是展現我們實力的時候。儘管面對重重挑戰，香港的貨幣及銀行體系再次成功抵禦衝擊。這一切絕非偶然，而是我們多年來一直奉行審慎政策的成果。\n\n復甦前路難望平坦。即使各地央行及政府都全力支持經濟，但前景仍充滿不確定性，包括央行的貨幣政策立場、疫苗接種計劃的進展，以及長期低息環境的潛在影響。另一方面，地緣政治緊張局勢變化不斷，令宏觀形勢更添變數。\n\n縱使面對如此不明朗的形勢，金管局會繼續緊守崗位，維持貨幣及金融穩定，締造有利經濟復甦的環境。與此同時，在不斷演變的銀行及金融業大環境下，我們亦會致力把握機會，提升香港作為全球金融樞紐的競爭力。\n\n# 貨幣及金融穩定：堅穩如昔\n\n聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）在2020年繼續暢順有序地運作。聯匯制度自1983年實施至今，渡過一次又一次的難關，充分展現出抵禦衝擊的能力。儘管面對疫情及波動的宏觀經濟環境，年內港元匯率一直保持平穩。強方兌換保證合共被觸發85次，累計資金流入約3,835億港元。\n\n聯匯制度得以維持穩健，全賴多年來所建立的穩固根基。正如國際貨幣基金組織在其《2020年對外部門報告》中的總結指出，聯匯制度的公信力建基於具高透明度的運作規則、充裕的財政及外匯儲備、穩健的金融監管、靈活的經濟及審慎的財政制度。同時，金管局透過與業界緊密聯繫，以及透過傳統及社交媒體與公眾有效溝通，迅速澄清謠言，並適時提供有關事實與數據的最新資訊。金管局亦利用最新的科技與數據分析技術，繼續提升監察能力，以靈活應對最新市況及新出現的風險。\n\n雖然疫情對經濟造成沉重壓力，但銀行體系維持穩健，資本及流動資金充裕。於2020年底，本地銀行的資本充足比率為20.7%，遠高於國際最低要求的8%。大型銀行的平均流動性覆蓋比率亦遠高於法定最低要求的100%，於2020年第4季達到155.1%。受疫情影響，銀行的資產質素略為轉差，特定分類貸款比率於2020年底上升至0.9%，但仍屬穩健並遠低於自2000年以來的長期平均水平1.8%。\n\n# 銀行體系：經濟命脈\n\n銀行體系在經濟與社會中扮演重要的金融中介角色。年內金管局一方面繼續重點監管銀行的信用及流動性風險，另一方面亦密切留意疫情對銀行營運的影響，並採取多項措施，確保銀行體系能繼續提供基本服務，以及提供貸款支持經濟。金管局在3月下調逆周期緩衝資本比率100基點至1%，又在4月調低監管儲備水平。這些措施為銀行體系合共釋放約1萬億港元的借貸空間。\n\n我們深知中小企在當前的經濟環境下或會面對資金周轉壓力。因此，金管局聯同我們在2019年成立的銀行業中小企貸款協調機制推出多輪紓困措施，包括「預先批核還息不還本」計劃，將合資格企業的所有貸款本金還款延期6個月。截至2020年底，銀行共批出超過58,000宗貸款展期及其他支援措施的個案，涉資超過7,400億港元。鑑於疫情反覆，金管局因應情況將「預先批核還息不還本」計劃展期，並於2021年3月將計劃延長至2021年10月底。香港按揭證券有限公司亦在其中小企融資擔保計劃下推出「百分百擔保特惠貸款」，以紓緩中小企支付僱員薪金及租金的負擔。截至2020年底，共批出超過25,000宗申請，涉資約400億港元。該計劃在2021年第1季作出優化，申請期限亦延長至2021年12月31日。年內銀行亦批出超過28,000宗紓困措施申請，協助個人客戶的資金周轉，涉資440億港元。銀行業同心協力，支持企業及個人客戶，共渡時艱，實在令人鼓舞。\n\n與此同時，金管局繼續推動銀行業加強普及金融與實踐「以客為本」的文化。我們進一步鼓勵銀行格外留意有需要的客戶，並與銀行分享多方面的良好做法，包括為智障人士提供銀行服務，以及提供更多無障礙及方便易用的銀行服務。\n\n隨着科技長足發展，銀行業的經營環境亦急速轉變。因此，金管局的工作不僅限於應對當前的挑戰，亦要放眼未來，擴大人才庫，以配合銀行業的日後發展。我們與香港銀行公會及香港銀行學會聯合展開「提升未來銀行業人才的專業能力」研究計劃，評估銀行業未來幾年的潛在人才缺口，並為銀行規劃清晰的路線圖，以期未雨綢繆，改善人才供應的情況。我們又推出「銀行業人才起動計劃」，為本地大學的應屆畢業生提供為期6個月的實習機會及銀行業相關的特定培訓，藉以為業界培育人才。在本港勞工市場的嚴峻時期推出此計劃，亦正好為有志加入銀行業的年青人提供機會。\n\n# 國際金融中心地位：無懼挑戰\n\n為履行金管局其中一項重要職責，協助鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位，我們的未來規劃涵蓋銀行體系以至整個金融體系，旨在讓香港在不斷演變的金融環境中能夠保持作為國際金融中心的競爭力。在疫情期間，我們仍然穩步推進這些工作，並在幾個重點範疇積極開拓新機遇，以充分把握新趨勢及轉變的契機。\n\n# 推動綠色金融，締造更可持續的未來\n\n第一個範疇是推動綠色及可持續金融。自2019年5月推出分三階段進行的措施以來，相關工作已取得理想進展。我們在2020年完成對47間銀行的「綠色基準」評估，發表白皮書及發出通告，就銀行管理氣候風險提供指引及分享經驗。我們亦全力推進第二階段的工作，制定銀行業管理氣候風險的監管架構。此外，我們會致力在2025年或之前按照氣候相關財務披露工作小組的建議，要求銀行就氣候相關資料作出披露。這將使香港成為亞洲區內首個作出相關具體要求的地區。\n\n金管局作為全球最大的儲備管理人之一，我們積極將環境、社會及管治(ESG)因素納入甄選、委任及監察外聘投資經理的程序。我們亦身體力行作出ESG投資，包括投資於綠色、社會及可持續債券和低碳項目。\n\n為進一步發展香港的綠色金融生態圈，金管局一直協助政府發行綠色債券，而最近發行的第二批政府綠色債券更大受國際投資者歡迎。乘着這個發展趨勢，財政司司長在《2021至22年度財政預算案》中宣布政府會擴大「政府綠色債券計劃」的規模，將借款上限提升一倍至2,000億港元，並會增加日後發行的綠色債券的種類與發行渠道。\n\n為鞏固香港作為區內綠色及可持續金融樞紐，我們整體策略的其中一環，是與本地其他監管機構及國際社會合作，推進綠色金融議程。在本地方面，金管局聯同其他監管機構成立綠色和可持續金融跨機構督導小組，協調金融業的相關措施。該小組已經制定策略性計劃，促進香港的綠色及可持續金融的發展。在國際方面，金管局應國際金融公司的邀請，成為亞洲區域創始成員及首個區域執行理事，與其合力推動「綠色商業銀行聯盟」。聯盟旨在於全球金融市場推動綠色銀行業，並由亞洲開始，逐步擴展至其他地區。\n\n我們期望上述工作有助減低金融業面對的氣候風險，以及促進本港銀行發揮優勢，滿足區內綠色投資的龐大資金需求。\n\n# 金融科技方便市民，裨益經濟\n\n推動金融業增長的另一個主要引擎是金融科技，而在新冠病毒疫情下，這方面的步伐更見加速。\n\n過去一年清楚顯示，金融科技能夠擴展我們的「工具箱」，以應對突如其來的衝擊。面對新冠病毒疫情，電子支付渠道發揮了前所未見的作用。自2018年9月推出快速支付系統「轉數快」至2020年底期間，「轉數快」已錄得690萬個登記賬戶。即使在社交距離措施的限制下，公眾仍能利用「轉數快」這個安全快捷及穩妥的方式收付及轉撥資金，令「轉數快」的平均每日交易量在2020年急增2.3倍。我們亦一直與政府合作，將「轉數快」的應用範圍擴大至繳付更多種政府及公共服務帳單。\n\n此外，金融科技亦有助銀行提供更多元化及便利的銀行客戶服務。獲金管局發牌的所有8間虛擬銀行年內已經全數在香港開業。截至2020年底，在虛擬銀行開設的帳戶共有420,000個，總計客戶存款150億港元。其中部分虛擬銀行已經率先使用新類型數據進行信貸評估，以開拓新的客戶群及促進普及金融。金管局繼續推動在香港發展更具規模及更多元化的合規科技生態圈，作為「銀行易」措施的一部分，從而精簡監管規定，提升客戶體驗。除透過刊發通訊系列，以提高業界對合規科技應用的認知外，金管局亦發表白皮書，載述加快銀行業採用合規科技的兩年計劃。另外，金管局又展開「商業數據通」項目，以便中小企利用自身的數碼足跡更便捷地獲取銀行融資。\n\n金融科技面貌日新月異，科技應用亦日趨普及，金管局需繼續秉持嚴謹的監管。為此，我們推出「網絡防衛計劃2.0」，以提高銀行的網絡防衛能力。我們亦加強對科技風險管理的現場審查，並制定監管框架，評估運用創新信用風險評估方法的個人貸款產品的信用風險。金管局亦展開監管科技應用的三年計劃，以提升監管流程的成效及前瞻性。我們現正進行的有關工作包括更有效地利用數據及科技來加強反洗錢方面的監管。", "en": "# The President reports\n\n2020 is a year of unimaginable things.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has brought the economy to a near standstill as the global economy is hit by a global outbreak of the virus. The economy of Hong Kong has contracted for the second year in a row since 2019, with the country's GDP falling by the most in a record time. Unemployment has risen to a 16-year high, with some industries particularly hard hit.\n\nHowever, the difficulties are often the time when we show our strength. Despite the challenges, Hong Kong's monetary and banking system has once again managed to withstand the shock. This is not an accident, but the result of our prudent policy over the years.\n\nThe recovery is not a smooth one, and even with the full support of central banks and governments in various regions, the outlook remains fraught with uncertainty, including the monetary policy stance of the central bank, the progress of the vaccination program, and the potential impact of a prolonged low-interest environment. On the other hand, geopolitical tensions are constantly changing, adding to the volatility of the macro situation.\n\nEven in the face of such uncertainties, the Bank of China will continue to maintain its position and maintain monetary and financial stability, and create an environment conducive to economic recovery. At the same time, in the constantly evolving banking and financial industry environment, we will also strive to seize opportunities and enhance Hong Kong's competitiveness as a global financial hub.\n\n#Money and Financial Stability: The same as before\n\nThe linkage exchange rate system continued to function smoothly in 2020. The linkage system, which has been in place since 1983, has been through a series of challenges and has fully demonstrated its ability to withstand shocks. Despite the pandemic and volatile macroeconomic environment, the year-on-year HKD exchange rate has remained stable. The strong currency swap guarantee has been triggered 85 times, with a cumulative cash flow of about HKD 3835 billion.\n\nThe Fed's credibility is based on highly transparent operating rules, ample fiscal and foreign reserves, robust financial supervision, and a flexible and prudent financial system. At the same time, the Fed is able to quickly clarify rumors and provide timely updates on facts and data through close ties with industry and effective communication with the public through traditional and social media. The Fed also uses the latest technology and data analysis techniques to continue to improve its surveillance capabilities to respond to the latest market conditions and emerging risks.\n\nDespite the severe economic pressures, the banking system has remained stable, with capital and liquidity in place. The capital adequacy ratio of local banks was 20.7% at the end of 2020, well above the international minimum requirement of 8%. The average liquidity coverage ratio of large banks was also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 100%, reaching 155.1% in Q4 2020. The quality of banks' assets was slightly impaired by the epidemic, with the specific classification loan ratio rising to 0.9% at the end of 2020, but remained stable and well below the long-term average of 1.8% since 2000.\n\n#Banking: the life force of the economy\n\nThe banking system plays an important financial intermediary role in the economy and society. The Banking Authority continued to focus on banking credit and liquidity risk during the year, while closely monitoring the impact of the pandemic on bank operations, and took several measures to ensure that the banking system could continue to provide basic services, as well as provide loans to support the economy. The Banking Authority lowered the countercyclical capital buffer rate to 100 basis points to 1% in March, and lowered the level of supervisory reserves in April.\n\nWe know that SMEs are facing the risk of financial stress in the current economic environment. We are aware that SMEs are facing financial stress. Therefore, the CRA, in conjunction with our banking SMEs Loan Coordination Mechanism, which was established in 2019, has introduced a series of stress relief measures, including the \"pre-approval interest-free loan\" scheme, which will delay the repayment of all loans to eligible enterprises for six months. As of the end of 2020, banks have approved more than 58,000 loan extension periods and other support measures involving more than HK$740 billion.\n\nAt the same time, the Kim administration continues to push for the banking industry to strengthen its access to finance and practice a \"customer-centric\" culture. We further encourage banks to pay special attention to customers in need and share good practices with banks in many areas, including banking for people with intellectual disabilities and providing more accessible and convenient banking services.\n\nWe have developed a joint research project with the Hong Kong Banking Association and the Hong Kong Institute of Banking to assess the potential talent gap in the banking industry in the coming years and to plan a clear roadmap for banks to overcome the shortage of talent. We have also launched the Banking Talent Activation Program to provide 6-month internships and specific training for banking professionals to graduates from local universities. We are also offering opportunities for young people to join the bank's volunteer program. \"\n\n#International financial centre status: not afraid to challenge\n\nTo fulfill one of the key responsibilities of the KIM, to help consolidate Hong Kong's position as an international financial centre, our future plans cover the banking system and the entire financial system, aimed at enabling Hong Kong to remain competitive as an international financial centre in a constantly evolving financial environment.\n\n#Promoting green finance for a more sustainable future\n\nThe first is to promote green and sustainable finance. Since the launch of the three-phase measure in May 2019, there has been good progress. We completed the Green Standard assessment of 47 banks in 2020, published a white paper and issued a notice to provide guidance and share experience on managing climate risk. We are also fully advancing the work of the second phase, developing a regulatory framework for managing climate risk in the banking industry. In addition, we will work to require banks to disclose climate-related data by 2025 or earlier, as recommended by the Climate-related Financial Disclosure Working Group. This will make Hong Kong the first region in Asia to make such a requirement.\n\nAs one of the largest reserve managers in the world, we actively incorporate environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into our processes for selecting, appointing and monitoring outsourced investment managers. We also actively engage in ESG investments, including investments in green, social and sustainable bonds and low-carbon projects.\n\nIn order to further develop the green financial ecosystem in Hong Kong, the CIM has been assisting the government in issuing green bonds, and the second batch of green bonds recently issued by the government is more welcomed by international investors. Taking this development trend, the Finance Minister announced in the draft budget for the fiscal year 2021-22, that the government will expand the size of the \"Government Green Bond Program\", double the borrowing limit to HK$200 billion, and increase the types and issuance channels of green bonds issued in the future.\n\nTo consolidate Hong Kong as a green and sustainable financial hub in the region, part of our overall strategy is to work with other local regulators and the international community to promote green finance protocols. At the local level, the Gold Authority has formed a Green and Sustainable Finance Inter-institutional Supervisory Group with other regulators to coordinate relevant measures in the financial industry. The group has developed a strategic plan to promote the development of green and sustainable finance in Hong Kong.\n\nWe hope that this work will help reduce the climate risks faced by the financial sector and promote the dominance of the Bank of Hong Kong to meet the huge demand for green investment in the region.\n\n#Fintech is good for citizens, good for the economy\n\nAnother major engine driving financial sector growth is fintech, which is accelerating under the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe past year has clearly shown that fintech can expand our toolbox to deal with sudden shocks. In the face of the coronavirus outbreak, electronic payment channels have played an unprecedented role. Since the launch of the rapid payment system \"Fast Transfer\" in September 2018, 6.9 million accounts have been registered in Fast Transfer by the end of 2020. Even with the limitations of social distancing measures, the public can still use Fast Transfer as a safe, fast and secure way to receive and transfer funds, and the average daily transaction of Fast Transfer increased by 2.3 times in 2020. We have also been working with the government to expand the scope of Fast Transfer to pay more government and public service bills.\n\nIn addition, financial technology also helps banks to provide more diversified and convenient banking services to their customers. All eight virtual banks licensed by the Financial Conduct Authority have been opened in Hong Kong since the year 2020. As of the end of 2020, there were 420,000 accounts opened in virtual banks, with a total of HK$15 billion in customer deposits. Some of these virtual banks have pioneered the use of new types of data for credit assessment to develop new customer groups and promote financial inclusion. The Financial Conduct Authority continues to develop a larger and more diversified integrated technology ecosystem in Hong Kong as part of the Banking Ease initiative, thereby simplifying regulation and enhancing customer experience. In addition to publishing a series of communications to increase awareness of the use of non-regulated technologies in the industry, the Financial Conduct Authority has also published a white paper, including a two-year regulation on accelerating the adoption of small banks.\n\nWe have also strengthened the field review of technology risk management and developed a regulatory framework to assess the credit risk of personal loan products using innovative credit risk assessment methods. We have also developed a three-year plan for the application of supervisory technology to improve the effectiveness and forward-looking nature of the supervisory process. We are currently working on a more effective use of data and technology to strengthen the supervision of anti-money laundering."}

The labor market deteriorated rapidly, and inflation eased. The government and the Gold Authority introduced austerity measures to support the economy in response to the harsh economic environment.\n\nDespite the challenges, the banking system in Hong Kong has remained stable, with good financial conditions, continued growth in deposits, ample capital and liquidity, and stable asset quality.\n\n# Currency is stable\n\nDespite the increased uncertainties, the HKD and the money market have been operating smoothly, reflecting the stability of the Hong Kong monetary system. The HKD exchange rate was strong for most of 2020, and stronger exchange rate guarantees were triggered several times. This fully demonstrates the stability of the correlation exchange rate system and the confidence of the market in the system.\n\n# Banking is stable\n\nThe Banking Authority of China (BAC) has continued to focus on the credit and liquidity risk management of banks, while closely monitoring the impact of the pandemic on bank operations. In light of the continuing increase in network risks and the industry's accelerated adoption of technology, the BAC has strengthened its oversight of the risk management and operational stability of banks' technology, as well as the protection of consumers of digital financial services.\n\nThe FSA has provided flexibility to banks to continue serving their customers during the pandemic. The FSA has also worked with other relevant authorities to develop the implementation rules for the pilot of the \"cross-border cash flow\" business, as well as to provide guidance on family office and wealth management operations.\n\nIn its response to the coronavirus outbreak, the Banking Authority has acted quickly to identify risks to how the methodology and technology can help banks respond more effectively to the coronavirus outbreak, while prudently managing the impact of the ongoing geopolitical tensions on the banking system. The Banking Authority also continues to promote information sharing with public-private partners and support the adoption of contract technology in the banking industry.\n\nThe Bank of Hong Kong has introduced new rules and regulations to strengthen the banking system's regulatory regime to meet the latest international standards. In terms of green and sustainable banking, the Bank of Hong Kong has entered the second of three phases of the process, and is developing regulatory requirements. The Bank of Hong Kong is also working to develop settlement standards, conduct settlement planning and build settlement enforcement capacity, and ensure Hong Kong has a credible banking settlement system.\n\nHong Kong's status as an international financial center is a matter of debate.\n\nThe Ministry of Finance continues to promote the development of the fintech ecosystem, with banks and the payment industry increasingly adopting fintech. The rapid payment system \"Quick Transfer\" has seen a sharp increase in transactions. The Ministry of Finance is actively engaged in cross-border cooperation in areas such as central bank digital currency.\n\nHong Kong's position as the global hub for offshore RMB operations has been consolidated and continues to be the main gateway to mainland China. Hong Kong's financial connectivity to the mainland continues to grow through its world-class market infrastructure and interconnected communications infrastructure. Good progress has also been made in the development of the Macau Bay Area in Hong Kong over the years.\n\nThe Bank is actively exploring new opportunities to further enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong's financial platforms, including the Asset and Wealth Management Enterprise Finance Centre, and the green and sustainable finance arena.\n\n# Reserves management\n\nDespite the complex and volatile investment environment, the OTC fund recorded HK$235.8 million in investment income in 2020, a 5.3% return, and a positive return across all five major investment categories.\n\nThe Bank continues to promote responsible investment and asset diversification. The long-term growth of the Bank has been a 13.7% annual internal rate of return since its inception in 2009.\n\n# Institutional and social responsibility\n\nDuring the year, the KIM continued to communicate effectively with the society and the market through various channels, and to increase public understanding of the KIM's policies and operations. In the performance of its duties, the KIM maintained a very high level of corporate governance, supported the professional capacity of its staff, strictly controlled the finances and strengthened the information technology capacity and security to cope with new challenges and projects, as well as increasingly heavy workloads.\n\nAt the same time, the KING Administration continues to work to fulfill its institutional social responsibility and strive to be a responsible and sustainable institution. In the context of the coronavirus epidemic, the KING Administration has made special work arrangements to ensure that important functions continue to function normally, while safeguarding the health of employees.

{"zh": "# 經濟及金融環境\n\n面對新冠病毒疫情，香港經濟在2020 年連續第二年收縮，並錄得歷年來最嚴重的跌幅。消費及旅遊相關行業尤其受到重創，其收縮幅度較整體經濟更大。與此同時，勞工市場急速惡化，通脹有所緩和。政府及金管局為應對嚴峻的經濟環境，推出歷來最大規模的紓困措施以支持經濟。新冠病毒疫苗接種可望使經濟活動回復正常，預期2021年經濟會恢復增長，然而經濟復甦的力度及步伐仍受疫情發展以及疫苗供應、覆蓋範圍和成效等眾多不明朗因素影響。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 實體經濟活動\n\n受新冠病毒疫情打擊，香港經濟在2020年收縮6.1%，是連續第二年收縮，亦是有紀錄以來最嚴重的年度跌幅（表1）。經濟活動急跌主要是本地需求急劇收縮所致（圖1）。疫情爆發及相應的社交距離措施令本地消費活動受到重創。由於營商環境轉差，整體投資支出亦明顯減少。對外方面，儘管疫情導致供應鏈受干擾及全球需求萎縮，但部分受惠於中國內地迅速恢復生產和經濟活動，全年合計香港貨物出口僅略為下降。相比之下，由於封城、關閉邊境及旅客流量限制令全球旅遊業陷入停頓，所以香港服務輸出嚴重受挫。本地及轉口帶動的需求疲弱，亦令貨物進口及服務輸入轉差。由於進口總額下跌步伐較出口快，淨出口（貿易順差）為本地生產總值帶來支持（圖1）。按經濟行業分析，消費及旅遊相關行業，例如零售、住宿及膳食服務業受到的打擊尤其嚴重，收縮情況較整體經濟更差，而金融業則溫和增長。\n\n表 1 按開支項目計的實質本地生產總值增長（比對上期）\n\n# 經濟及金融環境\n\n圖 1 組成部分對實質本地生產總值增長的貢獻\n\n政府為應對疫情，透過2020至21年度《財政預算案》迅速推出歷來最大規模的紓困措施，並從「防疫抗疫基金」發放4輪補助，合共超過3,000億港元。這些措施包括向合資格居民發放一筆過10,000港元現金、透過「保就業」計劃提供工資補貼，以及為受疫情重創的行業提供一筆過資助、寬減租金及豁免收費。金管局則採取三管齊下的方式支持銀行業，從而支撐實體經濟。有關措施包括與銀行業積極協調，減輕企業及家庭的資金周轉壓力，釋放緩衝以提高銀行的借貸能力，並確保銀行有足夠流動性支持本地經濟活動。\n\n# 通脹\n\n通脹壓力在2020年明顯減弱。剔除政府一次性紓困措施的影響，基本通脹率放緩至1.3%，是2009年全球金融危機以來最小的升幅。基本食品（尤其新鮮豬肉）的價格壓力明顯減退；而自行烹煮以外，由於飲食業提供大幅度折扣，所以外出用膳的價格在下半年亦有所下降。隨着早前新簽訂的私人住宅租金回落，消費物價指數租金項目的增長亦回軟（圖2）。更廣泛而言，由於名義工資增長減慢及商業樓宇租金偏軟，本地營商成本壓力減少；而在疲弱的全球經濟狀況下，進口價格通脹有所緩和。\n\n圖 2 基本消費物價通脹\n\n# 勞工市場\n\n勞工市場在2020年急速惡化。經季節性調整的失業率年內由3.3%飆升至6.6%，為16年的高位（圖3），其中零售、住宿及膳食服務等受疫情重創行業的失業率達到10%以上。就業不足率亦於8月升至3.8%，為沙士疫情後的高位。部分由於經濟狀況急速惡化造成的周期性反應，勞動人口參與率輕微減少。總就業人數（圖3）及私營機構職位空缺急跌，反映整體勞工需求進一步收縮。名義工資及收入增長進一步放緩。政府推出「保就業」計劃，為僱主提供有時限的財政支援以保留僱員，使勞工市場獲得一定程度的支持。\n\n圖 3 勞工市場狀況\n\n# 股市\n\n隨着新冠病毒疫情爆發，恒生指數在首季急跌至3年低位。繼各國中央銀行及政府推出大型支持措施後，股市在第2季及第3季略為回穩（圖4）。由於新冠病毒疫苗研發出現突破，股市於接近年底時重拾一些上升動力。恒生指數於年底收報27,231點，全年計錄得3.4%跌幅。受惠於內地企業在香港的第二上市活動，2020年本港首次公開招股集資總額約4,000億港元，以集資額計全球排名第二。\n\n圖 4 資產價格\n\n# 物業市場\n\n部分受到超低利率所支持，住宅物業市場在2020年大致平穩（圖4）。整體樓價及成交量較前一年均無大變動。然而，由於家庭住戶入息減少，置業負擔能力更為偏緊。另一方面，非住宅物業市場進一步轉弱，物業價格錄得不同程度跌幅，成交量亦見底。受經濟下滑及空置率上升的影響，寫字樓及零售物業租金大幅下跌。鑑於2019年以來非住宅物業市場已出現大幅調整，並預期會持續受壓，加上考慮到經濟基調及外圍環境等其他因素，金管局於8月調整非住宅物業的逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施。政府因應市場需求回落，亦於11月撤銷購置非住宅物業的雙倍從價印花稅這項需求管理措施。\n\n# 經濟前景\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n新冠病毒疫苗接種可望使經濟活動回復正常，預期香港經濟在2021年（全年合計）重拾正增長，然而經濟復甦的力度及步伐仍受疫情發展及疫苗供應、覆蓋範圍和成效等眾多不明朗因素影響。具體而言，疫苗廣泛接種需時，因此本地經濟在2021年早段仍面對相當程度的挑戰。對外方面，預計內地經濟會進一步增強，並為香港貨物及服務輸出帶來支持，然而其他主要經濟體的復甦步伐將取決於其大規模接種疫苗計劃的成效。政府預測2021年實質本地生產總值增長率介乎3.5至5.5%之間，與國際組織及私營機構分析員對香港最新的增長預測平均4.4%相符。\n\n# 通脹及勞工市場\n\n鑑於環球及本地經濟狀況仍具挑戰，預期2021年的通脹壓力將維持輕微。此外，早前新簽訂私人住宅租金回落的傳遞效應，將繼續令本地通脹受到抑制。市場共識預測2021年整體通脹率為1.5%，而政府預期整體及基本通脹率分別為1.6%及1%。由於經濟前景在2021年早段仍具挑戰，加上私營機構分析員預計2021年全年失業率仍會在約5.9%的偏高水平，因此短期內勞工市場將繼續受壓。\n\n# 銀行體系表現\n\n香港銀行體系在2020年保持穩健，銀行財務狀況良好。儘管新冠病毒疫情帶來挑戰，銀行資產負債表繼續擴大，存款資金增加。銀行體系資本及流動性狀況維持充裕，資產質素輕微轉差，但仍處穩健水平。\n\n# 資產負債表走勢\n\n2020年銀行體系資產負債表擴大5.7%。由於經濟下滑，年內貸款增長減慢至1.2%，相比2019年的增幅為6.7%；其中在香港使用的貸款增加2.2%，在香港境外使用的貸款微增0.1%，貿易融資減少6.2%。2020年中國內地相關貸款微跌0.2%，相比2019年錄得7.4%的增長。\n\n銀行資產負債表的負債方面，存款總額在2020年增加5.4%，相比2019年的增幅為2.9%。由於存款總額增長較貸款總額快，整體貸存比率由2019年底的75.3% 降至 2020 年底的 72.3%（圖 5）。\n\n圖 5 銀行體系的貸款及存款\n\n# 資本充足水平\n\n2020年銀行體系資本狀況維持穩健，為抵禦潛在衝擊提供強大的緩衝。2020年底本地註冊認可機構的綜合總資本比率與2019年底相比維持穩定，為20.7%。一級資本比率於同期由18.5%微升至18.7%（圖 6）。\n\n2020年底《巴塞爾協定三》槓桿比率與2019年底相比維持穩定，仍為8.2%，遠高於3%的法定最低要求（圖 7）。\n\n圖 6 本地註冊認可機構的綜合資本比率\n\n圖 7 本地註冊認可機構的綜合槓桿比率\n\n# 流動性狀況\n\n銀行體系的流動性狀況維持穩健，有能力抵禦受壓時的流動性衝擊。第1類機構的季度平均流動性覆蓋比率在第4季為155.1%，遠高於100%的法定最低要求。第2類機構的季度平均流動性維持比率為57.9%，亦遠高於25%的法定最低要求（圖 8）。\n\n圖 8 指定認可機構的流動性比率\n\n銀行體系的資金來源維持穩定。於2020年底，第1類機構的穩定資金淨額比率為138.6%，遠高於100%的法定最低要求。第2A類機構的核心資金比率為139.5%，亦遠高於75%的法定最低要求（圖 9）。\n\n圖 9 指定認可機構的資金比率\n\n# 資產質素\n\n新冠病毒疫情影響下，年內銀行體系資產質素略為下降，但以歷史及國際標準計仍然維持良好。特定分類貸款比率由2019年底的0.57%上升至2020年底的0.90%，逾期及經重組貸款比率於同期由0.34%上升至0.57%（圖10）。中國內地相關貸款的特定分類貸款比率由 2019 年底的 0.75% 上升至 2020 年底的 0.96%。住宅按揭貸款及信用卡貸款的拖欠比率仍然處於低位，分別為0.04%及0.27%（圖11）。\n\n圖 10 銀行體系的資產質素\n\n圖 11 住宅按揭貸款及信用卡貸款的拖欠比率\n\n# 盈利走勢\n\n低息環境加上資產質素略為下降，令銀行體系盈利受壓。零售銀行的整體除稅前經營溢利在2020年下降29.4%（圖12），主要是淨利息收入減少（-21.9%）及貸款減值撥備增加（+61.3%）所致。淨息差由2019年的1.63% 收窄至 2020 年的 1.18%（圖 13）。\n\n由於收入減少，零售銀行的成本與收入比率由2019年的39.5%，上升至2020年的46.8%（圖 14）。\n\n圖 12 零售銀行的表現\n\n圖 13 零售銀行淨息差\n\n圖 14 零售銀行成本與收入比率", "en": "#Economic and financial environment\n\nThe economy contracted for the second year in a row in 2020 and recorded the worst contraction in a year. Consumption and tourism-related industries were particularly hard hit, and contracted more than the overall economy. At the same time, the labor market deteriorated rapidly, and inflation eased. The government and the Ministry of Finance introduced the largest-ever austerity measures to support the economy in response to the severe economic environment. The coronavirus vaccine is expected to restore economic activity and growth is expected to resume in 2021, however, the strength and pace of the economic recovery is still affected by the development of the epidemic and uncertain factors such as the supply, coverage and effectiveness of the vaccine.\n\n# Economic reflection\n\n# Physical economic activity\n\n\"they are responsible for the rapid decline in local demand\", she said. \"they are responsible for the rapid decline in local consumption caused by the outbreak of the epidemic and the corresponding social distancing measures\". she said. \"therefore, the overall investment expenditure is significantly reduced\". she said. \"therefore, the number of new cases of new cases of new cases has increased significantly\". she said. \"therefore, the number of new cases of new cases has increased significantly\". she said. \"therefore, the number of new cases has increased significantly\". she said. \"therefore, the number of new cases has increased significantly\". she said. \"therefore, the number of new cases has increased significantly\". she said. \"therefore, the number of new cases has increased significantly\". she said. \"therefore, the number of new cases has increased significantly\". she said. \"therefore, the number of new cases has increased significantly\". she said. \"therefore, the number of new cases has increased significantly\". she said. \"therefore, the number of new cases has increased significantly increased\". \"therefore, the number of new cases has increased significantly increased\". \"therefore, the number of new cases has increased significantly increased\". \"there are now has increased\". \"there have been found: there is now become significant\". \"there are now there is a number of new cases of new cases of new cases have been found\". \"there have been found\". \"there have been many cases of new cases of new cases of new cases of new cases of new cases of new cases of new cases have been found\". \"there have been found\". \"there have been found\". \"there have been many cases\" have been many cases of new cases\" have been found\". \"there have been many cases of new cases of new cases\" have been found\". \"there have been found\". \"there have been many cases\" have been many cases\" have been found\" have been found\" have been found\" have been found\" have been found\" have been \"many cases of \"many cases of \"many\" have been\" have been\" have been found\" have been\" have been found\" have been\" there. \"many cases of \"many\" there\" there have been\"\n\nTable 1 Growth of real gross domestic product by item of expenditure (over the previous period)\n\n#Economic and financial environment\n\nFigure 1 Component of the contribution to the growth of real GDP\n\nIn response to the pandemic, the government has rapidly introduced the largest austerity measures in history through the 2020-21 budget bill, and has issued four rounds of grants totaling over HK$300 billion from the Epidemic Prevention and Control Fund. These measures include the issuance of over HK$10,000 in cash to eligible residents through the Employment Security Scheme, wage subsidies, and a grant to start-up businesses that are affected by the pandemic. The Finance Ministry has taken a well-organized approach to supporting the banking industry to support the physical economy.\n\n# The Gathering\n\nInflationary pressures eased markedly in 2020. Excluding the effects of the government's one-off austerity measures, the basic inflation rate slowed to 1.3%, the smallest increase since the 2009 global financial crisis. Price pressures for basic foods (especially fresh pork) decreased markedly; and prices for outdoor meals, other than home cooking, decreased in the second half of the year due to substantial discounts offered by the food and beverage industry. Growth in consumer price index rental projects also softened following the return of private residential rentals signed earlier.\n\nFigure 2 Inflation in basic consumer goods\n\n# The labour market\n\nThe labor market deteriorated rapidly in 2020. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose from 3.3% in the year to 6.6%, a 16-year high (Figure 3), with unemployment in retail, lodging and catering industries affected by the epidemic reaching over 10% . The unemployment rate also rose to 3.8% in August, a high after the SARS epidemic. The participation of the labor force decreased slightly due to a cyclical reaction caused by the rapid deterioration of economic conditions.\n\nFigure 3 Situation in the labour market\n\n# The stock market\n\nThe H&M index fell to a three-year low in the first quarter following the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. After the introduction of large-scale support measures by central banks and governments, the stock market recovered slightly in the second and third quarters (Figure 4). The stock market regained some upward momentum near the end of the year due to the breakthrough in the development of the coronavirus vaccine.\n\nFigure 4 Asset prices\n\n# The property market\n\nPartly supported by ultra-low interest rates, the residential property market was broadly flat in 2020 (Figure 4). Overall, house prices and turnover were unchanged from the previous year. However, due to declining household housing interest, affordability was more skewed. On the other hand, the non-residential property market continued to weaken, with property prices falling to varying degrees and turnover also declining.\n\n# Economic Prospects\n\n# The economic environment\n\nThe coronavirus vaccination is expected to restore economic activity and the economy is expected to recover in 2021 (year-round), however, the strength and pace of the economic recovery is still affected by the development of the epidemic and the availability, coverage and effectiveness of vaccines. In particular, the widespread demand for vaccines, so the local economy still faces a considerable challenge in early 2021. On the other hand, the local economy is expected to grow stronger and support Hong Kong's exports of goods and services, but the pace of recovery of other major economies will depend on the effectiveness of its mass vaccination program. The government forecasts a real GDP growth rate of between 3.5 and 5.5% in 2021, in line with the latest growth forecast of Hong Kong analysts from international organizations and private sector organizations.\n\n#Community and the labour market\n\nWith the global and local economic conditions remaining challenging, inflationary pressures are expected to remain subdued in 2021. In addition, the spillover effects of the early contractual rental decline in private residential rentals will continue to dampen local inflation. Market consensus forecasts an overall inflation rate of 1.5% in 2021, while the government expects an overall and basic inflation rate of 1.6% and 1%, respectively.\n\n# Banking system performance\n\nThe banking system in Hong Kong remained stable in 2020, with good financial conditions for banks. Despite the challenges of the coronavirus pandemic, the bank's asset-liability ratio continued to expand and deposits increased. The capital and liquidity situation of the banking system remained ample, with slight fluctuations in asset quality, but remained stable.\n\n# The asset and liability index is moving\n\nIn the first quarter of 2020, the banking system's asset-liability ratio expanded by 5.7%. Due to the economic downturn, the annual loan growth slowed to 1.2%, compared to the increase of 6.7% in 2019; of which the loans used in Hong Kong increased by 2.2%, the loans used outside Hong Kong increased by 0.1%, and trade loans decreased by 6.2% 2020. The related loans in China fell by 0.2%, compared to 7.4% in 2019.\n\nThe return on equity of the bank's income statement increased by 5.4% in 2020 compared to a 2.9% increase in 2019. The overall loan-to-deposit ratio decreased from 75.3% at the end of 2019 to 72.3% at the end of 2020 (Figure 5) as total deposits grew faster than total loans.\n\nFigure 5 Loans and deposits in the banking system\n\n# Capital is sufficient\n\nThe capital position of the banking system remained stable in 2020, providing a strong buffer against potential shocks. The combined total capital ratio of locally registered accredited institutions remained stable at 20.7% at the end of 2020, compared to the end of 2019. The tier 1 capital ratio increased slightly to 18.7% over the same period (Figure 6)\n\nThe Basel III inflation rate remained stable at 8.2% at the end of 2020, well above the 3% legal minimum (Figure 7).\n\nFigure 6 Capital ratio of locally registered accredited institutions\n\nFigure 7 Cement ratio of locally registered certified organizations\n\n# Mobility\n\nThe liquidity situation of the banking system is stable and able to withstand liquidity shocks when pressured. The quarterly average liquidity coverage ratio of Category 1 institutions in Q4 was 155.1%, well above the statutory minimum requirement of 100%. The quarterly average liquidity retention ratio of Category 2 institutions was 57.9%, well above the statutory minimum requirement of 25% (Figure 8).\n\nFigure 8 Liquidity ratios of designated accredited institutions\n\nThe financial resources of the banking system remained stable. At the end of 2020, the stable capital ratio of Category 1 institutions was 138.6%, well above the statutory minimum requirement of 100%. The core capital ratio of Category 2A institutions was 139.5%, well above the statutory minimum requirement of 75% (Figure 9).\n\nFigure 9 Capital ratios of designated accredited institutions\n\n# Quality of assets\n\nThe asset quality of the banking system decreased slightly during the year, but remained good by historical and international standards. The specific classification loan ratio increased from 0.57% at the end of 2019 to 0.90% at the end of 2020, and the rate of overdue and restructured loans increased from 0.34% to 0.57% during the same period (Figure 10). The specific classification loan ratio of related loans in China increased from 0.75% at the end of 2019 to 0.96% at the end of 2020 (Figure 11). The default rate of residential mortgage loans and credit card loans remained low at 0.04% and 0.27% respectively.\n\nFigure 10 Quality of assets in the banking system\n\nFigure 11 Debt to credit ratio for residential mortgages\n\n# The earnings trend\n\nThe low yield environment coupled with a slight decline in asset quality put pressure on the profitability of the banking system. The overall operating profit before tax of retail banks decreased by 29.4% in 2020 (Figure 12), mainly due to a decrease in net interest income (-21.9%) and an increase in loan impairment reserves (+61.3%). The net interest margin narrowed from 1.63% in 2019 to 1.18% in 2020 (Figure 13).\n\nThe cost-to-income ratio of retail banks increased to 46.8% in 2020 from 39.5% in 2019 due to decreased revenues (Figure 14).\n\nFigure 12 Performance of retail banks\n\nFigure 13 Net interest differential of retail banks\n\nFigure 14 Cost to revenue ratio of retail banking"}
{"zh": "# 貨幣穩定\n\n儘管新冠病毒疫情增加不確定因素，港元外匯及貨幣市場運作暢順有序。受到大量股票相關的資金流入所支持，港元匯率於2020 年內大部分時間偏強，而強方兌換保證多次被觸發。聯繫匯率制度是香港金融體系的基石，充分展現強大的抵禦衝擊的能力。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的主要目標是維持貨幣穩定，即確保港元匯價穩定，使港元在外匯市場兌美元的匯率保持在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的區間內。該貨幣體制主要採用貨幣發行局制度，規定由外匯基金所持的美元儲備向貨幣基礎提供最少百分之百的支持；貨幣基礎若有變動，美元儲備亦必須作出相應增減，與貨幣基礎的變動百分之百配合。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n- 負債證明書（為3間發鈔銀行發行的銀行紙幣提供十足支持）\n- 政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣\n- 設於金管局的結算戶口結餘總額（即總結餘）\n- 金管局代表政府發行的外匯基金票據及債券。\n\n表 1 貨幣基礎\n\n金管局透過自動利率調節機制及履行兌換保證的堅決承諾來維持港元匯率的穩定。當強方（或弱方）兌換保證被觸發，金管局會應銀行要求，按每美元兌7.75港元向銀行沽出港元、買入美元（或按7.85港元買入港元、沽出美元），使總結餘增加（或減少），令港元利率下跌（或上升），從而促使港元匯率回復到7.75至7.85 的兌換範圍。\n\n# 2020年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n隨着3月全球爆發新冠病毒疫情，避險情緒下環球投資者增持美元，令美元資金狀況明顯收緊。在聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）下，由於港元利率受同期美元利率影響，美元流動性緊張令香港貨幣狀況收緊。儘管其後美國聯邦儲備局實施流動資金計劃，美元資金壓力有所紓緩，但由於股票相關需求及季結效應，令香港貨幣狀況仍維持偏緊。而港元需求殷切，加上港元與美元的正息差刺激套息交易活動，促使港元匯率偏向強方兌換保證匯率（圖1），強方兌換保證最終於4月被觸發。其後新股集資活動暢旺，以及「滬港通」與「深港通」下的南向資金帶動股票相關資金流入，令港元一直維持接近7.75水平，並導致強方兌換保證在2020年內多次被觸發。強方兌換保證在4月21日至10月28日期間合共被觸發85次，累計資金流入3,835億港元。整體而言，港元外匯市場在2020年全年運作正常。\n\n圖 1 2020年市場匯率\n\n總結餘（進行貼現窗活動前）與未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額由2019年底的11,330億港元，增加至2020年底的15,266億港元（圖2）。隨着強方兌換保證被觸發，金管局應銀行要求合共沽出3,835億港元。新冠病毒疫情引致環球宏觀環境波動，金管局為了提供額外港元流動性，亦於4月底及5月初逐步減發總計200億港元外匯基金票據。由於強方兌換保證被觸發及外匯基金票據發行量減少，總結餘（進行貼現窗活動前）由2019年底的543億港元，增加至2020年底的4,575億港元。年內未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額由10,787億港元，稍降至10,692億港元，反映外匯基金票據發行量減少，這抵銷了按一貫做法以新發行的外匯基金票據及債券來吸納未償還外匯基金票據及債券的利息。整體貨幣基礎仍然由外匯儲備提供十足支持。\n\n圖 2 2020年總結餘（進行貼現窗活動前）及未償還外匯基金票據及債券\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n隨着農曆新年假期後流動性需求減退，香港銀行同業拆息在2月普遍下降（圖3）。踏入3月，由於美元資金壓力，連同新股集資相關及季結資金需求等本地因素，香港銀行同業拆息一度上升。其後由於強方兌換保證被觸發及外匯基金票據發行量減少，令總結餘增加，港元流動性狀況逐步紓緩。\n\n因應美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍於3月兩度下調，以及反映年內隔夜與1個月香港銀行同業拆息變動，基本利率由年初的2.73厘下降至年底收報0.50厘。在零售層面，儘管美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍調低，銀行仍維持最優惠貸款利率不變。整體而言，香港貨幣市場繼續正常運作。貼現窗借貸由2019年的383億港元降至2020年的91億港元。\n\n圖 3 2020 年香港銀行同業拆息\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n過去30多年來，聯匯制度一直是香港金融體系的重要支柱，歷經考驗均能展現強大的抵禦衝擊的能力。儘管2020年面對挑戰，港元外匯及貨幣市場保持正常運作，一再證明聯匯制度穩健有效。年內面對一些毫無根據的謠言，質疑聯匯制度以至香港的金融穩定，金管局迅速向公眾重申香港會繼續實施聯匯制度，同時資金自由流動及港幣自由兌換受到《基本法》第112條保障。金管局另又發表多篇文章，闡明逆境下香港金融體系繼續展現強大抵禦衝擊能力的事實。政府亦堅決維持聯匯制度。香港的金融市場有序運作，以及港元繼續如常作為支付及保值貨幣，反映上述措施有效維持公眾對聯匯制度的信心。國際貨幣基金組織在《2020年對外部門報告》重申香港擁有具透明度的規則、充裕的財政及外匯儲備、穩健的金融規管與監管、靈活的經濟，以及審慎的財政架構，確保聯匯制度具公信力。\n\n穩健的銀行體系對聯匯制度的正常運作具關鍵作用。儘管新冠病毒疫情構成負面影響，香港銀行體系繼續運作暢順，流動性及資本水平以國際標準而言均非常充裕。為確保銀行體系具備承受衝擊的能力，金管局一直密切監察銀行的信用、流動性及利率風險管理，以及壓力測試結果，並維持對銀行貸款的監管。與此同時，金管局亦為銀行體系提供更多流動性，維持貨幣及金融穩定。除減發外匯基金票據以增加港元流動性外，金管局為銀行設立一系列流動資金安排。此外，金管局與銀行保持聯繫，確保它們在緊張情況時利用這些流動資金安排。因應新冠病毒疫情為環球金融市場帶來波動及不確定因素，金管局推出臨時性美元流動資金安排，為持牌銀行提供美元流動性支援，有助紓緩環球美元銀行拆借市場流動性緊絀的情況。\n\n為提高貨幣發行局帳目的透明度，自1998年10月起，外匯基金已有部分資產被指定用作支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（即支持資產相對貨幣基礎的比率）於2020年在109.8至112.1%之間上落，並無觸及上限或下限。該比率於12月31日收報109.9%（圖4）。在聯匯制度下，雖然已指定某些外匯基金資產作為支持組合，但外匯基金的全部資產均可用作支持港元匯率。外匯基金的龐大財政資源，加上香港穩健的銀行體系，為保障香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供強而有力的後盾。\n\n圖 4 2020年支持比率每日變動\n\n# 其他事務\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的貨幣發行委員會負責監察及探討與香港貨幣及金融穩定有關的課題。在2020年，貨幣發行委員會探討的課題包括香港經濟的情景分析、香港物業市場的評估、了解跨境資金流的概念架構，以及了解香港銀行同業市場。貨幣發行委員會會議紀錄及金管局向其呈交的貨幣發行局制度運作報告，均載於金管局網站。\n\n# 貨幣研究\n\n疫情持續下，香港貨幣及金融研究中心（研究中心）在2020年仍能維持一定數量的研究成果。在2020年，研究中心合共發表20篇研究論文，涵蓋貨幣政策、銀行體系穩定、市場微觀結構和金融科技發展等廣泛議題，部份論文已獲接納或正被評審在專業期刊中刊登。在疫情下由於要實施社交距離及旅遊限制，研究中心舉辦的研討會、講座及到訪研究計劃等主要活動需要押後，待日後公共衛生和旅遊條件回復正常後，研究中心將會復辦上述活動。\n\n# 紙幣及硬幣\n\n截至2020年底，流通銀行紙幣（指發鈔銀行發行的紙幣）總值5,595億港元，較上年增加8.3%（圖5、6及7）。政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣總值127億港元，較上年減少0.6%（圖8及9）。在政府發行的紙幣及硬幣中，10港元流通紙幣總值46億港元，其中塑質鈔票佔79%。\n\n圖 5 2020年底按發鈔銀行分析的銀行紙幣流通金額\n\n圖 6 2020年底流通銀行紙幣分布情況\n\n圖 7 2020 年底銀行紙幣流通金額\n\n圖 8 2020年底政府發行紙幣及硬幣流通金額\n\n圖 9 2020年底政府發行流通紙幣及硬幣分析\n\n# 香港鈔票\n\n繼於2020年1月推出20港元及50港元面額新鈔，2018年新鈔系列所有5款面額鈔票已在市面流通。該系列鈔票具備更強固及應用方便的防偽特徵，廣受市民歡迎，並逐漸取代舊版鈔票。\n\n年內金管局繼續舉辦講座，介紹香港鈔票的設計及防偽特徵。金管局舉辦8場講座(包括網上形式)，增進公眾對香港鈔票的認識，吸引2,000多名人士參加，包括銀行櫃位職員、商戶及學生等。\n\n# 硬幣收集計劃\n\n硬幣收集計劃於2014年10月推出，年內繼續廣受大眾歡迎。這是全球首個有系統的流動硬幣收集計劃，設有兩部收銀車輪流停駐全港18區。每部收銀車均裝設兩部高速硬幣點算機，市民可選擇將硬幣轉換成鈔票或用作八達通卡或電子錢包等儲值支付工具增值，亦可將款項放入車內的公益金捐款箱。此外，金管局與香港社會服務聯會合作，在非政府組織賣旗日派出收銀車收集硬幣。收銀車亦到訪學校，增進學生對硬幣收集計劃的認識。過去多年硬幣收集計劃曾獲頒多個本港及國際獎項，對其創新及環保的處理方法予以肯定。", "en": "# Currency is stable\n\nDespite the increased uncertainty of the coronavirus outbreak, the HKD and the money market have been operating smoothly. Backed by a large influx of equity-related funds, the HKD exchange rate was strong for most of 2020, while the strong exchange rate guarantee was triggered several times. The linkage rate system is a cornerstone of the Hong Kong financial system, fully demonstrating its ability to provide a strong buffer shock.\n\n# Goals\n\nThe main objective of Hong Kong's monetary policy is to maintain monetary stability, i.e. to ensure that the HKD is stable against the US dollar in the foreign exchange market, so that the HKD's exchange rate against the US dollar remains within the range of 7.75 to 7.85 HKD to US$1. The monetary system mainly adopts the money issuing bureau system, which provides for a minimum of 100 percent support to the currency base by the dollar reserves held by the foreign exchange fund; if the currency base changes, the dollar reserves must be increased and decreased in proportion to the percentage change in the currency base.\n\nThe monetary base (Table 1) consists of: - certificates of debt (providing adequate support for the banknotes issued by the three issuing banks) - circulating banknotes and coins issued by the government - balances on the settlement account of the Gold Board (i.e. total balances) - foreign exchange fund notes and bonds issued by the Gold Board on behalf of the government.\n\nTable 1 Monetary base\n\nThe Board maintains the HKD exchange rate stable through an automatic rate adjustment mechanism and a firm commitment to fulfill the exchange rate guarantee. When the strong (or weak) exchange rate guarantee is triggered, the Board will respond to the bank's request by remitting HKD 7.75 per dollar to the bank to buy HKD out of the bank, into the dollar, or to buy HKD into the bank, and out of the dollar, at HKD 7.85, increasing or decreasing the total balance, lowering HKD interest rates, or raising them, thereby restoring the HKD exchange rate to the range of HKD 7.75 to 7.85.\n\n# Looking back on 2020\n\n# The rate of inflation is stable\n\nThe global coronavirus outbreak has led to a sharp decline in the dollar's holdings. Under the linkage system, the dollar's liquidity stress has led to a decline in the dollar's holdings. Although the US Federal Reserve implemented a cash flow plan, the dollar's liquidity pressure has continued to be negative due to stock-related demands and seasonal effects. The dollar's demand has increased, coupled with interest rate differentials, which have led to the dollar's volatility.\n\nFigure 1 Market rate of inflation in 2020\n\nThe total amount of outstanding notes and bonds of the Overseas Exchange Fund (OEF) increased from HK$11.33 billion at the end of 2019 to HK$15.266 billion at the end of 2020 (Figure 2). As the strong currency swap guarantee was triggered, the FCA required banks to issue a total of HK$385.5 billion. The global macro-environmental fluctuations caused by the coronavirus epidemic led the FCA to provide liquidity in the overseas exchange currency, and the initial issuance of HK$20 billion of OEF notes was gradually reduced in late April and May. The total amount of outstanding notes and bonds of the OEF was affected by the strong currency swap guarantee and the issuance of the overseas exchange currency was reduced, and the total amount of outstanding notes and bonds of the OEF decreased from HK$543 billion at the end of 2019 to HK$457.5 billion at the end of 2020. The total amount of outstanding notes and bonds of the OEF was reduced from HK$10.7 billion to HK$10.78 billion, and the profits of the OEF were slightly reduced to HK$10.69 billion. The new OEF is the foundation of the OEF, and the fund, and the fund, and the fund, and the fund, and the fund, and the fund, and the fund, and the fund, and the fund, and the fund, and the fund, and the fund, the fund, the fund, the fund, the fund, the fund, the fund, the fund, the fund, the fund, the fund, the fund, the fund, the fund, the fund, the fund, the fund, the fund, the fund, the fund, the fund, the fund, the fund, the fund, the fund, the fund, the fund, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the\n\nFigure 2 Balance for 2020 (before the window activity) and unpaid shell fund notes and bonds\n\n# The money market\n\nAs liquidity demand decreased after the Lunar New Year holiday, the Hong Kong interbank rate fell in February generally (Figure 3). In March, the interbank rate rose due to local factors such as dollar funding pressure, new equity capital-related and quarter-end funding needs.\n\nThe base rate fell from 2.73 cents at the beginning of the year to 0.50 cents at the end of the year, reflecting the two-digit decline in the US Federal Reserve target range in March and the overnight and one-month changes in the interest rate of Hong Kong banks. At the retail level, banks maintained the most favorable lending rate despite the decline in the US Federal Reserve target range. Overall, Hong Kong's money market continued to operate normally.\n\nFigure 3 Bank of Hong Kong and its subsidiaries in 2020\n\n#Contact rate system\n\nFor more than 30 years, the Hong Kong Fed has been a key pillar of Hong Kong's financial system, and its ability to withstand strong shocks has been proven. Despite the challenges, Hong Kong's foreign exchange and money market remained operational in 2020, repeatedly proving the stability and effectiveness of the Fed. In the face of some unfounded rumors questioning the Fed's financial stability, the Monetary Authority quickly reiterated to the public that Hong Kong will continue to implement the Fed, while the free flow of funds and the free exchange of Hong Kong currency is protected by Article 112 of the Basic Law. The Ministry of Finance also published several articles, highlighting the fact that Hong Kong's financial system continues to show strong resistance to shocks.\n\nA stable banking system is critical to the smooth functioning of the system. Despite the negative impact of the coronavirus pandemic, the banking system in Hong Kong continues to operate smoothly, and liquidity and capital levels are very high by international standards. To ensure that the banking system is able to withstand shocks, the CMA has been closely monitoring the banks' credit, liquidity and interest rate risk management, as well as the results of stress tests, and maintaining supervision of bank loans. At the same time, the CMA also provides more liquidity to the banking system, maintaining monetary and financial stability.\n\nIn order to improve transparency of the purpose of the Money Issuing Agency's books, since October 1998, some of the assets of the shell fund have been designated as supporting the currency base. The support ratio (i.e. the ratio of support assets to the currency base) rose between 109.8 and 112.1% in 2020, without touching the upper or lower limit. The ratio was reported at 109.9% on December 31 (Figure 4). Under the federal system, although some shell fund assets have been designated as supporting the unit, all of the assets of the shell fund can be used to support the HKD. The huge financial resources of the shell fund, coupled with the sound banking system in Hong Kong, provide a strong backing for the monetary and financial stability of Hong Kong.\n\nFigure 4 Daily changes in the support ratio in 2020\n\n# Other affairs\n\nThe Monetary Issuing Committee, under the Overseas Fund Advisory Board, is responsible for monitoring and addressing issues related to the currency and financial stability of Hong Kong. In 2020, the issues addressed by the Monetary Issuing Committee include the scenario analysis of the Hong Kong economy, the assessment of the Hong Kong property market, understanding the conceptual architecture of cross-border capital flows, and understanding the Hong Kong banking peer market. The minutes of the Monetary Issuing Committee and the report of the monetary issuing system presented to the Gold Authority are available on the Gold Authority website.\n\n# Currency research\n\nThe Hong Kong Centre for Monetary and Financial Research (HCMFRC) maintained a certain number of research outputs in 2020 during the pandemic. In 2020, the Centre published 20 research papers covering a wide range of topics such as monetary policy, banking system stability, market microstructures and financial technology development, some of which have been accepted or are being reviewed for publication in professional journals. The main activities of the Centre will resume after the public health and tourism conditions are restored, due to the need to implement social distancing and travel restrictions during the pandemic.\n\n# Banknotes and coins\n\nAs of the end of 2020, the total value of banknotes in circulation (i.e. banknotes issued by the central bank) was HK$559.5 billion, an increase of 8.3% (Figures 5, 6 and 7) over the previous year. HK$12.7 billion in banknotes and coins in circulation issued by the government was HK$12.7 billion, a decrease of 0.6% (Figure 89) over the previous year. HK$4.6 billion in banknotes and coins issued by the government was HK$10 billion, of which HK$79 billion was plastic banknotes.\n\nFigure 5 Amount of banknotes in circulation at the end of 2020 as analyzed by the Bank of Distribution\n\nFigure 6 Distribution of banknotes in circulation at the end of 2020\n\nFigure 7 Banknotes in circulation at the end of 2020\n\nFigure 8 Government notes and coins in circulation at the end of 2020\n\nFigure 9 Analysis of government issuance of circulating banknotes and coins at the end of 2020\n\n# Hong Kong currency\n\nFollowing the introduction of the HK$20 and HK$50 denominations in January 2020, all five denominations of the 2018 series are in circulation. The series of notes has more robust and easy-to-use anti-counterfeiting features, is popular among the public, and gradually replaces the old version of the note.\n\nThe HKSAR continued to hold lectures throughout the year on the design and anti-counterfeiting features of Hong Kong banknotes. The HKSAR held eight lectures (including online) to raise public awareness of Hong Kong banknotes, attracting more than 2,000 people, including bank counter staff, merchants and students.\n\n# Coin collection project\n\nThe coin collection program was launched in October 2014 and continued to gain popularity throughout the year. It is the first systematic mobile coin collection program in the world, with two cash wheel streams stationed in all 18 districts of the port. Each cash wheel is equipped with two high-speed coin counter, citizens can choose to convert coins into banknotes or use them as a value-added payment instrument such as an eight-dollar card or e-wallet, and can also deposit funds into the public benefit donation box in the vehicle."}
{"zh": "# 銀行體系穩定\n\n儘管新冠病毒疫情爆發為經濟帶來重大挑戰，香港銀行體系於2020年維持穩健。年內金管局除密切留意疫情對銀行營運及監管活動的影響並靈活應變外，繼續將監管重點放在認可機構的信用及流動性風險管理上。鑑於網絡威脅持續增加及銀行業使用金融科技的上升趨勢，金管局加強對認可機構科技風險管理及運作穩健性的監管。金管局亦與銀行及國際組織緊密合作，促進業界過渡至備用參考利率。\n\n在操守監管方面，金管局給予認可機構在遵守監管規定上彈性處理的空間以及提供指引，以便一方面協助銀行在疫情下的業務運作及繼續為客戶提供服務，另一方面則繼續確保投資者及消費者得到保障。金管局聯同有關當局制定「跨境理財通」業務試點的建議實施細則，並諮詢業界。金管局與證券及期貨事務監察委員會合作，就精簡有關家族辦公室及擁有高資產淨值並精於財務事宜的投資者的銷售程序提供指引。此外，金管局加強對數碼金融服務消費者的保障，並繼續推動以客為本的企業文化。\n\n在打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集方面，金管局迅速採取行動，不但釐清風險為本方法及科技如何協助認可機構更有效應對與新冠病毒疫情相關的情況，並同時審慎應對持續升溫的地緣政治緊張局勢對銀行體系造成的影響。金管局繼續支持有關提升打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集工作的成效與效率的措施，包括增加參與公私營夥伴共享訊息的認可機構數目，以及支持銀行業採用合規科技。金管局又順應科技及數據運用的國際發展趨勢，展開進一步加強打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集監察能力的計劃。\n\n與此同時，金管局與銀行業緊密合作，優化監管政策與程序，以及推行提升人才專業能力的措施。香港在實施國際監管標準方面取得理想進展，包括資本充足標準和披露標準。在促進綠色及可持續銀行業的發展方面，金管局已進入三個階段中的第二階段，正制定相關監管規定。金管局亦繼續致力確保香港備有具公信力的認可機構處置機制，包括制定新處置標準及實施吸收虧損能力規定的規則，以提升認可機構的處置可行性。\n\n# 目標\n\n金管局的整體目標之一是促進銀行體系的安全及穩定。要達致這個目標，實有賴建立及維持具高度應對能力且能為香港經濟提供所需關鍵金融服務的金融體系。\n\n銀行可能因營運方式，甚或在極端情況下因失序地倒閉而影響銀行體系的穩定。作為監管當局，金融管理專員在保障金融穩定方面擔當重要角色，確保銀行有能力抵禦衝擊、應對危機及自危機中恢復常態，以最終有助防止出現倒閉。金融管理專員負責對銀行進行審慎監管，以及認可香港的持牌銀行、有限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司（統稱「認可機構」）。金融管理專員亦負責某些金融市場基建的指定及監管。\n\n然而，金融管理專員不能確保金融體系全無風險，香港的審慎監管制度亦並非為確保「零風險」而設。作為其中一個處置機制當局，金融管理專員力求確保一旦有認可機構不再可持續經營，能有秩序地處理其倒閉。為此，香港已設立金融機構處置機制，金融管理專員在該機制下為認可機構（以及其他類型機構）的處置機制當局。為落實香港的處置機制，必須制定處置規則及政策標準、進行處置規劃以排除認可機構處置可行性的障礙，以及建立金管局處置瀕臨倒閉認可機構的運作能力。為有效執行上述工作，金管局採納與國際一致及協調的方法。\n\n# 2020年回顧\n\n# 監管工作概覽\n\n金管局在2020年共進行186次非現場審查，涵蓋範圍甚廣，包括認可機構的CAMEL評估、企業管治、風險管理及金融科技策略。為繼續加強認可機構的風險管治水平，金管局與認可機構董事局、獨立非執行董事或董事局轄下委員會共舉行30次會議，並與認可機構及其外聘核數師共舉行30次三方聯席會議。\n\n除了非現場審查工作外，金管局亦進行定期現場審查，並以專題評估作為配合，以審視被評估屬較高風險的範疇。金管局於年內共進行610次現場審查及專題評估，並繼續以信用風險管理作為審查及評估的主要重點之一。另一個重點是在新冠病毒疫情下的業務操作風險及科技風險管理。此外，金管局又增加針對流動性及市場風險管理的現場審查及專題評估次數。同時，專項審查小組亦對認可機構的證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（強積金）相關業務進行現場審查及專題評估。\n\n儘管面對疫情，金管局維持監管力度，並作出彈性安排，靈活有效地履行監管職責，包括在提交申報表及進行現場審查方面給予彈性處理的空間；加強數據收集以補足現場審查，以及利用網上會議平台。\n\n表1載有金管局於2020年的監管工作概要。\n\n表 1 監管工作概要\n\n# 信用風險的監管\n\n# 信貸增長及資產質素\n\n2020年貸款總額增加1.2%，2019年的增幅為6.7%。表2列載各類貸款及墊款的增長情況。\n\n表 2 貸款及墊款的增長\n\n於2020年，內地相關貸款總額略為減少0.2%至45,530億港元（表3）。\n\n表 3 內地相關貸款增長\n\n受到新冠病毒疫情影響，認可機構的資產質素略為轉差。年內銀行業的特定分類貸款比率由0.57%上升至0.90%，仍維持在穩健水平，遠低於2000年以來的長期平均水平1.8%。內地相關貸款方面，相關比率亦由一年前的0.75%上升至0.96%。\n\n鑑於與新冠病毒疫情相關的不明朗因素為經濟帶來重大挑戰，金管局深入檢視認可機構資產質素，以評估資產質素轉差的趨勢。尤其金管局透過收集有關銀行在行業及借款人層面的信用風險承擔數據，加強對大額借款人及在目前的經濟環境下較易受影響行業的監察。金管局進行的特別壓力測試分析顯示，銀行有能力抵禦新冠病毒疫情帶來的經濟壓力。\n\n年內金管局進行專題評估，檢視認可機構對內地相關貸款、同業貸款，以及對私人銀行及財富管理客戶的有抵押貸款等不同範疇的信用風險管理方法。\n\n# 紓緩客戶資金周轉壓力的措施\n\n因應新冠病毒疫情爆發，金管局於2019年10月成立的銀行業中小企貸款協調機制（協調機制）推出多輪協助企業及個人客戶的紓緩措施，鼓勵銀行在審慎風險管理原則容許下繼續支持借款人的融資需要。其中最主要的是協調機制於5月推出的「預先批核還息不還本」計劃。計劃下合資格的企業客戶的所有貸款本金還款可延期6個月。該計劃在11月延長6個月後，在2021年3月再度延長6個月至10月底。該計劃約有100間銀行參與，覆蓋12萬合資格企業客戶。截至12月底，銀行共批出58,000多宗企業客戶貸款展期及其他支援措施的個案，涉及金額超過7,400億港元。個人客戶方面，銀行亦推出住宅按揭「還息不還本」計劃，「居者有其屋計劃」下資助房屋的相關按揭亦涵蓋在內。此外，銀行亦提供應急貸款予從事受疫情嚴重打擊行業的客戶、延長個人貸款期限，以及下調各種個人信貸的收費。截至12月底，銀行共批出28,000多宗住宅按揭「還息不還本」及其他個人應急貸款的個案，涉及金額超過440億港元。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n金管局自2009年起先後推出多輪逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施，已經加強銀行的風險管理及香港銀行體系應對本港樓市一旦突然逆轉的抵禦能力。新批出住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數於2020年12月為57%，而有關按揭成數於2009年9月推出首輪逆周期措施前為64%。2020年新批出住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數有所上升，主要由於當中涉及按揭保險的貸款的佔比有所增加，而這類貸款的按揭成數一般較高。新批出按揭的平均供款與入息比率亦維持在低水平，於12月為37%，而在2010年8月首度推出有關比率上限時為41%（圖1）。\n\n考慮到非住宅物業的價格走勢與交投量、經濟基調及外圍環境等因素，金管局在8月放寬非住宅物業按揭貸款的逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施，將這類貸款的適用按揭成數上限上調10個百分點，一般個案的上限由四成上調至五成。\n\n圖 1 新批出住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數及供款與入息比率\n\n# 業務操作及科技風險的監管\n\n因應2020年初爆發新冠病毒疫情，金管局採取連串措施減低疫情對銀行業務運作的影響。有關措施包括要求認可機構檢討其持續業務運作計劃，並採取適當的預防措施，以保障員工與客戶的健康，以及維持重要銀行服務。此外，金管局提醒認可機構加強與員工及客戶的溝通，就其處所可能出現確診個案的情況作好準備，以及制定應對較為嚴峻但可能發生的風險情境的持續業務運作計劃。金管局與業界保持緊密聯繫，又要求認可機構保持警覺，並因應疫情的最新發展及政府的社交距離措施，不時審視其持續業務運作計劃。\n\n金管局完成對「網絡防衛計劃」的全面檢討及廣泛的業界諮詢後，於11月推出「網絡防衛計劃2.0」，因應海外網絡風險管理的最新做法，進一步提升「網絡防衛計劃」。當中「網絡防衛評估框架」加入了有關網絡事故應對及恢復的最新國際穩健做法。「網絡防衛計劃」下的「專業培訓計劃」方面，資歷認證清單的範圍有所擴大，納入主要海外地區的同等資歷。金管局又向香港銀行公會（銀行公會）提出多項建議，令「網絡風險資訊共享平台」更易於使用。「網絡防衛計劃2.0」於2021年1月1日生效。\n\n# 智慧銀行\n\n經過在「金融科技監管沙盒」進行嚴謹的測試與試行後，所有在2019年獲發銀行牌照的8間虛擬銀行都已經於年內開業。虛擬銀行運用創新科技，提供全新的客戶體驗，例如利用大數據分析進行中小企貸款的信貸評估，以加快貸款批核程序。為加強客戶參與及建立客戶對品牌的忠誠，部分虛擬銀行更在其定期存款及獎賞計劃等服務中加入遊戲元素。\n\n# 流動性及市場風險的監管\n\n金管局在4月推出一系列措施，確保銀行同業市場及銀行體系在疫情下繼續暢順運作。這些措施包括釐清「金管局流動資金安排」的操作細則及推出臨時美元流動資金安排，並重申在監管架構下認可機構可使用流動性緩衝的彈性。金管局又與認可機構進行演習，確保認可機構已經作好準備，能夠在有需要時運用這些措施。", "en": "# Banking system is stable\n\nDespite the significant challenges posed to the economy by the coronavirus outbreak, Hong Kong's banking system remained stable in 2020. In addition to closely monitoring the impact of the epidemic on banking operations and regulatory activities and adapting flexibly, the CMA continued to focus its oversight on credit and liquidity risk management of accredited institutions. In light of the continuing increase in cyber threats and the rising trend of the use of financial technology in the banking industry, the CMA strengthened its oversight of the risk management and operational stability of accredited institutions. The CMA also worked closely with banks and international organizations to promote the industry's transition to the reserve reference rate.\n\nIn the area of regulatory compliance, the GCM is giving the licensed institutions flexibility to comply with regulatory requirements and providing guidance to help banks operate and continue to serve customers in the pandemic, while continuing to ensure the safety of investors and consumers. The GCM is working with the authorities to develop a \"cross-border smart money\" business pilot, implementing the rules, and advising the industry. The GCM is working with the Securities and Futures Affairs Regulatory Commission to streamline the sales process for family offices and high-net-worth investors with financial savvy.\n\nIn the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing, the FSA has acted quickly to identify risks to how this methodology and technology can help accrediting agencies more effectively respond to the coronavirus outbreak, while also taking into account the impact of ongoing geopolitical tensions on the banking system. The FSA continues to support measures to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing, including increasing the number of accredited agencies that participate in information sharing with private partners and supporting the adoption of joint banking. The FSA has adapted to international developments in the use of technology and data, and further developed plans to strengthen the surveillance capabilities against money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\nIn this context, the Ministry of Finance, in close cooperation with the banking industry, has taken steps to improve regulatory policies and procedures and to enhance the professional competence of its personnel. Hong Kong has made good progress in implementing international regulatory standards, including capital adequacy and disclosure standards. In promoting the development of green and sustainable banking, the Ministry of Finance has entered the second of three phases of the process of developing regulatory regulations.\n\n# Goals\n\nOne of the overall objectives of the MRA is to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this objective relies on the establishment and maintenance of a highly resilient financial system that can provide the critical financial services needed by the Hong Kong economy.\n\nThe stability of the banking system may be affected by the way a bank operates or, in extreme cases, by its disorderly collapse. As a regulatory authority, the Financial Supervisory Authority plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability and ensuring that banks are able to withstand shocks, respond to crises and recover from crises, ultimately helping to prevent collapse. The Financial Supervisory Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks, as well as licensed banks, limited-licensed banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong (the \"Authorized Entities\").\n\nHowever, financial regulators cannot ensure that the financial system is completely risk-free, and the prudential regulation system in Hong Kong is not designed to ensure \"zero risk\". As one of the regulatory authorities, financial regulators seek to ensure that once an authorized institution is no longer viable, its collapse can be handled in an orderly manner. To this end, Hong Kong has established a financial institution resolution mechanism, the Financial Regulators under which the authorized institution (and other types of institutions) is the resolution mechanism authority. To implement the Hong Kong resolution mechanism, it is necessary to develop resolution rules and policy standards, conduct resolution planning to eliminate obstacles to the viability of the authorized institution, and establish the ability to operate the authorized institution that is about to collapse.\n\n# Looking back on 2020\n\n# Overview of the work of the regulator\n\nThe Bank conducted 186 off-site audits in 2020, covering a wide range of issues, including CAMEL assessments, corporate governance, risk management and Fintech strategies of accredited institutions. In order to further strengthen the level of risk governance of accredited institutions, the Bank held 30 meetings with the Board of Directors of accredited institutions, independent non-executive directors or committees under the Board of Directors, and 30 joint tripartite meetings with accredited institutions and their external auditors.\n\nIn addition to the non-site audits, the CRA also conducts regular site audits and special assessments to support the review of the areas assessed as high risk. The CRA conducted a total of 610 site audits and special assessments during the year, and continued to focus on credit risk management as one of the main areas of review and evaluation. Another focus is on the operational risk and technology risk management of the business under the coronavirus epidemic.\n\nDespite the outbreak, the KIM maintained its regulatory capacity and made flexible arrangements to perform its regulatory duties flexibly and effectively, including providing space for flexible processing in filing returns and conducting on-site audits; strengthening data collection to supplement on-site audits; and utilizing online meeting platforms.\n\nTable 1 provides an overview of the regulatory work of the Gold Authority in 2020.\n\nTable 1 Summary of supervisory work\n\n#Credit risk regulation is a big deal\n\n#Credit growth and asset quality\n\nTotal loans increased by 1.2% in 2020 and 6.7% in 2019. Table 2 shows the growth of various types of loans and advances.\n\nTable 2 Growth in loans and advances\n\nIn 2020, the total amount of loans related to the mainland decreased by 0.2% to HK$4553 billion (Table 3).\n\nTable 3 Growth of land-related lending\n\nThe asset quality of the accredited institutions was affected by the coronavirus outbreak. The specific classification loan ratio of the banking industry increased from 0.57% to 0.90% during the year, remaining at a stable level, well below the long-term average of 1.8% since 2000.\n\nIn view of the uncertainties associated with the coronavirus outbreak that pose significant challenges to the economy, the KIMSA is conducting a thorough review of the asset quality of accredited institutions to assess the trend of asset quality divergence. In particular, the KIMSA is strengthening its surveillance of large borrowers and industries that are more vulnerable to the current economic environment by collecting data on the credit risk exposure of banks in the industry and at the level of borrowers. The special stress test analysis conducted by the KIMSA shows that banks are able to withstand the economic pressure brought by the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nDuring the year, the KMA conducted a dedicated assessment to examine the credit risk management approaches of the accredited institutions for different categories of loans, such as domestic loans, peer-to-peer loans, and mortgages for private banks and wealth management clients.\n\n# Measures to ease pressure on customer funds\n\nIn response to the coronavirus outbreak, the Banking Authority of China (BAC) launched a series of relaxed measures to assist enterprises and private customers in the banking industry in October 2019, encouraging banks to continue supporting borrowers' lending needs as permitted by prudent risk management principles. The most important of these is the \"Pre-approved Interest-free Return\" scheme launched by the Bank in May. All loans to eligible enterprises under the program can be repaid for six months. The Bank of China is the founding partner of the Hong Kong Special Economic Zone.\n\n# Mortgage loans for property\n\nThe MRA has introduced multi-cycle macro-prudential oversight since 2009, which has strengthened the risk management of banks and the ability of the Hong Kong banking system to respond to a sudden reversal of the Hong Kong real estate market. The average mortgage rate for new residential mortgage loans was 57% in December 2020, compared to 64% before the introduction of the first round reversal in September 2009. The average mortgage rate for new residential mortgage loans increased in 2020, mainly due to the increase in the share of loans involving mortgage insurance, while the mortgage rate for such loans is generally higher. The average rate of new mortgage loans to supply to the market has also remained low, at 37% in December, compared to 41% in August 2010.\n\nTaking into account factors such as price movements and volumes of non-residential property, the economic background and the external environment, the KIM in August relaxed its reverse-cycling macro-prudential oversight of non-residential mortgage loans, increasing the maximum percentage of mortgages applicable to such loans by 10 percentage points, from 40% to 50% in general cases.\n\nFigure 1 Average mortgage percentage and supply to yield ratio of new residential mortgage loans\n\n#Regulation of business operations and technology risks\n\nIn response to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus in early 2020, the Bank of China (Guoyuan) has taken a series of measures to reduce the impact of the epidemic on the operation of banking operations.The measures include requiring the authorized institution to review its continuous operation plan and take appropriate precautions to ensure the health of employees and customers, and maintain essential banking services.In addition, the Bank of China (Guoyuan) reminds the authorized institution to strengthen communication with employees and customers, be prepared for the possibility of a confirmed case in its location, and develop a continuous operation plan to respond to more severe but possible risk situations.The Bank of China (Guoyuan) maintains close contact with the industry, and requests the authorized institution to remain vigilant, and not to review its continuous operation plan in light of the latest developments in the epidemic and the social distancing measures of the government.\n\nAfter completing a comprehensive review and broad industry consultation of the \"Cyber Defense Plan\", the CBI launched the \"Cyber Defense Plan 2.0\" in November, further improving the \"Cyber Defense Plan\" in response to the latest practices in overseas network risk management. The \"Cyber Defense Assessment Framework\" includes the latest international practices on network incident response and recovery. The \"Professional Training Program\" under the \"Cyber Defense Plan\" has expanded the scope of the list of qualifications to include equivalent qualifications in major overseas regions.\n\n#Wisdom Bank\n\nAfter rigorous testing and piloting in the \"Fintech Regulatory Sandbox\", all eight virtual banks licensed in 2019 have been opened within the year. Virtual banks use innovative technologies to provide a new customer experience, such as using big data analytics to conduct credit evaluations for small and medium-sized businesses to speed up loan approval procedures. In order to strengthen customer engagement and build customer loyalty to the brand, some virtual banks have added game elements to their services such as periodic deposits and reward programs.\n\n# Liquidity and market risk regulation\n\nIn April, the FSA introduced a series of measures to ensure that the banking industry and the banking system continue to function smoothly during the pandemic. These measures include clarifying the operating rules of the FSA's cash flow arrangement and the introduction of a temporary cash flow arrangement in dollars, and reaffirming the flexibility of the liquidity buffers that accredited institutions can use under the regulatory framework. The FSA also conducted exercises with accredited institutions to ensure that accredited institutions are prepared to use these measures when needed."}
{"zh": "# 香港的國際金融中心地位\n\n香港繼續是具全球競爭力的國際金融中心。年內金管局採取多項措施，促進銀行及支付行業開發與應用金融科技。在新冠病毒疫情下年內快速支付系統「轉數快」交易量急增。\n\n香港位處內地金融市場對外開放的要衝，能充分把握開放過程中的契機。憑藉世界級的市場基建以及「滬港通」、「深港通」與「債券通」，香港既是深受內地企業垂青的集資平台，亦是國際投資者進入增長迅速的內地市場的窗口。年內在促進粵港澳大灣區金融合作，尤其便利香港居民在大灣區內使用金融及銀行服務方面取得良好進展。\n\n與此同時，金管局積極開拓新機遇，提升香港金融平台，包括資產及財富管理、企業財資中心，以及可持續金融範疇的競爭力。金管局亦加強市場推廣，向海外及內地持份者推廣香港的金融服務。在環球層面，金管局在多個區內及國際委員會擔當領導角色，充分凸顯香港在相關國際工作的專業知識及承擔。\n\n# 概覽\n\n為鞏固香港的亞洲金融科技樞紐地位，金管局繼續致力實施各項措施，促進銀行及支付行業開發與應用科技。年內的主要進展包括：\n- 推動更廣泛使用快速支付系統「轉數快」；\n- 促進銀行業實施開放應用程式介面（開放API）；\n- 連接貿易融資平台「貿易聯動」與中國人民銀行（人民銀行）轄下的貿易金融區塊鏈平台，促進貿易融資數碼化；\n- 研究央行數碼貨幣於跨境支付的應用；\n- 探討「商業數據通」的技術可行性及研究新類型信貸評分模型，以助中小型企業（中小企）獲取融資；\n- 公布旨在發展更具規模及更多元的合規科技生態圈的兩年計劃，進一步推動合規科技的應用；\n- 加強培育人才；及\n- 推進跨境金融科技合作。\n\n金管局金融科技促進辦公室(FFO)與金管局各銀行部門聯手，在推動上述措施中發揮關鍵作用。\n\n隨着主要金融市場指數開始加入內地在岸證券或增加其權重，流入人民幣資產的資金繼續加快步伐。香港得天獨厚，憑藉連繫內地資本市場的「滬港通」、「深港通」及「債券通」，在促進國際投資者增加人民幣資產配置方面發揮關鍵的作用。在2020年，「債券通」平均每日交易額增加82%，至約193億元人民幣。為完善「債券通」運作，金管局推出新措施，包括新設特別結算周期服務、延長交易時間及引入新安排，讓投資者在選擇銀行進行貨幣兌換與外幣對沖方面有較多彈性。繼「債券通」北向通取得成功，金管局又與人民銀行組成工作小組研究南向通的框架。\n\n金管局亦繼續致力加強香港與粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）內地城市之間的金融配套措施。內地當局公布一系列政策措施，支持區內金融發展。於6月，人民銀行、金管局與澳門金融管理局（澳門金管局）聯合宣布決定實施跨境「理財通」。金管局一直與內地和本地當局以及業界緊密合作，制定有關實施細則。金管局亦就其他措施與內地當局保持聯繫，尋求為香港銀行擴大政策空間拓展更廣闊的跨境業務範疇。年內，香港繼續保持作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位。香港的人民幣即時支付結算(RTGS)系統平均每日交易額創出1.2萬億元人民幣的新高。\n\n金管局積極開拓新機遇，提升香港金融平台競爭力。為促進香港基金業務的發展，金管局與政府及業界緊密合作，為基金在本地落戶締造更有利的稅務及監管環境。金管局亦投入大量工作，繼續提升香港作為區內綠色及可持續金融樞紐的地位。與此同時，金管局加強市場推廣，向海外及內地持份者推廣香港的金融服務。\n\n在中央銀行領域，金管局在多個區內及國際委員會擔當領導角色。例如，金管局為巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（巴塞爾委員會）轄下政策及標準小組，以及東亞及太平洋地區中央銀行會議(EMEAP)轄下金融市場工作小組主席。金管局亦擔任金融穩定理事會轄下非銀行監察專家小組及金融創新網絡聯席主席，並領導探討基準過渡相關監管事項的小組。\n\n香港金融基建的安全及有效運作，為香港的國際金融中心地位奠定穩固基礎。處理銀行同業交易的4個RTGS系統、債務工具中央結算系統（CMU系統）及香港交易資料儲存庫（香港儲存庫）在2020年達到100%的系統可供使用率，高於99.95%的目標水平。透過於內地兩個中央證券託管機構的帳戶，CMU系統繼續協助結算「債券通」北向通交易，以及替相關CMU系統成員持有內地債務證券。\n\n轉數快使用量在2020年繼續增長。截至2020年底合共錄得690萬個登記，全年交易量較2019年上升兩倍。政府接受以轉數快繳費及更多商戶採用，是轉數快在個人對個人支付穩步增長以外，交易額錄得顯著增長的主要原因。\n\n為確保本地零售支付業的整體安全及效率，金管局根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（《支付條例》）指定及監察6個零售支付系統。金管局亦繼續監管18個儲值支付工具持牌人。\n\n# 2020年回顧\n\n# 香港的亞洲金融科技樞紐地位\n\n# 轉數快\n\n自2018年9月轉數快推出以來，已有35間銀行及12間儲值支付工具營運商加入，其中在2020年增加了5間銀行及1間儲值支付工具營運商。轉數快使用量亦穩步增長。截至12月31日，轉數快共錄得690萬個登記（圖1）。為方便市民收取由機構發出的款項，轉數快於12月6日起新增以香港身份證號碼作帳戶識別代號。引入這項功能後不足1個月已錄得超過110,000個登記。這項新功能並非用於個人對個人轉帳，只供已有收款人身份證號碼的機構發放款項（例如發放薪酬）之用。由於每名市民的身份證號碼都是獨一無二，市民利用香港身份證號碼作為帳戶識別代號，即使不提供銀行帳戶號碼都能夠確保準確收取款項。\n\n圖 1 轉數快帳戶登記數目\n\n新冠病毒疫情及保持社交距離措施為使用電子支付服務帶來新動力。年內轉數快交易量增長尤其迅速（圖2），於2020年12月的平均每日交易量達505,000宗即時交易（涉及52億港元及9,500萬元人民幣），相當於2019年12月168,000宗的3倍，更是2018年10月轉數快推出首月的10倍。轉數快使用量增加，亦受惠於應用範圍逐步擴大，由最初主要用作個人對個人支付，逐步擴展至繳付帳單（包括政府帳單）、零售及商業支付。\n\n圖 2 港元即時支付平均每日交易數字\n\n金管局與多個政府部門及銀行業一直合作，將轉數快的應用範圍由個人對個人支付，擴展至繳付帳單及其他商戶支付。政府於2019年11月起接受以轉數快繳付帳單，以推廣使用轉數快及便利市民。市民以支援轉數快的手機銀行或電子錢包掃描印於帳單上的二維碼，即可輕鬆繳付稅款、差餉及地租、水費及政府發出的一般繳費單。截至2020年12月經轉數快繳付政府帳單的交易達180萬宗，涉及22億港元。繼繳付政府帳單服務成功推出後，再有4個政府部門由2020年12月21日起接受在指定繳費櫃枱及自助服務機以轉數快二維碼繳費。政府亦正在探討於網上採用轉數快付款的安排。\n\n另一正面的發展是越來越多大小商戶採用轉數快以加強業務營運。支付商戶的交易在2020年12月急增至平均每日100,000宗，較2019年12月增加38倍轉數快普遍用作繳付帳單、應用程式內直接扣帳，以及進行其他網上購物。電子錢包日益普及，亦帶動了以轉數快為帳戶增值的交易量顯著增長。2020年12月平均每日增值的交易量，是2019年12月的7倍。\n\n為加強市民對轉數快的認識，金管局製作各類教育及宣傳資料，包括電視廣告及在社交媒體平台提供一系列精明使用錦囊。金管局亦舉辦中學生Whatsapp Stickers設計比賽，增加他們對電子支付的認識。此外，金管局向多個慈善團體及街市營運商推廣使用轉數快收付款項。多間參與轉數快的銀行及儲值支付工具營運商亦推出宣傳活動，包括提供優惠，吸引客戶登記及利用轉數快轉帳及支付帳單。在2020年的成果上，金管局在2021年初與銀行及儲值支付工具營運商合作，推廣透過轉數快以電子方式派利是。一方面金管局推出宣傳活動，另一方面銀行及儲值支付工具營運商則提供優惠，鼓勵客戶以電子方式派利是，既環保又有助抗疫。\n\n# 開放應用程式介面\n\n金管局繼續促進銀行業按照開放API框架研發及提供開放API。該框架分4個階段實施，銀行已推出第一及第二階段開放API，並以這些開放API與第三方服務提供者合作，開拓各項創新服務，提升客戶體驗。另一方面，金管局就實施第三及第四階段開放API進行調查研究，並於11月刊發小冊子，刊載調查結果。\n\n# 貿易聯動\n\n為使進出口商獲得更方便的貿易融資服務，金管局於年內展開概念驗證研究，探討連接「貿易聯動」與人民銀行轄下的貿易金融區塊鏈平台。該研究的首階段於年內第4季完成，並隨後開始試行。香港和內地銀行已用該連接成功完成多項跨境貿易融資交易。\n\n# 跨境支付\n\n央行數碼貨幣方面，金管局與泰國中央銀行繼續進行聯合研究，探討央行數碼貨幣於跨境支付的應用藉此促進香港與泰國兩地銀行之間港元和泰銖的外匯交易同步交收。雙方完成第一階段研究，並於1月發表聯合報告闡述主要研究結果；另亦開發以區塊鏈為基礎的跨境走廊網絡原型，致力提高跨境支付的效率及降低成本。項目第二階段已展開，旨在探討跨境貿易結算及資本市場交易的商業應用案例。其他央行亦對項目深感興趣。國際結算銀行、阿拉伯聯合酋長國中央銀行和人民銀行數字貨幣研究所於2021年初宣布參與項目。", "en": "Hong Kong's status as an international financial center is a matter of debate.\n\nHong Kong continues to be a globally competitive international financial centre. In the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority took several measures to promote the development and application of financial technology in the banking and payment industry. In the year following the coronavirus outbreak, the transaction volume of the fast payment system \"Transfer Fast\" increased sharply.\n\nHong Kong is a key location for Hong Kong's financial market to open up to the outside world, and can fully seize the opportunities in the opening process. With its world-class market infrastructure and \"Hong Kong Portfolio\", \"Deep Portfolio\" and \"Bond Portfolio\", Hong Kong is both a highly sought-after investment platform for domestic companies and a window for international investors to enter the rapidly growing domestic market.\n\nAt the same time, the KIC is actively pursuing new opportunities to enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong's financial platforms, including asset and wealth management, corporate finance centres, and sustainable finance. The KIC is also strengthening its market promotion and promoting Hong Kong's financial services to overseas and domestic stakeholders. At the global level, the KIC plays a leading role in several regional and international committees, fully demonstrating Hong Kong's expertise and commitment to relevant international work.\n\n# Summary\n\nTo consolidate Hong Kong's position as the financial technology hub in Asia, the KING Administration continued to implement measures to promote the development and application of technology in the banking and payment industry. The main developments during the year include: - Promoting the wider use of the fast payment system \"Quick Transfer\"; - Promoting the implementation of the open application interface (\"Open API\") by the banking industry; - Linking the \"Trade Interaction\" trade finance platform with the \"Trade Interaction\" financial district block platform under the People's Bank of China (\"People's Bank\") to promote the digitalization of trade finance; - Studying the application of central bank digital currency in cross-border payments; - Exploring the technical feasibility of \"Digital Commerce\" and new credit rating models to help SMEs obtain financing; - Publication of a two-year, step-by-step plan to promote the development of a more integrated and multi-disciplinary ecosystem of technology and technology; - Developing the talent and skills of the Chinese government; - Promoting cross-border financial cooperation between the Chinese government and the Chinese government.\n\nThe FFO, which works with the Banking Sectors of the Gold Authority, has been instrumental in the implementation of the above measures.\n\nAs major financial market indices began to add inland offshore securities or increase their weight, the flow of funds into RMB assets continued to accelerate. Hong Kong is fortunate to have the \"Ring Hafen\", \"Deep Hafen\" and \"Bond Hafen\" connecting the domestic capital market, playing a key role in promoting international investors to increase RMB asset allocation. In 2020, the average daily transaction of \"Bond Hafen\" increased by 82%, to about 19.3 billion yuan. To improve the operation of \"Bond Hafen\", the Treasury introduced new measures, including the establishment of a special settlement cycle, extended service trading hours and the introduction of new arrangements, allowing investors to choose banks to carry out more flexible currency and foreign exchange operations. Following the success of \"Bond Hafen\" to the north, the Treasury and a small group of banks worked together to develop a framework for the \"Bond Hafen\" to the south.\n\nThe HKMA also continues to work to strengthen financial support measures between Hong Kong and the inland cities of the Greater Bay Area (GBA). The local authorities have announced a series of policy measures to support financial development in the region. In June, the People's Bank of China, the HKMA and the Macau Financial Management Authority (MFMA) jointly announced the implementation of cross-border \"Rational Money\".\n\nThe HKMA is actively pursuing new opportunities and enhancing the competitiveness of Hong Kong's financial platform. In order to promote the development of the fund's business in Hong Kong, the HKMA works closely with the government and industry to create a more favorable tax and regulatory environment for the fund to settle locally. The HKMA also invests a lot of work to continue promoting Hong Kong's status as a green and sustainable financial hub in the region.\n\nIn the central banking area, the KIM exercises leadership roles in several regional and international committees. For example, the KIM chairs the Policy and Standards Group under the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) and the Financial Markets Working Group under the East Asia and Pacific Council of Central Banks (EMEAP). The KIM also chairs the Non-Banking Supervisory Expert Group and the Financial Innovation Network under the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and leads the group to discuss regulatory issues related to the transition to standards.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong's financial infrastructure has laid a solid foundation for Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre. The four RTGS systems for processing bank-to-bank transactions, the Central Settlement System for Debt Instruments (CMU System) and the Hong Kong Transaction Data Storage (HKDTS) have reached 100% system availability in 2020, above the target level of 99.95%. Through the accounts of the two mainland central securities depository institutions, the CMU System continues to facilitate the settlement of \"bond transit\" northbound transactions and the holding of domestic debt securities by the relevant CMU System members.\n\nThe use of ATMs continued to grow in 2020 with 6.9 million registrations by the end of 2020, doubling the number of transactions for the full year compared to 2019. The acceptance of ATM fees by the government and the adoption of more merchants are the main reasons for the significant increase in transaction volumes, in addition to the steady growth of person-to-person payments.\n\nTo ensure the overall safety and efficiency of the local retail payments industry, the IPA designated and supervised six retail payment systems under the IPA Payment Systems and Payment Instruments Regulations. The IPA also continues to supervise 18 Payment Instruments Licensees.\n\n# Looking back on 2020\n\nHong Kong is the financial technology hub of Asia\n\n# Turn the clock fast\n\nSince the launch of the Transfer Express in September 2018, 35 banks and 12 ATM operators have joined, with 5 banks and 1 ATM operator added in 2020. The use of the Transfer Express has also been steadily growing. As of December 31, the Transfer Express had 6.9 million registrations. To facilitate the collection of funds issued by institutions, the Transfer Express was added on December 6 to use the Hong Kong ID card as an account identification code.\n\nFigure 1 Number of accounts registered in the Fast Track\n\nThe coronavirus outbreak and social distancing measures have given new impetus to the use of electronic payment services. The average daily transaction volume in December 2020 was 505,000 instant transactions involving HK$5.2 billion and RMB 95 million, equivalent to three times the 168,000 transactions in December 2019, and 10 times the number of transactions in the first month of October 2018\".\n\nFigure 2 Average daily number of transactions in HKD instant payments\n\nThe Ministry of Finance has been working with various government departments and banking industry to expand the scope of the FTT from person-to-person payments to checking accounts and other business payments. The government began accepting checking accounts in November 2019 to promote the use of FTT and to facilitate citizens. Citizens can scan the bills in 2D to support the FTT, i.e. easily pay the difference in tax, land rent, water and general expenses issued by the government. As of December 2020, 1.8 million transactions were paid by the FTT, involving 2.2 billion yuan.\n\nAnother positive development is the growing number of small and large merchants adopting FAST to boost their business operations. Payment merchant transactions surged to an average of 100,000 per day in December 2020, a 38-fold increase compared to December 2019. FAST is widely used as a payment account, direct debit in the app, and for other online purchases. The growing popularity of e-wallets has also led to a significant increase in the number of transactions that add value to accounts with FAST.\n\nIn order to increase public awareness of the fast transfer, the KBA has produced various educational and promotional materials, including TV ads and a series of smart use capsules on social media platforms. The KBA also held a WhatsApp Stickers design competition for high school students to increase their awareness of electronic payments. In addition, the KBA promoted the use of the fast transfer payment to several charitable groups and street market operators.\n\n#Open the app interface\n\nThe Bank has launched the first and second phases of the Open API, and has collaborated with third-party service providers to develop innovative services and improve customer experience. On the other hand, the Bank has conducted a survey study on the implementation of the third and fourth phases of the Open API, and published a brochure in November, publishing the results of the survey.\n\n# Trade and Mobility\n\nTo facilitate access to trade financing services for importers and exporters, the KIM conducted a proof-of-concept study during the year to explore the possibility of linking the \"Trade Connectivity\" with the trade finance block platform under the People's Bank. The first phase of the study was completed in the fourth quarter of the year, and subsequently began testing.\n\n# Cross border payments\n\nThe first phase of the study was completed by the two sides and a joint report was published in January describing the main results of the study. The second phase of the project has been developed to explore the commercial application of cross-border trade and capital market transactions. Other central banks are also interested in the project. The Bank of International Settlements, the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates and the People's Bank of China Digital Currency Institute announced their participation in the project in early 2021\"."}
{"zh": "# 儲備管理\n\n2020年是峰迴路轉的一年，新冠病毒疫情為全球經濟帶來前所未有的挑戰。資產市場於第1 季經歷了大幅調整和震盪後，在主要央行推出超寬鬆的貨幣政策及各地政府實施大規模的財政紓困措施帶動下，得以迅速反彈。由於主要央行大幅下調基準利率並重啟量化寬鬆措施，令國債收益率顯著下跌、債券價格上升。在此投資環境下，外匯基金在2020 年錄得2,358 億港元的投資收入，回報率為5.3%。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》，外匯基金的首要目的是直接或間接影響港元匯價，亦可運用於保持香港貨幣及金融體系穩定健全，藉此保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。金管局根據財政司司長轉授的權力及轉授權力的條款，就外匯基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標及組合架構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會為外匯基金制定下列投資目標：\n(a) 保障資本；\n(b) 確保整體貨幣基礎在任何時候都由流通性極高的美元資產提供十足支持；\n(c) 確保流動資金足以維持貨幣及金融穩定；以及\n(d) 在符合上述(a)至(c)項的前提下盡量爭取投資回報，以保障基金的長期購買力。\n\n以上目標全面顧及外匯基金的法定目的，並已於外匯基金的組合結構及目標資產配置中反映。\n\n外匯基金大致上分成兩個主要組合：支持組合及投資組合。支持組合持有流通性極高的美元資產，按照貨幣發行局制度的規定為貨幣基礎提供十足支持。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債市及股市，以保障資產的價值及長期購買力。\n\n為能更妥善管理風險及提高中長期回報，金管局以審慎及循序漸進方式將外匯基金的部分資產配置於較多元化的資產類別，包括新興巿場及內地債券與股票、私募股權（包括基建）及房地產。新興巿場及內地債券與股票由投資組合持有，私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合持有。長期增長組合的市值上限為外匯基金累計盈餘的三分之一，以及未來基金存款與外匯基金附屬公司存款中與長期增長組合掛鈎部分的總和。\n\n策略性資產組合於2007年設立，一直持有政府基於策略性目的而為外匯基金帳目購入的香港交易及結算所有限公司股份。由於這個組合性質獨特，因此外匯基金的投資表現評估並無將其包括在內。\n\n# 於外匯基金的存款\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定組織的存款，利率一般與投資組合的表現掛鈎，但未來基金屬主要個別例子。未來基金存款的利率與投資組合及長期增長組合的表現掛鈎，實際利率視乎組合比重而定。未來基金在投資組合與長期增長組合的比重約為40：60。\n\n# 投資程序\n\n外匯基金的投資程序分別以策略性資產配置及戰略性資產配置作基礎。策略性資產配置，會以投資基準方式反映，亦即外匯基金為達到投資目標而可作出的長線資產配置。外匯基金以策略性配置作為指引，透過戰略性的資產配置，以爭取超越基準的回報。因此，實際配置往往會與基準配置（亦即策略性配置）有所偏離，而實際與基準配置之間的差距稱為「戰略性偏離」。財政司司長經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後制定投資基準及循跡誤差限額，金管局獲授權決定戰略性資產配置及定出戰略性偏離的容許範圍。投資組合經理可在戰略性偏離的容許範圍內管理倉盤，從短期市場變化中獲利。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局的外匯基金投資辦公室專責投資及相關風險管理職能。該辦公室職員負責直接管理外匯基金約72%的投資，包括整個支持組合及部分投資組合。該部分投資組合包括不同的環球定息市場投資，並透過衍生工具執行外匯基金的宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 外聘投資經理\n\n除透過內部職員管理資產外，金管局亦僱用外聘投資經理負責管理外匯基金約28%的資產，包括所有上市股票組合及其他特別資產。僱用外聘投資經理的目的是要運用市場上最佳的專業投資專才為外匯基金投資，獲取可持續回報，並讓外匯基金受惠於多元化及互補的投資方式，以及汲取市場心得與專門的投資知識。\n\n僱用外聘投資經理的相關支出包括基金管理與託管費、交易費、預扣稅及其他稅項。這些支出主要受市場因素影響而每年不同。\n\n# 風險管理及監察\n\n投資環境越趨複雜，風險管理的重要性不言而喻。金管局為內部及外聘投資經理所管理的投資組合均訂下嚴格管控措施及投資指引，並設立嚴謹的風險監察及合規制度。金管局為投資相關活動設有三重防線以確保有效的風險管理及監察。金管局亦定期監察主要投資風險類別（包括信用、市場、流動性及業務操作風險），並已加強風險管理程序以配合外匯基金的多元化投資。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n金管局支持負責任投資，將環境、社會及管治(ESG)因素併入外匯基金的公開市場及私募市場的投資管理過程。\n\n金管局訂有一套原則，以評估外匯基金投資項目的ESG風險與機會。就外聘投資經理所管理的資產組合而言，金管局透過獲委任的投資經理執行負責任投資。在甄選、委任及監察外聘投資經理的過程中，金管局會評估其落實ESG的不同範疇，包括ESG管治方面的組織架構、ESG標準及政策、將ESG因素併入投資程序中的情況，以及管理督導的業務活動，即代理投票和與投資組合公司的溝通（例如與投資組合公司管理層商討ESG的事宜）。為彰顯對負責任投資的重視，金管局透過外聘投資經理在管理督導方面扮演的角色，推動更完善的ESG做法。負責管理金管局的香港股票組合及中國內地股票主動投資管理組合的外聘投資經理，須承諾遵守證券及期貨事務監察委員會頒布的《負責任的擁有權原則》，若未能遵守則須作出解釋。至於負責管理已發展市場股票組合的外聘投資經理則需恪守國際公認的ESG標準。此外，金管局又展開聘任後監察計劃，以審視外聘投資經理的代理投票及與投資組合公司溝通的落實概況。\n\n由金管局內部人員負責管理的定息投資組合，亦將ESG因素融入債券投資的信用風險分析中。藉著擴大ESG數據來源以及在量化評估中提高ESG因素的權重，加強相關的分析。\n\n至於在公開市場的ESG投資，金管局自2015年起投資於綠色、社會責任及可持續債券（ESG債券），是這個市場的早期投資者之一。此外，金管局亦參與國際金融公司的「聯合貸款組合管理計劃」，而其投資對象聚焦於新興市場的可持續發展項目。在2020年，適逢市場供應增加，金管局增加ESG債券的投資。展望未來，金管局將繼續透過直接投資或持有ESG債券基金等方式，壯大其ESG債券組合。此外，金管局將透過採納ESG股票指數作為被動投資組合的投資基準，推動外聘投資經理建立以ESG為主題的股票投資方針。金管局在未來幾年將會繼續留意以ESG為主題的投資機會，例如主動式的ESG投資組合及低碳為題的投資工具。\n\n私募市場投資方面，金管局在盡職審查過程中檢視專責合夥人的ESG政策及具體措施。金管局的長期增長組合積極投資於具備可持續特點的項目，包括可再生能源基建，而在房地產投資組合亦有吸納具有綠色及可持續特點的倉庫及其他建築物。金管局將在未來繼續物色具備可持續特點的項目，並在房地產投資方面將綠色認證列入為重要考慮因素。金管局與專責合夥人舉行年度ESG工作坊，就良好的ESG作業手法交流意見及經驗。在11月舉行的ESG工作坊上，一眾專責合夥人就新冠病毒疫情對其投資組合公司及ESG投資發展所造成的影響交換意見。為提高私募市場投資的ESG透明度，金管局已要求專責合夥人提供有關其投資項目的ESG資訊，例如氣候變化風險等，以便監察。\n\n金管局往後仍會密切觀察ESG標準的發展，評估如何將有關標準進一步融入投資程序，當中包括與理念相近的投資者及國際組織互動合作。金管局作為聯合國支持的《負責任投資原則》的簽署人之一，肩負作為全球倡導者的責任，日後將會參與制定ESG最佳作業手法，並推動其他投資者採納負責任的投資方法。金管局亦是非牟利機構 FCLTGlobal 的成員，該機構旨在透過舉辦工作坊及研究，鼓勵以長遠目標為本的業務及投資決策。金管局亦有參與「氣候相關財務資訊披露工作小組」，並為「央行與監管機構綠色金融網絡」的成員。此外，金管局籌辦講座及積極參與投資業界舉辦的活動，分享及推廣有關ESG投資的理念。\n\n有關金管局的負責任投資政策架構，詳見「機構社會責任」一章。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2020年的金融市場\n\n因應受新冠病毒疫情為全球經濟帶來的重大挑戰而推出的寬鬆貨幣及財政政策支持下，環球金融市場在年底時升至高位。環球股票市場於第1季經歷了大幅調整和震盪後迅速反彈，主要市場更錄得雙位數字的增長。美國標準普爾500指數上升16%，是2020年表現最佳的七大工業國股票指數。\n\n債市方面，主要已發展國家的債券收益率在第1季顯著下跌後繼續受壓。10年期美國國債收益率由年初的1.9%下跌約100基點，至年底的0.9%。由於主要國債價格急升，2020年從債市錄得非常可觀的估值收益。\n\n貨幣市場方面，美國息率向下令息差收窄，促使美元兌主要貨幣轉弱，而2020年下半年情況更為顯著，其中歐元及人民幣兌美元分別升值約9.0%及6.5%。\n\n表1列載主要貨幣、債巿及股市在2020年的表現。\n\n表 1 2020年市場回報\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n外匯基金在2020年錄得2,358億港元的投資收入，其中包括債券投資收益927億港元、香港股票投資收益40億港元、其他股票投資收益699億港元、非港元資產外匯估值上調96億港元，以及外匯基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資收益596億港元。另一方面，策略性資產組合錄得140億港元估值收益。", "en": "# Reserves management\n\n2020 was a year of turning points, with the coronavirus pandemic bringing unprecedented challenges to the global economy. After the asset markets experienced significant adjustments and shocks in Q1, they were able to bounce back quickly after the major central banks launched ultra-loose monetary policies and large-scale fiscal austerity measures by various governments. As the major central banks drastically lowered the benchmark interest rate and re-invigorated the easing measures, the yield on government bonds fell significantly, and bond prices rose. In this investment environment, the foreign exchange fund recorded HK$235.8 billion in investment income in 2020, with a return of 5.3%.[28]\n\n# The Outdoor Fund\n\nAccording to the regulations of the OTC Funds, the primary purpose of the OTC Funds is to directly or indirectly influence the HKD exchange rate and may be used to maintain the stability and soundness of the monetary and financial system of Hong Kong, thereby maintaining Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre. The Gold Authority is responsible to the Finance Minister for the operation and investment management of the OTC Funds, in accordance with the terms of the delegated powers and delegated powers of the Chief Financial Officer.\n\n# Managing the foreign exchange fund\n\n# Investment goals and syndicate structure\n\nThe Advisory Committee on Hedge Funds has established the following investment objectives for hedge funds: (a) to safeguard capital; (b) to ensure that the overall monetary base is adequately supported at all times by highly liquid dollar assets; (c) to ensure that there is sufficient liquid capital to maintain monetary and financial stability; and (d) to seek the highest return on investment to secure the long-term purchasing power of the fund, subject to the conditions set out in subparagraphs (a) to (c) above.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the legal purpose of the fund and are reflected in the composition and target asset allocation of the fund.\n\nThe funds are broadly divided into two main groups: support groups and investment groups. Support groups hold highly liquid dollar assets and provide adequate support on a currency basis in accordance with the rules of the monetary authority system. Investment groups invest primarily in the bond and stock markets of the member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to secure the value of the assets and their long-term purchasing power.\n\nIn order to better manage risk and improve medium- and long-term returns, the FSA has prudently and progressively allocated some of the assets of the hedge fund to a more diversified set of assets, including emerging market and inland bonds and stocks, private equity (including infrastructure) and real estate. Emerging market and inland bonds and stocks are held by the investment group, while private equity and real estate are held by the long-term growth group. The market cap of the long-term growth group is one-third of the cumulative surplus of the hedge fund, and the sum of the future fund deposits and the hedge fund's portion of the long-term growth group's accumulated surplus of the subsidiary's deposits.\n\nThe Strategic Asset Group was established in 2007 and has been holding Hong Kong trading and settlement ownership shares of companies acquired by the government for the account of the shell fund for strategic purposes. Due to the unique nature of the group, the investment performance assessment of the shell fund does not include it.\n\n# Deposits to the shell fund\n\nThe interest rate on the deposit of a future fund is the interest rate on the deposit of a future fund and the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the interest rate on the next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment procedures of hedge funds are based on strategic asset allocation and strategic asset allocation respectively. Strategic asset allocation reflects the investment criteria, i.e. the long-term asset allocation that hedge funds can make to achieve their investment objectives. Hedge funds use strategic allocation as a guide, through strategic asset allocation, to fight for the return of exceeding the criteria. Therefore, the actual allocation tends to be deviated from the standard allocation (also known as strategic allocation), and the difference between the actual and standard allocation is called \"strategic deviation\". After consulting the Advisory Committee of the hedge fund, the Director of Finance develops investment criteria and trajectory margin, and the Financial Conduct Authority is authorized to decide on the strategic allocation and the allocation of the allowance.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nThe Office of Investment in Hedge Funds is the investment and risk management arm of the FCA. The Office is responsible for the direct management of approximately 72% of the hedge fund's investments, including the entire support group and some of the investment groups. The investment groups include various global fixed income market investments and implement the macro risk management strategy of the hedge fund through derivatives.\n\n# Outsourcing investment managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets through internal staff, the CMA also employs an external investment manager responsible for managing approximately 28% of the assets of the shell fund, including all listed stock combinations and other special assets. The purpose of employing an external investment manager is to use the best professional investment professionals in the market to invest in the shell fund, to obtain sustainable returns, and to allow the shell fund to benefit from diversified and complementary investment methods, as well as to draw on market-oriented and specialized investment knowledge.\n\nThe associated expenses of hiring an outsourced investment manager include the management and custody fees, transaction fees, withholding taxes and other taxes. These expenses vary from year to year, mainly due to market factors.\n\n# Risk management and surveillance\n\nThe investment environment is becoming increasingly complex, and the importance of risk management is evident. The IORP has established strict regulatory and investment guidelines for investment groups managed by internal and external investment managers, and has established a rigorous risk oversight and compliance system. The IORP has a triple line of defence for investment-related activities to ensure effective risk management and oversight. The IORP also regularly monitors the main investment risk categories (including credit, market liquidity and operational risk), and has strengthened its risk management procedures to match the diversified investments of its hedge funds.\n\n#Responsible investing\n\nThe FSA supports responsible investing and the integration of environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into the investment management processes of the public and private markets for hedge funds.\n\nThe Board has a set of principles to evaluate ESG risks and opportunities in shell fund investment projects. In the case of an asset pool managed by an OIM, the Board conducts responsible investment through a designated investment manager. In the process of selecting, appointing and supervising OIMs, the Board evaluates the implementation of ESG in different areas, including the organizational structure of ESG governance, ESG standards and policies, the incorporation of ESG factors into the investment process, and the business activities of the management supervision, namely proxy voting and communication with the investment fund company (e.g. communication with the managers of the investment fund company).\n\nThe FIS, which is managed by the FIS staff, also integrates ESG factors into the credit risk analysis of bond investments. The analysis is strengthened by expanding the source of ESG data and increasing the importance of ESG factors in the quantitative assessment.\n\nAs for ESG investments in the open market, the FSA has been one of the early investors in green, socially responsible and sustainable bonds since 2015. In addition, the FSA is also involved in the International Finance Corporation's Joint Credit Union Management Plan, which focuses on sustainability projects in emerging markets. In 2020, the FSA is increasing its investment prospects in ESG bonds, as market supply increases.\n\nIn terms of private market investments, the CMA reviews the ESG policies and specific measures of the responsible partners during the ex-officio review process. The CMA's long-term growth consortium actively invests in projects with sustainable characteristics, including renewable energy infrastructure, while the real estate investment consortium also has green and sustainable warehouses and other buildings. The CMA will continue to invest in projects with sustainable characteristics in the future and include green certification as an important consideration in real estate investments. The CMA holds an annual workshop with the responsible partners to exchange views and experiences on good ESG working practices.\n\nThe FSA will continue to monitor the development of ESG standards to assess how they can be further integrated into investment processes, including interaction with investors and international organizations that are similar in concept. As one of the signatories of the UN-backed Principles for Responsible Investment, the FSA is responsible for promoting responsible investment practices among other investors. The FSA is a member of the non-profit organization FCLT Global, which aims to encourage long-term business and investment decisions through workshops and research.\n\nFor more information on the KIM's framework for responsible investment, see the chapter on Institutional Social Responsibility.\n\n# Performance of the foreign exchange fund\n\n# Financial markets in 2020\n\nGlobal financial markets rose to high levels at the end of the year, supported by loose monetary and fiscal policies introduced in response to the significant challenges posed to the global economy by the coronavirus pandemic. Global equity markets rebounded quickly after major adjustments and shocks in Q1, with major markets posting double-digit growth. The US Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 16%, the best-performing stock index of the seven major industrial nations in 2020.\n\nBond market yields in the major developed countries continued to be depressed after a significant decline in Q1. The 10-year US Treasury yield fell by about 100 basis points from 1.9% at the beginning of the year to 0.9% at the end of the year.

{"zh": "# 機構社會責任\n\n金管局致力履行機構社會責任，以成為負責任及可持續發展的機構為目標。金管局在不同領域履行此承諾，包括推動可持續發展及具環保意識的市場、關懷廣大社會、保護環境及締造友善的工作環境。\n\n為應對新冠病毒疫情，金管局推出多項措施，支援有需要的個人及企業，從而協助香港經濟渡過難關。\n\n# 市場環境\n\n# 綠色及可持續金融\n\n氣候變化是影響人類福祉及全球經濟可持續性的主要風險之一，作為社會重要環節之一的金融體系，亦難免會受到影響；而銀行作為金融體系的一部分，應更積極管理氣候風險。有見及此，金管局致力探究應對這項挑戰的方法，並正落實多項於2019年5月宣布推出的措施，促進綠色金融在香港的發展。有關措施包括分三階段推動綠色及可持續銀行業的發展：\n\n# 第一階段\n\n與業界建立一個共同框架，評估銀行目前的「綠色基準」，以及與國際組織合作，為本港銀行提供技術支援；\n\n# 第二階段\n\n就綠色及可持續銀行業的監管期望及要求諮詢業界及其他持份者；以及\n\n# 第三階段\n\n集中落實、審視及評估銀行在這方面的進度。\n\n在國際層面，金管局參與多個國際組織，包括央行與監管機構綠色金融網絡、巴塞爾銀行監管委員會轄下的氣候相關財務風險高級別工作組、東亞及太平洋地區中央銀行會議轄下銀行監管工作小組之下的可持續金融關注組及國際可持續金融平台。透過參與這些國際組織，金管局有機會為中央銀行界及監管機構在應對氣候變化的工作上作出貢獻，並能在制定本地架構時借鑑其他地區的經驗與觀點。\n\n金管局亦參與央行與監管機構綠色金融網絡下的多個工作組，包括微觀審慎監管工作組、宏觀金融工作組及促進綠色金融工作組。此外，金管局亦加入了兩個新設的工作組：研究工作組及彌補數據缺口工作組。研究工作組負責相關研究工作，而彌補數據缺口工作組旨在制定監管當局及金融機構評估氣候相關風險與機遇所需、但目前卻並未掌握的數據項目詳盡清單。有關金管局年內在推動綠色及可持續銀行業發展方面的工作，詳見「銀行體系穩定」一章。\n\n金管局在11月與國際金融公司聯合推出綠色商業銀行聯盟，協助各新興市場的銀行制定應對氣候變化的方案。作為聯盟的創始成員及首個區域執行理事，金管局i)在全球金融市場推動發展綠色商業銀行；ii)為商業銀行提供互相學習平台，獲取所需知識、工具及商業資訊，以制定其本身的綠色金融路線圖，並轉型為具公信力的綠色銀行；iii)促進溝通，並探討前沿議題推動全球綠色議程；以及iv)協助聯盟的成員合作，以及把握國際金融公司所識別在未來10年估計高達23萬億美元的新興市場綠色及氣候相關投資機會。\n\n本地方面，金管局與其他金融監管機構合作，協調金融業針對氣候和環境風險的措施應對。除了協助政府落實政府綠色債券計劃的相關工作外，金管局亦與證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）共同發起成立了綠色和可持續金融跨機構督導小組（督導小組），處理跨行業的監管及市場發展事宜。有關金管局年內在發展香港成為綠色及可持續金融樞紐方面的工作，詳見「香港的國際金融中心地位」一章。\n\n# 綠色和可持續金融跨機構督導小組\n\n督導小組旨在協調金融業針對氣候及環境風險的措施應對、加快香港綠色及可持續金融的發展，以及支持政府的氣候策略。督導小組由金管局與證監會於5月共同發起成立，其他成員包括環境局、財經事務及庫務局、香港交易及結算所有限公司、保險業監管局及強制性公積金計劃管理局。\n\n自成立以來，督導小組設立了兩個技術工作專責團隊，分別負責研究及處理跨部門的監管事宜，以及協調跨機構的市場發展工作。\n\n督導小組在12月發布綠色及可持續金融策略，提出從六方面鞏固香港金融生態系統，長遠共建更綠色及更可持續的未來。督導小組亦宣布5個短期行動綱領，處理發展過程中一些最迫切的問題。\n\n金管局舉辦督導小組成立大會，金管局總裁余偉文先生（右三）為該小組的聯席主席。\n\n督導小組發布香港的綠色和可持續金融策略計劃及5個主要行動綱領。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n金管局支持負責任投資，即將環境、社會及管治(ESG)因素融入投資活動中。金管局作為規模龐大的資產擁有人，日益關注負責任投資，將對其基金經理如何進行投資活動產生影響。\n\n# 金管局的信念\n\n金管局相信透過適度強調負責任投資及考慮各項投資的可持續長期表現，將更有效達致外匯基金的投資目標，並且減低投資活動所涉及的ESG相關風險。\n\n# 金管局的原則\n\n按金管局採取的指導性原則，當ESG投資與其他投資項目的經風險調整長期收益相若時，一般會優先考慮ESG投資。作為負責任的長期投資者，金管局在投資管理過程中，會因應情況採納以下的負責任投資原則：\n\n# 融入\n\n金管局相信ESG因素會對投資項目的長期價值帶來重大影響，因此將ESG因素融入投資分析程序，以辨察風險及物色良機。金管局將ESG因素併入公開市場及私募市場的投資管理過程中。\n\n# 主動行使資產擁有權\n\n金管局就所持有的上市公司股票適當地行使股東權利，以維護投資的長期價值。金管局相信，顧及ESG因素的負責任企業行為，將有助創造長綫的股東利益。金管局期望外聘投資經理透過行使表決權及與獲投資公司溝通時，主動行使資產擁有權，藉以協助金管局履行對投資項目的擁有權責任。\n\n# 合作\n\n金管局致力與理念相近的投資者及監管機構合作，推動良好的長期投資管理手法，又出席公開活動並發表演講，分享更完善的ESG作業手法及鼓勵投資界採納負責任投資理念。\n\n有關金管局年內在負責任投資方面的工作，詳見「儲備管理」一章。\n\n# 金管局作為主動的負責任投資者，監察外聘投資經理的ESG作業手法\n\n# 金管局的期望\n\n金管局非常重視將ESG因素融入投資決定及主動行使資產擁有權等概念。為此，金管局在甄選聘任及監察外聘投資經理時，皆會考慮ESG因素。由於金管局認為就所持有的上市公司股票行使股東權利，是維護投資的長期價值的基本方針，因此會要求獲聘任的投資經理嚴肅對待主動行使資產擁有權一事。\n\n# 金管局的監察\n\n外聘投資經理須就其替金管局管理的上市股票組合的ESG表現接受評估。金管局透過溝通計劃，有系統地檢視外聘投資經理在不同範疇的ESG作業手法，例如其ESG評估架構、與獲投資公司的溝通，以及代理投票方面的工作。金管局在2020年選出若干外聘投資經理率先進行溝通計劃，當中不僅評估其ESG表現，亦檢視其有否代表金管局妥善行使資產擁有權。\n\n# 溝通成果\n\n金管局透過計劃識別出作業手法有問題的外聘投資經理，並採取跟進行動。下文列舉其中兩個例子。\n\n# 個案1\n\n金管局留意到股票投資經理A的ESG架構有改善空間，尤其應設立更有系統的方法去評估獲投資公司。金管局就此與A跟進，其後A進行全面的公司政策檢討，以實施一個更穩健的ESG架構。A更特別委任外聘顧問就ESG程序提供意見，反映加快落實改革的決心，並新設由高級管理層組成的ESG委員會，顯示對ESG的承擔及高級管理層對有關措施的支持。\n\n# 個案2\n\n金管局在檢視股票投資經理B的投票方法後，發現B的投票政策在多個範疇上都有不足之處，並要求其ESG主管作出審視。尤其B在過往的投票全數贊成管理層的建議，偏離其本身的代理投票指引。B其後承諾會加強公司的投票政策以符合期望，其中包括會提高ESG團隊成員的參與度，以及在遇上涉及重大管治問題時有可能對管理層投下反對票。\n\n在私募市場投資方面，金管局藉着其專責合夥人致力與相關投資組合公司在ESG事宜上合作，從而實現負責任投資。金管局留意到專責合夥人都貫徹對ESG的承擔，因他們認為此舉可有利創造投資組合公司的長期價值和確保回報的可持續性。下文列舉的兩個例子顯示可透過(i)設計改動及利用創新運作技術；以及(ii)在建造及營運綠色及可持續倉庫時融入減碳因素，以管理氣候變化風險。兩個例子都對環境產生顯著的正面影響，減少碳排放，避免有害物質，並同時透過降低成本及節省能源，提升運作效率。\n\n(i) 金管局有投資一間採用環保方案的害蟲防治公司。雖然傳統殺蟲劑及化學製品能有效殺滅害蟲，但若未能迅速清除或妥善棄置蟲屍，將會危害公共衛生。此外，化學成分的滲漏及棄置亦會造成環境問題。該公司採用的不含生物殺滅劑方案，透過設置捕蟲器以減少使用有害化學品。該公司亦利用與互聯網相連的動態感應器，遙距偵察是否已捕獲害蟲。藉着此項新技術，該公司能作出完善的路線規劃以收集捕獲的害蟲，減低出行里程，從而減少碳排放。該公司採用的方案令公司整體碳排的淨效應達到每美元淨銷售額0.36千克二氧化碳當量的低水平，接近法律服務及軟件出版等低碳行業的平均水平，實在令人鼓舞。\n\n(ii) 金管局有投資綠色及可持續倉庫。雖然建造業是碳排放的一大源頭，但有關的倉庫發展商在其整體倉庫建造與營運中，採用淨零碳排放程序，並制定衡量淨零碳排放基準的標準及指標，而建築計劃亦顧及所用材料與部件的可持續性。因此，所建造的倉庫減碳效率高，並具備可持續特點，包括太陽能加熱系統、電動車充電設施、自然採光及雨水收集等。\n\n根據獨立顧問的評估，按淨額計，有關倉庫建造的碳足跡較一般物流大廈的碳排放量低25.8%。為進一步抵銷建築工程所造成的碳排放，建造過程中更種植了32,799棵樹（以淨額計）。建成後倉庫的日常運作的碳排放量較一般倉庫少26.9%。", "en": "# Institutional social responsibility\n\nThe Gold Authority is committed to fulfilling its corporate social responsibility and to becoming a responsible and sustainable institution. The Gold Authority fulfills this commitment in various areas, including promoting sustainable and environmentally conscious markets, caring for the wider society, protecting the environment and creating a friendly working environment.\n\nIn response to the coronavirus outbreak, the HKSAR has introduced a number of measures to support individuals and businesses in need, thereby helping Hong Kong's economy through the difficult times.\n\n# The market environment\n\n#Green and sustainable finance\n\nThe Bank of China is committed to addressing the challenge and is implementing a number of measures announced in May 2019 to promote the development of green finance in Hong Kong. The measures include three phases to promote the development of green and sustainable banking:\n\n# Stage one\n\nDevelop a common framework with the industry to assess the current \"green standards\" of the bank and provide technical support to the Bank in collaboration with international organizations;\n\n# Stage two\n\nthe regulatory expectations and requirements for green and sustainable banking for the consulting industry and other stakeholders; and\n\n# Stage three\n\nThe focus is on implementation, review and evaluation of the progress made by the banks in this regard.\n\nAt the international level, the Bank participates in a number of international organizations, including the Green Finance Network of central banks and regulators, the High-Level Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Risk under the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the Sustainable Finance Focus Group under the Banking Supervision Working Group under the Central Bank Conference for East Asia and the Pacific, and the International Sustainable Finance Platform. Through its participation in these international organizations, the Bank has the opportunity to contribute to the work of the central banking community and regulators on climate change, and to draw on the experience and perspectives of other regions in developing its local infrastructure.\n\nThe FSA also participates in several working groups under the Green Finance Network of central banks and regulators, including the Microsurveillance Working Group, the Macro Finance Working Group and the Green Finance Promotion Working Group. In addition, the FSA has joined two new working groups: the Research Working Group and the Supplementary Data Gateway Working Group. The Research Working Group is responsible for the relevant research work, while the Supplementary Data Gateway Working Group is aimed at developing a detailed list of data items needed but not currently available to regulatory authorities and financial institutions to assess climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\nIn November, the IFC launched the Alliance of Green Commercial Banks to assist banks in emerging markets in developing programs to address climate change. As a founding member and first regional executive director of the Alliance, the IFC is responsible for: (i) driving the development of green commercial banks in global financial markets; (ii) providing commercial banks with a platform for mutual learning and the knowledge, tools and business information needed to develop their own green finance roadmap and transform into a credible green bank; (iii) facilitating communication and exploring frontier issues to advance the global green agenda; and (iv) assisting members of the Alliance in capturing the estimated $2.3 trillion in emerging markets and green climate-related investment opportunities identified by IFCs over the next 10 years.\n\nIn addition to the work to help the government implement the government's green bond program, the KINGDAO has also jointly launched the Green and Sustainable Inter-Institutional Financial Institutions Supervisory Group (GIFSG) with the Securities and Futures Affairs Oversight Board (SFOB) to address regulatory and market development issues across the industry. For more information on the KINGDAO's work to develop Hong Kong as a green and sustainable financial hub over the coming years, see the chapter \"Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre\".\n\nThe Green and Sustainable Finance Interagency Steering Group\n\nThe task force was created in May by the Gold Authority and the Board of Trustees, with other members including the Environmental Bureau, the Financial Affairs and Treasury Board, the Hong Kong Trading and Settlement Company Limited, the Insurance Industry Regulatory Authority and the Mandatory Public Credit Scheme Authority.\n\nSince its inception, the Steering Group has established two technical task forces, each responsible for researching and handling cross-sectoral regulatory matters and coordinating cross-agency market development.\n\nThe Steering Group released its Green and Sustainable Finance Strategy in December, which proposes six ways to strengthen Hong Kong's financial ecosystem and build a greener and more sustainable future in the long run. The Steering Group also announced five short-term action plans to address some of the most pressing issues in the development process.\n\nThe Supervisory Group was established by the Board of Directors at a meeting held by the Board of Directors, with the President of the Board, Mr. Yu Weiyun (right) serving as the co-chair of the group.\n\nThe Steering Group released Hong Kong's Green and Sustainable Finance Strategic Plan and 5 Key Action Plans.\n\n#Responsible investing\n\nThe IDA supports responsible investing and incorporates environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into its investment activities. As a large-scale asset owner, the IDA is increasingly concerned with responsible investing, which will influence how its fund managers conduct their investment activities.\n\n# The beliefs of the Gold Council\n\nThe FSA believes that by appropriately emphasizing responsible investment and considering the sustainable long-term performance of individual investments, the investment objectives of the hedge fund will be more effectively met and ESG-related risks associated with the investment activity will be reduced.\n\n# The principles of the Gold Board\n\nAs a guiding principle adopted by the Gold Authority, ESG investments are generally considered to be of priority when the risk-adjusted long-term returns of other investment projects are comparable. As a responsible long-term investor, Gold Authority adopts the following responsible investment principles in the investment management process, as appropriate:\n\n# Fold in\n\nThe FSA believes that ESG factors have a significant impact on the long-term value of investment projects, and therefore incorporates ESG factors into the investment analysis process to identify risks and opportunities. The FSA incorporates ESG factors into the investment management process in both the public and private markets.\n\n# Take ownership of assets\n\nThe Board expects that outsourced investment managers will exercise ownership of assets through the exercise of voting rights and communication with the acquired investment company, thereby assisting the Board in fulfilling ownership responsibilities for the investment project.\n\n# Collaborate\n\nThe Board is committed to working with like-minded investors and regulators to promote good long-term investment management practices, and to attend public events and give presentations to share better ESG working practices and encourage the investment community to adopt responsible investment concepts.\n\nFor more information on the work of the KIM in responsible investment over the years, see the chapter \"Reserve Management\".\n\n# The KING Board, as an active responsible investor, monitors the ESG practices of outsourced investment managers\n\n#Golden Board's expectations\n\nThe SEC attaches great importance to the integration of ESG factors into investment decisions and the active exercise of ownership of assets. To this end, the SEC considers ESG factors when selecting and supervising the hiring of outsourced investment managers. Since the SEC considers the exercise of shareholder rights in the shares of listed companies held by the SEC to be a basic policy of maintaining the long-term value of investments, it requires hired investment managers to take the active exercise of ownership of assets seriously.\n\n#Government oversight\n\nThe SEC has systematically reviewed the ESG practices of the SEC in various areas, such as its ESG assessment structure, communication with the investment company it has acquired, and its work on proxy voting. The SEC selected several SEC-led investment managers in 2020 to conduct a communication program that not only evaluates their ESG performance, but also examines whether they are properly exercising their ownership rights on behalf of the SEC.\n\n# Communication is a win\n\nThe FSA has identified and followed up on the work of outsourced investment managers with problematic work methods through its program. Two examples are listed below.\n\n# Case number one\n\nThe Board noted that there was room for improvement in the ESG architecture of Equity Investment Managers A. In particular, a more systematic approach to evaluating the investee company should be established. The Board followed up with A. A. on this and then conducted a comprehensive company policy review to implement a more robust ESG architecture.\n\n# Case number two\n\nAfter examining the voting methods of equity investment manager B, the FSA found that B's voting policies were flawed in several areas and asked its ESG supervisor to review them. In particular, B has voted in favor of management's recommendations in the past, deviating from its own proxy voting guidelines. B subsequently promised to strengthen the company's voting policies to meet expectations, including increasing the participation of ESG team members and the possibility of voting against management when major governance issues are involved.\n\nIn private market investments, the Gold Authority is committed to working with the relevant investment partners on ESG issues through its dedicated partners, thereby implementing responsible investment. The Gold Authority is aware of the commitment of all dedicated partners to ESG, as they believe that this will help create long-term value for the investment partners and ensure the sustainability of the returns. The two examples listed below demonstrate that it is possible to manage climate change risk by integrating carbon reduction factors in the construction and operation of green and sustainable warehouses through i) design changes and the use of innovative operating technologies; and ii) reducing carbon emissions by reducing carbon emissions and avoiding harmful substances, while improving operational efficiency through cost and energy savings.\n\n(i) The Gold Regulatory Authority has invested in a pest control company that has adopted an environmental protection program. Although traditional pesticides and chemical products are effective in killing pests, failure to remove or properly dispose of insect carcasses will endanger public health. In addition, leakage and disposal of chemical components also cause environmental problems. The company's biologicide-free program reduces the use of harmful chemicals by installing a tracker. The company also uses a dynamic sensor connected to the Internet to remotely detect whether the pest has been captured.\n\n(ii) The Gold Authority has invested in green and sustainable warehouses. Although the construction industry is a major source of carbon emissions, the relevant warehouse developers have adopted a net zero carbon emission procedure in the construction and operation of their overall warehouses, and have developed standards and indicators to measure net zero carbon emission standards, and the building plans also take into account the sustainability of the materials and components used.\n\nThe carbon footprint associated with the warehouse construction is 25.8% lower than that of the general logistics building, according to the independent consultant's assessment.

My responsibilities under these standards are set out in the section \"Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of financial statements\" of this report. I am independent of the Group and have fulfilled other ethical responsibilities under these standards. I believe that the audit certificates I have obtained provide an adequate and appropriate basis for my audit opinion.\n\n# Key accounting issues\n\nThe critical audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, are of the greatest importance to the audit of the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020. These matters are handled by me in the course of auditing and forming opinions on the financial statements as a whole, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Other\n\nThe Financial Controller is responsible for all other information. The other information includes all information contained in the 2020 Annual Report of the Financial Controller, but does not include the financial statements and my auditor's report.\n\nI am not making any kind of expert opinion on the financial statements or any other material.\n\nWhereas, in the context of an audit of the financial statements, I am responsible for reading other material and thereby considering whether there is a material inconsistency with the financial statements or with the circumstances of which I became aware in the course of the audit, or whether there appears to be a material misstatement. Based on the work that I have performed, I am required to report the fact that if I believe that there is a material misstatement in other material. In this regard, I have no report.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Audit Committee under the Financial Management Committee and the OTC Advisory Committee\n\nThe financial controller shall be responsible for preparing the financial statements of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Chartered Accountants and the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under Article 7 of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange Fund Regulations, and for implementing the internal controls he deems necessary to ensure that the financial statements do not contain material misstatements caused by fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing financial statements, the financial manager shall be responsible for assessing the Group's ability to operate in a sustainable manner and, where applicable, for disclosing matters related to sustainable operation and taking account of sustainable operation as a basis for accounting.\n\nThe Audit Committee, under the auspices of the Advisory Committee of the Overseas Fund, is responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process of the group.\n\n# Accountability of auditors for auditing financial statements\n\nMy objective is to obtain reasonable assurance that there are no material misstatements in the overall financial statements that result from fraud or error and to issue an auditor's report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but it is not guaranteed that an audit conducted in accordance with the audit standards of the Audit Bureau of Circulations will reveal any material misstatements that exist. Misstatements can be caused by fraud or error and are considered to be material misstatements if it is reasonably expected that, individually or in aggregate, they could affect the economic decisions made by users of the financial statements.\n\nI will also: - identify and evaluate the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements resulting from fraud or error; design and implement audit procedures to address those risks; and obtain adequate and appropriate audit certificates as a basis for my opinion. - assess the financial statements and the financial statements of the auditors and the audit team as a whole, to determine whether the audit team is aware of the structure and disclosure of the audit activities involved; - continue to be responsible for the disclosure of information relevant to the audit; - maintain the auditors' ability to obtain the necessary information from the auditors and the audit team, to continue to employ the audit committee's audit policy, and to obtain appropriate and adequate audit certificates and financial statements, and to determine whether the audit committee is competent to assess the financial statements and the financial statements of the auditors and the audit team, if the audit committee considers that the audit committee's opinion is not based on the existence of material material information relevant to the audit activity and to determine whether the audit committee's opinion is based on the disclosure of material information relevant to the audit activity; - be responsible for the continuing use of the audit committee's audit policy, to obtain adequate and adequate audit evidence as a basis for my opinion, and to determine whether the financial statements are material and whether the financial statements of the audit activity involved, and, and, or are not, and, or are, material, or are, reflective or are, material, or are, material or are not, material or are, or are, or are not, or are, or are, or are not, or are, or are, or are not; - to be included in the financial statements, or are included in the financial statements, or are not, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are\n\nI communicate with the audit committee under the advisory board of the hedge fund the scope and timing of the audit plan and the significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal controls that I identify during the audit.\n\nI will also make a statement to the Audit Committee under the auspices of the Advisory Committee on Outer Banks that I have met the relevant ethical requirements for independence and communicate to them all relationships and other matters that are reasonably believed to affect my independence and, where applicable, the relevant safeguards.\n\nFrom my communications with the audit committee under the advisory committee of the OTC Funds, I determine which matters are most important to the audit of the financial statements for the current period and therefore constitute critical audit matters. I describe these matters in the auditor's report unless the law or regulation does not permit public disclosure of a matter, or in extremely rare circumstances where there is a reasonable expectation that the negative consequences of communicating a matter in my report will outweigh the public interest it generates and I decide not to communicate the matter in the report.\n\nThe Director of the Audit Office, Jun Jian\n\nThe first of April 2021\n\n#1 Primary business\n\nThe Financial Management Officer is empowered by the Director of Finance to manage the Fund in accordance with the provisions of the Fund Regulations, Chapter 66, and the Fund's principal function is to safeguard the Hong Kong dollar's exchange rate and maintain the stability of the monetary and financial system of Hong Kong.\n\nThe assets of the fund are managed by four different groups: the Support Group, the Investment Group, the Long-Term Growth Group and the Strategic Asset Group. Under the Hong Kong Monetary Authority system, the assets of the Support Group are fully matched to the monetary base. The Investment Group primarily invests in the bond and stock markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The Long-Term Growth Group holds private equity and real estate investments. The Strategic Asset Group holds shares of Hong Kong limited companies that are included in the fund's books and are purchased for government policy purposes by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR).\n\n#2 Main accounting policies\n\n# 2.1 Statement of compliance with the rules\n\nThis financial statement is prepared in accordance with the Financial Reporting Standards of Hong Kong (hereinafter referred to as the \"Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards\" or \"HKF Standards\"), Hong Kong Accounting Standards and Interpretations, and the Hong Kong Principles of Accepted Accounting of the Hong Kong Institute of Chartered Accountants. The following is a summary of the main accounting policies adopted by the Fund and its affiliates (collectively, the \"Group\").\n\nThe Hong Kong Society of Accountants has issued a number of new or revised Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards that are effective or available for early adoption for the first time in the Group's current financial year. Changes in accounting policies for the current and previous financial years that result from the Group's first adoption of the applicable standards are reflected in these financial statements, as set out in Appendix 3.\n\n#2.2 The criteria for the preparation of financial statements\n\nThe financial statements of the group include the financial statements of the group and the group's interests in the joint ventures and associates. The main activities of the main subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are listed in Appendices 17 and 18.\n\nThe following assets and liabilities are excluded from the financial statements as measured at cost: - derivatives (Note 2.6), - financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value for the purposes of the statement of profit and loss (Note 2.6), - financial assets measured at fair value for other comprehensive income (Note 2.6), - gold (Note 2.10), and - investment property (Note 2.11).\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standard requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the presentation of accounting policies on receipts and assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Such estimates and related assumptions are made on the basis of past experience and other factors considered appropriate in the relevant circumstances. In the absence of other available data, such estimates and assumptions are used as a basis for judging the book value of assets and liabilities, and the estimated results may differ from the actual value.\n\nSuch estimates and related assumptions shall be subject to periodic review and revision. Revisions that affect only the current period shall be confirmed during the period, but revisions that affect the current and future periods shall be confirmed during the period and the future period.\n\nThe management's judgments on the material impact of the adoption of the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standard on the financial statements and the principal sources of estimated uncertainty are disclosed in Appendix 2.19.\n\nSome of the comparative figures for 2019 have been reclassified to reflect the presentation of the Group's financial statements for the current year.\n\n# 2.3 Affiliates and Non-Controlling Shareholders\n\nSubsidiary means an entity controlled by a group. If the group bears the risk or enjoys the rights to the floating return related to its participation in the operation of the entity and has the ability to exercise power over the entity to affect such return, it has control over the entity. Only the substantive rights held by the group and other parties are considered in assessing whether the group has power."}

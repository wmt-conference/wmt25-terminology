{"en": "# Chief Executive’s Statement\n\nThe year 2021 was a year of concurrent consolidation and development.\n\nIn 2021, the pandemic entered its second year unabated: global supply chains were disrupted, inflation pressures were on the rise, risk of premature tightening of global financial conditions increased.  Adding to the unpredictability were the emergence of mutant variants of COVID-19 and the intensification of geopolitical tensions.  Despite such a macro environment filled with uncertainties, we continued to safeguard monetary and financial stability and maintain operational resilience.\n\n2021 also brought hope for recovery with the successful rollout of COVID-19 vaccines together with the accommodative monetary and fiscal policies introduced in multiple economies.  The global economy began to recover from the severe contraction in 2020.  Locally, after having endured economic contraction in 2019 and 2020, the Hong Kong economy grew by 6.3% in 2021, thanks to the rollout of the vaccination programme and the Government’s pandemic relief measures which have lent crucial support to our economic recovery.\n\nWith financial and monetary stability maintained, as well as a steadying macro environment, 2021 gave us some room to pursue more development work.  We seized the opportunity and pressed ahead with developmental initiatives that will help our financial sector remain highly competitive. Significant progress has been made across our three strategic priorities, namely fintech, green finance and Mainland market opportunities arising from Hong Kong’s gateway role.\n\nAs we entered 2022, the global environment took a turn for the worse.  But as the saying goes, when the going gets tough, the tough get going.  We will continue to be proactive and pursue our developmental goals and priorities to be better prepared for the next challenge and to cement our status as an international financial centre.  We will also remain steadfast in our commitment to ensure the soundness of Hong Kong monetary and financial systems, as we have risen to the many challenges time and again as in the past.\n\n# Monetary and financial stability: foundation of an international financial centre\n\nSince its establishment in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has been a strong anchor of Hong Kong’s financial system and has helped Hong Kong withstand numerous shocks and challenges.  Despite the lingering uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and market concerns about the pace of US monetary tightening, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to function in an orderly manner throughout the year, reflecting the robustness of the LERS.\n\nThis confidence in our systems did not happen overnight, but is based on the solid foundation which has been built up over the years.  In its 2021 External Sector Report, the International Monetary Fund once again reiterated that the credibility of the LERS has been assured by a transparent set of rules, ample fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy, and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nThe confidence is also a result of our efforts in public and market engagement, as well as effective surveillance.  On the latter, we have leveraged technology and data analytics to strengthen our capability for more timely and comprehensive analysis on financial stability and macroprudential surveillance.\n\nThe robustness of the banking system is of paramount importance to financial stability in Hong Kong.  Two years into the COVID-19 pandemic, our banks remained resilient with liquidity positions and capitalisation faring very well by international standards.  As at end-2021, the capital adequacy ratio of local banks stood at 20.2%, well above the minimum requirement of 8%, while the average Liquidity Coverage Ratio of large banks was 151.9% in the fourth quarter of 2021, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 100%.  Despite a challenging credit landscape amid the pandemic, the asset quality of the banking sector remained largely stable during the year. The classified loan ratio of the industry was 0.88% at the end of 2021, down from 0.90% at the end of 2020, well below the long-run historical average of 1.8% since 2000.\n\n# Banking sector: a pillar of support to the economy\n\nAs always, the banking sector is an important pillar of support to economic activity.  This is ever more crucial in the face of economic fallout from the COVID-19 outbreak.  In the past year, a main challenge was to strike a balance between managing credit risk in the banking sector and maintaining the sector’s support for the real economy.  With our supervisory work over the years, banks continued to manage credit risks effectively.  At the same time, we worked closely with banks to provide the much needed relief to corporate and personal customers through the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme (PPPHS) and other relief measures.  The PPPHS, launched together with the Banking Sector Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) Lending Coordination Mechanism in 2020 allowing eligible corporate customers to defer loan principal payments by six months on a pre-approval basis, was again further extended twice during 2021 until April 2022 recognising that some economic sectors were still hard-pressed by the lingering pandemic and were in need of continued credit relief.  Subsequently, in light of a resurgence of local coronavirus infections, in February 2022, the PPPHS was further extended until the end of October 2022.  It is encouraging to see that the banking sector has joined forces with the HKMA to help relieve cash-flow pressures on corporate and individual borrowers, even whilst the sector itself is experiencing its own difficult operating conditions due to the outbreak of the pandemic.\n\nApart from the challenging credit landscape, the pandemic also brought about a more difficult operating environment and a digital landscape with escalating cyber threat. We have stepped up our efforts to enhance operational and cyber resilience of the banking sector, as well as consumer and investor protection amid increasing digitalisation and a surge in phishing scams.  In particular, the Code of Banking Practice was revised to enhance consumer protection in digital financial services.\n\nBesides supervisory work, we are dedicated to promoting financial inclusion and customer-centric culture in the banking sector.  Enhancing accessibility to banking services by customers in need has been one of our priority areas and we have been working closely with the industry to develop industry guidelines.  Further to the guidance on barrier-free banking services and provision of banking services for persons with intellectual disabilities, the industry, with the support of the HKMA, published in December 2021 a guideline to set out the principles and good practices for the banking industry in providing banking services to persons with dementia and customers in need.\n\nTo support the continued development of the banking sector in the future where the new growth opportunities and challenges require a new set of skills from the workforce, the HKMA has formulated a holistic talent development strategy — “Connecting Talent to the Future” — to groom future talent and upskill existing practitioners in a more systematic and targeted manner.  Our new strategy is built on three “connect” directions: connecting students to the banking industry, connecting practitioners to the future of banking, and connecting the key stakeholders together to enhance collaboration in implementing the strategy.  We have launched a series of outreach and promotional campaigns to attract more students to enter the banking industry. To better prepare university students to be “future ready”, we have launched the Future Banking Bridging Programme jointly with the Hong Kong Institute of Bankers, which comprises a series of courses that cover practical banking knowledge and useful soft skills that are highly in demand in the banking industry.  For the existing banking practitioners, we have been working closely with the industry on developing opportunities for upskilling through providing more in-demand training programmes.  In December 2021, the new Fintech module under the Enhanced Competency Framework for banking practitioners was launched.\n\nFinancial talent is crucial to the future development of Hong Kong as an international financial centre.  We will work hand in hand with all stakeholders with a view to strengthening the talent pool for the further development of the industry.\n\n# International financial centre: strong position underpinned by an unparalleled access to opportunities\n\nThe competitiveness of Hong Kong as an international financial centre is underpinned by the unparalleled access to opportunities it offers.  There is general consensus that global fintech adoption, opening-up of Mainland’s financial markets, and the mainstreaming of green and sustainable finance present huge opportunities for the future development of Hong Kong’s financial sector.  At the HKMA, we have dedicated substantial efforts in leveraging Hong Kong’s unique edge to capture these opportunities.  Let me talk about the fintech and Mainland opportunities first.\n\n# Comprehensive adoption of fintech\n\nThe pandemic has clearly demonstrated the power of fintech and permanently changed customers’ behaviour towards financial services.  To make sure we continue to stay at the forefront of the global fintech scene and are ready to tap all of the potential of fintech, we must build an ecosystem where the value of fintech is experienced across all levels and by all groups of people.\n\nThis vision has driven us to formulate a new strategy, “Fintech 2025”, which was unveiled in June 2021.  As its name suggests, it aspires to help the financial sector adopt technology comprehensively by 2025.  The strategy comprises five focus areas which cover the required elements to achieve a successful ecosystem, and also the right factors for the ecosystem to grow further in a virtuous cycle. The first two parts of the strategy, namely “all banks go fintech” and “future-proofing Hong Kong for Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)” mainly sought to create more demand for fintech adoption.  The other parts of the strategy relate to data, infrastructure, talent and funding, which are vital to the growth of the ecosystem.\n\nUnder this strategy, a number of new initiatives were introduced, such as the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) fintech pilot trial facility which allows financial institutions and technology firms to conduct pilot trials and obtain early feedback from regulators and users on their cross-boundary fintech initiatives, and the pilot launch of the Commercial Data Interchange which leverages the use of alternative data to facilitate SME financing.  We have also stepped up research on the application of wholesale CBDC to cross-border payments, and explored the prospect of e-HKD, which will increase Hong Kong’s readiness in terms of adopting CBDCs and in turn future-proof our city’s financial infrastructure in the decades ahead.\n\nWhile we capitalise on the new opportunities presented by technological advancement, we also continue to build on our existing achievements as well as watch out for new risks that may arise.  For example, the Faster Payment System (FPS) introduced in 2018 has grown rapidly over the years, with the number of registrations reaching 9.6 million at the end of 2021, up 40% year on year.  The average daily turnover also increased 90% from 2020, reaching about 673,000 real-time transactions in 2021.  Meanwhile, in view of the rapid development of crypto-assets particularly payment-related stablecoins, we have issued a discussion paper earlier this year to invite market feedback on the development of an appropriate regulatory framework.\n\nOur new, forward-thinking strategy will set the scene for a healthy growth of the fintech ecosystem.  As the banking sector increasingly adopts fintech to capture the opportunities it offers, this will ultimately benefit both financial institutions and Hong Kong people, while strengthening Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre.\n\n# Hong Kong as the dominant gateway to the Mainland\n\nHong Kong has always played a strategic role in linking the Mainland market with international financial markets, providing international investors with a familiar regime and platform to conduct various kinds of financial, investment and wealth management activities.  The National 14th Five-Year Plan strengthens Hong Kong’s position as an international financial centre, a global offshore renminbi business hub, as well as asset management and risk management centres. This together with global economic trends has reinforced our conviction that Hong Kong should continue to enhance its unique value as a bridge connecting the Mainland and international markets.\n\nIn 2021, we reached a milestone in enhancing connectivity, adding two new members to our family of Connect schemes, namely the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) Scheme in the GBA, and Southbound Trading under Bond Connect, essentially completing the two-way loop of mutual access in a wide spectrum of financial markets including equities, debts and wealth management.  The launch of the two schemes will bring new opportunities for Hong Kong in various aspects. By meeting the increasing diversification needs of Mainland investors, the two schemes will enlarge the customer base of our bond market and wealth management industry.  I am pleased to see that these two schemes have been operating smoothly.  The HKMA will continue to engage the Mainland authorities to further enhance these schemes over time.", "zh": "首席执行官的声明\n\n2021年是巩固和发展的一年.\n\n2021年,全球供应链受到了破坏,通货膨胀压力不断上升,全球金融状况过早收紧的风险增加.加上不可预测性的是COVID-19突变变种的出现和地缘政治紧张局势的加剧.尽管充满了不确定性的宏观环境,我们继续维护货币和金融稳定性并保持运营性.\n\n2021年,随着COVID-19疫苗的成功推出,全球经济开始从严重的缩中恢复.在2019年和2020年经历经济缩后,由于疫苗接种计划和政府的疫情救济措施,香港经济增长了6.3%.\n\n随着金融和货币稳定,我们在2021年获得了更多发展工作的空间.我们抓住了机会,并推进了发展举措,帮助我们的金融部门保持高度竞争力.在我们的三个战略优先事项中取得了重大进展,即金融科技,绿色金融和来自香港的门户市场机会.\n\n随着我们进入2022年,全球环境变得更糟糕.但正如人们所说,当事情变得艰难时,我们将继续积极追求我们的发展目标和优先事项,以便更好地应对下一个挑战,并巩固我们作为国际金融中心的地位.我们还将坚定地确保香港的货币和金融系统,因为我们已经一再应对了许多挑战.\n\n# 货币和金融稳定:建立一个国际金融中心\n\n自1983年建立以来,联汇汇率系统一直是香港金融体系的坚固支柱,帮助香港应对众多冲击和挑战.尽管COVID-19大流行和市场对美国货币紧缩的速度存在不确定性,但香港美元汇率和货币市场在全年持续运行,反映了LERS的稳健性.\n\n国际货币基金组织在2021年外部部门报告中再次重申,透明的规则,充足的财政和外汇储备,强有力的金融监管和监督,灵活的经济和审慎的财政框架确保了LERS的可信性.\n\n信心也是我们在公众和市场参与以及有效监督方面所做的努力的结果.在后者方面,我们利用了技术和数据分析来加强我们对金融稳定和宏观审慎监督的及时和全面分析的能力.\n\n银行体系的稳定性对香港的金融稳定至关重要.在COVID-19大流行的两年里,我们的银行保持了弹性,流动性状况和资本化水平非常符合国际标准.截至2021年底,当地银行资本充足率为20.2%,远高于最低要求的8%,而2021年第四季度大银行的平均流动性覆盖率为151.9%,也远高于法定最低要求的100%.尽管在疫情中存在挑战性的信贷环境,但银行业的资产质量在一年中基本保持稳定.该行业的分类贷款比率在2021年底为0.88%,低于2020年底的0.90%,远低于2000年以来的1.8%的长期历史平均水平.\n\n银行业:经济支柱\n\n银行业务是经济活动的重要支柱.在过去的一年里,银行业务的支是很有效的.同时,我们与银行业务合作,通过预先批准的支付计划以及其他支付措施,进一步帮助企业支付贷款.\n\n除了具有挑战性的信贷环境,我们还带来了更为艰难的运营环境和数字风景,以加强银行业的运营和网络弹性,以及在数字化和网络诈事件中提高消费者的保护.\n\n除了监督工作,我们致力于促进银行业的包容性和以客户为中心的文化.提高需要的客户对银行服务的访问性是我们的优先事项之一,我们一直与行业合作制定行业指南.除了对无障碍银行服务和为智障人士提供银行服务的指导之外,行业在HKMA的支持下,于2021年12月发布了一份指南,为银行业提供智障人士和需要的客户的银行服务.\n\n为了支持未来的银行业务,我们与香港银行业务协会共同制定了\"未来银行业务计划\",该计划包括一系列涵盖银行业务的知识和实践技能.\n\n金融人才对于香港作为国际金融中心的未来发展至关重要.我们将与所有利益相关方携手合作,以加强人才库,进一步发展行业.\n\n#国际金融中心:强大的地位,有着无与伦比的机会.\n\n作为国际金融中心,香港的竞争力在于它所提供的机会.普遍认为,全球金融技术的采用,大陆金融市场的开放以及绿色和可持续金融的普及,为香港金融业的未来发展带来了巨大的机遇.在香港金融管理局,我们致力于利用香港独特的优势,抓住这些机遇.让我先谈谈金融技术和大陆的机遇.\n\n#全面采用金融科技\n\n疫情清楚地表明了金融科技的力量,并永久改变了客户对金融服务的态度.为了确保我们继续保持全球金融科技的领先地位,并准备充分利用金融科技的潜力,我们必须建立一个金融科技的生态系统,让所有人能够体验到金融科技的价值.\n\n这一愿景促使我们制定了新的战略\"金融科技2025\",于2021年6月推出.正如其名称所示,它旨在帮助金融部门在2025年之前全面采用技术.该战略包括五个重点领域,涵盖了实现成功生态系统所需的要素,以及生态系统在良性循环中进一步增长的正确因素.战略的前两个部分,即\"所有银行都采用金融科技\"和\"对中央银行数字货币 (CBDC) 提供未来防范的香港\",主要旨在创造更多对金融科技采用需求.战略的其他部分与生态系统增长至关重要的数据,基础设施,人才和资金有关.\n\n根据这一战略,我们推出了一些新举措,例如广东-香港-澳门大湾区 (GBA) 金融科技试点设施,该设施允许金融机构和技术公司进行试点试验,并从监管机构和用户那里获得跨境金融科技举措的早期反,以及利用替代数据促进中小企业融资的商业数据交换试点启动.我们还加强了对批发CBDC用于跨境支付的研究,并探索了e-HKD的前景,这将增加香港在采用CBDC方面的准备,从而使我们的城市在未来几十年内提供金融基础设施.\n\n虽然我们利用了技术进步带来的新机遇,但我们也继续建立在现有成就的基础上,并警可能出现的新风险.例如,2018年推出的快速支付系统,注册人数在2021年底达到960万,同比增长了40%.与此同时,鉴于加密资产特别是支付相关的稳定币的快速发展,我们今年早些时候发布了讨论文件,邀请加密市场对适当的监管框架的发展做出反.\n\n我们的新前性战略将为金融科技生态系统的健康发展奠定基础.随着银行业越来越多地采用金融科技,这最终将使金融机构和香港人民受益,同时加强香港作为国际金融中心的竞争力.\n\n香港是大陆的重要门户\n\n香港一直在与国际金融市场联系,为国际投资者提供熟悉的制度和平台,加强香港作为国际金融中心,全球人民币商业中心的地位.这与全球经济趋势相结合,加强了我们对香港作为连接大陆和国际市场的独特价值观的认识.\n\n2021年,我们在增强连接方面取得了里程碑式的成绩,为我们的连接计划家族增加了两个新成员,即GBA的跨境财富管理连接计划 (Cross-border WMC) 和Bond Connect下的南方交易,基本上完成了在股票,债务和财富管理等广泛的金融市场中相互访问的双向循环.这两个计划的推出将在各个方面为香港带来新的机会.通过满足内地投资者的日益增长的多元化需求,这两个计划将扩大我们债券市场和财富管理行业的客户群体.我很高兴看到这两个计划一直在顺利运行.HKMA将继续与内地当局进行接触,以进一步加强这些计划."}

{"en": "# Priorities for 2022 and Beyond\n\nGlobal and local conditions deteriorated notably entering 2022. On the one hand, the escalation of the Ukraine situation and expectations of rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve triggered market volatility. On the other hand, the local economy took a hit from the new wave of COVID-19 pandemic. That said, Hong Kong’s financial system remains well-positioned to withstand adverse shocks given its resilience and buffers built up over the years. Looking ahead, the HKMA will continue to attach high importance to safeguarding monetary and financial stability. In doing so, we will endeavour to stay ahead of the curve by identifying emerging risks and responding to them in an agile manner. At the same time, the HKMA will seek opportunities that would help bolster Hong Kong’s status as a leading international financial centre. In managing the Exchange Fund in this complicated investment environment, the HKMA will continue to invest prudently, while remaining flexible, implementing defensive measures as appropriate, and maintaining a high degree of liquidity.\n\n# STABILITY AND INTEGRITY OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM\n\nThe global economic outlook remains subject to significant uncertainties.  The HKMA will keep abreast of latest developments and stay vigilant against potential risks, with the aim of upholding the resilience and stability of the financial system, which are essential for the ongoing provision of critical financial services that support the functioning of the Hong Kong economy.\n\n# Staying vigilant against potential risks\n\nLooking ahead, markets may be subject to heightened volatilities amid increased uncertainties on various fronts. On the one hand, the US Federal Reserve’s monetary policy normalisation, if continuing at a fast pace, may tighten global financial conditions visibly ahead and increase the global debt-servicing burden.  On the other hand, following the escalation of the Ukraine situation in early 2022, geopolitical uncertainties including the China–US tension may continue to stay high and trigger bouts of financial market volatility again.  Last but not least, with the evolving pandemic developments, there might be a potential downside scenario where lockdowns were to be re-imposed at a large scale, leading to persistent global supply bottlenecks and adversely affecting global growth and inflation.  Having said that, Hong Kong’s financial system is well-positioned to withstand adverse shocks given the resilience and buffers built up over the years.  The HKMA also has the capability, resources and commitment to safeguard Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nThe HKMA will continue to closely monitor risks and vulnerabilities in the domestic and external environments and stand ready to deploy appropriate measures where necessary to maintain Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. Research programmes in 2022 will study issues affecting the Hong Kong economy and assess their potential risks. Meanwhile, the HKMA’s ongoing Digitalisation Programme will help enhance its surveillance capabilities to support more holistic surveillance and comprehensive analysis of the financial system.\n\n# Maintaining banking stability\n\nAs developed markets tighten monetary policies and the impact of the pandemic lingers, the credit landscape facing the banking sector is expected to remain challenging. At the same time, rapid technological advancement and digitalisation present both opportunities and challenges to the banking sector.  Facing an ever-changing financial landscape, the HKMA strives to ensure banks’ ability to withstand shocks through its ongoing supervisory efforts. At the same time, the HKMA will also continue to enhance and refine its banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account international standards and best practices.\n\n# A risk-based supervisory focus\n\n# Credit risk\n\nIn 2022, the HKMA will step up the surveillance of banks’ credit risk exposures and take proactive steps to ensure that overall risk levels remain well contained.\n\nThe HKMA will also continue to monitor the development of the pandemic and its effect on the operating conditions of corporates, as well as maintain close dialogue with the banking and commercial sectors while keeping the various relief measures under review.\n\n# Operational and technology risks\n\nWith the issuance of the new Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module on “Operational Resilience” in May 2022, the HKMA will continue to engage the industry and understand authorized institutions’ (AIs’) progress in developing their operational resilience frameworks.  In parallel, the HKMA will seek to raise the banking sector’s cyber resilience by following up with AIs on issues revealed by the assessments under the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 and monitoring AIs’ implementation of secure tertiary data backup.  Another key supervisory focus will be evaluating and addressing the risks from AIs’ growing dependency on technology service providers.\n\nWith enhanced digital capabilities and extensive remote working experience accumulated during the pandemic, some AIs are planning to transition to a hybrid working model on a business-as-usual basis.  The HKMA will keep track of this development and assess whether the associated risks are adequately addressed by the industry.\n\n# Liquidity and market risks\n\nThe HKMA will focus on the supervision of AIs’ liquidity and market risk management in 2022.  In particular, the HKMA will continue to monitor AIs’ progress in transitioning away from the remaining London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) settings before these settings cease to be published by 30 June 2023.\n\n# Combating money laundering and terrorist financing\n\nIn 2022, the HKMA’s work on anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) will continue to focus on strengthening response to fraud and financial crime through collaboration and information sharing, pursuing closer co-operation with various stakeholders in the AML/CFT ecosystem.  Other priorities are to implement a wider range of risk-sensitive supervisory techniques, by leveraging enhanced data and supervisory technology (Suptech) capabilities, and promote the use of Regtech by banks, including transaction monitoring systems.\n\nThe HKMA will also keep working closely with the Government, the banking and stored value facility (SVF) sectors to publish an updated Hong Kong money laundering and terrorist financing risk assessment, and assist the industry in combatting new and emerging risks.  Work will also continue on understanding evolving money laundering and terrorist financing risks, implementing changes to AML law and related guidance to align with international standards, and maintaining proactive engagement with other regulators and international standard setters.\n\n# Wealth management and mandatory provident fund-related businesses\n\nIn 2022, the HKMA will carry out on-site examinations and off-site surveillance of AIs’ conduct in relation to wealth management and the selling of securities, mandatory provident fund (MPF) and other investment and insurance products, with a focus on the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) Scheme in the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area, digital advisory platforms, complex products, virtual assets and non-investment-linked long term insurance products.\n\nWhile maintaining close communication with other regulators and the banking industry, the HKMA will provide further guidance on regulatory standards in relation to the sale of investment, insurance and MPF products.  This will cover, among other things, investment services related to virtual assets and the selling of Protection Linked Plans, a new subset of investment-linked assurance scheme products with high level of insurance protection.  The HKMA, the Insurance Authority and the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority will jointly launch a mystery shopping programme on the selling practices of intermediaries in respect of Qualifying Deferred Annuity Policies and Tax-deductible Voluntary Contributions.\n\nFollowing the smooth launch of the Cross-boundary WMC, the HKMA will continue engaging the industry and relevant regulatory authorities to enhance the scheme.\n\nMoreover, the HKMA will embark on preparation work for supervising AIs’ trust business under a new SPM module and a new Code of Practice.\n\n# Oversight of financial market infrastructures\n\nThe HKMA will continue to promote the safety and efficiency of the financial market infrastructures (FMIs) under its oversight, in accordance with the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO), the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMI)1, and the various guidances issued by the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI).  It will fine-tune the FMI oversight framework taking into account the latest technological and market developments.\n\nThe HKMA will work with the FMIs on their observance of the PFMI, conducting and updating assessments as appropriate. In addition, the HKMA will continue to participate in the CPMI-IOSCO PFMI implementation monitoring and assessment exercise.  The HKMA will also participate in the work of international standard setting bodies and strengthen its oversight requirements in response to market and technology developments and in line with international practices.  The HKMA will work with relevant authorities to further strengthen co-operative oversight arrangements where appropriate.\n\n# Policy development\n\nThe HKMA will continue to enhance and refine its banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account international standards and best practices.\n\n# Implementation of Basel standards in Hong Kong\n\n# Capital standards\n\nThe HKMA will continue to enhance the capital framework with the implementation of the standards published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) in recent years, which include the following:\n\nThe Capital Requirements for Banks’ Equity Investments in Funds of December 2013 (EIF standard), which will come into effect on 1 July 2022 with the Banking (Capital) (Amendment) Rules 2022 commencing operation after negative vetting by the Legislative Council.\n\nThe revised capital standards set out in the Basel III Finalising Post-crisis Reforms of December 2017, the Minimum Capital Requirements for Market Risk of January 2019 (revised in February 2019), and the Targeted Revisions to the Credit Valuation Adjustment Risk Framework of July 2020, which are collectively referred to as the “Basel III final reform package”.  These revised capital standards set out the revised capital treatment of credit risk, market risk, credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk and operational risk, introduce an output floor requirement, and enhance the leverage ratio framework.  Amendments to the Banking (Capital) Rules (BCR) are being prepared in consultation with the industry with a view to them taking effect from 1 July 2023 as minimum requirements (except for those on market risk and CVA risk2).\n\nGiven that the capital treatment for sovereign concentration risk under the BCR was designed to complement the Basel Committee’s large exposure framework as implemented by the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules, the HKMA will propose amendments to the capital rules in parallel with relevant changes to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules.\n\n# Exposure limits\n\nThe HKMA will continue its work on the proposed amendments to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules in consultation with the industry and the Department of Justice with a target implementation date aligned with the one for the Basel III final reform package, i.e. 1 July 2023.\n\n# Disclosure standards\n\nNew or revised disclosure requirements associated with the revised capital standards in the Basel III final reform package are mainly set out in the Pillar 33 Disclosure Requirements – Updated Framework and the Revisions to Market Risk Disclosure Requirements, published by the Basel Committee in December 2018 and November 2021 respectively.  The Basel Committee also published the Revisions to Leverage Ratio Disclosure Requirements in June 2019 amending the disclosure requirements for leverage ratio to address concerns regarding potential “window-dressing” (i.e. banks reducing the volumes of certain transactions around reporting dates to artificially inflate their leverage ratios for reporting and public disclosure).  Corresponding amendments to the Banking (Disclosure) Rules to implement these new or revised disclosure requirements are also being prepared, with a view to having them take effect in Hong Kong along the same timelines as their associated revised capital standards.\n\n# Other supervisory policies and risk management guidelines\n\nTo reflect developments in regulatory requirements and international standards, the HKMA plans to update certain SPM modules, including those relevant to the implementation of the revised capital and disclosure standards in the Basel III final reform package, “Countercyclical Capital Buffer – Approach to its Implementation”, “Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book”, “New Share Subscription and Share Margin Financing” and “Stress Testing”.  The HKMA will also continue to work on the revised SPM modules on “Code of Conduct” and “Reporting Requirements Relating to Authorized Institutions’ External Auditors under the Banking Ordinance”, with an aim to finalising the revisions within 2022. Consequential to the proposed amendments to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules, the related Code of Practice and SPM modules, e.g. CR-G-8 on “Large Exposures and Risk Concentrations” and CR-G-9 on “Exposures to Connected Parties”, will be updated accordingly.", "zh": "#2022年及以后的优先事项\n\n香港金融局的情况是这样的:一方面,乌克兰的情况和美国联邦储备局的预期导致市场波动.另一方面,香港金融局的金融体系仍然处于承受不利影响的状态,因为它具有弹性,并采取了高水平的流动性措施.\n\n# 金融体系的稳定和完整性\n\n全球经济前景仍存在重大不确定性.香港管理局将跟上最新的发展,并保持警,以维护金融体系的弹性和稳定性,这些都是为支持香港经济运转的关键服务提供必不可少的.\n\n# 保持警,防止潜在的风险\n\n未来,市场可能会出现更多的不稳定,因为中国的经济已经被压倒.\n\n香港管理局将继续密切监测国内外的风险和脆弱性,并随时准备采取适当的措施来维持香港的货币和金融稳定性.\n\n# 保持银行稳定\n\n随着发达市场收紧货币政策,疫情的影响仍在持续,银行业面临的信贷环境预计将继续充满挑战.与此同时,快速的技术进步和数字化为银行业带来了机遇和挑战.面对不断变化的金融环境,HKMA致力于通过其持续的监管努力确保银行业的监管和监管框架和政策得到加强和完善.\n\n# 基于风险的监管重点\n\n# 信用风险\n\n在2022年,HKMA将加强对银行信用风险的监督,并采取积极措施确保整体风险水平保持在适当的控制之下.\n\n香港管理局将继续监测疫情的发展及其对企业的运营条件的影响,并与银行和商业部门保持密切联系,同时对各种救济措施进行审查.\n\n# 运营和技术风险\n\n随着2022年5月发布新的\"监管政策手册\" (SPM) 模块\"运营弹性\",香港金融管理局将继续与行业接触,了解授权机构 (AI) 在开发运营弹性框架方面的进展.与此同时,香港金融管理局将通过跟踪AI在网络弹性评估框架2.0下评估发现的问题,并监测AI实施安全第三级数据备份,来提高银行业的网络弹性.另一个关键的监管重点将是评估和解决AI对技术服务提供商日益增长的依赖造成的风险.\n\n随着数字化能力的提高和在疫情期间积累的大量远程工作经验,一些AI正在计划在正常情况下转向混合工作模式.

{"en": "# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nWith strong merchandise exports, reviving domestic demand and a boost from the Government’s supportive policy measures, the Hong Kong economy resumed positive growth in 2021, reversing the contraction experienced during 2019 and 2020. The labour market also improved, and inflation remained moderate albeit having edged up. While economic recovery is expected to continue after the fifth wave of COVID-19 subsides, its strength and speed are subject to uncertainties and risks, especially those surrounding the pandemic and the path of US monetary policy normalisation.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Real activities\n\nDriven by strong merchandise exports and improving domestic demand, the Hong Kong economy grew by 6.3% in 2021, ending the economic contraction in 2019 and 2020 (Table 1 and Chart 1).  Private consumption recovered, thanks to improved labour market conditions and a boost from the Government’s Consumption Voucher Scheme1. Overall investment spending also rebounded as the business environment and outlook improved2.  Externally, HongKong’s exports of goods saw strong growth for the whole year, in part supported by the continued global economic recovery.  Export of services recorded modest growth, reflecting active regional trade and cargo flows as well as stronger cross-border business and financial activities. Total imports rose appreciably, mainly because of greater domestic and re-export-induced demand.  On a net basis, external trade contributed positively to real gross domestic product (GDP) growth in 2021 (Chart 1) as total exports grew faster than imports.\n\nTable 1 Real GDP growth by expenditure component (period-over-period)\n\nNote: The seasonally-adjusted quarter-on-quarter rates of change in the gross domestic fixed capital formation are not available. Source: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Inflation\n\nInflationary pressures edged up but remained moderate during the year.  Netting out the effects of the Government’s one-off relief measures, the year-on-year underlying inflation rate3 picked up gradually to a mild 1.4% in December (Chart 2)4.  Prices of consumer items such as dining out, transport, clothing and footwear regained upward momentum as local consumption demand improved. Import prices also increased notably alongside bottlenecks in global supply chains and the surge in international energy and commodity prices.  By contrast, the housing component was a drag on overall inflation, reflecting the feed-through of the earlier decline in fresh-letting private residential rentals (Chart 2).  More broadly, slow growth in nominal wage and commercial rentals helped keep domestic business cost pressures in check.  For 2021 as a whole, the underlying and headline inflation rates5 stayed mild at 0.6% and 1.6% respectively.\n\nChart 2 Underlying consumer price inflation\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Labour market\n\nAlongside the domestic economic recovery, the labour market improved in 2021.  After reaching a 17-year high of 7.2% in February, the unemployment rate declined visibly to 4.0% in December6 (Chart 3) and the decline was broad based across most economic sectors.  Overall labour demand strengthened gradually as reflected by a pick-up in total employment (Chart 3) and private sector vacancies, though they were still below their pre-pandemic peaks.  On the other hand, the labour force shrank slightly by 1.3% in December compared with a year earlier, partly due to a modest decline in the labour force participation rate. The year-on-year growth in nominal wage and labour earnings, while moderate, showed signs of acceleration in the first three quarters of 2021, reversing the trend of deceleration during 2019–2020.\n\nChart 3 Labour market conditions\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe local stock market was broadly sluggish during the year, despite a continued rally in some major overseas equity markets (Chart 4).  Extending its rebound in late 2020, the Hang Seng Index rose to a high of 31,085 on 17 February 2021, but market sentiment had turned sharply negative since then owing to a host of factors, including concerns about the new COVID-19 virus variants, potential monetary policy tightening by major central banks and reduced inflows from southbound trading under Stock Connect7.  The Hang Seng Index closed the year at 23,398, down markedly by 14.1% from a year ago.\n\nChart 4 Asset prices\nSources: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market regained some upward momentum in the first half of 2021 alongside better economic prospects, but saw some consolidation in the second half amid weakened asset market sentiments (Chart 4).  Overall, housing prices and transaction volume still recorded an increase of 3.7% and 24.1% respectively in 2021. Household affordability also became even more stretched, partly reflecting reduced household income.  On the other hand, after going through sharp corrections in 2019 and 2020, the non-residential property markets generally improved, with prices and rentals of industrial properties generally rising to their pre-pandemic peaks, whereas those of retail and office spaces remained below their respective peaks.\n\nSee Table B: Major Economic Indicators on pages 326 to 327 for more details, including their trends during 2017–2021.\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nIn early 2022, the fifth wave of local COVID-19 infections has exerted pressures on domestic economic activities. In response, the Government introduced the fifth and the sixth rounds of the Anti-epidemic Fund and additional countercyclical measures under the 2022–23 Budget to help support the economy.  The HKMA, together with the banking sector, also extended the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme to the end of October 2022.\n\nFor 2022 as a whole, economic recovery is expected to continue, albeit at a more moderate pace compared to 2021, partly reflecting the impact of the fifth wave of COVID-19, slower global economic growth, a less favourable base effect and US monetary policy normalisation.  The Government forecasts real GDP growth for 2022 to be in the range of 1–2% and the latest growth estimates by international organisations and private sector analysts averaged 1.1%.  That said, the strength and pace of the recovery are subject to a host of uncertainties and risks, especially those surrounding the pandemic, the Ukraine situation, and the path of US monetary policy normalisation.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nAlongside rising import prices and pandemic-induced logistics disruptions, inflationary pressures are expected to edge up in the near term, but should stay broadly in check owing to soft rentals and mild local labour cost pressures. Market consensus forecasts a headline inflation rate of 2.4% in 2022, while the Government projects the headline and underlying inflation rates to be 2.1% and 2.0% respectively. The fifth wave of local COVID-19 infections has exerted pressures on the labour market in early 2022, especially for contact-intensive sectors.  Further out, labour market conditions will depend on the pandemic developments and the pace of the domestic economic recovery.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector continued to be stable in 2021.  Total banking assets expanded moderately as both loans and deposits increased.  The capital and liquidity positions of the banking sector remained robust. Asset quality stayed at a healthy level by both historical and international standards.\n\n# Balance sheet trends\n\nThe banking sector’s balance sheet grew by 1.9% in 2021. Driven by the economic recovery, total loans recorded a growth of 3.8% during the year, compared with 1.2% in 2020.  Among the total, loans for use in Hong Kong grew by 4.4%, loans for use outside Hong Kong grew by 1.1% and trade finance increased by 14.2%.  Mainland-related lending expanded by 3.6% in 2021, after remaining largely stable in 2020.\n\nOn the liability side, total deposits rose by 4.6% in 2021, compared with 5.4% in 2020.  As total deposits increased at a faster pace than total loans, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio edged down to 71.8% at the end of 2021 from 72.3% a year ago (Chart 5).\n\nChart 5 Loans and deposits of the banking sector\nSource: HKMA.\n\n# Capital adequacy\n\nThe banking sector remained well capitalised. The consolidated total capital ratio of locally incorporated authorized institutions (AIs) stood at 20.2% at the end of 2021.  The Tier 1 capital ratio was 18.2% (Chart 6). Both ratios were well above their respective international minimum requirements of 8% and 6%.\n\nThe Basel III leverage ratio was 7.9% at the end of 2021, well above the statutory minimum requirement of 3% (Chart 7).\n\n# Liquidity\n\nThe liquidity position of the banking sector was sound.  The quarterly average Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) of category 1 institutions8 was 151.9% in the fourth quarter of 2021, well\n\nabove the statutory minimum requirement of 100%. The quarterly average Liquidity Maintenance Ratio (LMR) of category 2 institutions was 59.1%, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 25% (Chart 8).\n\nChart 8 Liquidity ratios of designated AIs\nSource: HKMA.\n\nThe sources of funding of the banking sector remained stable.  The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) of category 1 institutions was 135.3% at the end of 2021, well above the statutory minimum requirement of 100%.  The Core Funding\n\nRatio (CFR) of category 2A institutions9 was 150.3% at the end of 2021, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 75% (Chart 9).\n\nChart 9 Funding ratios of designated AIs\nSource: HKMA.\n\n# Asset quality\n\nAsset quality remained stable during the year and stayed at a healthy level by both historical and international standards. The classified loan ratio was 0.88% at the end of 2021 as compared to 0.90% at the end of 2020, with the overdue and rescheduled loan ratio edging down to 0.56% from 0.57% during the period (Chart 10).  The classified loan ratio for Mainland-related lending was 0.86% at the end of 2021 as compared to 0.96% at the end of 2020.  The delinquency ratios of residential mortgage lending and credit card lending remained low at 0.04% and 0.20% respectively (Chart 11). The HKMA will continue to closely monitor the change in the asset quality of the banking sector.\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe low interest rate environment continued to weigh on the profitability of the banking sector.  The aggregate pre-tax operating profit of retail banks declined by 19.8% in 2021 (Chart 12), mainly attributable to a decrease in net interest income (-13.6%) and an increase in total operating expenses (+7.1%).  These were partly offset by an increase in income from fees and commissions (+9.6%) and a drop in loan impairment charges (-25.1%).  The net interest margin further narrowed to 0.98% in 2021 from 1.18% in 2020 (Chart 13).\n\nRetail banks’ cost-to-income ratio rose to 54.7% in 2021 from 47.0% in 2020 (Chart 14).", "zh": "#经济和金融环境\n\n随着商品出口的强,国内需求的提高,香港经济在2021年恢复了正面的增长,扭转了2019年和2020年的收缩.虽然COVID-19的第五波浪潮已经消退,但经济复苏的力量和速度仍受到不确定性和风险的影响.\n\n#经济在审查\n\n#真正的活动\n\n由于商品出口强,香港经济在2019年和2020年结束了经济缩.由于商业环境和前景有所改善,香港的商品出口在整个年份中出现了强的增长.服务出口的增长主要是由于国内和再出口的需求.\n\n表1 按支出组成部分的实际GDP增长 (期对期)\n\n注:季节性调整后的国内固定资本形成变化率没有提供.\n\n#通货膨胀\n\n由于政府的一次性救济措施的影响,基础通货膨胀率逐渐上升至1.4% (图2).随着当地消费需求的改善,进口价格也显著上升.相比之下,住房组成部分阻碍了整体通货膨胀,反映了以前的新租和商业租的缓慢增长.\n\n图表2 消费者价格的基本通胀来源:人口普查和统计部门.\n\n# 劳动力市场\n\n随着国内经济复苏,2021年劳动力市场改善.在2月达到17年来的最高水平7.2%,失业率在12月明显下降至4.0% (图3),并且大多数经济部门的下降幅度很大.总体劳动力需求逐渐增强,反映在总就业 (图3) 和私营部门的空缺,尽管它们仍低于疫情前的高点.另一方面,劳动力在12月份比一年前略有下降1.3%,部分原因是劳动力参与率的适度下降.名义工资和劳动力收入的同比增长,虽然温和,但在2021年前三季度显示出加速的迹象,扭转了2019-2020年期间的减速趋势.\n\n图3 劳动力市场情况 来源:人口普查和统计局\n\n# 股票市场\n\n尽管一些主要的海外股票市场持续反弹,但当地股票市场在今年的整体上一直很低.2020年底,杭 Seng 指数在2021年2月17日上升至31085的最高点,但由于许多因素,包括对新型COVID-19病毒的担忧,主要央行可能收紧货币政策以及在股票连接下减少南方交易的流入,杭 Seng 指数在今年的收盘时达到23398点,比去年大幅下降14.1%.\n\n图表4 资产价格来源:评级和估值部门和香港交易所和清算有限公司.\n\n# 房地产市场\n\n住宅房地产市场在2021年上半年与更好的经济前景相结合,但在下半年中仍有所收缩.整体而言,住房价格和交易量在2021年分别上升了3.7%,部分反映了家庭收入的下降.另一方面,在2019年和2020年经历了大幅度的调整后,非住宅房地产市场的价格和租金通常上升到疫情前的高点,而零售和办公空间的价格仍低于各自的高点.\n\n详见表B:主要经济指标,第326-327页,详见2017-2021年期间的趋势.\n\n# 经济前景\n\n#经济环境\n\n在2022年初,当地COVID-19感染的第五波对国内经济活动施加了压力.作为回应,政府在2022年至23年预算中引入了第五轮和第六轮抗疫基金以及额外的反周期措施,以帮助支持经济.香港管理局与银行业一起,还将预先批准的首要支付假期计划延长到2022年10月底.\n\n预计2022年整体经济复苏将继续,尽管与2021年相比,经济复苏速度较为缓慢,部分反映了COVID-19第五波的影响,以及美国货币政策的正常化.政府预计2022年实际GDP增长率将在12%左右,国际组织和私营部门分析师的最新增长估计为1.1%.\n\n# 通货膨胀和劳动力市场\n\n随着进口价格的上升和疫情引发的物流中断,预计近期的通胀压力将会增加,但由于软租金和轻微的当地劳动力成本压力,市场共识预测2022年的总体通胀率将分别为2.1%和2.0%.当地COVID-19感染的第五波已经对劳动力市场施加了压力,特别是接触密集的部门.此外,劳动力市场的情况将取决于疫情发展和国内经济复苏的速度.\n\n#银行业的表现\n\n香港银行业在2021年继续保持稳定,因为贷款和存款增加.银行业的资本和流动性状况仍然很好.资产质量保持在历史和国际标准的健康水平.\n\n# 资产负债表趋势\n\n银行业的资产负债表在2021年增长了1.9%.受经济复苏的推动,总贷款在今年增长了3.8%,而2020年为1.2%.在总数中,在香港使用的贷款增长了4.4%,在香港以外使用的贷款增长了1.1%,贸易融资增长了14.2%.与大陆相关的贷款在2021年扩大了3.6%,在2020年基本保持稳定之后.\n\n在负债方面,2021年总存款增长4.6%,而2020年为5.4%.由于总存款增长速度比总贷款快,总贷款存款比率在2021年底从一年前的72.3%降至71.8% (图5).\n\n图5 银行业贷款和存款来源:香港银行管理局.\n\n#资本充足性\n\n银行业资本化依然良好.当地注册的授权机构 (AI) 的整合总资本比率在2021年底为20.2%,一级资本比率为18.2% (图6).这两种比率都远高于各自的国际最低要求的8%和6%.\n\n根据巴塞尔III协议,该国在2021年底的杆率为7.9%,远高于法定最低要求的3%.\n\n#流动性\n\n银行业的流动性状况良好.第一类机构的季度平均流动性覆盖率 (LCR) 是2021年第四季度的151.9%.\n\n类别2机构的季度平均流动性维持比率 (LMR) 为59.1%,也远高于法定最低要求的25% (图8).\n\n图8 指定国际机构的流动性比率 来源:HKMA.\n\n银行业的融资来源保持稳定. 在2021年底,第一类机构的净稳定融资比率高于法定最低要求的135.3%.\n\n对于2A类机构的比例是150.3%,也远远高于法定最低要求的75% (图 9).\n\n图9 指定国际机构的融资比率 来源:香港管理局\n\n# 资产质量\n\n资产质量在今年保持稳定,按历史和国际标准保持健康水平.2021年底的分类贷款比率为0.88%,而2020年底的0.90%,逾期和重定向贷款比率在此期间从0.57%降至0.56% (图 10).与大陆相关的贷款的分类贷款比率在2021年底为0.86%而不是2020年底.住宅抵押贷款和信用卡贷款的违约率分别为0.04%和0.20% (图 11).香港金融管理局将继续密切监测银行业资产质量的变化.\n\n#利趋势\n\n低利率环境继续影响银行业的利能力.零售银行在2021年税前营业利总额下降了19.8% (图12),主要归因于净利息收入下降 (-13.6%) 和总营业费用增加 (+7.1%).这些部分被费用和佣金收入增加 (+9.6%) 和贷款减值费用下降 (-25.1%) 抵消.净利息率进一步缩小至2021年的0.98%,而2020年的1.18% (图13).\n\n零售银行成本收入比率从2020年的47.0%上升至2021年的54.7% (图14)."}
{"en": "# Monetary Stability\n\nDespite the lingering uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and increased concerns about the pace of US monetary tightening, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to trade in a smooth and orderly manner.  As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability since it was implemented in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System has shown its strength and resilience to external shocks.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability.  This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\n# The Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n\nCertificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks; Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation; the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of clearing account balances kept with the HKMA; and Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs).  With the HKMA standing ready to sell (or buy) Hong Kong dollars to (or from) banks in exchange for US dollars upon request at 7.75 (or 7.85) per US dollar, when the strong-side (or weak-side) CU is triggered, the Aggregate Balance will expand (or contract) to push down (or up) Hong Kong dollar interest rates that would help move the Hong Kong dollar back to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2021\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nDriven by equity-related demand arising from fundraising activities and the southbound Stock Connects1, the Hong Kong dollar traded close to the strong-side CU at the beginning of the year.  Thereafter, the Hong Kong dollar weakened amid stock market correction and repatriation of initial public offering (IPO) proceeds by some newly listed firms before rebounding slightly in the second quarter due to corporates’ dividend payment needs and net inflows from the southbound Stock Connects.  Stepping into the second half of the year, while the Hong Kong dollar drifted lower amid softened equity market sentiment, it stayed mostly at the strong side of the Convertibility Zone and continued to trade in a smooth and orderly manner (Chart 1).  Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market functioned normally throughout 2021.\n\nChart 1 Market exchange rate in 2021\n\nAs the CUs were not triggered, the total of the Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs remained virtually unchanged at around HK$1,526.3 billion in 2021 (Chart 2). During the year, the HKMA issued a total of HK$80 billion additional Exchange Fund Bills to meet the ongoing demand for Exchange Fund paper by banks amid the abundance of liquidity in the banking system, which led to a contraction of the Aggregate Balance from HK$457.5 billion at the end of 2020 to HK$377.5 billion at the end of 2021.\n\nReflecting the additional issuance of Exchange Fund Bills and the issuance of EFBNs to absorb EFBNs’ interest payments according to the established practice, the outstanding EFBNs increased from HK$1,069.2 billion to HK$1,148.8 billion during the year.  The Monetary Base as a whole remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\n# HK$1,526.3 billion\n\nTotal Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs\n\nChart 2 Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding Exchange Fund papers in 2021\n\n# Money market\n\nWith the sizeable Aggregate Balance, the Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained largely stable at low levels throughout the year (Chart 3).  While the demand for the Hong Kong dollar increased along with the IPO activities during the first quarter, Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs) of various tenors saw little fluctuations.  Thereafter, HIBORs remained largely stable despite concerns about the pace of US monetary tightening.  Towards the end of 2021, HIBORs witnessed mild pick-ups, partly reflecting anticipated funding needs towards the year end.  On the retail front, banks kept their Best Lending Rates unchanged.  Overall, Hong Kong’s money markets continued to function normally.  Discount Window borrowing decreased to HK$6.8 billion in 2021 from HK$9.1 billion in 2020.\n\nChart 3 Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates in 2021\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nThe Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has been a strong anchor of Hong Kong’s financial system for more than three decades and has shown its strength and resilience to challenges.  Despite lingering uncertainties surrounding global economic recovery, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to function in an orderly manner, reflecting the robustness of the LERS.  The Government is firmly committed to the LERS.  In its 2021 External Sector Report, the International Monetary Fund once again reiterated that the credibility of the LERS has been assured by a transparent set of rules, ample fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nA robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS.  Hong Kong’s banking sector continued to operate smoothly with liquidity positions and capitalisation faring very well by international standards.  To ensure resilience of the banking sector, the HKMA has been closely monitoring banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and has maintained its supervisory efforts on bank lending.\n\nTo improve transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998.  The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) moved within a range of 109.8–110.5% during 2021, without touching the Upper or the Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 110.2% on 31 December (Chart 4). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate.  The ample financial resources of the Exchange Fund, together with the sound banking system, provide a powerful backstop to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nChart 4 Daily movement of the Backing Ratio in 2021\n\n# Currency Board Sub-Committee\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong.  In 2021, the CBC considered issues, including an assessment of inflation in the US, implications of the US dollar depreciation on Hong Kong, assessment of the taper tantrum risk and its impact on Hong Kong, and understanding the influence of Mainland-related fund flows on monetary conditions in Hong Kong.  Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and reports on the Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Notes and coins\n\nAt the end of 2021, the total value of banknotes issued by note-issuing banks in circulation was HK$592.6 billion, an increase of 5.9% from a year earlier (Charts 5, 6 and 7). The total value of Government-issued notes and coins in circulation amounted to HK$12.9 billion at the end of 2021, up 1.7% year on year (Charts 8 and 9).\n\n# HK$592.6 billion, +5.9%\n\nTotal value of banknotes issued by note-issuing banks\n\n# HK$12.9 billion, +1.7%\n\nTotal value of notes and coins issued by Government\n\n# Chart 5\n\nBanknotes in circulation by note-issuing banks at the end of 2021\n\n# Chart 6 \n\nDistribution of banknotes in circulation at the end of 2021\n\n# Hong Kong banknotes\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA arranged 14 seminars for more than 4,000 participants, including professionals in the banking and retail industries as well as students, to help enhance their knowledge and skills in differentiating between authentic and counterfeit banknotes.  These public education programmes on the design and security features of Hong Kong banknotes are well received.\n\n# Coin Collection Programme\n\nThe Coin Collection Programme continued to be well received by the public.  More information about the Programme can be found in the Sustainability chapter on page 198.\n\n# Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\n\nThe EFBN Programme continued to operate smoothly. To meet the ongoing demand for Exchange Fund paper by banks amid the abundance of liquidity in the banking system, the HKMA issued a total of HK$80 billion additional Exchange Fund Bills in the second half of 2021.  The additional issuance resulted in a corresponding reduction of the Aggregate Balance.  At the end of 2021, the nominal amount of outstanding Exchange Fund papers stood at HK$1,148.6 billion (Table 2).\n\nTable 2 Outstanding issues of Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\n\n# Monetary research\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMR)  maintained a steady research output in 2021 despite the ongoing pandemic.  During the year, the HKIMR released 30 working papers and held nine webinars, which encompassed a wide range of topics including monetary policy, banking stability, market microstructure and financial technology (fintech) development.  The HKIMR also organised an international conference and a webinar in hybrid format.\n\nThe webinar, titled RMB Exchange Rate Formation Mechanism and Exchange Rate Outlook, was co-organised with the Hong Kong Academy of Finance on 17 August.  It was live-streamed on a number of online platforms and attracted a total of over 1.16 million real-time views.\n\nThe 11th Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy, titled On the Path to Common Prosperity: China’s Economic Development in Dual Circulation, was held on 11 November.  The conference discussed recent policy developments related to common prosperity, dual circulation, anti-monopoly regulations, property market, Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect and financial developments in the Greater Bay Area5.  Expert speakers also presented in-depth analyses on the impact of population ageing and the sustainability of social security funds, as well as China’s contribution to global financial stability and world economy.  The six different sessions of the conference attracted over 3,200 online and on-site viewers, totaling 5,900 views.", "zh": "#货币稳定性\n\n尽管围绕COVID-19大流行病的不确定性以及对美国货币紧缩的速度的担忧增加,但香港美元换和货币市场仍以平稳有序的方式进行交易.作为香港货币和金融稳定的基石,自1983年实施以来,联汇汇率系统已经显示出其强度和对外部冲击的弹性.\n\n#目标\n\n香港货币政策的首要目标是货币稳定.这是香港货币在外汇市场上的汇率,在7.75美元到7.85美元的范围内.货币体系的特点是货币委员会安排,要求货币基础至少100%由汇率基金所持的美元储备来支,货币基础的变化必须100%由美元储备相应的变化来支.\n\n#货币基础 (表1) 包括:\n\n债务证书,为三个发行银行发行的纸币提供全部支持;政府发行的流通货币纸币和硬币;总余额,即在HKMA持有的结算账户余额的总和;以及由HKMA代表政府发行的汇率基金票据和票据 (EFBNs).\n\n香港元汇率的稳定性是通过自动利率调整机制和香港证券交易管理局 (HKMA) 坚定承诺遵守可换性承诺 (CUs) 的.随着香港证券交易管理局 (HKMA) 随时准备以每美元7.75 (或7.85) 的价格向银行出售 (或从银行购买) 香港元以换取美元,当强势 (或弱势) 的元被触发时,总余额将扩大 (或收缩) 以推动香港元利率下降 (或上升),这将有助于将香港元重新移至可换性区7.75至7.85.\n\n#2021年回顾\n\n# 汇率稳定性\n\n由于融资活动和南方股票连接1引起的股票相关需求,香港元在年初接近强势的CU.此后,在股票市场的纠正和一些新上市公司首次公开募股 (IPO) 收益的遣返中,香港元在第二季度略有反弹,原因是公司的股息支付需求和南方股票连接的净流入.进入下半年,尽管香港元在股票市场情绪疲软的情况下下跌,但它主要停留在可转换区的强势侧面,并继续以平稳有序的方式交易 (图1).总体而言,香港元在整个2021年运行正常.\n\n图1 在2021年市场汇率\n\n由于CU没有触发,总余额和现存EFBN在2021年几乎保持不变,约为1526.3亿港元 (图2).在一年中,HKMA发行了总计800亿港元的额外交换基金账单,以满足银行在银行系统流动性充足的情况下对交换基金纸张的持续需求,这导致总余额从2020年底的4575亿港元缩减到2021年底的3775亿港元.\n\n由于增加了交换基金账单和EFBN的发行,以吸收EFBN的利息支付,该年该基金的发行额从1069.2亿港元增加到1148.8亿港元.货币基础作为一个整体仍然完全由外汇储备支持.\n\n# 香港1526.3亿美元\n\n总总结余额和未结账的EFBN\n\n图2 总余额 (在折扣窗口之前) 和交换基金的债务在2021年\n\n# 货币市场\n\n随着相当大的总体余额,香港美元银行间利率在全年基本保持在低水平 (图3).虽然在第一季度随着IPO活动而增加了对香港美元的需求,但各种期限的香港银行间报价率 (HIBOR) 几乎没有波动.此后,尽管对美国货币收紧的速度存在担忧,HIBOR基本保持稳定.到2021年底,HIBOR出现了轻微回升,部分反映了年底预期的融资需求.在零售方面,银行保持了最佳贷款利率.总体而言,香港的货币市场继续正常运作.折扣窗口借款从2020年的91亿港元下降到2021年的68亿港元.\n\n图3 香港美元的银行间利率\n\n# 链接汇率系统\n\n连接汇率系统 (LERS) 是香港金融体系的强大支柱,它已经证明了自身的强大性和抗挑战性.尽管全球经济复苏的不确定性持续存在,但香港美元汇率和货币市场仍在正常运行,这反映了LERS的稳定性.国际货币基金组织在2021年外部部门报告中再次重申,LERS的可信性已经得到了透明的规则,充足的财政和外汇储备,强有力的金融监管和监督,以及灵活的经济和审慎的财政框架.\n\n强大的银行体系对于LERS的正常运作至关重要.香港的银行部门继续顺利运作,流动性和资本化情况非常好.为了确保银行部门的弹性,HKMA一直在密切监督银行管理的信贷,流动性和利率风险以及压力测试结果.\n\n为了提高货币委员会账户的透明度,自1998年10月以来,交易所资产的支持率 (定义为由货币基础划分的支持资产) 在2021年内在109.8110.5%范围内移动.在LERS下,虽然特定的交易所资产已被指定为支持港元的汇率,但交易所资产的充足财务资源以及健全的银行体系为香港的货币和金融稳定提供了强大的支持.\n\n图表 4 2021 年的逆转比率的每日变化\n\n# 货币委员会小组委员会\n\n汇率基金咨询委员会 (CBC) 监督和审查香港货币和金融稳定方面的问题.在2021年,CBC考虑了包括美国通货膨胀,美国美元值对香港的影响,评估与大陆有关的资金流对香港货币状况的影响.CBC对这些问题的讨论记录和提交给CBC的货币委员会报告都在HKMA网站上公布.\n\n# 纸币和硬币\n\n截至2021年底,发行银行在流通中的银行纸币总价值为5926亿港元,比去年增加5.9% (图5,6和7).2021年底,政府发行的在流通中的纸币和硬币总价值为129亿港元,同比增长1.7% (图8和9).\n\n# 港币5926亿,增长5.9%\n\n发行银行发行的银行纸币总值\n\n香港129亿美元,增长1.7%\n\n政府发行的纸币和硬币的总价值\n\n#图表5\n\n发行银行在2021年底流通的纸币\n\n#图表6\n\n在2021年底流通的纸币的分配\n\n# 香港的纸币\n\n在一年中,香港银行管理局为4000多名参与者安排了14次研讨会,以帮助他们提高识别真伪的知识和技能.这些关于香港银行账户设计和安全特征的公共教育项目得到了很好的收获.\n\n# 收藏硬币的计划\n\n硬币收集计划继续受到公众的欢迎. 关于该计划的更多信息可以在第198页的可持续发展章节中找到.\n\n# 汇票基金账单和纸币\n\n为了满足银行在银行系统流动性充足的持续需求,HKMA在2021年下半年发行了总共800亿港元的额外的交换基金账单,导致总余额相应减少.到2021年底,交换基金的标价为1,148.6亿港元 (表2).\n\n汇率基金账单和债券的未发行\n\n# 货币研究\n\n香港货币与金融研究院 (HKIMR) 尽管在持续的疫情中保持稳定的研究成果.在一年内,HKIMR发布了30篇工作论文,并举办了9个网络研讨会,涵盖了包括货币政策,银行稳定性,市场微观结构和金融技术 (fintech) 发展在内的广泛主题.HKIMR还组织了混合形式的国际会议和网络研讨会.\n\n网上研讨会题为\"人民币汇率形成机制和汇率展望\",于8月17日与香港金融学院联合组织.该研讨会在多个在线平台上直播,总共吸引了超过116万实时观看.\n\n第十一届中国经济年会\"通往共同繁荣:双流通中的中国经济发展\"于11月11日举行.会议讨论了与共同繁荣,双流通,反断法规,房地产市场,跨境财富管理联系以及大湾区的金融发展有关的问题.专家发言人还对人口老龄化和社会保障基金的可持续性以及中国对全球金融稳定和世界经济的贡献做了深入分析.会议的六个不同会议吸引了超过3200名在线观众,总计观看次数为5900人."}
{"en": "# Banking Stability\n\nThe banking sector in Hong Kong remained sound and stable in 2021, despite the emergence of more contagious COVID-19 variants, causing uncertainty to global economic recovery.  During the year, the HKMA remained focused on the supervision of authorized institutions’ risk management.  Supervision of authorized institutions’ operational and cyber resilience was also stepped up in light of escalating cyber threats and accelerating digitalisation in the banking sector.\n\nOn conduct supervision, the HKMA provided guidance to banks to facilitate the use of non-face-to-face channels for distributing investment and insurance products, and worked with fellow regulators to formulate supervisory requirements on new products in the market such as insurance-linked securities and virtual assets.  The Code of Banking Practice was also revised to enhance consumer protection in digital financial services.\n\nIn the area of anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT), the HKMA’s priority has been to further strengthen banks’ gatekeeper role in the ecosystem and their ability to prevent and detect illicit fund flows associated with increases in online fraud, mule account networks and other financial crimes during the pandemic.  To increase protection for customer accounts against fraud and financial crimes, the HKMA scaled up collaboration and information sharing with other stakeholders via public-private partnerships.  While supporting remote customer on-boarding, the HKMA also encouraged adoption of other technologies including network analytics through the launch of the first AML Regtech Lab in November.  Internationally, proactive engagement has kept the HKMA at the forefront of global AML/CFT efforts in the Financial Action Task Force.\n\nOn the development front, the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Pilot Scheme in the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area was launched smoothly in September.  During the year, the HKMA continued to execute its two-year roadmap for promoting Regtech adoption in Hong Kong.  Several initiatives were rolled out to lay the foundation for banks’ climate risk management and promote green and sustainable banking more broadly, as discussed in the Sustainability chapter. Further efforts were also made in the area of soft infrastructure, including promoting a customercentric corporate culture, as well as working with the banking industry to roll out capacity-building initiatives to facilitate talent development.\n\nMeanwhile, the HKMA has worked closely with the banking industry in optimising supervisory policies and processes. Good progress was made on implementing international supervisory standards locally, including those on capital adequacy and disclosure.  The HKMA continued to advance its work to ensure a credible resolution regime for authorized institutions, including developing new resolution standards and implementing rules on loss-absorbing capacity requirements to enhance authorized institutions’ resolvability.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system.  Achieving this objective is contingent upon a highly resilient financial system that is capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their businesses and, in extreme cases, by failing in a disorderly manner.  The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring that banks are resilient to shocks and able to recover their positions in crises, ultimately helping to prevent failures.  The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks and is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs).\n\nHowever, the Monetary Authority cannot ensure, nor is the Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework designed to ensure, a zero-risk financial system.  Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that, in the event of an AI becoming non-viable, its failure can be managed in an orderly manner.  To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong has been established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs, among other types of institutions.  To operationalise the resolution regime in Hong Kong, it is important to lay down resolution rules and policy standards, undertake resolution planning to remove impediments to AIs’ resolvability and develop the HKMA’s operational capability to resolve a failing AI.  In order to carry out these tasks effectively, the HKMA adopts an internationally harmonised and co-ordinated approach.\n\nThe Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs). In overseeing FMIs, the HKMA aims to promote their general safety and efficiency, limit systemic risk and foster transparency.  Making FMIs more resilient to financial crises protects the monetary and financial systems in Hong Kong from possible destabilising effects arising from disruption to the FMIs.  Information regarding the HKMA’s oversight approach is available on the HKMA website.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2021\n\n# Licensing\n\nAt the end of 2021, Hong Kong had:\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA granted two banking licences and one restricted bank licence to three non-local banks. The HKMA also granted a money broker approval to a foreign trading platform operator.  The authorizations of three licensed banks and two restricted licence banks were revoked during the year.\n\nMore information about the AIs and local representative offices in Hong Kong can be found in the Annex and Tables D to F on pages 321 to 324, and 330 to 333 respectively.\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nThe HKMA conducted 189 off-site reviews covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL rating assessment1, corporate governance, risk management and financial technology (fintech) strategies.  As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance, 40 meetings were held with the AIs’ boards of directors, independent non-executive directors or board-level committees.  A further 38 tripartite meetings were held among the HKMA, AIs and their external auditors.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA conducted regular on-site examinations supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk.  A total of 679 on-site examinations and thematic reviews were carried out during the year with credit risk management as a key focus. Amid growing adoption of technology by banks, management of operational risk and technology risk was another major area of attention.  The HKMA also increased the number of on-site examinations and thematic reviews targeting liquidity and market risk management.  In addition, specialist teams performed on-site examinations and thematic reviews of AIs’ activities in securities, investment products, insurance and mandatory provident fund (MPF)- related businesses, as well as their anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) controls. Table 1 contains a summary of the HKMA’s supervisory activities in 2021.\n\n# Credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nTotal loans increased by 3.8% in 2021, compared with a growth of 1.2% in 2020.  Table 2 shows the breakdown of growth in loans and advances.\n\nMainland-related lending increased by 3.6% to HK$4,725 billion in 2021 (Table 3).\n\nThe asset quality of the banking sector remained largely stable during the year and stayed at a healthy level by both historical and international standards.  The classified loan ratio of the industry was 0.88% at the end of 2021, down from 0.90% at the end of 2020, well below the long-run historical average of 1.8% since 2000.  The ratio for Mainland-related lending also decreased to 0.86% from 0.96% a year ago.\n\nDuring the year, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to weigh on some sectors of the economy, while credit events in the Mainland property sector caught the attention of the market.  The HKMA enhanced the breadth and depth of its surveillance, with deep-dive reviews focused on banks’ exposures to highly leveraged borrowers. Close communication with banks has been maintained to facilitate up-to-date assessment of the impact of economic and market developments as well as the adequacy of banks’ risk management measures.  The overall credit risk facing the banking sector is assessed to be manageable.  The latest results of the HKMA’s solvency stress tests confirm that the banking sector continues to maintain sufficient capital buffers to withstand extreme stress.\n\nTargeted and thematic examinations were conducted during the year to evaluate AIs’ systems and controls over loan classification and loan loss provisioning, overseas lending operations, and collateralised lending to private banking and wealth management customers.\n\n# Alleviating cash-flow pressure faced by customers\n\nIn September, the HKMA and the Banking Sector Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) Lending Coordination Mechanism announced a six-month extension of the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme until the end of April 2022.  This scheme was first launched in May 2020 to defer loan principal payments of eligible corporate customers by six months.  In light of a resurgence of local coronavirus infections, in February 2022, the scheme was further extended until the end of October 2022.  In addition, the scheme was enhanced to offer a one-year partial principal repayment option to those customers who are financially capable and willing to resume principal repayment gradually.\n\nBy the end of December 2021, banks had approved loan tenor extensions and other forms of relief in over 83,000 cases, involving an aggregate amount of over HK$920 billion. For personal customers, banks had approved more than 52,000 cases of principal payment holidays for residential mortgages and other personal relief loans, amounting to over HK$53 billion.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nThe successive rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures introduced by the HKMA since 2009 have strengthened banks’ risk management and the banking sector’s resilience to a possible abrupt downturn in the local property market.  The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of new residential mortgage loans (RMLs) approved in December 2021 was 53%, compared with 64% in September 2009 before the countercyclical measures were first introduced.  The average debt servicing ratio (DSR) of new mortgages remained low at 36% in December 2021, compared with 41% in August 2010, when a cap on DSR was first applied (Chart 1).\n\n# Operational and technology risks\n\nIn light of banks’ increasing reliance on technology to support their operations, the HKMA stepped up supervision of operational and technology risks.  Key supervisory focuses during the year included controls over cloud outsourcing and remote working arrangements.  The HKMA launched an industry consultation in December on a draft new Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module on “Operational Resilience”. The new SPM module seeks to provide guidance to banks on developing a holistic and integrated operational resilience framework.\n\nThe HKMA introduced the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 in January to reflect the latest sound practices on cyber security risk management.  During the year, the HKMA monitored AIs’ implementation of the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 and reviewed their cyber resilience capabilities.  In view of the growing risk of destructive cyber-attacks, in May, the HKMA requested all AIs to critically assess the need for a secure tertiary data backup, taking reference from the Secure Tertiary Data Backup Guideline issued by the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB).\n\nIn response to heightened risks and rising numbers of phishing attacks, the HKMA worked closely with the industry to strengthen the security of internet and mobile banking services.  A large-scale joint HKMA-HKAB public awareness campaign, themed “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!” began in July (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 Raising public awareness of phishing attacks\n\nSlogan icon for the public awareness campaign themed “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!”\n\n# Liquidity and market risks\n\nTo enhance monitoring of AIs’ liquidity risk exposures, the HKMA introduced additional scenarios into its liquidity stress testing framework to evaluate AIs’ ability to cope with liquidity shocks over a prolonged period.\n\nDuring the year, thematic reviews were conducted to assess the adequacy of AIs’ liquidity stress testing programmes and evaluate the sufficiency of their monitoring metrics and control limits for managing liquidity risk.  The HKMA also carried out reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of AIs’ market risk management frameworks for debt securities investments and operational controls over treasury activities.\n\nThe HKMA closely monitored AIs’ progress in preparing for the transition away from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR).  It collaborated with industry associations and developed tools to assist AIs in supporting their customers’ migration to alternative reference rates, including a leaflet to raise corporates’ awareness of the transition and an information note on options available in the loan markets to replace US dollar LIBOR.  AIs have substantially remediated contracts referencing LIBOR settings which ceased to be published after the end of 2021.  They were reminded not to enter into new LIBOR contracts from 1 January 2022 onwards.", "zh": "银行稳定性\n\n尽管COVID-19变种更为传染,但香港银行业仍专注于监督授权机构的风险管理.鉴于网络威胁不断升级,香港银行业的网络弹性也得到加强.\n\n关于行为监督,HKMA向银行提供了指导,以促进使用非面对面的道来分发投资和保险产品,并与其他监管机构合作,制定了对市场上的新产品的监管要求.银行行为准则也被修订,以加强数字金融服务的消费者保护.\n\n在反洗钱和反恐怖主义融资领域,香港金融管理局的优先事项是进一步加强银行在生态系统中的守门人角色,以及他们防止和检测与在线欺诈,子账户网络和其他金融犯罪增加相关的非法资金流.为了增加对客户账户的保护,香港金融管理局通过公私合作伙伴关系扩大了与其他利益相关方的合作和信息共享.在支持远程客户的同时,香港金融管理局还通过11月推出第一个AML Regtech实验室鼓励采用包括网络分析在内的其他技术.在国际上,积极参与使香港金融管理局在金融行动工作组的全球反洗钱/反金融犯罪努力中处于领先地位.\n\n在发展方面,广东香港澳大利亚大湾区的跨境财富管理连接试点计划于9月顺利启动.在今年期间,香港财富管理局继续执行其促进香港采用Regtech的两年路线图.根据可持续发展章节的讨论,为银行奠定了基础,并进一步努力在软基础设施领域,包括促进以客户为中心的企业文化,以及与银行业合作推出能力建设举措,以促进人才发展.\n\n香港管理局在优化监管政策和流程方面与银行业密切合作.在当地实施国际监管标准方面取得了良好进展,包括为授权机构制定新的解决方案,并实施关于减损能力要求的规定.\n\n#目标\n\n香港管理局的总体目标是促进银行系统的安全和稳定.实现这一目标取决于能够提供香港经济所需的关键金融服务.\n\n银行通过开展业务的方式,在极端情况下,通过无序失败,会影响系统的稳定性.作为监管机构,货币管理局在保障金融稳定方面发挥着关键作用,确保银行能够抵御冲击,并在危机中恢复其地位,最终有助于防止破产.货币管理局负责对银行进行审慎监督,并负责授权的银行,受限许可的银行和香港的存款公司的授权,这些机构集体称为授权机构 (AIs).\n\n然而,货币局不能确保,香港的审慎监管框架也不能确保,如果AI变得不可行,它将会有秩序地管理.为了使香港的解决方案能够运行,必须制定解决方案规则和政策标准.\n\n金融机构还负责指派和监督某些金融市场基础设施.在监督金融机构时,香港金融管理局的目标是促进其一般安全性和效率,限制系统风险,促进透明度.使金融机构更具抵御力,保护香港的货币和金融系统免受金融机构中出现的破坏性影响.有关香港金融管理局监督方法的信息可在香港金融管理局网站上找到.\n\n#2021年回顾\n\n# 许可证\n\n在2021年底,香港有:\n\n在今年,HKMA向三个非本地银行授予了两份银行许可证和一份有限银行许可证.\n\n关于香港的AI和地方代表处的更多信息可以在附件和表D至F中找到,分别在第321至324页和第330至333页.\n\n# 监管活动的概述\n\n香港证券管理局进行了189次场外审查,涵盖了广泛的问题,包括CAMEL评级评估1,公司治理,风险管理和金融技术 (金融技术) 战略.作为香港证券管理局继续努力促进更强有力的风险治理的一部分,与国际投资机构董事会,独立非执行董事或董事会级别委员会举行了40次会议.另外,香港证券管理局,国际投资机构及其外部审计师举行了38次三方会议.\n\n除了场外活动,HKMA还对被评估为高风险的领域进行了定期的实地考察和专题考察.在银行日益采用技术的背景下,HKMA还增加了针对流动性和市场风险的实地考察和专题考察.\n\n# 信用风险\n\n# 信用增长和资产质量\n\n总贷款在2021年增加了3.8%,而2020年增长了1.2%.表2显示了贷款和预付款的增长情况.\n\n相关贷款在2021年增长3.6%至4725亿港元 (表3).\n\n银行业的资产质量在今年基本保持稳定,根据历史和国际标准保持在健康水平.该行业的分类贷款比率在2021年底为0.88%,低于2020年底的0.90%,远低于2000年以来的1.8%的长期历史平均值.与大陆有关的贷款的比率也从一年前的0.96%降至0.86%.\n\n在今年,COVID-19疫情继续影响经济的一些部门,而大陆房地产部门的信贷事件引起了市场的关注.HKMA加强了监督,深入审查了银行对高度杆借款人的风险.与银行保持密切的沟通,以促进对银行部门所面临的整体信贷风险的管理.HKMA的偿付能力压力测试的最新结果证实,银行部门继续保持足够的资本缓冲.\n\n在今年进行了有针对性的专题考核,评估了贷款分类和贷款损失预备,海外贷款以及向私人银行和财富管理客户提供的抵押贷款.\n\n# 减轻客户面临的现金流压力\n\n9月,香港管理局和银行业中小企业 (SME) 贷款协调机制宣布将预先批准的贷款假期计划延长至2022年4月底.该计划最初是在2020年5月推出,以延迟符合条件的企业客户的贷款本金支付.鉴于当地冠状病毒感染的复苏,该计划进一步延长至2022年10月底.此外,该计划还加强了为那些有财务能力并愿意逐步恢复本金支付的客户提供一年的部分本金支付选择.\n\n到2021年12月底,银行已批准了超过83,000个案件的贷款期限延长和其他形式的救济,涉及总额超过920亿港元.对于个人客户,银行已批准了超过52,000个住宅抵押贷款和其他个人救济贷款的首付假期,总额超过530亿港元.\n\n# 房地产抵押贷款\n\n自2009年以来,香港金融管理局推出的连续一轮反周期性宏观审慎措施加强了银行风险管理,并使银行业对当地房地产市场可能出现的急剧下滑的抵御能力.2021年12月批准的新住宅抵押贷款的平均贷款价值比率为53%,而反周期性措施首次实施之前的2009年9月为64%.新抵押贷款的平均债务服务比率在2021年12月保持在低位,为36%,而在2010年8月首次实施DSR上限时为41% (图1).\n\n# 运营和技术风险\n\n鉴于银行日益依赖技术,HKMA加强了对运营和技术风险的监督.今年的主要监督重点包括对云外包和远程工作安排的控制.HKMA于12月就\"运营弹性\"的新监督政策手册 (SPM) 模块草案发起了咨询.新SPM模块旨在为银行提供全面和综合的运营弹性框架.\n\n香港金融管理局在1月份推出了网络弹性评估框架2.0,以反映网络安全风险管理的最新良好做法.在今年期间,香港金融管理局监测了AI的网络弹性评估框架2.0的实施情况,并审查了其网络弹性能力.鉴于破坏性网络攻击的风险日益增加,香港金融管理局要求所有AI严格评估安全第三级数据备份的需求,并参考香港银行协会 (HKAB) 发布的安全第三级数据备份指南.\n\n为了应对风险增加和网络鱼攻击数量的增加,香港金融管理局与行业密切合作,加强互联网和移动银行服务的安全性.香港金融管理局和香港银行联合开展了一项大型公众宣传活动,主题是\"保护您的个人数字密钥;警欺诈链接!\"\n\n图1提高公众对网络鱼攻击的认识\n\n宣传活动的口号图标主题是\"保护您的个人数字密钥;警欺诈链接!\"\n\n#流动性和市场风险\n\n为了加强对国际投资机构流动性风险的监测,HKMA在其流动性应激测试框架中引入了额外的情景,以评估国际投资机构在长期内应对流动性冲击的能力.\n\n在今年进行了专题审查,以评估AI的流动性压力测试计划的充分性,并评估AI监控指标和控制限制的流动性风险.HKMA还进行了评估,以评估AI对债券投资和财政活动的运营控制的有效性.\n\n香港管理局密切关注国际银行在从伦敦银行间提议利率 (LIBOR) 转型的进展.它与行业协会合作,开发了工具来帮助国际银行支持其客户转向替代参考利率,包括一本宣传册来提高企业对转型的认识,以及一本关于贷款市场可用替代美元利率的信息说明.国际银行已经大幅修复了2021年底后不再发布的利率设置的合同.他们被提醒不要从2022年1月1日起签订新的利率合同."}
{"en": "# International Financial Centre\n\nDuring 2021, the HKMA achieved good progress in strengthening Hong Kong’s status as a globally competitive international financial centre through a multi-pronged approach.\n\nThe HKMA unveiled “Fintech 2025” strategy to promote the wide adoption of fintech by the financial sector and bolster Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub more broadly.  On the Faster Payment System, it has seen a surge in turnover during the year amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOn enhancing connectivity, significant progress was made during the year with the addition of the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect and Southbound Trading under Bond Connect to the suite of Connect schemes.  Thanks to its world-class market infrastructure and the Connect schemes, Hong Kong is the favoured platform for Mainland funds to tap into global markets and for international investors to access the fast-growing Mainland markets.\n\nAlso during 2021, the HKMA devoted significant efforts in creating new business opportunities to strengthen the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, in areas including bond issuance, asset and wealth management, corporate treasury centres, and green and sustainable finance.  To promote Hong Kong’s financial services, the HKMA stepped up market outreach to overseas and Mainland stakeholders to keep them informed about the resilience of Hong Kong’s financial system and the prospects it presents.\n\nMeanwhile, the HKMA is active in international and regional central banking and regulatory forums, contributing to global efforts in maintaining financial stability and promoting financial market developments.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nThe HKMA announced its “Fintech 2025” strategy, covering a series of initiatives to promote wide adoption of financial technology (fintech) and strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia.  The HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO), together with the banking departments, played a pivotal role in driving various key initiatives during the year including the following:\n\n- Promoting regulatory technology (Regtech) adoption\n- Rolling out the Tech Baseline Assessment to understand banks' adoption of fintech\n\nHong Kong’s position as an offshore renminbi hub remained firm, with offshore renminbi businesses registering robust growth during the year.  Inflows into renminbi assets continued to gather pace as the inclusion of onshore securities in major financial market indices continued. Hong Kong plays an indispensable role in facilitating international investors’ increased allocation to renminbi assets, with the Mainland–Hong Kong Connect schemes being widely accepted as the channels of choice for international investors to access onshore capital markets. In 2021, daily turnover under Northbound Bond Connect increased 34% to around RMB25.8 billion.\n\nFollowing the success of Northbound Bond Connect, Southbound Bond Connect was launched in September, completing the two-way connection between the Mainland and international bond markets.  In the same month, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), the HKMA and the Monetary Authority of Macao promulgated the implementation details for the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Crossboundary WMC) Scheme in the Guangdong–Hong Kong– Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA).  In October, eligible banks in Hong Kong started providing Cross-boundary WMC services together with their Mainland partner banks.\n\n\n\nTo enhance Hong Kong’s role as a key offshore renminbi centre, a working group comprising the HKMA, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) was formed to conduct a feasibility study on promoting trading of renminbi-denominated equity securities in Hong Kong.  A joint seminar was also co-organised by the PBoC and the HKMA in December, showcasing Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre and a leading renminbi business hub.\n\nThe HKMA continues to make progress towards strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform.  In particular, to increase Hong Kong’s appeal as a preferred fund domicile, the HKMA worked closely with the Government and the financial industry to provide a more facilitating tax and regulatory environment for fund formation.  Significant strides were also made in further elevating Hong Kong’s position as a regional green and sustainable finance hub, and as a bond issuance centre. At the same time, the HKMA stepped up market outreach to promote Hong Kong’s financial services to overseas and Mainland stakeholders.\n\nSafe and efficient operation of financial infrastructure is fundamental for reinforcing Hong Kong’s position as a leading international financial centre.  In 2021, the four interbank Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) and the Hong Kong Trade Repository achieved 100%1 system availability, outperforming the target of 99.95%.  Following the launch of Southbound Bond Connect in September, the CMU became the settlement and custodian service provider for transactions conducted under both Northbound and Southbound Bond Connect.\n\nAdoption of the FPS continued to expand in 2021. The number of registrations grew to 9.6 million at the end of 2021 and the average daily turnover for the year rose by 90% from 2020.  Increased use of the FPS for settling Government bills, making merchant payments and topping up stored value facility (SVF) e-wallets or bank accounts were the key drivers for the continued rise in transaction volume, on top of a steady growth in person-to-person and business payments.\n\nTo promote the safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA oversees six designated retail payment systems (RPSs) and supervises 15 licensed SVFs under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO).  During the year, the HKMA facilitated the smooth implementation of the Government’s Consumption Voucher Scheme by co-ordinating and promoting dialogues and co-operation between the relevant Government parties and the SVF licensees appointed for the scheme.\n\nIn January 2022, the HKMA issued a discussion paper on crypto-assets and stablecoins, setting out the HKMA’s thinking on the relevant regulatory approach and inviting views from stakeholders.  Relevant factors, including feedback to this discussion paper and recommendations of relevant international bodies, will be taken into account when drawing up the appropriate regulatory regime.\n\nInternationally, the HKMA is an active member of the central banking community and plays a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees.  For example, the HKMA chairs the Working Group on Financial Markets (WGFM) established under the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP)2.  The HKMA also co-chairs the Policy and Standards Group of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), the Non-Bank Monitoring Experts Group and the Financial Innovation Network of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), and leads a team that looks into supervisory issues associated with financial benchmark transition.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2021\n\n# Hong Kong as a fintech hub in Asia\n\n# Fintech 2025\n\nIn June, the HKMA unveiled its “Fintech 2025” strategy to drive fintech development in Hong Kong.  The strategy aims to encourage the financial sector to adopt technology comprehensively by 2025, as well as to promote the provision of fair and efficient financial services for the benefit of Hong Kong citizens and the economy.  The five focus areas of the strategy are:\n\n- All banks go fintech\n- Future-proofing Hong Kong for CBDCs\n- Creating the next-generation data infrastructure\n- Expanding the fintech-savvy workforce\n- Nurturing the ecosystem with funding and policies\n\nThe HKMA’s “Fintech 2025” strategy drives fintech development in Hong Kong\n\n# Fintech Adoption in the Banking Sector\n\nTo support the “All banks go fintech” initiative of the “Fintech 2025” strategy, the HKMA rolled out the Tech Baseline Assessment in June 2021.  The assessment aims to help the HKMA develop a better understanding of the current fintech landscape in the banking sector, and identify which fintech areas may warrant the HKMA’s support.  All licensed banks with significant operations in Hong Kong were requested to develop a three-year plan for fintech adoption by the end of 2021.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA also continued to implement its two-year roadmap to promote Regtech adoption by banks in Hong Kong, and incorporate technology in its own supervisory processes to improve efficiency and effectiveness.  See page 98 of the Banking Stability chapter for more details.\n\n# Wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency\n\nThe HKMA and the Bank of Thailand expanded the scope of their joint research project with the joining of the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates and the Digital Currency Institute of the PBoC in February 2021.  Renamed as “Multiple Central Bank Digital Currency Bridge (mBridge)” and strongly supported by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Innovation Hub Centre in Hong Kong, the project further explores the capabilities of distributed ledger technology to facilitate real-time cross-border foreign exchange payment-versus-payment (PvP) transactions in a multi-jurisdictional context and on a 24/7 basis.  A joint report was published in September to deliver the interim findings, followed by the publication of potential use cases and a future roadmap in November.\n\n# Retail Central Bank Digital Currency\n\nTo future-proof Hong Kong in terms of CBDC readiness, the HKMA started a study on the prospect of issuing retail CBDC in Hong Kong, i.e. e-HKD, covering both technical and policy considerations.  In collaboration with the BIS Innovation Hub Centre in Hong Kong, the HKMA embarked on a study called Project Aurum to explore the technical aspect of issuing retail CBDC.  Separately, an internal cross-departmental working group was set up to study the relevant technical, policy and legal issues.  In October, the HKMA released a technical white paper titled e-HKD: A technical perspective to explore and invite comments on potential technical design options for issuing and distributing retail CBDC.\n\nFurthermore, the HKMA supports the Digital Currency Institute of the PBoC on the technical pilot testing of using e-CNY for cross-boundary payments.  This will help promote interconnection in the GBA and bring greater convenience to Hong Kong and Mainland tourists by enhancing the efficiency and user experience of cross-boundary payments.\n\n# Commercial Data Interchange\n\nIn July, the HKMA hosted a virtual symposium to encourage banks and SVF operators to join the CDI, a next-generation financial data infrastructure that aims to enable more efficient financial intermediation in the banking system.  To further facilitate development and adoption, the launch of the CDI Innovation Hub was announced during the symposium. To facilitate small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) financing, the HKMA completed two phases of proof-of-concept study examining the technical feasibility of the CDI.  Applying alternative data to facilitate credit assessment and the underwriting of loans, more than 550 SME loans exceeding HK$900 million in total were approved by the participating banks during the study.  Based on the encouraging results, the HKMA announced the pilot launch of the CDI in November.\n\nSME owners commend the CDI for streamlining their loan applications\n\n# Talent development\n\nTo expand the fintech talent pool, the HKMA continued to run the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme 2.0 in collaboration with its strategic partners3 to nurture young talent at various stages of their career development. More than 180 students benefitted from the scheme in 2021. Separately, the Industry Project Masters Network scheme was piloted in September to provide opportunities for master’s degree students majoring in fintech to work on real-life fintech projects.  To form strategic partnerships and foster collaboration in areas including fintech talent development, the HKMA entered into memorandums of understanding (MoUs) with four local universities in October.\n\nMr Colin Pou (middle), Executive Director (Financial Infrastructure) of HKMA, at the MoU signing ceremony with four local universities\n\n# Fintech Supervisory Sandbox\n\nThe use of Fintech Supervisory Sandbox (FSS) continued to rise during the year.

{"en": "# Reserves Management\n\nThe global financial markets embarked on a recovery path in 2021.  Although the global economy continued to be affected by the evolving COVID-19 pandemic situation, a number of factors, including an increasing vaccination rate as well as accommodative monetary policies and fiscal measures around the world, have contributed to notable recovery in the global economy and financial markets.  Against this background, a number of overseas equity markets achieved record highs during the year, and the Exchange Fund’s overall equity holdings were able to achieve a decent return despite the sluggish performance in Hong Kong equities. During 2021, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$191.9 billion, representing an investment return of 4.1%.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong.  The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre.  The HKMA, under the delegated authority of the Financial Secretary and within the terms of the delegation, is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(i) to preserve capital;\n(ii) to ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(iii) to ensure that sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(iv) subject to (i)–(iii), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Exchange Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 Portfolio Segregation of the Exchange Fund\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP).  The BP holds highly liquid US dollardenominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The IP invests primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member economies of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of its assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA diversifies part of the Exchange Fund’s investments in a prudent and incremental manner into a wider variety of asset classes.  This includes emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate.  Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP).  The HKMA has put in place a cap1 to guide the pace of diversification into the LTGP since its inception.  As the LTGP has become increasingly mature in investment scale and asset diversity, the EFAC decided in January 2022 to replace the cap by a target asset allocation that is determined concurrently with that of other asset classes, subject to prudent risk management principles.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007, holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that have been acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes.  The Strategic Portfolio is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of its unique nature.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by Fiscal Reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP2, with the major exception of the Future Fund3, which links its interest rate to the return of both the IP and the LTGP in accordance with the portfolio mix.  The portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 40:60 in 2021.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation.  The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents long-term asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund.  Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark.  This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark (or strategic) allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”.  While the benchmark and tracking error4 limit are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with the EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority.  Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may assume positions to take advantage of short-term market movements (Figure 2).\n\nFigure 2 Asset allocation of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nThe HKMA’s Exchange Fund Investment Office houses its investment and related risk management functions. Exchange Fund Investment Office staff members directly manage about 71% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, comprising the entire BP and part of the IP.  This part of the IP includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 29% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes.  The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to realise sustainable returns, draw on diverse and complementary investment styles, and gain market insights and technical expertise in investment.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes.  The expenditure is determined primarily by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe growing complexity of the investment environment underlines the importance of risk management.  The HKMA sets stringent controls and investment guidelines for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and ensures a proper risk monitoring and compliance system is in place. Three lines of defence are in place to implement effective risk management and governance of investment-related activities.  Key risk categories (including credit, market, liquidity and operational risks) are regularly monitored, and the risk management process provides a robust framework to support strategic planning and investment diversification.\n\n# RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT\n\nThe HKMA believes that, by putting an appropriate emphasis on responsible investment and sustainable long-term economic performance, it can better achieve the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund and reduce risks associated with environmental, social and governance (ESG)- related matters of its underlying investments.  The HKMA supports responsible investment by integrating ESG factors into the investment processes for both public and private market investments of the Exchange Fund, underpinned by the guiding principle that priority will generally be given to ESG investments if the long-term risk-adjusted return is comparable with other investments.  For more details about the HKMA’s responsible investment framework and implementation, see the Sustainability chapter on pages 184 to 191.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2021\n\nGlobal equity markets rose sharply and hit new record highs on the back of ultra-loose monetary policies and fiscal measures, driving an accelerated recovery of the global economy and financial markets.  However, Hong Kong and Mainland equity markets underperformed amid market reforms.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index in the US rose by 27%, while the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong dropped by 14%.\n\nFor the bond markets, rising inflation expectations and tapering of asset purchases by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) led to a rise in US Treasury yields and falling bond prices during 2021.  Ten-year US Treasury yields increased by about 60 basis points from 0.9% at the beginning of the year to 1.5% at the end of the year.\n\nIn the currency markets, the US dollar strengthened against other major currencies, particularly towards the end of 2021, on the back of expectations about the Fed’s tapering pace. In particular, the euro and the yen depreciated by 7.1% and 10.3% against the US dollar respectively.\n\nThe performance of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2021 is shown in Table 1.\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$191.9 billion in 2021.  This comprised gains on bonds of HK$12.6 billion, net gains on equities of HK$47.8 billion (with gains of HK$68.8 billion from foreign equities, and losses of HK$21.0 billion from Hong Kong equities), a positive currency translation effect of HK$16.8 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets and gains of HK$114.7 billion on other investments held by the investment-holding subsidiaries of the Fund. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$3.1 billion.\n\nTotal assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,570.2 billion at the end of the year.  The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$515.3 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$392.5 billion and real estate HK$122.8 billion.  Outstanding investment commitments of the LTGP amounted to HK$225.7 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund in 2021, excluding the Strategic Portfolio, was 4.1%.  Specifically, the IP achieved a rate of return of 3.7%, while the BP gained 0.4%.  The LTGP has recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 15.4% since its inception in 2009.\n\nThe annual returns of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2021 are set out in Chart 1.  Table 2 shows the 2021 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over several different time horizons.  The average return was 5.3% during 2019–2021, 4.7% during 2017–2021, 3.3% during 2012–2021 and 4.8% since 1994.

Following positive feedback to the online drama series “STEPS” in 2020, the HKMA launched a new series titled “Four Faces of Talents in Central” featuring four growing areas of the financial industry: data science, fintech, green and sustainable finance, and wealth management.  In the video series, the characters of the market practitioners were portrayed in a humorous manner, and seasoned industry players and young talents shared first-hand information on the nature and requirements of jobs, career opportunities and prospects across the above four growing areas.\n\n“Four Faces of Talents in Central” series keeps the young generation abreast of career opportunities in the financial market\n\nThe “Online Parenting and Educational Campaign” launched in 2020 was recognised with a Silver Award in the “Best Event — Corporate Social Responsibility” category of the MarketingInteractive’s Marketing Events Awards 2021.  Building on the campaign’s success and to sustain momentum, the HKMA rolled out additional initiatives, including a parenting financial education workshop where child education experts shared tips on how to teach kids good money sense and demonstrated a DIY (do-it-yourself) financial educational toy, as well as an animated virtual tour of the HKMA Information Centre.\n\nThe “Online Parenting and Educational Campaign” wins an award at the Marketing Events Awards 2021.  The campaign promotes money management concept and skills to let parents and kids learn in an amusing and entertaining way.\n\nTo enhance financial literacy among secondary school students, the HKMA and various stakeholders co-organised the “Hong Kong Financial Literacy Championship”, which featured a fintech theme.  Apart from an online quiz, a new financial design thinking workshop on personal financial management was added to train the participating students to develop innovative proposals on money management tools.  This initiative won the “Highest Student Participation Award” offered by the Business-School Partnership Programme under the Education Bureau, and the “Investor and Financial Education Award (Corporate) — Gold Award” offered by the Investor and Financial Education Council2 (IFEC).\n\nThe “Hong Kong Financial Literacy Championship” educates students on fintech and design thinking concepts and achieves record-high participation\n\nOther community engagement initiatives included talks or webinars for students and retirees.  The HKMA also participated in a teacher training webinar on economic security organised by the Education Bureau.  Online educational materials offering smart tips on using automated teller machines (ATMs) are available in eight languages3 to cater for people of different backgrounds living in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA supports the IFEC in promoting financial literacy and capacity in Hong Kong, and will explore further collaboration with stakeholders to maximise the impact of community engagement.\n\n# Financial disclosure\n\nTo maintain a high level of transparency, the HKMA adopts international standards in financial disclosure insofar as these are applicable to central banking operations.  These include the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and other applicable reporting requirements, for example, the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard.  The Finance Division works with external auditors and other accounting professionals to prepare and present the Exchange Fund’s financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards.  The HKMA also provides detailed disclosures and thorough analyses of a wide range of expense items and budgetary information in its Annual Report.\n\n# ACCOUNTABILITY AND CONTROLS\n\n# Risk management\n\nOne of the HKMA’s most important tasks is to manage risks to the monetary and banking systems.  Risk management is undertaken both at a working level in the day-to-day operations and at a higher level through strategic planning. Under the HKMA’s risk management framework, there are two high-level committees — the Macro Surveillance Committee and the Risk Committee — both of which are chaired by the Chief Executive of the HKMA.\n\nThe terms of reference of the Macro Surveillance Committee are:\n\n- to identify potential risks and threats to the monetary and financial system in Hong Kong and discuss possible measures to address such risks;\n- to review existing measures for managing risks in the monetary and financial system to identify possible gaps and ensure the adequacy of these measures; and\n- to encourage cross-departmental sharing of relevant information on macro surveillance with a view to enhancing the macro surveillance capability of the HKMA.\n\nThe terms of reference of the Risk Committee are:\n\n- to identify potential risks and threats to the organisation and devise strategies to reduce the impact of such events;\n- to review the existing system for managing risks across different departments to identify possible gaps and significant risks and ensure the adequacy of measures to address them;\n- to harmonise the criteria and methods of risk measurement and prioritise the resources management of risks identified; and\n- to encourage a stronger risk management culture institutionally which promotes the proper levels of authorisation and controls.\n\nA robust operational risk management framework is in place covering organisational risks at two levels: the entity level and the department level.  Entity-level risks refer mainly to those which concern the entire organisation in the medium term, or which might call for a cross-departmental response. Potential and emerging risks identified by business units, and the adequacy of the control measures and mitigating strategies they devise, are reviewed and reported every quarter.  This is supplemented by a top-down approach to manage entity-level risks, in which senior colleagues heading different business units actively identify risks of wider impact and propose mitigating measures.  The Risk Committee discusses these assessments and decides on appropriate follow-up actions.", "zh": "#公司职能\n\n公司功能支持HKMA的高水平透明度,效率和专业性.为了促进公众对其政策和运作的理解,HKMA通过传统和社交媒体,信息中心和其他道进行有效的沟通.在机构内,HKMA认真建立了敏捷和可持续的员工队伍,建立了严格的财务纪律,并升级了信息技术能力,以适应变化,并确保其政策和倡议的有效实施.\n\n#透明度\n\n# 媒体关系和社交媒体\n\n香港管理局与媒体密切合作,提高公众对其政策和运作的理解.在2021年,香港管理局举行或参加了169个实体和虚拟活动,包括8个新闻发布会,8个站立采访和153个其他公共功能.另外安排了27个媒体采访.在一年的时间里,共发布了632份双语新闻稿,并且每天处理大量媒体询问.\n\n为了提高对香港金融管理局关键职能的认识,为当地,大陆和外国媒体组织了新闻发布会和媒体简报.主题包括连接计划,金融技术 (fintech) 和利率基准改革.\n\n为了及时与公众互动,HKMA维护了五个社交媒体道,拥有超过8万名粉丝.HKMA利用社交媒体道,提高公众对各种主题的认识,特别是网络鱼骗局,在疫情期间大幅增加.此外,通过社交媒体进行了广泛的推广活动,使公众了解最新的发展趋势.\n\n香港金融管理局首席执行官埃迪·先生主持了2021年香港金融技术周的虚拟小组讨论.\n\n香港金融管理局副总裁霍华德·李先生主持媒体发布会,介绍了香港金融管理局的\"金融科技2025\"战略\n\n香港银行业副总裁Arthur Yuen先生在媒体发布会上就香港银行业为伦敦银行间提议利率的转变做好准备\n\n香港商贸管理局副总裁埃德蒙·劳先生接受国际新闻频道采访\n\n# 公共调查\n\n公共调查服务为公众提供了更好的理解功能和操作.在2021年,它处理了9781个调查.其中约有一半与银行政策和法规有关,以及金融基础设施和债务市场发展.一些值得注意的调查是关于硬币收集计划,银行产品和服务,银行相关的指导方针和通告以及零售债券发行计划.\n\n图1显示了自2018年以来收到的公众询问数量,图2则按询问性质进行了分类.\n\n图1 公开调查的总数\n\n图 2 在2021年收到的询问的性质\n\n# 出版物\n\n除了年度报告外,HKMA还出版了两期的半年货币和金融稳定报告,以及四季度公报的四期,并定期更新月度统计公报,提供最新的和主题性的信息和分析,以了解香港的货币,银行和经济问题.HKMA还出版了11篇Sight1文章,以介绍其主要的新举措和政策,并讨论相关的热点问题.\n\n香港管理协会2020年年度报告获得\"非营利性和慈善组织\"等奖项,并获得\"环境,社会和治理报告卓越奖项\".\n\n#公司网站\n\n公司网站 (www.hkma.gov.hk) 以英语,传统和简体中文提供超过44,000页的内容,是公众获取有关HKMA最新信息的门户.它包含授权机构 (AI) 和当地代表处的登记册以及AI的证券工作人员登记册,这两者都根据\"银行条例\"第20条维护,以及根据\"支付系统和存储价值设施条例\"的存储价值设施许可证人的登记册.\n\n自2018年以来,香港管理局通过开放应用程序编程接口 (API) 逐步发布财务数据和重要信息.到2021年底,香港管理局已在其网站上开放了148套开放API,符合目标时间表.\n\n# 信息中心\n\n香港金融管理局信息中心位于二国际金融中心的55层,是介绍香港金融管理局工作的重要设施,并促进了人们对金融管理局工作的认识.该中心包括一个展览区和一个图书馆.该中心还提供了有关香港金融管理局工作的信息和展览.\n\n为了保护COVID-19的公共健康和安全,信息中心采取了特殊的操作安排.加强了清洁和消毒,并定期使用抗菌涂层对设施和展品进行了消毒.\n\n香港证券交易所信息中心的展览区包括政策部分,货币部分和历史时间表.\n\n# 社区参与和公共教育\n\n为了接触到社区并提高公众对HKMA的工作认识,自1998年以来,已有超过2300名中学学生和教师参加了网络研讨会.网络研讨会涵盖了HKMA的工作概述,链接汇率系统,香港纸币,个人数字钥匙的保护,存款保护计划以及银行业的职业机会.迄今为止,已有超过63,000人参加了公共教育计划.\n\n香港金融管理局教育和吸引公众如何成为聪明和负责任的金融消费者.鉴于网络鱼诈骗的增加,香港金融管理局开展了一项以\"保护您的个人数字密钥;注意欺诈链接\"为主题的公众宣传活动,并通过跨媒体宣传敦促公众保持警,防止据称来自银行的短信和电子邮件中嵌入的欺诈性超链接.\n\n跨媒体推广提醒公众注意欺诈性超链接\n\n香港金融管理局还试图提高公众对金融业的了解,并提高年轻一代对该行业的职业生涯的兴趣.在2020年,香港金融管理局推出了一系列名为\"中部人才的四面\",其中包括金融业的四个增长领域:数据科学,金融科技,绿色和可持续金融和财富管理.在视频系列中,市场从业者的角色以幽默的方式描绘,经验丰富的行业参与者和年轻人才分享了上述四个增长领域的性质和职业前景.\n\n中部人才的四面系列让年轻一代了解金融市场的职业机会\n\n2020年推出的\"在线育儿和教育活动\"在\"营销互动\"营销活动奖2021年度\"最佳活动\"企业社会责任类别中获得银奖.为了巩固该活动的成功并保持势头,香港商业管理局推出了其他举措,包括一个育儿金融教育工作坊,儿童教育专家分享了如何教孩子善于理解金钱的技巧,并展示了DIY (DIY) 金融教育玩具,以及HKMA信息中心的动画虚拟参观.\n\n在线育儿和教育活动在2021年营销活动奖中获得奖项.该活动促进了资金管理概念和技能,让父母和孩子以有趣和娱乐的方式学习.\n\n为了提高中学生的财务素养,香港金融管理局和各方共同组织了\"香港金融素养锦标赛\",以金融科技为主题.除了在线测验,还增加了个人财务管理的新财务设计思维研讨会,以培训参与者制定资金管理工具的创新建议.该计划获得了教育局旗下商学院合作计划提供的\"最高学生参与奖\",以及投资者和金融教育委员会 (IFEC) 提供的\"金奖\".\n\n香港金融知识赛教育学生金融技术和设计思维概念,并实现创纪录的参与\n\n其他社区参与活动包括为学生和退休人员举办的讲座和网络研讨会.在线教育材料提供了使用自动取款机 (ATM) 的智能提示,以满足生活在香港的不同背景的人.\n\n香港金融管理局支持IFEC在香港促进金融知识和能力,并将进一步与利益相关者合作,以最大限度地提高社区参与的影响.\n\n# 财务披露\n\n为了保持高水平的透明度,香港管理局采用了适用于中央银行业务的国际标准.这些标准包括香港财务报告标准和其他适用于汇总的财务报告标准.\n\n#责任和控制\n\n# 风险管理\n\n香港金融管理局最重要的任务之一是管理货币和银行系统的风险.风险管理是在日常运营中的工作层面和通过战略规划的更高层面进行的.在香港金融管理局的风险管理框架下,有两个高级别委员会 - 宏观监督委员会和风险委员会 - 两者由香港金融管理局首席执行官主持.\n\n宏观监督委员会的职责是:\n\n香港的货币和金融系统可能面临的风险和威胁,并讨论应对这些风险的可能措施;\n\n风险委员会的工作范围是:\n\n组织的潜在风险和威胁,并制定减少这些事件的影响;审查现有的风险管理系统,以确定可能存在的差距和重大风险,并确保采取适当的措施来解决这些问题;协调风险测量标准和方法,并优先考虑对所发现风险的管理;鼓励在机构上建立更强大的风险管理文化,以促进适当的授权和控制.\n\n实体级风险主要是涉及整个组织的,或者可能需要跨部门的反应.业务单位发现的潜在和新出现的风险,以及他们设计的控制措施和减轻风险的充分性,都会在每个季度进行审查和报告."}
{"en": "# Sustainability\n\nThe HKMA is publishing its first sustainability report, as an integral part of its Annual Report 2021, to set out its strategy on sustainability and document its own efforts, as well as its joint efforts with the financial industry, to support the Government’s climate strategies and contribute to a more climate resilient and sustainable world.\n\nThe HKMA embeds sustainability considerations across its main roles and functions, whether as a banking supervisor, a market facilitator, a responsible investor, or in maintaining financial and monetary stability.  Moreover, the HKMA collaborates with local and overseas counterparts in strengthening the management and disclosures of climate risks, as well as the development of the green and sustainable finance market.\n\nIn addition, the HKMA is committed to fulfilling its corporate social responsibility, and aims to be a responsible and sustainable organisation. This commitment is manifested in various areas, including promoting a sustainable, financially inclusive and environmentally friendly marketplace, supporting the wider community, protecting the environment and nurturing a caring workplace.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nClimate change is one of the most pressing challenges facing the world today.  To combat climate change, countries agreed, under the Paris Agreement1, to take actions to cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and eventually achieve carbon neutrality within this century.  Meeting the Paris Agreement climate change target will require investments of an estimated US$1–2 trillion a year globally2, making sustainability one of the biggest drivers of capital flows in the decades ahead.\n\nHong Kong is determined to be at the forefront of this transition.  The Government announced that it will strive to achieve carbon neutrality before 2050, in line with developed economies globally.  Hong Kong is also the first Asian jurisdiction that has committed to specifically aligning disclosure requirements with recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) by 2025 across relevant sectors.\n\nTo the financial sector, climate change is both a source of risk and opportunity.  While the financial sector cannot be spared from the threats posed by climate change, it has a key role to play in the transition by channelling more financing to activities that are consistent with a pathway towards lower GHG emissions and climate-resilient developments.\n\nThe HKMA is committed to strengthening Hong Kong’s financial system to support a greener and more sustainable future, driving actions to support the Government’s climate goal and contributing to the global agenda.  In doing so, the HKMA incorporates sustainability considerations in carrying out its main functions and in running its operations.\n\nFirst, as a banking supervisor, the HKMA aims to strengthen resilience of the banking system against climate risks and to accelerate banks’ efforts in supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy.  To accomplish this, the HKMA has formulated a regulatory framework setting out supervisory requirements for banks to manage and disclose climate risks.  A pilot exercise on climate risk stress test to assess the resilience of the banking sector was also concluded successfully in 2021.  Meanwhile, on an ongoing basis, the HKMA takes into account climate change in monitoring financial stability risks.\n\nSecondly, in its market development role, the HKMA is focusing its efforts in enhancing Hong Kong’s role as a green and sustainable finance hub in the region, including the Greater Bay Area (GBA).  Hong Kong, being Mainland’s offshore financial centre, is well-positioned to channel global investments into Mainland’s plans to achieve peak carbon emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060.  The HKMA is also working through the Green and Sustainable Finance Cross-Agency Steering Group (CASG)3, which the HKMA co-chairs, to build industry capacity, address data gaps and explore the development of a local green classification framework.\n\nIn fact, Hong Kong is a leader in green finance solutions, having established the world’s first government Global Medium Term Note Programme dedicated to green bond issuances under the Government Green Bond Programme, and increased gradually the diversity of its issuances since 2019, both in terms of currencies and tenors.  To support the issuance of green and sustainable bonds and loans in the private sector, the Government set up the Green and Sustainable Finance Grant Scheme in May 2021. Administered by the HKMA, this scheme has incentivised more corporates to seek green and sustainable financing in Hong Kong, and encouraged more green advisers and external reviewers to establish or expand their presence here.\n\nThirdly, as the manager of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA has ensured that environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations are an integral part of its investment process and asset allocation decisions.  In the latter part of this report, the HKMA makes its inaugural disclosures on its climate scenario analysis and carbon footprint metrics of the Exchange Fund’s portfolios.\n\nFourthly, the HKMA is stepping up its own green office initiatives to ensure its own operations conform to best practices in the management and mitigation of climate risks.  As a start, the HKMA has established its carbon profile across Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions4, and made corresponding disclosures.  At the same time, the HKMA has implemented measures to enhance industry-wide operational efficiency and minimise resource consumption.  In addition, the HKMA holds itself to high standards of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and works with its stakeholders to promote financial inclusion and financial literacy.\n\nGreening the financial system requires close collaboration amongst central banks and supervisors.  The HKMA is an active member of the international community in global policymaking and alignment of sustainability standards. The HKMA has also issued a statement to support the Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) Glasgow Declaration5, reaffirming its commitment to delivering on the NGFS recommendations in taking the necessary measures to foster a greener financial system.\n\nIn driving these sustainability initiatives and assessing climaterelated opportunities and risks, sustainability and green considerations are embedded in the HKMA’s governance and risk management frameworks, in which the leadership is actively involved in setting the overarching objectives and guiding principles, in consultation with the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) and its sub-committees. The HKMA’s CSR and Sustainability Committee (CSC) also assesses the potential impacts of sustainability and climate-related issues on the organisation, and devises strategies to reduce the impacts.  Execution of the relevant strategies and initiatives is closely monitored and reported to the top management regularly.  In addition, external consultants have been engaged to advise the HKMA in selected areas of work.\n\nThe subsequent sections of this chapter will delve into the HKMA’s governance, strategies and risk management measures in undertaking green finance and sustainability work in each of its roles.\n\nThis report is prepared with reference to the disclosure elements recommended in the NGFS’s Guide on Climaterelated Disclosure for Central Banks, published in December 2021.  In addition, information in relation to the HKMA’s office operations makes broad reference to the reporting principles under the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards6 and the ESG Reporting Guide promulgated by the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited.\n\n# Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System\n\nThe NGFS provides a platform for central banks and prudential supervisory authorities to exchange experiences, share best practices, contribute to the development of environmental and climate risk management in the financial sector, and mobilise mainstream finance to support the transition towards a sustainable economy.  Its purpose is to define and promote best practices to be implemented within and outside of the membership of the NGFS, and to conduct or commission analytical work on green finance.\n\n# Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures\n\nIn December 2015, the Financial Stability Board created the TCFD to develop recommendations for more effective climate-related disclosures by companies to investors, lenders and insurance underwriters that could promote more informed decisions.  The TCFD’s recommendations are structured around four thematic areas that represent the core elements of how organisations operate: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets.\n\n# BANKING SUPERVISOR\n\nAs the core part of the financial system, banks should be proactive in managing climate risks, and support channelling more capital to green and sustainable activities.  As a banking supervisor, the HKMA focuses on building banks’ resilience against climate risks and accelerating banks’ efforts in supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\n# Overview of the HKMA’s three-phased approach\n\nSince May 2019, the HKMA has been promoting green and sustainable banking in three phases:\n\n# Phase I\n\nDeveloping a common framework to assess the “greenness baseline” of individual banks, and collaborating with international bodies to provide technical support to banks in Hong Kong.\n\n# Phase II\n\nConsulting the industry and other stakeholders on the supervisory expectations and requirements of green and sustainable banking.\n\n# Phase III\n\nFocusing on the implementation of supervisory requirements, monitoring and evaluation of banks’ progress in green and sustainable banking.\n\n# Guidance\n\n# Supervisory requirements on climate risk management\n\nIn 2020, the HKMA developed a common framework for assessing the “greenness baseline” of individual banks in collaboration with the industry.  The HKMA also conducted the first greenness assessment of banks, which marked the completion of Phase I.  To help banks prepare for the new supervisory requirements, a white paper was published in June 2020, which outlined the HKMA’s initial thinking on supervisory expectations for climate risk management.\n\nIn December 2021, following an industry consultation, the HKMA issued the supervisory requirements for banks to incorporate climate considerations into governance, strategy, risk management and disclosure.  In particular, specific requirements and concrete timeline were set out in mandating climate-related disclosures based on the recommendations of the TCFD before 2025. The requirements will set a benchmark to help banks upgrade their risk management capability.\n\nThe next step is for the HKMA to monitor banks’ implementation of the relevant requirements.  In this regard, the HKMA has stepped up its supervisory capacity by setting up a new dedicated team within its Banking Supervision Department to carry out climate risk supervision.\n\nThis three-phased approach is an iterative and evolving process.  Further to the first round of greenness assessment conducted in 2020, the HKMA is reviewing the framework to encompass the new supervisory requirements on climate risk management and potentially cover a wider scope, such as other environmental risks and measures for supporting the net zero transition.   The HKMA intends to launch an updated framework in the second half of 2022.\n\n# Sound practices supporting the transition to carbon neutrality\n\nApart from incorporating climate risk considerations into the risk management framework, some banks have devoted resources and taken measures to support the goals of the Paris Agreement and contribute to achieving global net zero emissions.  The HKMA issued a circular in December 2021 to share with the industry the sound practices of these banks which would be of reference value to other banks in the industry in formulating their climate strategies.  These sound practices are grouped into four areas: reducing GHG emissions of the banks’ own operations, reducing financed emissions through portfolio alignment, assisting clients to transition, and promoting collective efforts to assist the economy to achieve a net-zero transition.\n\n# Green classification framework to facilitate green finance flows\n\nTo increase transparency across the financial markets and enable consistent policy making on green finance, the HKMA has been working with other financial regulators to explore a local green classification framework, which will facilitate navigation among the Common Ground Taxonomy (CGT) developed by the International Platform on Sustainable Finance (IPSF)8 and the green definitions adopted by China and European Union, for adoption across different financial sectors.  The work will be guided by the principles of interoperability, comparability and inclusiveness, taking into account other definitions of green, transitional activities and local considerations.  This initiative will reduce the risk of green washing, improve product comparability and ultimately enhance investor protection.\n\n# Assessment: climate risk stress test\n\nTo assess the banking sector’s ability to cope with potential shocks brought about by climate change, the HKMA undertook a pilot exercise on climate risk stress test (CRST), which included the participation of 20 major retail banks and seven branches of international banking groups.  A report summarising the results of the pilot CRST exercise was published in December 2021.  The results showed that the banking sector remained resilient even in the face of extreme climate-related shocks, although these shocks could potentially give rise to significant adverse impacts on banks’ financials.  The CRST exercise helped to enhance banks’ capabilities for measuring and assessing climate risks. In light of the CRST results, the participating banks have devised plans to strengthen their climate strategies and risk governance frameworks.

{"en": "# The Exchange Fund\n\nReport of the Director of Audit Exchange Fund Financial Statements\n\n# Audit Commission The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 217 to 319, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2021, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2021, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards.  My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report.  I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards.  I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021.  These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.5, 2.6 and 38.1 to the financial statements.\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, the Group had financial assets totalling HK$4,502,475 million and financial liabilities totalling HK$1,150,861 million valued at fair value.\n\nFor 89% of these financial assets and all these financial liabilities, their fair values were quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 inputs) or were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data (Level 2 inputs).\n\nFor the remaining 11% of these financial assets, their fair values were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data (Level 3 inputs).  Such financial assets totalled HK$517,316 million, including mainly unlisted investment funds.\n\nGiven the substantial amount and the estimations involved, valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value was a key audit matter.\n\nThe audit procedures on valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value included:\n\n- obtaining an understanding of the procedures, including relevant controls, for valuing different categories of financial assets and financial liabilities;\n- evaluating and testing the controls, including relevant application controls of the computer systems;\n- obtaining external confirmations on the valuation, existence, rights and obligations and completeness of the financial assets and financial liabilities;\n- where quoted market prices were used, verifying the prices to independent sources;\n- where valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions, and verifying the inputs to independent sources; and\n- where valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Valuation of investment properties at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.11, 18 and 19 to the financial statements.\n\nThe Group’s investment properties were stated at their fair values, totalling HK$27,089 million as at 31 December 2021. The Group also had interests in one associate and twenty one joint ventures totalling HK$45,172 million, whose principal activities were holding overseas investment properties.  The fair values of these investment properties, whether held by the Group directly or by associate or joint ventures, were mainly determined based on valuations by independent professional valuers.  Such valuations involved significant judgments and estimates, including the valuation methodologies and the assumptions used.\n\nThe audit procedures on valuation of investment properties at fair value included:\n\n- obtaining and reviewing the valuation reports of investment properties held by the Group directly or by associate or joint ventures, and verifying that the fair values were based on the valuations stated in the valuation reports;\n- assessing the independence and qualifications of the valuers; and\n- evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information.  The other information comprises all the information included in the 2021 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.  If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact.  I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.  I also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.  The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.  If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion.  My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report.  However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and\n- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements.  I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit.  I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.  I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nJohn Chu Director of Audit", "zh": "# 交换基金\n\n审计交易所董事报告 财务报表\n\n# 审计委员会 香港特别行政区政府\n\n# 独立审计报告给财政秘书\n\n# 意见\n\n我证实我已经审计了汇丰基金及其子公司的财务报表,包括汇丰基金和集团的2021年12月31日的资产负债表,综合收益表,股权变动表和现金流表,以及财务报表的附注,包括重要会计政策的摘要.\n\n根据我认为,财务报表真实地反映了基金和集团在2021年12月31日的财务状况,以及根据香港注册会计师协会 (HKICPA) 发布的\"香港财务报表标准\" (HKFRSs) 完成的财务业绩和现金流,并按照交易所条例第7条 (第66章) 制定的行政主管的指示进行准备.\n\n# 根据意见\n\n我根据交易所条例第7条和审计委员会的审计标准进行了审计.我根据这些标准对集团独立,并根据这些标准履行了其他伦理责任.我认为我获得的审计证据足够和适当,以提供我的意见.\n\n# 关键的审计问题\n\n关键审计问题是我在审计2021年12月31日结束的财务报表时最重要的,这些问题是在我审计整个财务报表时所解决的,我对这些问题没有提供单独的意见.\n\n# 金融资产和金融负债的估值\n\n参考财务报表的第2.5条,第2.6条和第38.1条.\n\n截至2021年12月31日,该集团的金融资产总额为4,502,475万港元,金融负债总额为1,150,861万港元,按公允价值估值.\n\n对于89%的金融资产和所有金融负债,它们的公允价格是对相同资产或负债的活跃市场的报价 (一级输入),或是使用基于可观测市场数据的输入技术进行估计.\n\n对于剩余的11%的金融资产,其公允价值是使用了不基于可观测的市场数据的估值技术 (第三级输入).这些金融资产总计为517.316亿港元,其中主要包括非上市的投资基金.\n\n鉴于所涉及的大量资金和估计,以公允价值评估金融资产和金融负债是审计的一个关键问题.\n\n金融资产和金融负债的价值评估包括:\n\n- - 了解评估的程序,包括计算机系统的相关应用控制; - - 在使用报价市场时,向独立的来源核实价格; - - 在使用非市场数据的评估技术时,向独立的来源核实价格.\n\n# 投资物业的估值在公允价值\n\n参考财务报表的第2.11条,第18条和第19条.\n\n集团的投资物业以其公允价值进行了表述,总额为27089万港元.集团还持有1家关联公司和21家合资企业,其主要活动是持有海外投资物业.这些投资物业的公允价值主要是基于独立的专业估值师的估值.这些估值师涉及到包括估值方法和使用的假设在内的重要判断.\n\n投资物业的价值评估包括:\n\n- 获取和审查本集团直接或通过关联公司或合资企业持有的投资物业的估值报告,并核实公允价值是基于估值报告中的估值; - 评估估值人员的独立性和资格; - 评估估值方法的适当性以及假设和投入的合理性.\n\n#其他信息\n\n其他信息包括香港货币局的2021年年度报告,除了财务报表和我会计师的报告.\n\n我对财务报表的看法并不涵盖其他信息,我没有表达任何形式的保证性结论.\n\n在我对财务报表的审计中,我的责任是阅读其他信息,并考虑其他信息是否与财务报表或我在审计中获得的知识相矛盾.如果我根据我完成的工作得出结论,那么我必须报告这一事实.我没有关于此事的报道.\n\n#货币机构和汇率基金咨询委员会的审计小组委员会对财务报表的责任\n\n货币局负责根据HKICPA发布的财务报表和根据交换基金条例第7条的行政指令编制财务报表,以确保没有因欺诈或错误而导致的重大错误.\n\n在编制财务报表时,货币局负责评估集团继续经营的能力,并酌情披露与经营运营有关的情况,并使用经营运营的会计基础.\n\n汇率基金咨询委员会的审计小组负责监督集团的财务报告流程.\n\n# 审计员对财务报表的审计责任\n\n我的目标是获得合理的保证,以确保整个财务报表没有重大误报,无论是由于欺诈或错误,并发布包含我的审计报告.合理的保证是保证高水平,但并不能保证按照审计委员会审计标准进行的审计总是会发现存在重大误报.误报可能是由于欺诈或错误而产生的,如果单独或总体而言,可以合理地预期它们会影响用户基于这些财务报表而做出的经济决策.\n\n作为符合审计委员会的审计标准的一部分,我在整个审计过程中都保持专业判断力和专业怀疑.\n\n- 识别和评估财务报表存在重大误报的风险,无论是由于欺诈还是错误,设计和执行符合这些风险的审计程序,并获得足够和适当的审计证据,以提供我意见的基础.由于欺诈导致的重大误报未被发现的风险,高于由于错误导致的重大误报的风险,因为欺诈可能涉及勾结,伪造,故意遗漏,误报或违反内部控制; - 了解与审计有关的内部控制,以便设计在特定情况下适当的审计程序,但不用于对集团内部控制的有效性发表意见; - 评估所采用的会计政策的适当性和会计估计和相关披露的合理性; - 根据财务报表的财务报表,我继续以审计机构的总体情况,包括财务报表的内容或财务报表的内容,以获得足够证据或证据,以合理的方式进行审计,以期我能够表达对财务报表的意见,包括对财务报表的内容或财务报表的内容,以及对审计机构的财务报表的财务报表的内容或相关事件的不确定性; - 如果我对审计机构的财务报表现或财务报表达的内容或财务报表达的情况有充分的担忧,我可能继续以审计或以审计师的财务报表达的财务报表达方式进行审计,包括财务报表现,或财务报表达财务报表现的情况,以审计,或以审计师的财务报表现为基础上所获得的财务报表达的财务报表现,或财务报表达的情况; - 如果我有任何不确定性或有任何其他相关情况,我有责任于审计,我可能继续以审计师会对审计,包括财务报表达财务报表达财务报表现的财务报表现或财务报表现,包括财务报表现,包括财务报表现,或财务报表现,或财务报表现,包括财务报表现现现,或\n\n我与汇丰基金咨询委员会进行沟通,包括我在审计过程中发现的重大缺陷.\n\n我还向汇丰基金咨询委员会提交一份声明,证明我遵守了有关独立性的相关要求,并向他们通报了可能影响我独立性的所有关系和其他问题,以及适用时的相关保障措施.\n\n从与交易所咨询委员会的审计小组决定了当前期的审计问题,并因此成为审计报告中的关键问题.除非法律或法规禁止公开此事,否则我决定不将此事公开,因为这样做会造成不利的后果.\n\n查理 审计总监"}

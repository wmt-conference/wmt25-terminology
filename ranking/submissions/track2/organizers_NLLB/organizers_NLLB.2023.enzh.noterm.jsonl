{"en": "# Resilience in the face of adversity\n\nReverberations from slowing global economic growth amid a “high for longer” interest rate environment and intensifying geopolitical tensions — not just stemming from the RussiaUkraine war and China-US tensions but also the outbreak of conflict in the Middle East — were the key themes for the financial markets in 2023. The March banking turmoil in the US and Europe, the most significant system-wide banking stress since the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, weighed further on market sentiment. Major economies grappled with the harsh realities of tightened monetary conditions and greater uncertainty over the inflationary path and interest rate outlook. Adding to the uncertainty was the pace of Mainland China’s economic recovery, which was slower than general market expectations.\n\nWith volatility and unpredictability becoming the “new normal” in financial markets, Hong Kong has again demonstrated its well-known ability to adapt, showing remarkable resilience. Since the city’s full-fledged post-COVID reopening last year, much work has been done to attract people back to our dynamic city and reconnect them with Hong Kong. The HKMA has contributed by hosting a series of large-scale international events such as the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit and conferences with the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), which showcased our vibrant city and helped send the message worldwide that Hong Kong, as a major international financial centre (IFC), is open for business and remains the centre of action and innovation. There are clear signs of gradual recovery, driven by an encouraging revival of inbound tourism and improved private consumption, also supported by a resilient labour market and the various support measures rolled out by the Government. For 2023 as a whole, Hong Kong’s gross domestic product growth bounced back to 3.2% from negative territory in 2022.\n\nThe HKMA entered its fourth decade in 2023. The past 30 years have seen the dynamics of the economy and the financial markets change drastically, with technology driving advances beyond anyone’s wildest imagination. The invaluable experience and wisdom gained over the past three decades have enabled us to face the future with confidence. Despite macroeconomic headwinds and an uncertain external environment, the HKMA will continue to uphold its mandate of safeguarding monetary and banking stability in Hong Kong, and will actively pursue developmental opportunities to anchor that stability and cement the city’s status as a leading IFC.\n\nFormer and current Financial Secretaries of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Chief Executives of HKMA at a gathering to celebrate the HKMA’s 30th anniversary: (from left) Mr Joseph Yam, Mr Henry Tang, Mr Donald Tsang, Mr Paul Chan, Mr Eddie Yue, Mr Antony Leung, Mr John Tsang, and Mr Norman Chan\n\n# LERS — Weathering the storms\n\nLast year marked the 40th anniversary of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), a staunch pillar supporting Hong Kong’s strong and stable monetary and financial systems. Four decades of transparent and effective operation have nurtured confidence in the LERS and its credibility in the market. Throughout the year, the Hong Kong dollar stayed within the Convertibility Zone and the Hong Kong dollar market operated smoothly, reflecting the strong market confidence in the LERS, a confidence also shared and expressed by the International Monetary Fund and global market players.\n\nBehind this confidence lie the HKMA’s proactive efforts in public and market engagements, along with effective surveillance. We spared no effort during the year in communicating with key stakeholders to foster a clear understanding of the functioning of the LERS, which is all the more important in times of volatility, be it stemming from economic stress or political uncertainties. We also strengthened surveillance of our monetary system, leveraging the use of datasets from the trade repository and expanded granular data from banks, as well as advanced data analytics and artificial intelligence, to enhance our capability, enabling more timely and comprehensive analysis of financial stability and macro-prudential surveillance.\n\n# Banking system — A major source of stability\n\nDespite a multitude of challenges including the high-interestrate environment, persistent geopolitical tensions and a challenging credit landscape, Hong Kong’s banking system remained stable throughout the year, underpinned by strong capital and liquidity buffers.\n\nAs at the end of 2023, the consolidated total capital ratio of local banks stood at 21.1%, well above the international minimum requirement of 8%. The Liquidity Coverage Ratio of large banks edged up to 178.6% as of the fourth quarter of 2023, likewise well above the statutory minimum requirement of 100%. While the classified loan ratio increased slightly from 1.40% at the end of 2022 to 1.56% at the end of 2023, it remained below the long-term historical average of 2.0%. The increase was mainly driven by exposures to Mainland privately-owned enterprise (POE) property developers; but such exposure levels were generally well-contained as a result of banks’ prudent credit risk management over the years, and the overall asset quality of the banking sector remained sound.\n\nWhat caught most market players by surprise in 2023 was unquestionably the banking turmoil in the US spilling over to Europe, which created a level of system-wide banking stress unseen since the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. The HKMA remained on high alert as the situation unfolded and took a number of precautionary actions to limit any potential adverse spillover effects on confidence in the local banking and financial systems. This, coupled with the strong capital and liquidity buffers maintained by banks in Hong Kong, meant that our banking sector was largely unaffected by the turmoil, remaining resilient even as the global financial markets were roiled. In the aftermath of this episode, the HKMA conducted a comprehensive internal review with a view to drawing out lessons for the local banking sector and strengthening the HKMA’s supervisory effectiveness and agility to handle a banking crisis should one occur.\n\nWhile prudent credit risk management is important, we have always reiterated our supervisory expectation for banks to be mindful of the need to support the real economy. As the orderly exit from the banking sector’s Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme commenced in July 2023 with the economic effects of COVID-19 receding, the HKMA worked closely with banks to ensure a gradual and smooth transition to normal loan repayment with flexibility for those borrowers who continued to be under pressure. Earlier this year, recognising that some small and medium-sized enterprises are still facing challenges in their operations despite the end of the pandemic, nine new measures were rolled out to further assist them in obtaining financing from banks.\n\nHaving reviewed the risks associated with the local property market in the context of banks’ property lending, the HKMA announced in July 2023 the first relaxation of the countercyclical macroprudential measures for residential properties since their introduction in 2009. This relaxation increased the loan-to-value ratio cap for most residential mortgage loans as well as for financing for property development and investment. It was later followed by suspension of the interest rate stress testing requirement in early 2024.\n\nThe HKMA’s supervision of financial institutions has been moving with the times. With recent years having seen a sharp global increase in fraud cases, we have considerably stepped up our efforts to counter new fraud tactics by introducing a holistic set of measures to protect bank customers. These include enhancing information sharing between banks and with law enforcement agencies; strengthening the monitoring of suspicious transactions (including implementation of real-time fraud monitoring and tightened payment card authentication); empowering customers to have more controls on their payment cards; and educating customers and raising public awareness of frauds with the launch of the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter, as well as a pre-transaction alert mechanism which warns users if a higher-risk Faster Payment System (FPS) transaction is spotted.\n\nIn light of a proliferation of innovative and digital banking products and services, the HKMA has worked with the banking industry to step up consumer and investor protection more broadly and enhance the banks’ operational and cyber resilience, as well as their collective defences against systemic cyber events. At the same time, all major banks have considerably strengthened their capabilities to respond to, and recover from, destructive ransomware attacks. The HKMA together with the industry has also pursued various consumer data infrastructure projects, such as the “Credit Data Smart” pilot programme to enhance consumer credit reference services, and taken forward a cross-boundary credit reference initiative to facilitate crossboundary financing activities by corporates.\n\nFintech and digitalisation can bring about enormous opportunities when the risk is properly managed. Leveraging earlier success in facilitating the uptake of Regtech, the HKMA, with the support of the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Insurance Authority, published a new Fintech Promotion Roadmap in August 2023 to promote further development of fintech by financial institutions in five focus areas — Wealthtech, Insurtech, Greentech, artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology. We anticipate local regulators continuing to collaborate and work closely together with their industry sectors in the coming years in order for the Hong Kong financial industry as a whole to keep abreast and reap the benefits of dynamic fintech development.\n\n# Hong Kong as an IFC — The centre of action and innovation\n\nIn 2023, we fully emerged from the pandemic. Hong Kong was not only back in business but its position as one of the world’s leading IFCs was further underscored by the return of global investors and our strengthened global network. Domestically, we took the opportunity of the 30th anniversary of the HKMA’s establishment to host a series of large-scale, international events with top-level participation from the global financial and banking community to demonstrate Hong Kong’s vibrancy and to send a clear message that Hong Kong as an IFC remained relevant and indispensable to global investors and financial institutions seeking growth and innovation. Of particular note was the return of the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit, held in November, which attracted to our city more than 350 international and regional leaders from some 160 global financial institutions. Other high-powered events hosted in Hong Kong included a meeting of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) and two HKMA-BIS Conferences which were among the largest gatherings of central bank governors and banking supervisors of the year. These events attest to the global financial sector’s commitment to and confidence in Hong Kong.\n\nExternally, 2023 was also a year in which Hong Kong proactively reached out to strengthen its connections with traditional markets including the US and Europe, as well as new destinations such as those in the Middle East. We met with peer regulators and top management of global financial institutions in these markets to both apprise and update them on the opportunities in Hong Kong and the Mainland, while seeking out new collaboration opportunities for Hong Kong.\n\nTo complement these engagement efforts, we actively contributed to the work of international and regional forums by taking up certain leadership roles. During the year, I accepted invitations to chair the BIS Meeting of Governors from Major Emerging Market Economies and to co-chair the Financial Stability Board (FSB)’s Regional Consultative Group for Asia. My colleagues are also chairing or co-chairing a number of other important groupings under the Basel Committee, the Financial Action Task Force, and the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks, to name a few. The HKMA’s leadership at many regional and international forums is a recognition of Hong Kong’s expertise and contribution to international central banking and regulatory efforts in the pursuit of global monetary and financial stability, as well as Hong Kong’s importance as an IFC.\n\nTo build on the above accomplishments, we must position ourselves as a forward-looking IFC, staying ahead of the curve to ensure our ongoing competitiveness. We have identified three long-term trends in the coming years that will shape our future: namely the continued opening-up of the Mainland, the development of green and sustainable finance and the deployment of fintech. We will continue to support the development of our financial markets to capture the opportunities from these long-term trends while positioning our financial platform to provide leading services to attract more businesses to Hong Kong.

{"en": "# Highlights of 2023\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nDespite a challenging external environment, the Hong Kong economy stages a positive growth in 2023, driven by revivals in inbound tourism and domestic demand. The labour market continues to improve alongside the economic recovery, while inflation remains moderate. Economic activities for 2024 are expected to recover further at a moderate pace, although the outlook is clouded by multiple external uncertainties.\n\nThe banking sector in Hong Kong remains sound in 2023, supported by strong capital and liquidity buffers. Asset quality remains at a healthy level.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nAmid market expectations of a “high for longer” US policy rate, the Hong Kong dollar mostly trades on the weak side of the Convertibility Zone in 2023, with the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking being triggered eight times between mid-February and early May. The Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets remain stable, and continue to trade in a smooth and orderly manner.\n\n2023 marks the 40th anniversary of the Linked Exchange Rate System. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, the Linked Exchange Rate System has helped Hong Kong weather a succession of shocks and crises in the past four decades, demonstrating the system’s resilience and robustness.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA responds swiftly to the March banking turmoil in the US and Europe — from managing the ripple effects to completing an internal review drawing lessons for the local banking sector, while maintaining its focus on the credit, liquidity and market risk management of banks. In light of escalating cyber threats and increasing use of technology services provided by third parties, the HKMA also works closely with banks to enhance their operational and cyber resilience.\n\nThe HKMA enhances consumer protection on payment cards, and through further revision of the Code of Banking Practice as well as the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter. The HKMA works with fellow regulators on a balanced regulatory regime for virtual asset-related activities, streamlines the selling process for sophisticated professional investors, introduces enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Pilot Scheme, and commences supervision of trust business. A pilot programme on consumer credit reference services under “Credit Data Smart” is also launched.\n\nThe HKMA’s efforts in anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism reflect a commitment to targeting the highest threats under a risk-based approach. To address increasing digital fraud, the HKMA has strengthened ecosystem collaboration through the launch of real-time fraud monitoring, enhanced information sharing between banks and with law enforcement agencies, intensified public education, and launched a new pre-transaction alert mechanism when using the Faster Payment System. In parallel, supervisory technology capabilities have been advanced through the Macro Analytics pilot scheme.\n\nThe HKMA makes good progress on implementing international supervisory standards locally, including those on capital adequacy and disclosure, and makes notable efforts in enhancing capacity building in the banking sector.\n\nThe HKMA also advances its work to ensure a credible resolution regime, including developing a new resolution standard on accessing critical financial market infrastructures, and completing a review on the implementation of loss-absorbing capacity policy standards.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\nThe successful conclusion of the second Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit and the HKMA-BIS High-Level Conference demonstrates the global financial sector’s commitment to and confidence in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA works closely with its Mainland and Hong Kong counterparts to deepen and widen the mutual access between the Hong Kong and Mainland financial markets. This includes enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Scheme, designation of additional market makers for Southbound Trading under Bond Connect, the successful launch of Northbound Trading of Swap Connect, and the roll-out of the HKD-RMB Dual Counter Model and the Dual Counter Market Making Programme, all of which are effective in solidifying Hong Kong’s status as a global hub for offshore renminbi business.\n\nOn strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, notable progress is made in areas including bond issuance, asset and wealth management, green and sustainable finance, and corporate treasury centres.\n\nThe HKMA continues to make significant progress on various fronts of the “Fintech 2025” strategy. Project mBridge enters the Minimum Viable Product development phase, Phase 1 of the e-HKD Pilot Programme is completed, and Commercial Data Interchange sees increasing usage and the successful linkage with Government data source. Moreover, a new Fintech Promotion Roadmap is announced to further develop Wealthtech, Insurtech, Greentech, artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology in the banking sector. Meanwhile, the Faster Payment System marks its fifth anniversary and continues to see expanded adoption and enhancements including new functionalities like the linkage with Thailand’s PromptPay for cross-border QR payment. Significant progress is also made in relation to developing a regulatory regime for stablecoin issuers, with a public consultation paper published for gathering views on the legislative proposal.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\nDespite a volatile and challenging investment environment, the Exchange Fund manages to achieve a decent investment income of HK$226.0 billion, representing an investment return of 5.5%.\n\nThe HKMA continues its efforts on asset diversification and responsible investing. Meanwhile, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio records an annualised internal rate of return of 11.8% since its inception in 2009.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains active communication with the community and the market through different channels to promote public understanding about its policies and operations.\n\nInternally, the HKMA strives to build an agile and professional workforce, maintain rigorous financial discipline and upgrade its digital capabilities to adapt to changes and ensure effective implementation of its policies and initiatives.", "zh": "#2023年的亮点\n\n#经济和金融环境\n\n尽管外部环境充满挑战,但香港经济在2023年仍呈现积极增长,主要是由于入境旅游和国内需求的复苏.劳动力市场随着经济复苏而继续改善,而通货膨胀仍处于温和状态.尽管前景受到多种外部不确定性的影响,但经济活动仍将以温和的速度复苏.\n\n香港的银行业在2023年仍然稳健,受到强大的资本和流动性缓冲的支持.资产质量仍然处于健康水平.\n\n#货币稳定性\n\n在市场预期的\"高长期\"美国政策利率下,香港美元在2023年主要在可转换区的弱点上交易,而弱点的可转换承诺在2月中旬到5月初之间被触发了8次.香港美元的汇率和货币市场保持稳定,并继续以顺利和有序的方式交易.\n\n作为香港货币和金融稳定的基石,联汇率系统在过去四十年中帮助香港度过了一系列的冲击和危机,证明了该系统的弹性和稳定性.\n\n#银行稳定\n\n香港管理局迅速应对美国和欧洲3月份的银行动荡事件,从管理波动效应到完成内部审查,为当地银行部门吸取教训,同时继续关注银行信用,流动性和市场风险管理.鉴于网络威胁的不断升级和第三方提供技术服务的日益使用,香港管理局还与银行密切合作,以加强其运营和网络弹性.\n\n香港管理局通过进一步修订银行行为准则以及反欺诈消费者保护章程,为复杂的专业投资者提供均衡的监管制度,并对跨境财富管理连接试点进行监督.\n\n香港金融管理局在反洗钱和反恐怖主义方面所做的努力反映了以风险为基础的目标.为了应对日益严重的数字欺诈,香港金融管理局通过实时欺诈监控,加强银行与执法机构之间的信息共享,并通过使用快速支付系统推出了新的交易前警报机制.\n\n香港金融管理局在地方实施国际监管标准方面取得了很好的进展,包括资本充足性和披露标准,并在加强银行业能力建设方面作出了显著努力.\n\n香港管理局还在推进确保可信度的解决方案,包括制定有关访问关键金融市场的新标准,并完成对吸收损失能力政策的审查.\n\n#国际金融中心\n\n香港金融机构的第二次投资峰会成功结束,证明了全球金融部门对香港的承诺.\n\n香港管理局与内地同行密切合作,深化和扩大香港与内地的金融市场.这包括加强跨境财富管理连接计划,在债券连接下指定额外的市场制定者,成功推出交换连接的北方交易,以及推出香港人民币双反制造模式和双反制造市场计划,所有这些都有效地巩固了香港作为离岸人民币业务的全球枢纽.\n\n香港金融平台的竞争力在债券发行,资产和财富管理,绿色和可持续金融以及企业财务中心等领域取得了显著进展.\n\n香港金融管理局在\"金融科技2025\"战略的各个方面取得了重大进展.项目mbridge进入了最低可行的产品开发阶段,e-HKD试点计划的第一阶段已经完成,商业数据交换也在不断增加,并与政府数据源相连接.此外,还宣布了新的金融科技推广路线图,以进一步发展银行业的财富科技,保险科技,绿色科技,人工智能和分布式账本技术.与此同时,快速支付系统也在不断扩大,包括与泰国钱快速支付的联系.\n\n#储备管理\n\n尽管投资环境充满波动和挑战,但交易所基金仍能获得相当高的投资收入,达到2260亿港元,投资回报率为5.5%.\n\n香港管理局继续努力实现资产多元化和负责任投资,而长期增长组合则自2009年开始以来一直保持着11.8%的年化内部收益率.\n\n#公司职能\n\n香港商贸管理局通过不同的道与社区和市场保持积极的沟通,以促进公众对其政策和运营的理解.\n\n香港管理局努力建立敏捷和专业的员工队伍,保持严格的财务纪律,并升级其数字能力,以适应变化,并确保其政策和倡议的有效实施."}

{"en": "# Priorities for 2024 and Beyond\n\nEntering 2024, the Hong Kong economy is expected to continue to recover at a moderate pace, riding on the ongoing revival of inbound tourism, public infrastructure projects and stable private consumption. However, the external environment is fraught with risks and uncertainties, especially those relating to the future US policy rate path, the global growth prospects, and the evolving geopolitical tensions. That said, Hong Kong’s financial system remains well-positioned to weather adverse shocks given its resilience and ample buffers built up over the years.\n\nThe HKMA attaches great importance to safeguarding Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. Looking ahead, we will stay vigilant in the face of the uncertain macroeconomic environment, seeking to promptly identify emerging risks and respond to them in an agile manner. At the same time, we will seek opportunities and create policy headroom to help further enhance Hong Kong’s status as a leading international financial centre. In managing the Exchange Fund in this challenging investment environment, we will continue to invest prudently, while remaining flexible, taking defensive measures as appropriate, and maintaining a high degree of liquidity.\n\n# Stability and integrity of the financial system\n\nThe global economic uncertainties of recent years look set to continue in 2024. The HKMA will keep abreast of latest developments and stay vigilant against potential risks, with the aim of upholding the resilience and stability of the financial system, which are essential for the ongoing provision of critical financial services that support the functioning of the Hong Kong economy.\n\n# Staying vigilant against potential risks\n\nLooking into 2024, global financial markets could experience volatility as a result of uncertainties surrounding the US monetary policy outlook, evolving geopolitical risks, and an uneven global economic recovery. 2024 is also a key election year as many major elections are scheduled to be held across the world. The outcome of these elections could further increase market uncertainties. Nevertheless, Hong Kong’s financial system is well-positioned to withstand adverse shocks given its resilience and buffers built up over the years. The HKMA also has the capability, the resources and the commitment to safeguard Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nThe HKMA will continue its efforts to closely monitor any risks and vulnerabilities arising in the domestic and external environments, and will deploy appropriate measures where necessary to maintain Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. We will also conduct research into issues affecting the Hong Kong economy, assessing and addressing any potential risks associated with these issues.\n\n# Maintaining banking stability\n\nIn 2023, new geopolitical tensions across the world broke out while others remained unresolved, contributing to political uncertainty and instability that looks set to continue into 2024. Economic pressures in the form of high interest rates were a feature of the global landscape, and rates remain high entering 2024. Within the banking sector, the continued drive towards digitalisation and the implementation of new technology, including artificial intelligence, have brought many advantages but are also posing new operational and cyber security risks as well as supervisory challenges. In such a volatile political, economic and technological landscape, the HKMA strives to ensure banks’ ability to withstand shocks through its ongoing supervisory efforts. At the same time, we will continue to enhance and refine our banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account technological developments, changes in customer expectations, as well as international standards and best practices.\n\n# A risk-based supervisory focus\n\n# Credit, liquidity and market risks\n\nIn light of the increasingly challenging macroeconomic landscape, a special focus of the HKMA will be on monitoring the asset quality of authorized institutions (AIs) and assessing the effectiveness of their credit risk management and controls, particularly with respect to loan classification and provisioning practices and problem loans management. We will also maintain close dialogue with the banking and commercial sectors with a view to ensuring that AIs are striking an appropriate balance between undertaking prudent credit risk management and fulfilling their financial intermediation function throughout economic cycles. In particular, we will follow up with banks through the Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism on the nine new measures rolled out in March 2024 to assist small and medium-sized enterprises in obtaining financing from banks.\n\nUncertainties in the global economic outlook as well as elevated geopolitical tensions may increase the volatility of both asset prices and cross-border fund flows. The HKMA will make vigilance a priority, and will continue to effectively supervise the liquidity and market risk management of AIs.\n\n# Follow-up actions on lessons drawn from the 2023 banking turmoil\n\nThe HKMA will implement the follow-up actions identified in the internal review that it undertook in response to the 2023 banking turmoil in the US and Europe. These are actions that will further strengthen supervisory effectiveness and enhance its ability to handle a banking crisis should one arise. They include enhancing the risk capture of AIs’ interest rate risk in the banking book in the context of the HKMA’s supervisory review process, improving the preparedness of AIs for dealing with liquidity stresses given the continuing digitalisation of banking services, streamlining the HKMA’s crisis management processes, and further enhancing interagency and cross-border supervisory co-ordination.\n\n# Operational and technology risk\n\nThe HKMA will continue to monitor AIs’ progress towards achieving full compliance with the HKMA Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module OR-2 on “Operational Resilience”, and assess and benchmark banks’ tolerance limits for plausible disruptions, with a view to enhancing the overall resilience of the banking system. With respect to cyber risk, we will oversee a new round of self-assessments by AIs under the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 and monitor AIs’ implementation of a secure tertiary data backup to enhance their data recovery capabilities if faced with destructive cyber attacks.\n\nGiven the accelerating pace of digitalisation in banking operations, the HKMA will keep a close watch on emerging risks arising from the use of advanced technologies such as generative artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology. We will also collaborate with banks and other relevant stakeholders in operating an agile and pre-emptive mechanism to counter the growing trend of digital fraud.\n\n# Combatting money laundering and terrorist financing\n\nIn 2024, to uphold the integrity of the banking system and build customer confidence, the HKMA will target high-risk areas and prioritise risk-based regulatory updates, including issuing guidance to support an effective, risk-based implementation of changes to requirements for politically exposed persons, and supporting the implementation of the regulatory regime for stablecoin issuers. We will also issue guidance to help AIs optimise their transaction monitoring systems and to promote the responsible use of artificial intelligence, and focus on controls targeting high-end money laundering through our thematic work. To strengthen the ecosystem response to digital fraud and reduce losses to victims, we will further consult the public and the industry on a proposal to expand the scope of bank-to-bank information sharing from corporate accounts to personal accounts and, based on the feedback received, pursue necessary legislative amendments. We will move to a full build of Macro Analytics 3.0 by pooling data relevant to anti-money laundering across multiple banks and interfacing this with existing ecosystem fraud analysis. This will deliver more rapid cross-bank responses and further enhance our datadriven anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism supervision, enabling us to take quicker, more decisive action against systemic money laundering and terrorist financing risks.\n\n# Wealth management and Mandatory Provident Fundrelated businesses\n\nIn 2024, the HKMA will step up both its on-site examinations and off-site surveillance of AIs’ conduct in relation to wealth management and the selling of securities, investment products, and insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses. More specifically, we will focus on Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) business, digital distribution and advisory platforms, virtual asset (VA)-related products, long term insurance products and premium financing activities, taking into account the latest market developments as well as evolving international standards.\n\nThe HKMA will communicate closely with fellow regulators and the banking industry to provide guidance on regulatory standards in relation to the sale of investment, insurance and MPF products as appropriate. In particular, to support the sustainable and responsible development of the VA sector, we will continue to work with the Government and fellow regulators to ensure that the regulatory regime in place for the VA sector is robust, comprehensive and well-balanced.\n\nThe HKMA will facilitate and monitor the industry’s implementation of enhancements to Cross-boundary WMC, and continue to engage with the industry and relevant regulatory authorities in order to further enhance the scheme. We will also continue to work with fellow regulators and the industry to streamline the selling process for investment products, and will consolidate and clarify guidance, as appropriate, to facilitate industry compliance. In addition to trust business, we will also commence the supervision of new Type 13 regulated activity under the Securities and Futures Ordinance for AIs providing depositary services for collective investment schemes authorised by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), which will come into operation on 2 October 2024.\n\n# Oversight of financial market infrastructures\n\nThe HKMA aims to promote the safety and efficiency of the financial market infrastructures (FMIs) under its oversight in accordance with the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO), the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMI) and the various guidance issued by the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI). We will continue to participate in the CPMI-IOSCO1 PFMI implementation monitoring and assessment exercise, and in other international working groups to discuss the implementation of new and innovative FMI-related initiatives. We will also participate in the work of international standard-setting bodies, and will review and strengthen our oversight requirements as appropriate to reflect the latest international practices as well as market and technology developments.\n\n# Policy development\n\nThe HKMA will continue to strengthen and refine its banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account international standards and best practices.\n\n# Implementation of Basel standards in Hong Kong\n\nThe proposed amendments to the Banking (Capital) Rules (BCR) and the Banking (Disclosure) Rules (BDR) for implementing the Basel III final reform package (Final Package) are expected to take effect on 1 January 2025 following the passage of the amended Rules in the Legislative Council. In 2024, the HKMA will continue to prepare the supporting guidance, banking returns and standard disclosure templates and tables needed to facilitate the application of the Rules. In particular, we plan to:\n- consult the industry in the second quarter of 2024 on the revisions to the SPM module CA-B-3 on “Countercyclical Capital Buffer (CCyB)–Geographic Allocation of Private Sector Credit Exposures” and Return MA(BS)25 “Quarterly reporting on the Countercyclical Capital Buffer”, reflecting the consequential changes arising from the implementation of the Final Package and the revised Return of International Banking Statistics; and\n- finalise the package for effecting the reporting-only requirement for the new standards on market and credit valuation adjustment risks, which starts on 1 July 2024.\n\nThose parts of the proposed amendments to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules (BELR) and the Banking (Liquidity) Rules (BLR) that are largely consequential to the implementation of the Final Package under the amended BCR are also targeted to take effect on 1 January 2025. The HKMA plans to finalise the proposed consequential amendments to the related regulatory returns in 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, with a new standard on the prudential treatment of banks’ crypto-asset exposures and subsequent targeted revisions to the standard having been issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December 2022 and December 2023 respectively, local implementation of the standard is planned for 2025. The HKMA will examine the need for potential legislative amendments to various sets of rules, including the BCR, the BDR, the BELR and the BLR, and conduct the statutory consultation on the necessary rule amendments in the first half of 2025.\n\n# Other supervisory policies and risk management guidelines\n\nThe HKMA plans to update a number of SPM modules in response to lessons learned from the banking turmoil in the US and Europe of March 2023, as well as developments in regulatory requirements and international standards. These modules include:", "zh": "# 对于2024年及以后的优先事项\n\n进入2024年,香港经济预计将继续以适度的速度恢复,这取决于入境旅游业的持续复苏,公共基础设施项目和稳定的私人消费.然而,外部环境充满了风险和不确定性,特别是与未来的美国政策利率路径,全球增长前景以及不断变化的地缘政治紧张关系有关.\n\n香港管理局非常重视保护香港的货币和金融稳定.展望未来,我们将保持警,尽快识别新出现的风险,并以敏捷的方式应对.同时,我们将寻求机会并创造政策空间,以帮助进一步提高香港作为领先的国际金融中心的地位.在这个充满挑战的投资环境中,我们将继续谨慎投资,同时保持灵活性,采取适当的防御措施,并保持高水平的流动性.\n\n# 金融体系的稳定性和完整性\n\n近年来全球经济的不确定性似乎还在继续.香港管理局将跟上最新的发展,并保持警,以维护金融体系的弹性和稳定性,这些都是为支持香港经济运转的关键服务所必需的.\n\n# 保持警,防止潜在的风险\n\n展望2024年,全球金融市场可能会因美国货币政策前景的不确定性,不断演变的地缘政治风险和全球经济复苏的不均而出现波动.2024年也是一个关键的选举年,因为计划在全球举行许多重大选举.这些选举的结果可能会进一步增加市场的不确定性.尽管如此,由于其多年来的弹性和缓冲,香港金融体系处于承受不利冲击的良好位置.香港金融管理局也具备保护香港货币和金融稳定的能力,资源和承诺.\n\n香港管理局将继续密切监督国内外的风险和脆弱性,并在必要时采取适当措施,维护香港的货币和金融稳定性.我们还将对影响香港经济的任何潜在风险进行评估和处理.\n\n# 保持银行稳定\n\n在2023年,全球出现了新的地缘政治紧张局势,而其他问题仍未得到解决.高利率的经济压力是全球形势的一个特征,而2024年,高利率的经济压力仍在继续.银行业不断向数字化发展,实施新技术,包括人工智能,但同时也带来了新的运营和网络安全风险,以及监管挑战.在这种动荡的政治,经济和技术环境中,HKMA将继续加强和完善银行监管框架和政策,考虑到技术变化,客户期望以及国际最佳实践.\n\n# 基于风险的监管重点\n\n# 信用,流动性和市场风险\n\n鉴于日益充满挑战的宏观经济环境,香港管理局将特别关注其信用风险管理和控制的有效性,特别是帮助中小企业从银行获得融资.\n\n全球经济前景的不确定性以及高度的地缘政治紧张局势可能会增加资产价格和跨境资金流动的波动性.HKMA将把警作为优先事项,并将继续有效监督AI的流动性和市场风险管理.\n\n# 根据2023年银行动荡所吸取的经验,采取后续行动\n\n香港管理局将执行其应对2023年美国和欧洲银行业动荡的内部后续行动.这些行动将进一步加强监管效率,并提高其应对银行业危机的能力.它们包括在香港管理局监管审查过程中加强对银行业账户中的AI利率风险的风险捕获,改善AI应对银行业服务持续数字化方面的流动性压力,简化香港管理局危机管理流程,进一步加强机构间和跨境监管协调.\n\n# 运营和技术风险\n\n香港金融管理局将继续监测AI在实现完全遵守\"运营弹性\"的OR-2模块监管政策手册 (SPM) 的进展情况,并评估和对银行对可能出现的中断的容忍限度进行基准评估,以期提高银行系统的整体弹性.就网络风险而言,我们将监督AI在网络弹性评估框架2.0下进行新一轮自主评估,并监测AI实施安全的第三级数据备份,以加强它们在面临破坏性网络攻击时的数据恢复能力.\n\n鉴于银行业务的数字化进程加快,香港管理局将密切关注使用人工智能和分布式账本技术等新出现的风险.我们还将与银行和其他相关利益相关者合作,以应对日益增长的数字欺诈行为.\n\n# 打击洗钱和恐怖主义融资\n\n在2024年,为了维护银行系统的完整性,我们将优先考虑基于风险的监管,以帮助AI优化其交易系统,并通过主题工作来加强对银行账户的监管,以进一步加强对银行账户的监管.\n\n# 财富管理和强制性预计基金相关业务\n\n在2024年,香港管理局将加强对人工智能机构的现场检查和监督,同时考虑到最新的市场发展以及不断发展的国际标准.\n\n香港管理局将与其他监管机构和银行业务部门密切沟通,提供与投资,保险和金融服务相关的监管标准.特别是,为了支持VA部门的可持续和负责任发展,我们将继续与政府和其他监管机构合作,确保VA部门的监管制度是强有力的,全面的和平衡的.\n\n香港管理局将协助行业实施跨境WMC的改进,并继续与行业和相关监管机构进行沟通,以简化投资产品的销售流程,并根据需要,加强指导.除了信托业务外,我们还将在2024年10月2日开始对提供集体投资计划存款服务的AI进行监督.\n\n# 对金融市场基础设施的监督\n\n根据\"支付系统和存储价值设施条例\",金融市场基础设施原则以及支付市场基础设施委员会发布的各种指导方针,香港金融管理局将继续参与CPMI-IOSCO1的PFMI实施监测和评估,并参与国际标准制定机构的工作.\n\n# 政策制定\n\n香港金融管理局将继续加强和完善其银行监管和监管框架和政策,同时考虑到国际标准和最佳实践.\n\n# 在香港实施巴塞尔标准\n\n银行 (资本) 规则的建议,在立法委员会通过后,将会生效.\n\n银行 (风险) 限制规则和银行 (流动性) 规则的拟议变更,主要是由于修改后的银行监管规定实施了最终方案,这些部分也将于2025年1月1日生效.\n\n由于银行对加密资产的审慎处理和随后的目标修订,该标准计划在2025年实施.HKMA将审查包括BCR,BDR,BELR和BLR在内的各种规则的潜在立法修正案,并于2025年上半年就必要的规则修正案进行咨询.\n\n# 其他监管政策和风险管理指南\n\n根据美国和欧洲2023年3月的银行动荡以及监管要求和国际标准的发展,HKMA计划更新一些SPM模块.这些模块包括:"}
{"en": "# About the HKMA\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is Hong Kong’s central banking institution. The HKMA has four main functions:\n- maintaining currency stability within the framework of the Linked Exchange Rate System;\n- promoting the stability and integrity of the financial system, including the banking system;\n- helping to maintain Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre, including the maintenance and development of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure; and\n- managing the Exchange Fund.\n\n# HKMA’s legal mandate\n\nThe HKMA was established on 1 April 1993 after the Legislative Council passed amendments to the Exchange Fund Ordinance in 1992 empowering the Financial Secretary to appoint a Monetary Authority.\n\nThe powers, functions and responsibilities of the Monetary Authority are set out in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the Banking Ordinance, the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance, the Deposit Protection Scheme Ordinance, the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, and other relevant Ordinances. The division of functions and responsibilities in monetary and financial affairs between the Financial Secretary and the Monetary Authority is set out in an exchange of letters dated 25 June 2003. The exchange of letters discloses delegations made by the Financial Secretary to the Monetary Authority. The letters are public documents and can be found on the HKMA website.\n\nThe Exchange Fund Ordinance establishes the Exchange Fund under the control of the Financial Secretary. According to the Ordinance, the Fund shall be used primarily for affecting the exchange value of the Hong Kong dollar. It may also be used (whilst having regard to its primary purpose) for maintaining the stability and integrity of the monetary and financial systems of Hong Kong, with a view to maintaining Hong Kong as an international financial centre.\n\nThe Monetary Authority is appointed under the Exchange Fund Ordinance to assist the Financial Secretary in performing his functions under the Exchange Fund Ordinance and to perform such other functions as are assigned by other Ordinances or by the Financial Secretary. The office of the Monetary Authority is known as the HKMA, and the Monetary Authority is the Chief Executive of the HKMA.\n\nThe Banking Ordinance provides the Monetary Authority with the responsibility and powers for regulating and supervising banking business and the business of taking deposits. Under the Ordinance, the Monetary Authority is responsible for the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong.\n\nThe Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance provides that the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for banking sector entities. The Monetary Authority is vested with a range of powers to effect the orderly resolution of a non-viable banking sector entity (the failure of which could pose systemic risk). The purpose is to maintain financial stability, while seeking to protect public funds.\n\nThe Securities and Futures Ordinance and the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Ordinance provide certain powers to the Monetary Authority regarding the securities and mandatory provident fund businesses of banks.\n\nThe Monetary Authority has been delegated with powers of inspection and investigation by the Insurance Authority under the Insurance Ordinance in relation to the insurance related businesses of banks.\n\nThe Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance empowers the Monetary Authority to supervise banks’ compliance with the customer due diligence and record-keeping requirements under the Ordinance.\n\nThe Deposit Protection Scheme Ordinance confers responsibility on the Monetary Authority to assist in the operation of the Deposit Protection Scheme and to trigger payment of compensation from the Deposit Protection Scheme Fund to depositors of a failed licensed bank.\n\nThe Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance provides a statutory regime for the Monetary Authority to designate and oversee certain significant clearing and settlement systems and retail payment systems operating in Hong Kong. It also empowers the Monetary Authority to administer a licensing regime for electronic and physical “facilities”, which are used to store monetary value and which meet the criteria specified in the Ordinance.", "zh": "#关于香港马会\n\n香港货币局是香港的中央银行机构,其主要职能是: - 在联汇系统中维持货币稳定; - 促进金融体系的稳定和完整; - 帮助保持香港作为国际金融中心的地位,包括维护和发展香港的金融基础设施; - 管理汇率基金.\n\n# 香港管理局的法律授权\n\n香港金融管理局成立于1993年4月1日,立法委员会通过了对1992年\"汇率基金条例\"的修正案,授权财政部长任命货币管理局.\n\n货币管理局的权力,职能和责任都在\"交易所条例\"\",银行条例\"\",金融机构 (解决方案) 条例\"\",存款保护计划条例\"等相关条例中.金融秘书和货币管理局之间的货币和金融事务的分担在2003年6月25日的信件交换中被披露出来.这些信件是公开的,可以在HKMA网站上找到.\n\n根据该条例,该基金主要用于影响香港美元的汇率.它也可以 (考虑到其主要目的) 维持香港的货币和金融体系的稳定性和完整性,以保持香港作为国际金融中心.\n\n货币管理局根据\"交易基金条例\"任命,协助财政部执行其职责,并执行其他条例或财政部指定的职责.货币管理局的办公室称为\"香港金融管理局\".\n\n银行条例赋予货币管理局监管和监督银行业务.根据条例,货币管理局负责授权香港的许可银行,限制许可银行和存款公司.\n\n金融机构 (解决方案) 条例规定,货币当局是银行部门实体的解决方案.货币当局有权执行非可行的银行部门实体的有序解决方案 (其失败可能会造成系统风险).目的是保持金融稳定,同时寻求保护公共资金.\n\n证券和期货条例以及强制性预计基金条例,为货币当局提供了有关银行证券和强制性预计基金业务的某些权力.\n\n根据保险条例,金融机构已被授权对银行进行检查和调查.\n\n根据\"反洗钱和反恐怖主义融资条例\",货币局有权监督银行遵守该条例所规定的客户尽职调查和记录要求.\n\n根据\"存款保护计划条例\",货币局有责任协助存款保护计划的运行,并启动从存款保护计划基金向失败的银行存款人的赔偿.\n\n支付系统和存储价值设施条例为货币局指定和监督在香港运行的某些重要清算和结算系统.它还授权货币局管理用于存储货币价值的电子和物理\"设施\"的许可制度."}
{"en": "# Corporate Governance\n\nAs Hong Kong’s central banking institution, the HKMA is committed to high standards of corporate governance, as good governance is crucial in maintaining and safeguarding the trust and confidence of the public in the HKMA to fulfil its statutory mandate.\n\nTo achieve its commitment to good corporate governance, the HKMA:\n- puts in place a well-defined governance structure with a high degree of accountability;\n- exercises robust controls to manage risks and ensure that staff behaviours at all levels and its day-to-day operations are consistent with specified standards; and\n- pursues a policy of high transparency and accessibility, and keeps close contacts with stakeholders.\n\n# The HKMA and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government\n\nThe HKMA is an integral part of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government, but is able to employ staff on terms different from those of the civil service in order to attract personnel of the right experience and expertise. The Chief Executive of the HKMA and his staff are public officers. In its day-to-day work, the HKMA operates with a high degree of autonomy within the relevant statutory powers conferred upon, or delegated to, the Monetary Authority.\n\nThe Financial Secretary is responsible for determining the monetary policy objective and the structure of the monetary system of Hong Kong: a letter from the Financial Secretary to the Monetary Authority dated 25 June 2003 specifies that these should be currency stability defined as a stable exchange value at around HK$7.80 to one US dollar maintained by Currency Board arrangements. The Monetary Authority is on his own responsible for achieving the monetary policy objective, including determining the strategy, instruments and operational means for doing so. The Monetary Authority also has responsibilities in relation to the maintenance of the stability and integrity of the monetary system of Hong Kong.\n\nThe Financial Secretary, assisted by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, has responsibility for policies for maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s financial system and the status of Hong Kong as an international financial centre. In support of these policies, the Monetary Authority’s responsibilities include:\n- promoting the general stability and effective working of the banking system;\n- promoting the development of the debt market, in co-operation with other relevant bodies;\n- matters relating to the issuance and circulation of legal tender notes and coins;\n- promoting the safety and efficiency of the financial infrastructure through the development of payment, clearing and settlement systems and, where appropriate, the operation of these systems; and\n- seeking to promote, in co-operation with other relevant bodies, confidence in Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems, and market development initiatives to help strengthen the international competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial services.\n\nThe Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary. The Monetary Authority, under delegation from the Financial Secretary, is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the use of the Exchange Fund, and for the investment management of the Fund.\n\n# Accountability and transparency\n\nThe autonomy given to the HKMA in its day-to-day operations, and in the methods it uses to pursue policy objectives determined by the Government, is complemented by a high degree of accountability and transparency.\n\nThe HKMA serves Hong Kong by promoting monetary and banking stability, by managing the official reserves effectively, and by developing and overseeing a robust and diverse financial infrastructure. These processes help to strengthen Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre and to foster Hong Kong’s economic well-being.\n\nThe HKMA must have the confidence of the community if it is to perform its duties well. The HKMA therefore takes seriously the duty of explaining its policies and work to the general public and makes every effort to address any concerns within the community relevant to the HKMA’s responsibilities. In particular, the HKMA makes timely clarifications on misinformation and rumours about the HKMA’s policies via traditional and social media.\n\nThe HKMA is accountable to the people of Hong Kong through the Financial Secretary, who appoints the Monetary Authority, and through the laws passed by the Legislative Council that set out the Monetary Authority’s powers and responsibilities. The HKMA also recognises a broader responsibility to promote a better understanding of its roles and objectives and to keep itself informed of community concerns. In its day-to-day operations and in its wider contacts with the community, the HKMA pursues a policy of transparency and accessibility. This policy has two main objectives:\n- to keep the financial industry and the public as fully informed about the work of the HKMA as possible, subject to considerations of market sensitivity, commercial confidentiality and statutory restrictions on disclosure of confidential information; and\n- to ensure that the HKMA is in touch with, and responsive to, the community it serves.\n\nThe HKMA seeks to follow international best practices in its transparency arrangements. It maintains extensive relations with the mass media and produces a range of regular and special publications in both English and Chinese. The HKMA’s bilingual website (www.hkma.gov.hk) carries a large number of HKMA publications, press releases, speeches and presentations, in addition to dedicated sections on research, statistics, regulatory resources, consumer information and other topics. Social media platforms are also used to communicate with the public more efficiently in the digital era. The HKMA maintains an Information Centre at its offices, consisting of a library and an exhibition area, which is open to the public six days a week. Further information on the HKMA’s work on public communications and engagement is contained in the Corporate Functions chapter on pages 185 to 193.\n\nOver the years, the HKMA has progressively increased the detail and frequency of its disclosure of information on the Exchange Fund and Currency Board Accounts. Since 1999, the HKMA has participated in the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard project for central banks. The HKMA publishes records of meetings of the Currency Board Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee and the reports on Currency Board operations. The supervisory policies and guidelines on banking have been published on the HKMA website since 1996.\n\nThe relations between the HKMA and the Legislative Council play an important part in promoting accountability and transparency. There is a formal commitment from the Chief Executive of the HKMA to appear before the Panel on Financial Affairs of the Legislative Council three times a year to brief Members and to answer questions on the HKMA’s work. Representatives from the HKMA attend Legislative Council panel and committee meetings from time to time to explain and discuss particular issues and to assist Members in their scrutiny of draft legislation.\n\n# Controls\n\nThe HKMA adopts robust internal and external control mechanisms to ensure that it upholds a high standard of staff conduct, prudent risk management as well as appropriate checks and balances. Internal and external audit functions provide independent assessment on the adequacy and effectiveness of the control mechanisms.\n\n# Code of Conduct\n\nA Code of Conduct, which provides guidance to staff on their ethical and legal responsibilities, is in place to ensure that staff behaviours are consistent with specified standards at all levels.\n\n# Internal controls\n\n# Operational controls\n\nAll departments and divisions have ownership and responsibility to identify and assess risks of their operational processes and put in place appropriate controls for ensuring proper day-to-day operations of the HKMA. This serves as the first line of defence for risk management.\n\n# Organisational risk management\n\nRisk management is also undertaken at the corporate level, with the Risk Committee, chaired by the Chief Executive of the HKMA, being one of the cornerstones of the organisational risk management framework.\n\nPotential and emerging risks identified by the functional units, and the adequacy of the control measures and mitigating strategies they devise, are reported to and discussed at the Risk Committee, which decides on appropriate follow-up actions.\n\n# Internal audit\n\nThe Internal Audit Division of the HKMA independently assesses the adequacy and effectiveness of governance, risk management and control processes of different functional units, and advises on areas for improvement.\n\n# External audit\n\nIn accordance with section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the Audit Commission of the HKSAR Government audits the financial statements of the Exchange Fund. The Commission does not charge for this service. The audited financial statements of the Exchange Fund are included in the HKMA Annual Report.", "zh": "#公司治理\n\n作为香港的中央银行机构,HKMA致力于高标准的公司治理,因为良好的治理对于保持和维护公众对HKMA履行其法定任务至关重要.\n\n为了实现其对良好的公司治理的承诺,HKMA: - 建立一个明确的治理结构,具有高度的问责制; - 实施强有力的控制来管理风险,并确保各级员工的行为及其日常运营符合特定标准; - 追求高度透明度和可访问性,并与利益相关方保持密切联系.\n\n#香港管理局和香港特别行政区政府\n\n香港管理局是香港特别行政区政府的一个组成部分,但可以在不同的条件上雇用员工,以吸引具有适当经验和专业知识的员工.香港管理局的首席执行官及其员工是公职人员.在日常工作中,香港管理局在赋予或委托给货币管理局的相关法定权限内具有高度的自主权.\n\n金融秘书负责确定香港的货币体系结构,并将其定义为货币局的稳定性.\n\n金融秘书负责维持香港金融体系的稳定,并协助发展金融体系.\n\n交换基金在财政秘书的控制下,货币当局对使用交换基金以及基金的投资负责.\n\n# 问责制和透明度\n\n香港海管理局在日常经营中所获得的自主权,以及在政府确定的政策目标的实现中所使用的方法,都得到了高度的问责制和透明度.\n\n香港管理局通过促进货币和银行稳定,有效管理官方储备,并开发和监督稳健多元化的金融基础设施,帮助加强香港作为国际金融中心的作用,促进香港的经济福祉.\n\n如果要好好履行职责,HKMA必须得到社区的信任.因此,HKMA认真地向公众解释其政策和工作,并尽一切努力解决与HKMA的责任相关的社区问题.特别是,HKMA通过传统和社交媒体及时澄清有关HKMA政策的错误信息和谣言.\n\n香港金融管理局通过任命货币管理局的财政秘书,通过立法委员会通过的规定,对人民进行了更广泛的了解.在日常运作和与社区的更广泛联系中,香港金融管理局遵循了透明度和可访问性的政策.这一政策的两个主要目标是: - 保持金融行业和公众尽可能充分了解香港金融管理局的工作,同时考虑到市场敏感性,商业机密性和法律限制.\n\n香港管理局试图遵循国际最佳做法,并以英语和汉语制作一系列定期和特别的出版物.香港管理局的双语网站 (www.hkma.gov.hk) 除了研究,统计,监管资源,消费者信息和其他主题之外,还提供了大量的出版物.在数字时代,香港管理局在其办公室内维护了一个信息中心,该中心每周开放六天.\n\n随着时间的推移,HKMA逐渐增加了对交易所和货币委员会账户的详细信息.自1999年以来,HKMA参与了国际货币基金组织的中央银行数据传播项目.HKMA发布了交易所咨询委员会会议记录和货币委员会工作报告.\n\n香港管理局与立法委员会之间的关系在促进问责制和透明度方面发挥着重要作用.香港管理局的首席执行官每年三次出现在立法委员会的财务委员会,并回答有关该委员会的问题.\n\n# 控制\n\n香港管理局采用强有力的内部和外部控制机制,以确保保持高标准的员工行为,以及适当的检查和平衡.内部和外部审计功能提供对控制机制的充分评估.\n\n# 行为准则\n\n现有行为准则为员工提供有关其道德和法律责任的指导,以确保员工的行为符合各级的规定.\n\n# 内部控制\n\n# 操作控制\n\n所有部门和部门都有责任识别和评估其运营过程中的风险,并实施适当的控制措施,以确保HKMA的日常运营.这作为风险管理的第一道防线.\n\n# 组织风险管理\n\n风险管理也在企业层面进行,由HKMA首席执行官主持的风险委员会是组织风险管理框架的基石之一.\n\n功能单位发现的潜在和新出现的风险,以及它们设计的控制措施和减轻策略的充分性,都会在风险委员会报告并讨论,该委员会决定采取适当的后续行动.\n\n# 内部审计\n\n香港管理局的内部审计部门独立评估不同职能部门的治理,风险管理和控制流程的充分性和有效性,并就需要改进的领域提供建议.\n\n# 外部审计\n\n根据交换基金条例的第7条,香港特区政府的审计委员会审计了交换基金的财务报表.委员会不收费.交换基金的审计财务报表包括在HKMA的年度报告中."}
{"en": "# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nDespite a challenging external environment, the Hong Kong economy staged a positive growth in 2023, thanks to the revivals in inbound tourism and domestic demand. The labour market continued to improve alongside the economic recovery, while inflation remained moderate. Asset markets remained soft amid tightened financial conditions and weak market sentiment. Economic activities for 2024 are expected to recover further at a moderate pace, although the outlook is clouded by multiple external uncertainties.\n\n# The economy in review\n\n# Real activities\n\nHaving navigated through the severe challenges posed by the pandemic in the previous year, the Hong Kong economy grew steadily by 3.2% in 2023 (Table 1 and Chart 1). Domestically, private consumption recovered notably on the back of improved labour market conditions and various support initiatives introduced by the Government, such as the Consumption Voucher Scheme and a series of promotional campaigns. Despite tightened financial conditions, overall investment expenditure registered significant growth against a low base of comparison from the previous year. Externally, Hong Kong’s exports of services rebounded, due mainly to the robust revival of inbound tourism. However, their positive impact on growth was more than offset by the strong recovery in outbound tourism, which was measured as imports of services. On the other hand, exports of goods remained lacklustre amid weak external demand, and put a drag on Hong Kong’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth.\n\nChart 1 Real GDP growth by contribution\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\nTable 1 Real GDP growth by expenditure component (period-over-period)\nNote: The seasonally-adjusted quarter-on-quarter rates of change in the gross domestic fixed capital formation are not available.\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\n# Inflation\n\nLocal inflation remained moderate in 2023 as external price pressures gradually eased, while domestic cost pressures remained broadly in check despite rising slightly as the economy recovered (Chart 2)1. For 2023 as a whole, the underlying and headline inflation rates were 1.7% and 2.1% respectively.\n\n# Labour market\n\nLabour market conditions improved further in 2023, with the unemployment rate falling to a decade-low level of 2.8% in July and hovering at a low level for the remaining months of the year2 (Chart 3). Both labour demand and labour supply increased, as reflected respectively by the pick-up in total employment (Chart 3) and in the labour force. In view of Hong Kong’s manpower shortages, the Government rolled out various labour importation schemes3 and talent attraction initiatives4 in 2023. Meanwhile, with tight labour market conditions, the year-on-year growth rates of nominal wages and of labour earnings increased gradually towards their pre-pandemic levels.\n\nChart 2 Underlying consumer price inflation\n\nChart 3 Labour market conditions\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\n# Stock market\n\nAfter stabilising in early 2023, the local stock market turned sluggish in the second half. Extending its rebound in late 2022, the Hang Seng Index rose to a year-high daily close of 22,689 on 27 January 2023. It then retreated and dropped further to low levels by December (Chart 4), reflecting weak market sentiment due to the banking sector problems in the US and Switzerland in March, as well as weaker global economic prospects and tightened financial conditions in the second half. The Hang Seng Index closed the year at 17,047, down notably by 13.8% from the end of 2022, and marking the fourth consecutive year of decline.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market experienced a rebound in the first four months of 2023 on the back of the resumption of normalcy in the Mainland and Hong Kong, but softened subsequently alongside rising mortgage rates5 and weak market sentiment. Overall, housing prices dropped by 6.9% year on year in 2023, while housing transactions further declined by 4.5% to a record-low of 43,002 units. Housing affordability remained stretched despite improving slightly along with the downward adjustment of housing prices. Similarly, the non-residential property markets continued to face headwinds, with prices of offices, retail premises and flatted factories softened further. The rentals for offices remained under pressure due to high vacancy rates amid the increasing prevalence of work-from-home arrangements and large supply. On the other hand, the rentals for retail premises increased in 2023 with the revival of inbound tourism and the improvement in private consumption.\n\nChart 4 Asset prices\nSources: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited\n\n# Outlook for the economy\n\n# Economic environment\n\nIn 2024, the Hong Kong economy is expected to continue its recovery at a moderate pace. Inbound tourism is set to expand further alongside the continuous improvement in handling capacity and the Government’s effort to promote mega events, while local consumption activities should be supported by a steady labour market. The various infrastructure projects to be taken forward by the Government will also lend support to the economy. Meanwhile, Hong Kong’s exports of goods will likely stabilise alongside the expected upturn in the global technology cycle. The Government forecasts real GDP to grow steadily by 2.5% –3.5% in 20246. However, the outlook is clouded by multiple risks and uncertainties, including those stemming from the US policy rate path, the pace of technology cycle recovery, the prospects for global economic growth, and evolving geopolitical tensions.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nLocal inflation is expected to remain mild in 2024, with softened external price pressures helping to offset the upward pressures on domestic costs amid further economic recovery and rising housing rentals. Market consensus forecasts a headline inflation rate of 2.1% in 2024, while the Government projects the headline and underlying inflation rates to be 2.4% and 1.7% respectively. On the other hand, the labour market is expected to be supported by the ongoing economic recovery, while the various labour importation and talent attraction schemes will continue to help alleviate manpower shortages across different industries.\n\n# Performance of the banking sector\n\nIn 2023, the Hong Kong banking sector faced a number of challenges including a high interest rate environment, heightened volatility in global financial markets caused by the March banking turmoil in the US and Europe, and a slowerthan-expected economic recovery in the Mainland and Hong Kong. Despite these multiple headwinds, the Hong Kong banking sector remained sound and continued to be supported by strong capital and liquidity buffers. The asset quality of the banking sector remained healthy despite an increase in the classified loan ratio. The profitability of banks improved notably, driven by higher net interest income.\n\n# Asset quality\n\nThe classified loan ratio of the banking sector rose to 1.56% at the end of 2023 from 1.40% at the end of 2022, with the overdue and rescheduled loan ratio increasing to 1.24% from 0.85% during the same period (Chart 5). The classified loan ratio for Mainland-related lending also rose to 2.58% at the end of 2023 from 2.26% a year before. The increase in the classified loan ratio was mainly due to downgrades of exposures to Mainland property developers. Nevertheless, the provisions set aside by banks remained sufficient. The provision coverage ratio (i.e.  total provisions to classified loans) stood at 75% at the end of 2023. If the market value of collateral held against the classified loans is taken into account, the adjusted provision coverage ratio would reach around 145%. Meanwhile, the delinquency ratios of residential mortgage lending and credit card lending remained low, at 0.08% and 0.30% respectively, at the end of 2023 (Chart 6).\n\nChart 5 Asset quality of the banking sector\nNote: Figures cover Hong Kong offices, overseas branches and major overseas subsidiaries.\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 6 Delinquency ratios of residential mortgage lending and credit card lending\nSource: HKMA\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe banking sector recorded notable profit growth in 2023. The aggregate pre-tax operating profit of retail banks increased by 62.1% in the year, while the post-tax return on average assets rose to 0.89% from 0.57% during the same period (Chart 7). The improvement in profit was predominantly the result of an increase in net interest income (+30%), coupled with a significant gain in investments held for trading in 2023 as compared to a mild loss in the previous year. This was partly offset by an increase in loan impairment charges (+28%), as specific provisions were set aside for new classified loans. Against the backdrop of rising interest rates, the net interest margin of retail banks widened to 1.68% in 2023 from 1.31% a year before (Chart 8). Meanwhile, retail banks’ cost-to-income ratio fell to 38.8% in 2023 from 48.0% in 2022 (Chart 9).\n\nChart 7 Retail banks’ performance\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 8 Retail banks’ net interest margin\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 9 Retail banks’ cost-to-income ratio\nSource: HKMA\n\n# Balance sheet trends\n\nThe banking sector’s balance sheet grew by 0.9% in 2023, as growths in negotiable debt instruments held (+8.6%) and interbank lending (+4.4%) were mostly offset by a decline in total loans. Given the subdued loan demand amid higher borrowing costs and a weakened global economic outlook, total loans decreased by 3.6% in 2023. Of the total loans, loans for use in Hong Kong remained broadly stable (-0.4%), while loans for use outside Hong Kong and trade finance decreased by 10.4% and 13.1% respectively. Mainlandrelated lending fell by 6.6% in 2023.\n\nOn the liability side, total deposits rose by 5.1% in 2023, compared with a growth of 1.7% in 2022. As total loans declined while total deposits grew, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio decreased to 62.8% at the end of 2023 from 68.5% a year before (Chart 10).\n\n# Capital adequacy\n\nThe banking sector remained well capitalised in 2023. The consolidated total capital ratio of locally incorporated authorized institutions (AIs) stood at 21.1% at the end of 2023, compared with 20.1% a year before. The Tier 1 capital ratio was 18.9% (Chart 11). Both ratios were well above their respective international minimum requirements. The Basel III leverage ratio was 7.9% at the end of 2023 (Chart 12).\n\nChart 10 Loans and deposits of the banking sector\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 11 Consolidated capital ratios of locally incorporated AIs\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 12 Consolidated leverage ratio of locally incorporated AIs\nSource: HKMA\n\n# Liquidity conditions\n\nThe banking sector continued to maintain a strong liquidity position. The quarterly average Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) of category 1 institutions was 178.6% in the fourth quarter of 2023, and the quarterly average Liquidity Maintenance Ratio (LMR) of category 2 institutions was 65.7% (Chart 13). The main source of funding for the banking sector continued to be customer deposits. The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) of category 1 institutions and the Core Funding Ratio (CFR) of category 2A institutions were 144.4% and 169.4% respectively at the end of 2023 (Chart 14). All four ratios were well above the statutory minimum requirements.\n\nChart 13 Liquidity ratios of designated AIs\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 14 Funding ratios of designated AIs\nSource: HKMA", "zh": "#经济和金融环境\n\n尽管外部环境充满挑战,但由于入境旅游和国内需求的复苏,劳动力市场继续改善,而通货膨胀仍然温和.预计2024年的经济活动将以温和的速度进一步复苏,尽管前景受到多种外部不确定性的影响.\n\n# 经济在审查\n\n#真正的活动\n\n经历了前一年的严重挑战,香港经济在2023年稳步增长 (表1和图1).国内的私人消费明显恢复,特别是由于劳动力市场条件改善,政府推出了一系列促销活动.尽管财政条件更加严格,但整体投资支出却在前一年的较低基础上出现了显著增长.\n\n图1 贡献的实际GDP增长来源:人口普查和统计局\n\n表1 按支出组成部分分别计算实际GDP增长 (季度比季度) 注:季节性调整后的季度比季度的国内固定资本形成变化率没有提供.来源:人口普查和统计局\n\n# 胀\n\n随着经济复苏,当地通胀在2023年保持温和,外部价格压力逐渐缓解,而国内成本压力在经济复苏的同时略有上升,但仍基本保持在控制中 (图2).\n\n# 劳动力市场\n\n劳动力市场状况在2023年进一步改善,失业率在7月降至十年低位,并在今年剩余的几个月保持低位2 (图3).劳动力需求和劳动力供应均有所增加,这在总就业率 (图3) 和劳动力中得到了反射.鉴于香港的人力短缺,政府在2023年推出了各种劳动力进口计划3和人才吸引计划4.与此同时,由于劳动力市场状况紧张,名义工资和劳动收入的年增长率逐渐提高到大流行前的水平.\n\n图 2 消费者价格的基本通胀\n\n图3 劳动力市场情况 来源:人口普查和统计局\n\n# 股票市场\n\n在2023年初稳定后,当地股市在下半年变得疲软.在2022年底延长反弹,杭 Seng指数上升至每日最高关闭22,689位.然后在12月份回落到低位 (图4),反映了由于美国和瑞士的银行业问题导致的市场情绪疲软,以及下半年全球经济前景疲软和金融状况紧缩.杭 Seng指数在2022年底相比显著下降13.8%,标志着连续第四年下降.\n\n# 房地产市场\n\n由于中国大陆和香港恢复正常,住宅市场在2023年出现反弹,但随着抵押贷款利率的上升和市场情绪的疲软,房价同比下降6.9%,而房屋交易则进一步下降4.5%,创下历史新低,达到43002个单位.尽管房价的下调有所改善,但房价仍然处于紧张状态.同样,非住宅房地产市场继续面临逆风,办公室,零售场所和平板工厂的价格进一步下降.由于在家工作和旅游业的普及程度较高,办公室的租金仍然处于压力之下.另一方面,随着私人消费的复苏和改善,2023年零售场所的租金供应增加.\n\n图4 资产价格来源:评级和估值部门和香港交易所和清算有限公司\n\n#对经济的看法\n\n#经济环境\n\n2024年,香港经济将以温和的速度继续发展,同时,政府将支持当地消费活动.与此同时,香港的商品出口将在全球技术周期的预期增长中稳定.然而,未来的发展前景受到多种风险和不确定性的影响.\n\n# 通货膨胀和劳动力市场\n\n预计2024年当地通货膨胀将保持温和,外部价格压力有助于抵消国内成本的上升压力.市场共识预测,总体通货膨胀率分别为2.4%和1.7%.另一方面,劳动力市场预计将受到持续的经济复苏的支持,而各种劳动力进口和人才吸引计划将继续帮助缓解各个行业的劳动力短缺.\n\n# 银行业的表现\n\n2023年,香港银行业面临着一系列挑战,包括高利率环境,美国和欧洲银行业动荡导致的全球金融市场波动,以及大陆和香港经济复苏速度比预期慢.尽管有这些多重的逆风,但香港银行业的资产质量仍然很好,尽管分类贷款比率有所增加.银行业的利能力显著提高,主要是由于净利收入较高.\n\n# 资产质量\n\n银行业的分类贷款比率在2023年底上升至1.56% (从2022年底的1.40%),逾期和重新安排贷款比率在同一时期从0.85%上升至1.24% (图5).与大陆相关贷款的分类贷款比率也从前一年的2.26%上升到2023年底的2.58% .分类贷款比率的增加主要是由于对大陆房地产开发商的风险评级下调.然而,银行设置的预备金仍然存在.预备金覆盖率 (即分类贷款的总预备金) 足够在2023年底为75% .如果考虑到对分类贷款的市场担保价值,则调整后的覆盖率将达到145%左右.与此同时,住宅抵押贷款和信用卡贷款的违约率在2023年底仍然很低,分别为0.08%和0.30% (图6).\n\n图5 银行业资产质量 注意:数据涵盖香港办事处,海外分支机构和主要海外子公司.\n\n图6 住宅抵押贷款和信用卡贷款的违约率 来源:香港金融管理局\n\n#利趋势\n\n银行业在2023年实现了显著的利增长.零售银行税前营业利总额在同期增长了62.1%,而平均资产税后回报率从0.57%上升到0.89% (图7).利的改善主要是由于净利息收入的增加 (+30%),加上2023年交易所持有的投资大幅增加,而前一年的轻微损失.由于为新分类贷款预留了特定准备金,这部分被贷款减值费用增加 (+28%) 抵消.在利率上升的背景下,零售银行在2023年净利息率从一年前的1.31%扩大到1.68% (图8).与此同时,零售银行成本/收入比率在2023年从2022年的48.0%下降到38.8% (图9).\n\n图7 零售银行业绩来源:香港银行管理局\n\n图8 零售银行 净利率来源:香港金融管理局\n\n图9 零售银行成本与收入的比率 来源:HKMA\n\n# 资产负债表趋势\n\n银行业的资产负债表在2023年增长了0.9%,因为持有可转让债券的增长 (+8.6%) 和银行间贷款 (+4.4%) 大多被总贷款的下降所抵消.鉴于借贷成本上升和全球经济前景疲软的背景下,贷款需求低迷,2023年总贷款下降了3.6%.在总贷款中,用于香港的贷款基本保持稳定 (-0.4%),而用于香港以外的贷款和贸易融资则分别下降了10.4%和13.1%.与大陆相关的贷款在2023年下降了6.6%.\n\n在负债方面,总存款在2023年增长了5.1%,而在2022年增长了1.7%.由于总贷款下降,而总存款增长,总贷款与存款比率在2023年底下降至62.8%,而前一年为68.5% (图10).\n\n#资本充足性\n\n银行业在2023年保持良好资本化.当地注册的授权机构 (AI) 的整合总资本比率为21.1%,而前一年为20.1%.一级资本比率为18.9% (图 11).这两种比率都远高于各自的国际最低要求.巴塞尔III杆率在2023年底为7.9% (图 12).\n\n图10 银行业贷款和存款来源:香港银行管理局\n\n图表11 地方注册的国际投资机构的合并资本比率 来源:HKMA\n\n图12 地方注册的国际投资机构的整合杆率 来源:HKMA\n\n#流动性条件\n\n银行业继续保持强的流动性.2023年第四季度,一类机构的季度平均流动性覆盖率 (LCR) 为178.6%,二类机构的季度平均流动性维持率 (LMR) 为65.7% (图 13).银行业的主要资金来源仍是客户存款.一类机构的净稳定资金比率 (NSFR) 和二A类机构的核心资金比率 (CFR) 在2023年底分别为144.4%和169.4% (图 14).这四个比率均远高于法定最低要求.\n\n图13 指定国际银行流动性比率 来源:HKMA\n\n图表14 指定国际投资机构的融资比率 来源:香港金融管理局"}
{"en": "# Monetary Stability\n\nIn 2023, amid market expectations of a “high for longer” US policy rate, the Hong Kong dollar mostly traded on the weak side of the Convertibility Zone, with the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking being triggered eight times between mid-February and early May.  The Hong Kong dollar had regained some momentum since May and traded around the central parity rate of 7.8 at year end.  Under the Linked Exchange Rate System, which marked its 40th anniversary in 2023, the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates generally track their US dollar counterparts, while also being affected by local supply and demand.  Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets remained stable and traded in a smooth and orderly manner.  As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, the Linked Exchange Rate System has shown its strength and resilience to various external shocks time after time.\n\n# Objectives\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability.  This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1.  The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n- Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks;\n- Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation;\n- The Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of clearing account balances kept with the HKMA; and\n- Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs).  With the HKMA standing ready to sell (or buy) Hong Kong dollars to (or from) banks in exchange for US dollars upon request at HK$7.75 (or HK$7.85) per US dollar when the strong-side (or weak-side) CU is triggered, the Aggregate Balance will expand (or contract) to push down (or up) Hong Kong dollar interest rates, helping move the Hong Kong dollar back to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85.\n\n# Review of 2023\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nAmid the market expectation of a “high for longer” US policy rate, the Hong Kong dollar remained soft and mostly traded on the weak side of the Convertibility Zone throughout 2023.  The weak-side CU was triggered eight times from mid-February to early May.  The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate regained some strength during early May to July, partly driven by dividend payment-related demand from listed companies and half-year-end funding needs by corporates. Thereafter, the Hong Kong dollar was mainly driven by the changes in local funding demands, such as buying flows through the Southbound Stock Connect, and traded around the central parity rate of 7.8 at year end (Chart 1).  Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market continued to function normally throughout 2023.\n\nChart 1 Market exchange rate in 2023\n\nFrom February to May, the HKMA purchased a total of HK$51.5 billion at the weak-side CU at the request of banks in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS).  Reflecting the triggering of the weak-side CU, the Aggregate Balance decreased from HK$96.3 billion at the end of 2022 to HK$45.0 billion at the end of 2023. Meanwhile, the outstanding EFBNs increased slightly from HK$1,200.4 billion to HK$1,245.5 billion during the year. The total of the Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs therefore declined from HK$1,296.7 billion at the end of 2022 to HK$1,290.4 billion at the end of 2023 (Chart 2). The Monetary Base as a whole remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\nChart 2 Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding Exchange Fund papers in 2023\n\n# Money market\n\nUnder the LERS, the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs) generally track their US dollar counterparts.  As the US continued to raise interest rates in the first seven months of 2023, the HIBORs generally rose (Chart 3).  For the year as a whole, the overnight, 1-month and 3-month HIBORs increased respectively by 286, 92 and 16 basis points to 6.09%, 5.27% and 5.15% at year end.\n\nFollowing the increases in the target range for the US federal funds rate, the Base Rate was adjusted upwards four times by a total of one percentage point (i.e. 100 basis points) from 4.75% to 5.75%.1 On the retail front, following the US policy rate hikes, many banks raised their Best Lending Rates by 12.5 basis points in early May and another 12.5 basis points in late July.  Some banks also increased the cap on HIBOR-based mortgage rates of newly approved mortgage loans during the year, and the average interest rate of new mortgage loans rose from 3.35% in 2022 to 4.13% in December 2023.  Overall, Hong Kong’s money markets continued to function normally.  Discount Window borrowing increased to HK$38.8 billion in 2023 from HK$8.4 billion in 2022 and no abnormality was noted in the relevant usage.\n\nChart 3 Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates in 2023\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nThe LERS has been a strong anchor of Hong Kong’s financial system for four decades and has shown its strength and resilience to challenges.  Despite lingering uncertainties surrounding the US interest rate path and global economic recovery, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to function in an orderly manner, reflecting the robustness of the LERS.  The Government is firmly committed to the LERS.  In its 2023 External Sector Report, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) once again reiterated that the credibility of the LERS has been ensured by a transparent set of rules, large fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nA robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS.  Hong Kong’s banking sector continued to operate smoothly with liquidity positions and capitalisation faring very well by international standards.  To ensure the resilience of the banking sector, the HKMA has been closely monitoring banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress testing results, and has maintained its supervisory efforts on bank lending.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of the Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) rose from 110.12% at the end of 2022 to a high of 112.71% on 4 May 2023, surpassing the Upper Trigger Level of 112.5% (Chart 4).  This largely reflected the contraction in the Aggregate Balance as a result of the triggering of the weak-side CU in the first half of the year2. In accordance with the arrangement approved by the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee and as a result of the redemption of Certificates of Indebtedness, assets were transferred out of the Backing Portfolio to the Investment Portfolio to reduce the Backing Ratio to around 109.97% on 8 May.  Thereafter, the Backing Ratio rose steadily to close at 110.73% on 31 December.  Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate.  The ample financial resources of the Exchange Fund, together with the sound banking system, provide a powerful backstop to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nChart 4 Daily movement of the Backing Ratio in 2023\n\n# Currency Board Sub-Committee\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong.  In 2023, the CBC considered issues including the May 2022 stablecoin market crash, the transmission of Federal Reserve’s dollar liquidity backstop measures to banks in Hong Kong, and the recent movements in the Hong Kong dollar interest rates.  Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Notes and coins\n\nThe below table summarises the value of the notes and coins in circulation at the end of 2023:\n\nChart 5 Banknotes in circulation by note-issuing banks at the end of 2023\n\nChart 6 Distribution of banknotes in circulation at the end of 2023\n\nChart 7 Banknotes in circulation at the end of 2023\n\nChart 8 Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation at the end of 2023\n\nChart 9 Breakdown of Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation at the end of 2023\n\n# Hong Kong banknotes\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA continued to organise seminars on the design and security features of Hong Kong banknotes for bank tellers, cashiers from retail establishments and students to help enhance their knowledge and skills in authenticating banknotes.  During 2023, 15 seminars were arranged for around 3,000 participants.\n\n# Coin Collection Programme\n\nThe Coin Collection Programme continued to be well received by the public.  More information about the Programme can be found in the Sustainable HKMA chapter of the Sustainability Report 2023.\n\n# Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\n\nThe EFBN Programme operated smoothly.  At the end of 2023, the nominal amount of outstanding Exchange Fund papers stood at around HK$1,255.4 billion (Table 2).\n\nTable 2 Outstanding issues of EFBNs\n\n# Monetary research\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMR)3, the research arm of the Hong Kong Academy of Finance, published 20 working papers and held 17 seminars/ webinars on monetary and financial research topics that are of strategic importance to Hong Kong and the region. The HKIMR also published six eJournals on the Social Science Research Network (SSRN) to disseminate research outputs to SSRN’s global research community.  Moreover, to provide the public with a high-level, non-technical summary of the recently published working papers, the HKIMR published two issues of Insights from Monetary Research.\n\nApart from its research activities, the HKIMR organised four international events, one roundtable and four seminars/ webinars with academia, global central banks and international financial institutions to promote dialogue and exchange on economic and financial issues:\n\n# 9 Mar\n\nA seminar on China’s Rebound: Recent Developments and Outlook by Dr Steven Alan Barnett, Senior Resident Representative in China of the IMF, and Dr Phakawa Jeasakul, Resident Representative for People’s Republic of China – Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) of the IMF, was held. Dr Barnett shared his views on the latest developments in the Chinese economy, as well as short- and medium-term issues that need to be addressed. More than 100 participants attended the seminar.\n\n# 17 Apr\n\nA seminar on Navigating Through a Challenging World was held. Four experts from the IMF shared their views on the analytical chapters of the most recent issues of World Economic Outlook and Global Financial Stability Report by the IMF. Over 50 participants attended the seminar.\n\n# 25 Apr\n\nA seminar with the presentation of the IMF’s April 2023 Global Financial Stability Report titled Safeguarding Global Financial Stability amid High Inflation and Interest Rates by Dr Jason Wu, Assistant Director, and Mr Thomas Pointek, Senior Financial Sector Expert, of the IMF’s Monetary and Capital Markets Department was held. More than 80 participants attended the seminar.\n\n# 2 May\n\nA fireside chat on Asia in a Challenging World was hosted between Mr Krishna Srinivasan, Director of the Asia and Pacific Department of the IMF, and Mr Eddie Yue, Chief Executive of the HKMA. Mr Srinivasan outlined the key messages of the recent IMF Regional Economic Outlook report for Asia and shared his views on the key drivers and risks of the global and regional economy. In addition, the dialogue covered many important issues concerning the regional economy and the evolution of the international monetary system. Around 120 participants attended the event.", "zh": "#货币稳定性\n\n在市场预期的\"高长期\"政策下,香港美元在2月中旬至5月初期间被触发了8次.香港美元自5月以来恢复了一些势头,并在年底交易了7.8的中央平价.在2023年庆祝40周年之际,香港银行间的报价率通常会跟随美元的同行,同时也会受到当地供应和需求的影响.总的来说,香港美元的汇率和货币市场保持稳定,以顺利和有序的方式交易.作为香港货币和金融稳定的基石,链接汇率系统已经显示出其强度和适应性.\n\n#目标\n\n香港货币政策的首要目标是货币稳定.这是香港货币在外汇市场上的汇率稳定,在7.75美元到7.85美元的范围内.货币体系的结构以货币委员会安排为特征,要求货币基础至少100%由汇率基金持有的美元储备支持,货币基础的变化必须100%与美元储备的相应变化相匹配.\n\n货币基础 (表1) 包含: - 债务证书,为三个发行银行发行的纸币提供全部支持; - 政府发行的流通货币纸币和硬币; - 总余额,即在HKMA持有的结算账户余额的总和; - 由HKMA代表政府发行的汇率基金票据和票据 (EFBNs).\n\n香港元汇率的稳定性是通过自动利率调整机制和香港证券交易管理局 (HKMA) 坚定承诺遵守可换承诺 (CUs) 的.当强势 (或弱势) CU触发时,随着HKMA随时准备以每美元7.75港元 (或7.85港元) 的价格向银行 (或从银行) 卖出 (或购买) 香港元以换取美元,汇总余额将扩大 (或收缩) 以推动香港元利率下降 (或上升),帮助将香港元重新移至7.75至7.85的可换区内.\n\n# 关于2023年的回顾\n\n# 汇率稳定性\n\n由于市场预期美国政策利率\"长期高\",香港美元在2023年期间保持软弱,主要在可转换区的弱点上交易.从2月中旬到5月初,香港美元汇率恢复了一些强度,部分原因是上市公司的股息支付相关需求和企业半年期融资需求.此后,香港美元主要受到当地融资需求的变化的影响,例如通过南方股票连接购买流动,并在年底交易7.8的中央平价 (图1).整体而言,香港美元汇率市场在2023年期间继续正常运行.\n\n图1 2023 年的市场汇率\n\n从2月到5月,根据银行要求,根据联汇汇率系统 (LERS) 的设计,香港金融管理局在弱势货币币币购买了总计515亿港元.反映弱势货币币币的触发,汇总余额从2022年底的963亿港元下降到2023年底的450亿港元.与此同时,在一年中,现存的EFBN从12004亿港元增加到12455亿港元.因此,汇总余额和现存的EFBN总额从2022年底的1296.7亿港元下降到2023年底的1290.4亿港元 (图2).整体而言,货币基础仍完全由外汇储备提供支持.\n\n图2 总余额 (在折扣窗口之前) 和2023年交换基金的债务\n\n# 货币市场\n\n根据LERS,香港银行间提议利率 (HIBOR) 通常跟随其美元对应价.随着美国在2023年前七个月继续提高利率,HIBOR通常上升 (图3).整年,一夜间,1个月和3个月的HIBOR分别上升了286,92和16个基点,达到6.09%,5.27%和5.15%在年底.\n\n随着美国联邦基金利率的目标范围的提高,基本利率由4.75%至5.75%调整了四次.在零售方面,在美国政策利率上调之后,许多银行在5月初将最佳贷款利率提高了12.5个基点,并在7月下旬又提高了12.5个基点.一些银行还在今年期间提高了新批准的抵押贷款利率,新抵押贷款的平均利率从2022年的3.3%上升到2023年12月的4.13%.总体而言,香港的货币市场继续正常运行.折扣窗口借款在2023年增加到388亿港元,而在2022年是84亿港元,相关使用没有发现异常.\n\n图3 香港银行间利率在2023年\n\n# 联汇汇率系统\n\n香港经济局长表示,尽管美国的利率走向不确定,但香港的货币市场仍在稳定运行.国际货币基金组织在2023年\"外部部门报告\"中再次重申,香港经济局长的说法是:\n\n强大的银行体系对于LERS的正常运作至关重要.香港的银行部门继续顺利运作,流动性和资本化情况非常好.为了确保银行部门的弹性,HKMA一直在密切监督银行管理的信贷,流动性和利率风险以及压力测试结果.\n\n为了提高货币理事会的透明度,从支持组合资产到投资组合资产的比例稳步上升,达到110.7%.\n\n图表4 退缩比率的每日变化\n\n# 货币委员会小组委员会\n\n汇率基金咨询委员会监督和审查有关香港货币和金融稳定的问题.在2023年,汇率委员会考虑了包括2022年5月稳定币市场崩,联邦储备委员会向香港银行转发美元流动性支持措施,以及最近的香港美元利率变化.汇率委员会的这些讨论记录和汇率委员会的报告都在香港汇率委员会的网站上公布.\n\n# 纸币和硬币\n\n下表总结了2023年底流通中的纸币和硬币的价值:\n\n图5 发行银行在2023年底流通的纸币\n\n图62023年底流通的纸币分布\n\n图7 在2023年底流通的纸币\n\n图8 在2023年底流通的政府发行的货币纸币和硬币\n\n图9 于2023年底流通的政府发行的货币纸币和硬币的分类\n\n# 香港的纸币\n\n在今年,香港银行继续组织关于香港银行纸币设计和安全特征的研讨会,以帮助提高银行纸币的真实性.在2023年,为约3000名参与者安排了15个研讨会.\n\n# 收藏硬币的计划\n\n硬币收集计划继续受到公众的欢迎.有关该计划的更多信息可以在2023年可持续发展报告的可持续发展章节中找到.\n\n# 汇票基金账单和纸币\n\n根据该基金的数据,该基金的债务额为1,460亿港元.\n\n表 2 关于EFBN 的未决问题\n\n#货币研究\n\n香港金融学院的研究部门香港金融研究所发表了20篇工作论文,并举行了17场关于香港和该地区战略重要性的货币和金融研究主题的研讨会/网络研讨会.香港金融研究所还在社会科学研究网络 (SSRN) 上发表了6篇电子期刊,以向SSRN的全球研究社区传播研究成果.此外,为了向公众提供最近发表的高层次,非技术性的工作论文,香港金融研究所发表了两期货币研究洞察.\n\n除了研究活动,HKIMR还组织了四个国际活动,一个圆桌会议和四个与学术界,全球央行和国际金融机构的研讨会/网络会议,以促进经济和金融问题的对话和交流.\n\n# 3月9日\n\n国际货币基金组织中国高级驻代表史蒂文·艾伦·巴内特博士和国际货币基金组织中华人民共和国驻代表法卡瓦·杰萨库尔博士举行了\"中国经济复苏:近期发展和前景\"研讨会.巴内特博士就中国经济的最新发展以及需要解决的短期和中期问题发表了意见.超过100名参与者参加了研讨会.\n\n# 4月17日\n\n国际货币基金组织组织在\"世界经济展望\"和\"全球金融稳定报告\"中发表了关于\"如何应对充满挑战的世界\"的四篇分析文章.\n\n#25年4月\n\n国际货币基金组织在2023年4月发布的\"在高通胀和利率的情况下维护全球金融稳定\"研讨会,由国际货币基金组织货币和资本市场部门高级专家托马斯·波因特克主持.\n\n# 5月2日\n\n国际货币基金组织亚洲和太平洋部门主任克里斯纳·斯里尼瓦桑先生与香港金融管理局的首席执行官进行了关于\"亚洲地区经济前景\"的对话.此外,对话还涉及了许多与区域经济和国际货币体系发展有关的重要问题."}
{"en": "# Banking Stability\n\nThe banking sector in Hong Kong remained strong and resilient in 2023 despite multiple headwinds, including the March banking turmoil in the US and Europe, a high interest rate environment and geopolitical tensions. The HKMA responded swiftly to the March banking turmoil — from managing the ripple effects to completing an internal review (covering such areas as the supervisory processes and resolution framework) drawing lessons for the local banking sector, while maintaining its focus on the credit, liquidity and market risk management of authorized institutions. In light of escalating cyber threats and the increasing use of technology services provided by third parties, the HKMA also worked closely with authorized institutions to enhance their operational and cyber resilience.\n\nThe HKMA enhanced consumer protection in respect of payment cards, and through further revision of the Code of Banking Practice as well as the launch of the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter. The HKMA worked with fellow regulators on a balanced regulatory regime for virtual asset-related activities, streamlined the selling process for sophisticated professional investors, introduced enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Pilot Scheme, and commenced supervision of trust business. A pilot programme was launched to prepare for provision of consumer credit reference services under “Credit Data Smart”.\n\nThe HKMA’s efforts in anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) reflect a commitment to targeting the highest threats under a risk-based approach. To address increasing digital fraud, the HKMA has strengthened ecosystem collaboration through the launch of real-time fraud monitoring and expanding the scope of public-private information-sharing partnerships, including the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce. The launch of a ground-breaking platform to facilitate bank-to-bank information sharing will help address the risk of mule account networks, while the HKMA also worked closely with the industry to take concerted action to handle increasing fraud-related banking complaints and raise public awareness about different scams, including a pre-transaction alert mechanism when using the Faster Payment System. In parallel, supervisory technology capabilities were also advanced through the Macro Analytics pilot scheme.\n\nGood progress was made on implementing international supervisory standards locally, including those on capital adequacy and disclosure. Notable efforts were also made in enhancing capacity building in the banking sector, attracting and nurturing future talents and upskilling existing practitioners. In addition, the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board completed a public consultation on proposed enhancements to the Deposit Protection Scheme.\n\nThe HKMA continued to advance its work to ensure a credible resolution regime. A new resolution standard related to accessing critical financial market infrastructures was developed and a review on experiences of implementing loss-absorbing capacity policy standards was completed. Significant progress was made in resolution planning with banks to address early termination risk and operational continuity in resolution. The HKMA also continued to be active in international policy initiatives and regional co-operation on resolution.\n\n# Objectives\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this objective is contingent upon a highly resilient financial system that is capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their businesses and, in extreme cases, by failing in a disorderly manner. The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring that banks are resilient to shocks and able to recover their positions in response to crises, ultimately helping to prevent failures. The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks and is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs).\n\nThe Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework is not designed to ensure a zero-risk financial system. Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that, in the event of an AI becoming non-viable, its failure can be managed in an orderly manner. To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong has been established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs, among other types of institutions. To operationalise the resolution regime in Hong Kong, it is important to lay down resolution rules and policy standards, undertake resolution planning to remove impediments to AIs’ resolvability and develop the HKMA’s operational capability to resolve a failing AI. In order to carry out these tasks effectively, the HKMA adopts an internationally harmonised and co-ordinated approach.\n\nThe Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs). In overseeing FMIs, the HKMA aims to promote their general safety and efficiency, limit systemic risk and foster transparency. Making FMIs more resilient to financial crises protects the monetary and financial systems in Hong Kong from possible destabilising effects arising from disruption to the FMIs.\n\n# Review of 2023\n\n# Licensing\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA granted one banking licence and one restricted bank licence to two banks incorporated outside Hong Kong. The HKMA also granted money broker approval to four foreign trading platform operators and revoked another approval granted to one money broker. The HKMA revoked authorizations of five licensed banks during the year.\n\nMore information about the AIs and local representative offices in Hong Kong can be found in the Annex and Tables D to F on pages 313 to 316 and 322 to 325 respectively.\n\n# Review of three-tier banking system\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA conducted a comprehensive review on the three-tier banking system in order to simplify the structure of Hong Kong’s banking system. The review found that the three-tier system has become more complex than necessary to achieve the original aim to strike a balance between flexibility of entry into the banking system and protection of small depositors. Subsequently, the HKMA commenced a three-month consultation in June on a proposal to simplify the three-tier banking system into two tiers by merging deposit-taking companies into the restricted licence bank sector, thereby forming a new second tier of Hong Kong’s banking system. Respondents were generally supportive of the proposal.\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA conducted 177 off-site reviews covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL rating assessment1, corporate governance and risk management. As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance, 38 meetings were held with the boards of directors, independent non-executive directors or board-level committees of AIs. Furthermore, 38 tripartite meetings were held among the HKMA, AIs and their external auditors.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA conducted regular on-site examinations on a wide range of AIs’ activities. Credit risk management was a key focus given the challenging credit risk landscape amid a high interest rate environment and debt defaults by some Mainland property developers. The management of operational risk and technology risk was another major focus as the adoption of technology by AIs gathered further momentum. The HKMA also stepped up its supervisory work on climate risk management and rolled out a new round of thematic examinations focused on climaterelated risk governance, and a series of consultative sessions to provide supervisory guidance to AIs.\n\nThe banking turmoil in the US and Europe that started in March 2023 was the most significant system-wide banking stress since the Great Financial Crisis of 2008 in terms of scale and scope. The HKMA stayed on high alert as the turmoil unfolded and took a number of precautionary actions to ensure that any potential fallout would not undermine confidence in the local banking and financial system. After the episode, the HKMA conducted an internal review exercise having regard to the observations and experience gained from the turmoil. Based on this exercise, the HKMA developed a detailed action plan to incorporate lessons learnt with a view to strengthening its supervisory effectiveness and augmenting its ability to handle a banking crisis if one did occur. See Liquidity and market risks on page 95 for more details on the HKMA’s work in this respect.\n\nOn conduct supervision, the HKMA carried out on-site examinations in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses as well as consumer protection matters, supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk or new initiatives.\n\nTable 1 contains a summary of the HKMA’s supervisory activities in 2023.\n\nTable 1 Summary of supervisory activities\n\n# Credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nTotal loans decreased by 3.6% in 2023, compared with a decline of 3.0% in 2022. Table 2 shows the breakdown of growth in loans and advances. Mainland-related lending decreased by 6.6% to HK$4,226 billion in 2023 (Table 3).\n\nTable 2 Growth in loans and advances\n\nTable 3 Growth in Mainland-related lending\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA intensified supervisory efforts in monitoring AIs’ asset quality and assessing their credit risk management practices given the high interest rate environment and continued weakness in the Mainland property market. The asset quality of the banking sector deteriorated during the year but remained manageable. The classified loan ratio of the banking sector was 1.56% at the end of 2023, up from 1.40% at the end of 2022. The classified loan ratio for Mainland-related lending increased to 2.58% from 2.26% at the end of 2022.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA conducted targeted and thematic examinations to evaluate AIs’ credit risk management focusing on exposures to vulnerable sectors, premium financing, oversight of credit risks at operations outside Hong Kong and exposures to non-bank financial institutions.\n\n# Alleviating cash flow pressure faced by bank customers\n\nThe HKMA and the Banking Sector Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) Lending Coordination Mechanism announced in July the commencement of an orderly exit from the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme. The Scheme was introduced in May 2020 to tide eligible corporates over the pandemic. Taking into account the views of the commercial sectors, the partial principal repayment options were enhanced to assist corporates’ gradual return to normal repayment. Where sectors or individual borrowers were still facing challenges despite the end of the pandemic, banks continued to offer principal moratorium or other suitable credit relief measures on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe HKMA also encouraged banks to be sympathetic in handling the funding needs of corporates which had not participated in the Scheme but were facing cash flow pressures due to individual circumstances. The HKMA reminded banks to follow the “Hong Kong Approach to Corporate Difficulties” guidelines in dealing with corporates encountering repayment problems, so that individual banks would act collaboratively in the common interest of the lenders involved.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nThe successive rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures introduced by the HKMA since 2009 have strengthened banks’ risk management of their property mortgage lending business and the banking sector’s capacity to cope with challenges arising from a sharp correction in property prices. The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of new residential mortgage loans approved in 2023 stood at 57%, compared with 64% in September 2009 before the countercyclical measures were first introduced (Chart 1). The average debt servicing ratio (DSR) of new mortgages stayed low at 40% in 2023, compared with 41% in August 2010 when a cap on DSR was first applied.\n\nOn 7 July, the HKMA adjusted the countercyclical macroprudential measures after taking into account factors such as property prices, transaction volumes and the local and external economic environment. This was the first time the countercyclical macroprudential measures for residential properties were relaxed since their introduction in 2009. The adjustments included increasing the maximum LTV ratios for residential properties and commercial properties, as well as for mortgage loans assessed based on the net worth of mortgage applicants. In addition, the requirements to lower the applicable maximum LTV ratio and DSR limit by ten percentage points for mortgage applicants with incomes derived mainly from places outside of Hong Kong were lifted. The HKMA also removed the requirement to apply a five-percentage-point reduction on applicable DSR limits when mortgage applicants’ total mortgage finance exceeded the HKMA’s normal permissible LTV ceilings by 20 percentage points.\n\nChart 1 Average LTV ratio and DSR of new residential mortgage loans approved", "zh": "#银行稳定\n\n尽管有多次逆风,包括美国和欧洲的银行动荡,高利率环境和地缘政治紧张局势,香港金融管理局迅速应对了3月份的银行动荡,从管理效到完成内部审查 (包括监管流程和解决框架等领域),同时保持对授权机构的信贷,流动性和市场风险管理的关注.鉴于网络威胁的不断升级以及第三方提供的技术服务的日益使用,香港金融管理局也与授权机构密切合作,以提高其运营和网络弹性.\n\n香港管理局通过进一步修订银行行为准则以及推出反欺诈消费者保护宪章,为复杂的专业投资者简化销售流程,对跨境财富管理连接试点计划进行了改进,并开始监督信托业务.\n\n香港金融管理局在反洗钱和反恐怖主义方面所做的努力反映了以风险为基础的目标.为了应对日益严重的数字欺诈,香港金融管理局通过实时欺诈监测和扩大公私信息共享的范围,推出了突破性的平台,以帮助解决与子账户网络有关的风险,同时,香港金融管理局还与行业采取了协调一致的行动,以提高公众对各种欺诈行为的认识,包括使用快速支付系统时的交易预警机制.\n\n在当地实施国际监管标准方面取得了很好的进展,包括资本充足性和披露.在银行部门加强能力建设,吸引和培养未来的人才,并提高现有从业人员的技能.此外,香港存款保护委员会完成了关于提议的增强存款保护计划的公开咨询.\n\n香港管理局继续推进其确保可信度的解决方案.与关键金融市场基础设施的接触有关,并完成了对实施损失吸收能力政策标准的审查.在解决早期终止风险和操作连续性的银行方面,香港管理局也继续积极开展国际政策倡议.\n\n#目标\n\n香港管理局的总体目标是促进银行系统的安全和稳定.实现这一目标取决于能够提供香港经济所需的关键金融服务.\n\n银行通过开展业务,在极端情况下,通过无序失败来影响系统的稳定.作为监管机构,货币管理局在保障金融稳定方面发挥着关键作用,确保银行能够抵御冲击,并能够恢复其应对危机的地位,最终有助于防止破产.货币管理局负责对银行进行审慎监督,并负责授权香港的授权银行,限制性许可银行和存款公司,这些机构集体称为授权机构 (AIs).\n\n香港的审慎监管框架并不是为了确保零风险的金融系统.相反,作为一个解决方案的机构,该机构希望能够有序地管理AI的失败.为此,香港设立了一个金融机构的解决方案制度,该制度下,金融机构是AI的解决方案机构.为了使香港的解决方案制度能够运行,必须制定解决方案规则和政策标准,以消除AI的解决方案.为了有效地执行这些任务,香港金融管理局采用了国际协调的方法.\n\n金融管理局还负责指定和监督某些金融市场基础设施.在监督金融市场时,HKMA的目标是促进其一般安全性和效率,限制系统风险,促进透明度.使金融市场对金融危机更具弹性,保护香港的货币和金融系统免受金融市场中出现的破坏性影响.\n\n# 关于2023年的回顾\n\n# 许可证\n\n在一年中,HKMA向两家在香港以外的银行授予了一份银行许可证.HKMA还向四家外国交易平台运营商授予了一份银行许可证,并对五家持牌银行进行了撤销.\n\n关于香港的AI和地方代表处的更多信息可在附件和表D至F分别在第313至316页和第322至325页找到.\n\n# 审查三层银行体系\n\n在2023年,香港金融管理局对三级银行体系进行了全面审查,以简化香港银行体系的结构.调查结果显示,三级银行体系的灵活性与小规模存款者的保护之间存在着相对较为复杂的关系.\n\n# 监管活动概述\n\n在2023年,香港证券管理局进行了177次场外审查,涵盖了包括CAMEL评级评估1,公司治理和风险管理在内的广泛问题.作为香港证券管理局继续努力促进更强大的风险治理的一部分,与AI董事会,独立非执行董事或董事会级委员会举行了38次会议.此外,香港证券管理局,AI及其外部审计师之间还举行了38次三方会议.\n\n除了场外活动,HKMA还定期对各种AI活动进行检查.鉴于高利率环境和一些大陆房地产开发商的债务违约,信用风险管理是另一个主要的重点,因为AI采用技术获得了进一步的发展.HKMA还加强了气候风险管理的监督工作,并推出了新的专题检查,以提供对AI的监督指导.\n\n美国和欧洲的银行动荡是2008年金融危机以来最严重的系统性压力.随着动荡的发展,HKMA采取了一些预防措施,以确保任何潜在的后果不会破坏对当地银行和金融系统的信心.在此基础上,HKMA制定了详细的行动计划,以纳入经验教训,以加强其监管效率,并提高其处理银行危机的能力.\n\n关于行为监督,HKMA对证券,投资产品,保险和与强制性预计基金 (MPF) 相关的业务以及消费者保护问题进行了现场审查,并对被认为具有更高风险或新举措的领域进行了专题审查.\n\n图表1中总结了HKMA在2023年的监管活动.\n\n表1 监管活动总结\n\n# 信用风险\n\n# 信用增长和资产质量\n\n总贷款在2023年下降3.6%,而2022年下降3.0%.表2显示贷款和预付款增长的分类.与大陆相关的贷款在2023年下降6.6%,至4226亿港元 (表3).\n\n表 2 贷款和预付款的增长\n\n图3 与大陆相关的贷款增长\n\n在2023年,香港管理局加强监督,鉴于高利率环境和内地房地产市场的持续疲软,银行业的分类贷款比例为1.56%,高于2022年底的2.26%.\n\n在今年,香港金融管理局进行了针对性和专题性审查,重点关注对脆弱部门的风险,保费融资,对香港以外的业务的信用风险以及对非银行金融机构的风险.\n\n# 缓解银行客户面临的现金流压力\n\n香港管理局和银行业中小企业 (SME) 贷款协调机制在7月宣布开始有序退出预先批准的首要支付假期计划.该计划于2020年5月推出,以帮助符合条件的企业在疫情期间.考虑到商业部门的观点,部分首要偿还选项得到了加强,以帮助企业逐步恢复正常偿还.尽管疫情结束,但各个部门或个人借款人仍面临挑战,银行继续根据具体情况提供首要停滞或其他合适的信用救济措施.\n\n香港管理局还鼓励银行对未参与该计划但因个人情况而面临现金流压力的公司进行同情.香港管理局提醒银行在处理遇到偿还问题时遵循\"香港方法\"的指导方针,以便各个银行能够在相关贷款人的共同利益中协作.\n\n# 房地产抵押贷款\n\n自2009年以来,香港金融管理局推出的连续一轮反周期性宏观审慎措施加强了银行对房地产抵押贷款业务的风险管理,并加强了银行业应对房地产价格急剧调整带来的挑战的能力.在2023年批准的新住宅抵押贷款的平均贷款价值比率为57%,而在反周期性措施首次实施之前,在2009年9月为64% (图1).新抵押贷款的平均债务服务比率 (DSR) 在2023年保持在低水平,为40%,而在首次实施DSR上限时,在2010年8月为41%.\n\n7月7日,香港管理局在考虑房地产价格,交易量和当地和外部经济环境后,首次放宽了住宅物业的反周期性宏观审慎措施,以及根据抵押贷款申请人的净资产评估的最高LTV比率.此外,香港管理局还取消了适用DSR限制的5个百分点.\n\n图1 经批准的新住宅抵押贷款的平均LTV比率和DSR"}
{"en": "# International Financial Centre\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA utilised a multi-pronged approach to achieve notable progress in consolidating Hong Kong’s status as a globally competitive international financial centre.\n\nThe success of two major events, namely the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit and the HKMA-BIS High-Level Conference, had reinforced Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre and created positive ripple effects.\n\nThe HKMA, together with its Mainland and Hong Kong counterparts, made concerted efforts to deepen and widen the mutual access between the financial markets of Hong Kong and the Mainland. This included enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Scheme in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, the designation of additional market makers for Southbound Trading under Bond Connect, the successful launch of Northbound Trading of Swap Connect, and the roll-out of the HKD-RMB Dual Counter Model and the Dual Counter Market Making Programme. These initiatives were effective in strengthening Hong Kong’s gateway position and reinforcing the city’s status as a global hub for offshore renminbi business.\n\nThe HKMA also made good progress in strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, in areas including bond issuance, asset and wealth management, green and sustainable finance, and corporate treasury centres. To promote Hong Kong’s financial services, the HKMA stepped up its market outreach activities to overseas and Mainland stakeholders to keep them well informed about the opportunities in Hong Kong’s financial market and its resilience.\n\nSignificant progress has been made on all fronts of the HKMA’s “Fintech 2025” strategy, including in areas such as promoting fintech adoption, Central Bank Digital Currency, data infrastructure, talent development, and policies and funding support.\n\nThe Faster Payment System (FPS) marked its fifth anniversary in September. The number of registrations has grown steadily, and had reached 13.6 million at the end of 2023. The average daily turnover for the year rose to 1.25 million real-time transactions. FPS x PromptPay link for cross-border QR payment between Hong Kong and Thailand was jointly launched with the Bank of Thailand in December, providing a fast, secure and easily accessible cross-border retail payment service for people travelling between the two places.\n\nAs an active member of many international and regional central banking and regulatory forums, the HKMA continued to contribute to global efforts to maintain financial stability and promote financial market developments.\n\n# Overview\n\nThroughout the year, the HKMA continued making proactive efforts to strengthen Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre. In November, it organised the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit for the second year. This three-day event brought together prominent financial leaders from around the world to share their unique perspectives under the theme of “Living with Complexity”. With over 350 participants from 160 international financial institutions attending, the summit clearly showed the global financial sector’s commitment to and confidence in Hong Kong. In the same month, the HKMA and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) co-hosted the HKMA-BIS High Level Conference, which attracted more than 300 participants, including over 20 current and former central bank governors. The conference highlighted the HKMA’s close collaboration with the BIS as well as with the international central banking community.\n\nThe expansion of and enhancements made to the MainlandHong Kong Connect schemes have reinforced Hong Kong’s role as the bridge between the Mainland and international financial markets. A series of enhancements to the Crossboundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) scheme were introduced to facilitate cross-boundary retail investment in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA). Riding on the smooth operations of Southbound Bond Connect, the HKMA designated nine additional market makers to improve secondary liquidity and meet investor demand. Northbound Trading of Swap Connect was successfully launched in the year, enabling global investors to better manage the interest rate risks associated with their Mainland fixed income portfolio via Hong Kong.\n\nHong Kong’s offshore renminbi businesses saw robust growth during the year. The HKMA collaborated with the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) to launch the HKD-RMB Dual Counter Model and the Dual Counter Market Making Programme in June. This helped develop a more diverse range of renminbi-denominated products in Hong Kong by facilitating the issuance and trading of renminbidenominated stocks in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA continued to work on strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. In particular, to enhance Hong Kong’s appeal as a preferred fund management centre, the HKMA worked closely with the Government and the financial industry to provide a more facilitative tax and regulatory environment. Significant progress was also made in promoting innovation in Hong Kong’s bond market, and consolidating Hong Kong’s position as a regional green and sustainable finance hub. At the same time, the HKMA stepped up its market outreach activities to promote Hong Kong’s financial services to overseas and Mainland stakeholders.\n\nBoth the Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO) and the banking departments of the HKMA continued to implement the “Fintech 2025” strategy1 to promote wide adoption of financial technology (fintech) and strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia. Key initiatives implemented during the year included:\n- promoting further adoption in the tech focus areas of Wealthtech, Insurtech, Greentech, artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology (DLT);\n- advancing the work on wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) to improve cross-border payments;\n- progressing further in the study on the prospect of introducing a retail CBDC in Hong Kong, i.e. an e-HKD;\n- stepping up efforts to develop Commercial Data Interchange (CDI);\n- enhancing talent development;\n- nurturing the fintech ecosystem through funding and policies;\n- strengthening cross-border collaboration in fintech; and\n- expanding the adoption of the FPS.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure is vital for maintaining the city’s position as a leading international financial centre. In 2023, the four interbank Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) and the Hong Kong Trade Repository (HKTR) achieved 100%2 system availability, outperforming the target of 99.95%. The debt securities settlement service, including the Northbound and Southbound Bond Connect linkage service, continued to operate smoothly.\n\nAdoption of the FPS continued to increase in 2023, marking the significant milestone of the FPS reaching its fifth anniversary. The number of registrations for the FPS and the FPS turnover have grown steadily over the past five years, with the number of registrations growing to 13.6 million at the end of 2023 and the average daily turnover for the year rising by 33% from 2022. The increased use of the FPS for settling Government bills, making merchant payments, and topping up Stored Value Facility (SVF) e-wallets or bank accounts, were key drivers for the continued rise in the transaction volume, on top of steady growth in person-toperson and business payments.\n\nTo ensure the safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA oversees six designated retail payment systems (RPSs) and supervises 17 licensed SVFs (four of which are SVFs issued by licensed banks) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO). During the year, the HKMA also continued to facilitate the smooth implementation of the Government’s Consumption Voucher Scheme, helping to co-ordinate the relevant Government parties and the SVF licensees appointed for the scheme, and facilitate dialogue and co-operation between them.\n\nOn 27 December, the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau and the HKMA jointly issued a public consultation paper on regulation for stablecoin issuers. The HKMA subsequently introduced a sandbox arrangement on 12 March 2024 for institutions planning to issue fiat-referenced stablecoins in Hong Kong. At the same time, the HKMA has been actively participating in the work of international bodies in relation to crypto-asset activities, and monitoring the development of the market closely.\n\nInternationally, the HKMA has remained an active member of the central banking community and continued to play a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees. Currently, the HKMA co-chairs the Policy and Standards Group of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), as well as the Regional Consultative Group for Asia, the Non-Bank Monitoring Experts Group (until June) and the Financial Innovation Network of the Financial Stability Board (FSB). The HKMA also chairs the BIS’ Meeting of Governors from Major Emerging Market Economies (EMEs). Between 2018 and 2023, the HKMA served consecutive terms as the chair of the Working Group on Financial Markets established under the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP)3.\n\nThe HKMA also held bilateral meetings with the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates and the Saudi Central Bank in May and July respectively to promote investment and financial market connectivity between the Middle East and Asia. The sixth Hong Kong-Switzerland Financial Dialogue was held in Bern, Switzerland on 25 September, and the discussion covered topics on regional and domestic outlook and policy challenges, latest development, and potential collaboration in the areas of sustainable finance, fintech, and market connectivity.\n\n# A glance at the HKMA’s initiatives in 2023 in strengthening Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre\n\n# Strengthen connections with the world\n\n- Hosted series of international events: Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit, HKMA-BIS High-Level Conference and HKMA-BIS Joint Conference and Basel Committee meeting\n- Active participation in international central banking and regulatory forums\n- Stepped up market outreach to overseas and Mainland stakeholders to promote Hong Kong’s financial services and laid solid foundation for collaboration with Middle East\n\n# Enhance financial platform competitiveness\n\n- Promoted bond market innovation by assisting the Government to issue the world’s first tokenised government green bond\n- Supported dim sum bond issuances by Shenzhen and Hainan governments in Hong Kong\n- Signed Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the National Development and Reform Commission to support cross-border financing by Chinese enterprises in Hong Kong\n- Enhanced tax concession regimes for family offices and asset and wealth management industries\n- Continued raising Hong Kong’s value proposition as a Corporate Treasury Centre (CTC) hub and financing hub for infrastructure investments\n- Continued the development of Hong Kong’s treasury market and over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market\n- Consolidation of Hong Kong’s position as a regional green and sustainable finance hub\n\n# Ensure the reliability and efficiency of Hong Kong’s critical financial infrastructure\n\n- Continued to ensure the safe and efficient operation of the RTGS systems, CMU and the HKTR\n- Progressed with the upgrade of the CMU’s operational capacity and product offerings to develop the system into a major international central securities depository\n\n# Nurture future finance leaders and strengthen applied research capabilities\n\n- Continued the leadership development and research efforts by the Hong Kong Academy of Finance (AoF)\n\n# Deepen connectivity between the financial markets of Hong Kong and the Mainland and enhance Hong Kong’s role as an offshore renminbi business hub\n\n- Successful launch of Northbound Trading of Swap Connect\n- Enhancements to Cross-Boundary WMC\n- Designation of additional market makers for Southbound Trading under Bond Connect\n- Rollout of HKD-RMB Dual Counter Model and Dual Counter Market Making Programme\n- Good progress on initiatives to support corporates’ business operations and the livelihoods of residents in the GBA, e.g. enhanced cross-boundary fund flow management for GBA corporates, facilitative measures for Hong Kong residents on property purchases in GBA’s Mainland cities\n- Deepened exchanges between Mainland agencies and financial industry in Hong Kong to identify business opportunities\n\n# Reinforce Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia\n\n- Continued implementation of the “Fintech 2025” Strategy:\n    -

{"en": "# Reserves Management\n\nThe investment environment in 2023 was volatile and challenging. Although some banks in the US and Europe experienced liquidity issues at the beginning of the year, the associated risks did not spread across the financial markets. While levels of inflation in major developed economies have declined from their peak in 2023, they have remained above the targets set by major central banks. Following an aggressive rate hike cycle, the US Federal Reserve has paused hiking rate since the third quarter, and indicated that the policy rate was likely at or near its peak. This, coupled with a resilient US economy, has made investor sentiment more optimistic. However, ongoing geopolitical tensions, such as the Russia-Ukraine war and the outbreak of conflict in the Middle East during the year, added turbulence and uncertainties to the investment market. In this complicated and dynamic investment environment, the investment performance of the Exchange Fund experienced some ups and downs. Despite this, the Exchange Fund managed to achieve a decent investment return. In 2023, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$226.0 billion, representing an investment return of 5.5%.\n\n# The Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems in order to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The HKMA, under the delegated authority of the Financial Secretary and within the terms of the delegation, is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# Management of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(i) To preserve capital;\n(ii) To ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(iii) To ensure that sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(iv) Subject to (i)–(iii), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Exchange Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 Portfolio segregation of the Exchange Fund\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP). The BP holds highly liquid US dollardenominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base, as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The IP invests primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member economies of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, with a view to preserving the value and long-term purchasing power of its assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA diversifies part of the Exchange Fund’s investments in a prudent and incremental manner into a wider variety of asset classes. These include emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The target asset allocation of the LTGP is determined concurrently with that of other asset classes, subject to prudent risk management principles and portfolio diversification strategy.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007, holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that have been acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes. Due to its unique nature, the Strategic Portfolio is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by the Fiscal Reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP1. A major exception is the Future Fund2, which links its interest rate to the return of both the IP and the LTGP in accordance with the portfolio mix. The portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 35:65 in 2023.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: strategic asset allocation and tactical asset allocation. Strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents long-term asset allocation based on the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark (or strategic) allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and tracking error3 limit are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with the EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may assume positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nThe HKMA’s Exchange Fund Investment Office houses the Exchange Fund’s investment and related risk management functions. Exchange Fund Investment Office staff members directly manage about 71% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, comprising the entire BP and part of the IP. The part of the IP managed internally includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 29% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes. The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to realise sustainable returns, while also drawing on diverse and complementary investment styles and taking advantage of external market insights and technical expertise in investment.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is determined primarily by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nAs the investment environment becomes more complex, good risk management is increasingly important. The HKMA sets stringent controls and investment guidelines for both its internally and externally managed portfolios, and ensures that a proper risk monitoring and compliance system is in place. Three lines of defence are in place to implement effective risk management and governance of investment-related activities. Key risk categories (including credit, market, liquidity and operational risks) are regularly monitored. The risk management process provides a robust framework that supports the HKMA’s strategic planning and investment diversification efforts.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nThe HKMA believes that an appropriate emphasis on responsible investment and sustainable long-term economic performance can help better achieve the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund, as well as reduce risks associated with environmental, social and governance (ESG)-related matters of its underlying investments. To embrace responsible investment practices, the HKMA has integrated ESG factors into the investment processes of the Exchange Fund, with the guiding principle that priority will generally be given to ESG investments if their long-term risk-adjusted returns are comparable with other investments. For more details about the HKMA’s responsible investment work, see the Responsible Investment chapter of the Sustainability Report 2023.\n\n# Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\n# The financial markets in 2023\n\nThe investment environment in 2023 was volatile and challenging.\n\nGlobal equities were generally on an upward trend in 2023. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose by 24% during the year, especially in the fourth quarter as markets began to anticipate sooner-than-expected rate cuts.\n\nIn the bond markets, yields remained high, with the 10-year US Treasury yield surging above 5% at one point to reach its highest level since 2007. However, as market expectations of central banks’ monetary policies shifted, bond yields retreated towards the end of the year alongside a gradual increase in bond prices.\n\nIn the currency markets, the US dollar recorded a mixed performance against major currencies. Among these, the pound sterling and the euro appreciated against the US dollar, while the yen and the renminbi depreciated.\n\nThe performance of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2023 is shown in Table 1.\n\nTable 1 2023 market returns\n\n# Reserves Management\n\n# Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$226.0 billion in 2023. This comprised gains on bonds of HK$144.7 billion, gains on equities of HK$58.1 billion (with gains of HK$73.6 billion from foreign equities, and losses of HK$15.5 billion from Hong Kong equities), a negative currency translation effect of HK$0.5 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets, and gains of HK$23.7 billion on other investments held by the investment-holding subsidiaries of the Fund. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation loss of HK$4.8 billion.\n\nTotal assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,016.5 billion at the end of the year. The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$517.3 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$411.9 billion and real estate HK$105.4 billion. Outstanding investment commitments of the LTGP amounted to HK$291.1 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund in 2023, excluding the Strategic Portfolio, was 5.5%. The returns of the IP and the BP were 6.4% and 5.0% respectively. The LTGP has recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 11.8% since its inception in 2009.\n\nThe annual returns of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2023 are set out in Chart 1.

It contains the register of authorized institutions (AIs) and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance (BO), as well as the register of stored value facility licensees under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance.\n\nThe HKMA has been releasing financial data and important information on its website via an Open Application Programming Interface (Open API) in phases since 2018. By the end of 2023, the HKMA had opened up 175 sets of Open APIs on its website, in line with its target schedule.\n\nThe HKMA’s Open API portal:\n\n# Information Centre\n\nLocated on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre, the HKMA Information Centre consists of an exhibition area and a library designed to introduce the work of the HKMA to the community and enhance public awareness of monetary and banking matters.

To date, more than 66,000 people have participated in the public education programme. In 2023, a webinar was organised for over 1,200 students and teachers from 58 secondary schools. The webinar topics included an overview of the HKMA’s work, the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, protection of personal digital keys, the Deposit Protection Scheme, green finance, and career opportunities in the banking industry.\n\nThe HKMA educates and engages the public on how to be smart and responsible financial consumers. In light of the rise in phishing scams and credit card fraud, the HKMA continued its efforts across different media to remind the public to stay vigilant. A brand new awareness campaign was rolled out following the launch of the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter, emphasising that banks and major merchants have committed not to send hyperlinks via instant electronic messages soliciting personal and credit card information. The HKMA also passed on smart tips on credit cards, personal loans, online shopping, banking services and different payment options (including “Buy Now, Pay Later” products) via radio and social media channels.\n\nA new video and animations with cannibal plant and animal trap are produced with the theme “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!”\n\nCross-media publicity is produced reminding members of the public not to click on suspicious links\n\nAnimated video to promote e-laisees\n\nIn support of the environment, and drawing on technological advances in financial services, the HKMA encouraged members of the public to give out electronic lai sees (e-laisees) and to consider using good-as-new banknotes for physical lai sees over the Chinese New Year through social media and radio promotions.\n\nThe HKMA also seeks to enhance public understanding of the financial industry and raise young people’s interest in pursuing a career in the industry, thus enlarging Hong Kong’s talent pool for the financial industry. Following positive feedback for its earlier video series “Four Faces of Talents in Central”, the HKMA launched a new video series titled “Financial Special Forces: Unleashing New Horizons” that featured four growth areas in the financial industry: data science, fintech, green and sustainable finance, and wealth management. The video series utilised computer graphics and animation to show seasoned market practitioners supervising young talents as they managed daily work challenges, providing a light-touch introduction to career opportunities and prospects within the industry.\n\nA video series “Financial Special Forces: Unleashing New Horizons” is produced to keep the younger generation abreast of career opportunities in finance\n\nMentors from different areas sharing their expertise and experience with students\n\nTo enhance financial literacy among secondary school students, the HKMA worked with other stakeholders to co-organise the “Hong Kong Financial Literacy Championship” for the ninth consecutive year. Under the theme of digital and sustainable economy, the event helped students learn more about money management, green and sustainability, the current state of the financial market and career opportunities. It also included an online quiz that received around 20,000 submissions, mentoring by experienced practitioners from diverse areas, and design thinking challenge.\n\n# $mart Money Management 321\n\nThe HKMA launched its first financial education board game called “$mart Money Management 321”, which is jointly designed and developed with a social enterprise specialising in board game production. The board game was designed to help primary school students learn about different payment methods, money management concepts, fintech and cybersecurity in a simulated setting.\n\nThe HKMA took a booth at the Hong Kong Book Fair 2023 to promote the board game, which was one of the best-selling items at the Fair. In addition, the HKMA organised a series of free promotional activities, which included workshops in community centres, trials for students in primary schools, and train-the-trainer workshops for primary school teachers and social workers at non-governmental organisations, as well as running a “$mart Money Management Experiential Centre” at PMQ during the festive season.\n\nThe HKMA’s first financial education board game, “$mart Money Management 321”, and the “$mart Money Management Experiential Centre” receive several international design awards\n\nFollowing its launch at the Hong Kong Book Fair, the board game is promoted through train-the-trainer workshops, student trial sessions and an experiential centre at PMQ\n\nThe HKMA also collaborated with different stakeholders in a number of community engagement programmes. One of these was the second phase of a cross-generation outreach educational programme, organised jointly with an educational institution. It included a bank simulation game along with talks targeting kindergarten students, their parents and teachers, and young adults.\n\nThe HKMA continued to support the work of the Investor and Financial Education Council in promoting financial literacy and financial capacity in Hong Kong. It will explore further collaboration with different stakeholders to maximise the impact of its community engagement work.\n\n# Financial disclosure\n\nTo maintain a high level of transparency, the HKMA adopts international standards in financial disclosure insofar as they are applicable to central banking operations. These include the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and other applicable reporting requirements, such as the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard. The Finance Division works with external auditors and other accounting professionals to prepare and present the Exchange Fund’s financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards. The HKMA also provides detailed disclosures and thorough analyses of a wide range of expense items and budgetary information in its Annual Report.\n\n# Accountability and controls\n\n# Risk management\n\nOne of the HKMA’s most important tasks is to manage risks to the monetary and banking systems. Risk management is undertaken both at a working level in its day-to-day operations, and at a higher level through strategic planning. Two high-level committees, the Macro Surveillance Committee and the Risk Committee, operate under the HKMA’s risk management framework. Both are chaired by the Chief Executive of the HKMA.", "zh": "#公司职能\n\n公司功能支持HKMA的高水平透明度,问责,效率和专业性.为了促进公众对其政策和运作的理解,HKMA通过传统和社交媒体,信息中心和其他道积极沟通.\n\n香港商贸局在内部努力建立敏捷和专业的员工队伍,保持严格的财务纪律,并升级其数字能力,以适应变化,并确保其政策和倡议得到有效实施.\n\n#透明度\n\n#媒体关系和社交媒体的使用\n\n香港商会与媒体密切合作,提高公众对其政策和运作的理解.在2023年,香港商会举行或参加了188次公开新闻活动,包括11次新闻发布会,6次媒体简报,15次站立采访和156次其他公共活动.在一年中,它还安排了25次媒体采访,发布了583份双语新闻稿,并每天处理大量媒体询问.\n\n为了提高当地,大陆和外国媒体对HKMA的关键功能的认识,组织了新闻发布会和媒体简报.主题包括反欺诈举措,中央银行数字货币 (CBDC) 和稳定币.\n\n媒体代表积极参与HKMA在2023年举办的第二次全球金融领导人投资峰会.这次为期三天的活动在当地,大陆和国际媒体上产生了超过2000篇积极的,真实的新闻报道.\n\n首席执行官艾迪先生在2023年香港金融科技周的媒体站上发言\n\n总裁埃迪·先生在全球金融领袖投资峰会上对媒体发表讲话\n\n副总裁亚瑟· (右上一号) 在反欺诈消费者保护宪章活动上主持分享会\n\n副行政长官霍华德·李 (中) 在媒体发布会上就电子卫生健康试点计划第一阶段报告\n\n戴里尔·陈 (左上位) 副首席执行官在2023年国债市场峰会上主持小组讨论\n\n创意的社交媒体内容有助于提高公众对HKMA的认识,\n\n为了更有效地与公众接触,HKMA运营着六个社交媒体道,这些道共有超过15万个粉丝.包括全球金融领袖投资峰会在内的,HKMA还开发了创意社交媒体内容,以提高公众对一系列主题的认识.最近的内容包括消费者保护和欺诈,快速支付系统,金融科技,绿色和可持续金融以及HKMA的主要活动.\n\n# 公共调查\n\n香港管理局的公众调查服务为公众提供了一个有效的道,以更好地了解香港管理局的关键职能和运作.\n\n据英国联邦调查局统计,在2023年,公众调查服务处理了9565份调查.其中约一半与消费者银行问题,银行政策和法规,金融基础设施和债务市场发展以及纸币和硬币有关.一些调查的常见主题涉及银行产品和服务,硬币收集计划,零售债券发行计划,银行相关指南和通告以及更快的支付系统.\n\n图1显示了公众调查服务自2020年以来收到的公众调查数量,图2则提供了2023年收到的调查性质的细分.\n\n图1 公开调查总数\n\n图 2 收到的询问的性质\n\n#出版物\n\n在今年,香港管理协会发布了2022年年度报告,以及第一份独立的2022年可持续发展报告.2022年年度报告在\"非营利性和慈善组织\"类别中获得金奖,是该类别中最高的.同时,2022年可持续发展报告在香港公会计师协会的公共部门/非营利性 (大) 类别中获得了ESG奖.\n\n在2023年,香港金融管理局发布了两期的半年货币和金融稳定报告和四期的季报,并定期更新其月度统计公报,提供最新的和主题信息,并分析香港的货币,银行和经济问题.香港金融管理局还发表了14篇Sight1文章,其中介绍了主要的新政策和举措,并讨论了当前的问题.\n\n#公司网站\n\n公司网站 (www.hkma.gov.hk) 拥有近6万页的英语,传统和简体中文内容,是公众获取有关香港金融管理局最新信息的门户.它包含授权机构 (AI) 和当地代表处的登记册以及AI的证券工作人员登记册,这两者都根据\"银行条例\" (BO) 第20条维护,以及根据\"支付系统和存储价值设施条例\" (SVF) 管理的存储价值设施许可证人的登记册.\n\n自2018年以来,HKMA通过开放应用程序编程界面 (Open API) 逐步发布财务数据和重要信息.到2023年底,HKMA已在其网站上开放了175套开放API,符合其目标日程表.\n\n香港证券交易所的开放API门户:\n\n# 信息中心\n\n香港金融管理局信息中心位于二国际金融中心55层,由一个展览区和一个图书馆组成,旨在向社区介绍香港金融管理局的工作,并提高公众对货币和银行事务的认识.互动展览区介绍了香港金融管理局的工作概述,以及香港货币和银行业的发展,以及对香港货币,银行和金融事务的研究有用的信息和展品.\n\n在一年中,信息中心接待了超过31,000名访客,并为学校和其他团体提供了480多次导游.\n\n图书馆位于展览区旁边,收藏了超过26,000本关于香港货币,银行和金融事务以及中央银行主题的书籍.图书馆还维护了AI和当地代表处的注册册册,以及AI的证券工作人员注册,以便按照BO的第20条要求进行公开访问.\n\n年轻游客在信息中心的导游游中了解香港的纸币设计\n\n游览幼儿园的信息中心\n\n# 社区参与和公共教育\n\n自1998年以来,香港金融管理局一直在开展公众教育计划,以提高公众对其工作的认识.到目前为止,已有超过66,000人参与了公众教育计划.在2023年,为来自58所中学的1,200多名学生和教师组织了网络研讨会.网络研讨会的主题包括了香港金融管理局的工作概述,链接汇率系统,香港纸币,个人数字密钥的保护,存款保护计划,绿色金融和银行业的职业机会.\n\n香港金融管理局 (HKMA) 致力于教育和吸引公众,提醒他们保持警.在\"反欺诈消费者宪章\"发布后,HKMA承诺不通过即时电子信息发送个人和信用卡信息.HKMA还通过广播和社交媒体传递了有关信用卡,个人贷款,银行服务和不同支付方式的信息.\n\n制作了新视频和动画, 展示食人植物和动物陷, 主题是\"保护您的个人数字密钥; 警欺诈链接!\"\n\n通过多媒体宣传提醒公众不要点击可疑链接\n\n动画视频推广电子饮食\n\n为了支持环境,并借鉴金融服务的技术进步,HKMA鼓励公众发放电子纸币,并考虑在中国新年期间通过社交媒体和广播宣传使用新版纸币.\n\n香港金融管理局还试图提高公众对金融行业的了解,并提高年轻人的对金融行业的兴趣,从而扩大香港人才库.在之前的视频系列\"中部人才的四面\"的积极反之后,香港金融管理局推出了一系列新的视频,题为\"金融特种部队:释放新的视野\",该系列视频包括金融行业的四个增长领域:数据科学,金融科技,绿色和可持续金融以及财富管理.该系列视频利用计算机图形和动画来展示经验丰富的市场从业者监督年轻人才,因为他们管理了日常工作挑战,提供了对行业的职业机会和前景的轻松介绍.\n\n为了让年轻一代了解金融领域的职业机会,制作了一系列视频\"金融特种部队:释放新视野\".\n\n提供不同领域的指导,与学生分享专业知识和经验.\n\n为了提高中学生的财务素养,香港金融管理局与其他利益相关者合作,连续第九年举办\"香港金融知识竞赛\".此次活动以数字化和可持续性为主题,帮助学生了解更多关于金融市场的现状和职业机会.\n\n#$智能资金管理321\n\n香港金融管理局推出了第一款金融教育板游戏\"$智能钱管理321\",该游戏与专门从事板游戏生产的社会企业共同设计和开发.该板游戏旨在帮助小学生在模拟环境中了解不同的支付方法,金钱管理概念,金融科技和网络安全.\n\n香港书展2023年在香港书展上展位宣传这款棋盘游戏,这是该展会最销的商品之一.此外,香港书展组织了一系列免费宣传活动,包括社区中心的研讨会,小学学生的试验,以及为非政府组织的小学教师和社会工作者培训培训员研讨会,以及在节日期间在PMQ运营\"智能资金管理体验中心\".\n\n香港金融管理局首款金融教育棋牌游戏\"智能货币管理321\"和\"智能货币管理体验中心\"获得多项国际设计奖\n\n经过在香港书展上发布,该棋盘游戏通过培训员工作坊,学生试用课程和PMQ体验中心进行了推广.\n\n香港管理局还与不同利益相关者合作开展了多项社区参与计划.其中之一是与教育机构联合组织的跨世代外展教育计划.该计划包括银行模拟游戏以及针对幼儿园学生,他们的家长和教师以及年轻人的讲座.\n\n香港管理局继续支持投资者和金融教育委员会在香港促进金融素养和金融能力的工作.它将探索与不同利益相关者的进一步合作,以最大限度地发挥其社区参与的工作.\n\n# 财务披露\n\n为了保持高水平的透明度,香港金融管理局采用了适用于中央银行业务的国际报告标准.金融管理局与外部审计人员合作,根据香港金融报告标准编制并提交各种费用和预算信息.\n\n# 问责和控制\n\n# 风险管理\n\n香港金融管理局最重要的任务之一是管理货币和银行系统的风险.风险管理是在日常运营中的工作层面,并在更高层面的战略规划中进行的.两个高级委员会,宏观监督委员会和风险委员会,在香港金融管理局的风险管理框架下运作.两者由香港金融管理局的首席执行官主持."}

My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report. I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises all the information included in the 2023 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. I also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and\n- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nProf. LAM Chi Yuen Nelson\nDirector of Audit\n\n# 1 PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES\n\nThe Monetary Authority, under delegated authority from the Financial Secretary as Controller of the Exchange Fund (the Fund), manages the Fund in accordance with the provisions of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66). The principal activities of the Fund are safeguarding the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong and maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems.\n\nThe assets of the Fund are managed as four portfolios: the Backing Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio and the Strategic Portfolio. The assets of the Backing Portfolio fully match the Monetary Base, under Hong Kong’s Currency Board system. The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The Long-Term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments. The Strategic Portfolio holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited acquired by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government for the account of the Fund for strategic purposes. Operating segment information is set out in note 31.\n\n# 2 MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n# 2.1 Statement of compliance\n\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRSs), which is a collective term that includes all applicable individual HKFRSs, Hong Kong Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), and accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong. Material accounting policies adopted by the Fund and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) is set out below.\n\nThe HKICPA has issued certain new or revised HKFRSs that are first effective or available for early adoption for the current accounting period of the Group. Note 3 provides information on the changes, if any, in accounting policies resulting from initial application of these developments to the extent that they are relevant to the Group for the current and prior accounting periods reflected in these financial statements.\n\n# 2.2 Basis of preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe Group financial statements include the financial statements of the Group as well as the Group’s interests in associates and joint ventures. The principal activities of the principal subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are shown in notes 16 and 17.\n\nThe measurement basis used in the preparation of the financial statements is historical cost except for the following assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value:\n- derivative financial instruments (note 2.6);\n- financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value through income and expenditure account (note 2.6);\n- financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (note 2.6);\n- gold (note 2.10); and\n- investment properties (note 2.11).\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with HKFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nJudgements made by management in the application of HKFRSs that have significant effect on the financial statements and major sources of estimation uncertainty are disclosed in note 2.18.\n\nCertain comparative figures have been restated to conform to the current year presentation of the Group financial statements.\n\n# 2.3 Subsidiaries and non-controlling interests\n\nA subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. When assessing whether the Group has power, only substantive rights (held by the Group and other parties) are considered.", "zh": "# 交换基金\n\n# 审计总监的报告\n\n# 独立审计报告给财政秘书\n\n# 意见\n\n我证实我已经审计了汇丰基金及其子公司 (集团) 的211-311,其中包括汇丰基金和集团的2023年12月31日资产负债表,综合收益表,股权变化表和现金流表,以及财务报表附录,包括重要的会计政策信息.\n\n根据我认为,财务报表真实地反映了基金和集团在2023年12月31日的财务状况,以及根据香港注册会计师协会 (HKICPA) 发布的\"香港财务报表标准\" (HKFRSs) 完成的财务业绩和现金流,并按照交易所条例第7条 (第66章) 颁布的行政总裁的指令进行准确编制.\n\n# 意见的基础\n\n我根据交易所条例第7条和审计委员会的审计标准进行了审计.我根据这些标准对集团的审计责任是独立的,并且根据这些标准履行了我的其他道德责任.我认为我获得的审计证据足够和适当,以提供我的意见.\n\n# 关键的审计问题\n\n关键审计问题是我在审计2023年12月31日结束的财务报表时最重要的问题.这些问题是在我审计整个财务报表时所处理的,我对这些问题没有提供单独的意见.\n\n#其他信息\n\n其他信息包括香港金融管理局2023年年度报告中的所有信息,除了财务报表和我本人对此的报告.\n\n我对财务报表的看法并不涵盖其他信息,我没有表达任何形式的保证性结论.\n\n关于我对财务报表的审计,我的责任是阅读其他信息,并考虑其他信息是否与财务报表或我在审计中获得的知识相矛盾,或者是否存在其他信息的重大错误.如果我根据我完成的工作得出结论,我必须报告这一事实.我没有关于此方面的报告.\n\n#货币机构和汇率基金咨询委员会的审计小组委员会对财务报表的责任\n\n货币局负责根据HKICPA发布的财务报表和根据交换基金条例第7条的行政指令编制财务报表,以确保没有因欺诈或错误而导致的重大错误.\n\n在编制财务报表时,货币局负责评估集团继续经营的能力,并酌情披露与经营有关的事项,并使用经营基础进行会计.\n\n汇率基金咨询委员会的审计小组负责监督集团的财务报告流程.\n\n# 审计员对财务报表的审计的责任\n\n我的目标是获得合理的保证,以确保整个财务报表没有重大误差,无论是由于欺诈还是错误,并发布包含我的审计报告.合理的保证是高水平的保证,但并不能保证按照审计委员会的审计标准进行的审计总是会发现存在重大误差.误差可能是由于欺诈或错误,如果单独或总体而言,它们可以合理地影响用户根据这些财务报表做出的经济决策.\n\n作为符合审计委员会的审计标准的一部分,我在整个审计过程中都保持专业判断和专业怀疑.\n\n- 识别和评估财务报表存在重大误报的风险,无论是由于欺诈还是错误,设计和执行符合这些风险的审计程序,并获得足够和适当的审计证据,以提供我意见的基础.由于欺诈导致的重大误报未被发现的风险,高于由于错误导致的重大误报的风险,因为欺诈可能涉及勾结,伪造,故意遗漏,误报或违反内部控制; - 了解与审计有关的内部控制,以便设计在特定情况下适当的审计程序,但不用于对集团内部控制的有效性发表意见; - 评估所采用的会计政策的适当性和会计估计和相关披露的合理性; - 根据财务报表的财务报表,我继续以审计机构的总体情况,包括财务报表的内容或财务报表的内容,以获得足够证据或证据,以合理的方式进行审计,以期我能够表达对财务报表的意见,包括对财务报表的内容或财务报表的内容,以及对审计机构的财务报表的财务报表的内容或相关事件的不确定性; - 如果我对审计机构的财务报表现或财务报表达的内容或财务报表达的情况有充分的担忧,我可能继续以审计或以审计师的财务报表达的财务报表达方式进行审计,包括财务报表现,或财务报表达财务报表现的情况,以审计,或以审计师的财务报表现为基础上所获得的财务报表达的财务报表现,或财务报表达的情况; - 如果我有任何不确定性或有任何其他相关情况,我有责任于审计,我可能继续以审计师会对审计,包括财务报表达财务报表达财务报表现的财务报表现或财务报表现,包括财务报表现,包括财务报表现,或财务报表现,或财务报表现,包括财务报表现现现,或\n\n我与汇丰基金咨询委员会的审计小组会谈,讨论审计的计划范围和时间,以及我在审计过程中发现的重大缺陷.\n\n我还向汇丰基金咨询委员会的审计小组委员会提供一份关于我遵守独立性的道德要求的声明,并向他们通报所有可能会影响我独立性的关系和其他事项,以及适用时的相关保障措施.\n\n从与交易所咨询委员会的审计小组决定了当前期的审计问题,并将其描述在审计报告中,除非法律或法规禁止公开该问题,或者在极少数情况下,我决定不将某一问题公开,因为这样做会产生不利的后果.\n\n兰  尼尔森 审计总监\n\n# 1 主要活动\n\n根据金融秘书作为交易所监管人的授权,该基金按照交易所条例 (第66章) 的规定管理.该基金的主要活动是保护香港货币的汇率,维护香港货币和金融体系的稳定性和完整性.\n\n基金的资产分为四个投资组合:支持组合,投资组合,长期增长组合和战略组合.支持组合的资产完全符合香港货币委员会制度下的货币基础.投资组合主要投资于经济合作与发展组织 (OECD) 成员国家的债券和股票市场.长期增长组合持有私募股权和房地产投资.战略组合持有香港交易所和清算有限公司的股份,该股份由香港特别行政区政府为基金的战略目的收购.操作细分信息如下:\n\n# 2 材料会计政策\n\n# 2.1 符合规定的声明\n\n这些财务报表是按照香港财务报告准则 (HKFRS) 编制的,HKFRS是包括所有适用的个人财务报告准则,HKICPA是香港公认会计师协会颁发的会计准则,以及在香港普遍接受的会计准则.基金及其子公司 (以下简称\"集团\") 采用的重要会计准则如下.\n\n香港证券交易所发布了一些新的或修订的HKFRS,这些HKFRS首先适用于本集团的当前会计年度,并提供了对会计年度的相关信息.\n\n# 2.2 财务报表的编制基础\n\n集团的财务报表包括集团的财务报表以及集团在关联企业和合资企业中的利益.主要的子公司,关联企业和合资企业的主要活动是在16和17的注释中显示的.\n\n在编制财务报表时使用的估值基准是历史成本,除了以下以公允价值计价的资产和负债: - 衍生金融工具 (注 2.6); - 通过其他综合收益计价的金融资产和负债 (注 2.6); - 黄金 (注 2.10); - 投资物业 (注 2.11).\n\n根据HKFRS编制财务报表,管理层需要作出影响政策和资产,负债,收入和支出的判断.这些估计和相关的假设是基于在特定情况下被认为是合理的,其结果是对其他来源无法立即显示的资产和负债的判断.\n\n估计和基础假设在持续的基础上进行审查.对会计估计的修订在修订估计时的期间被确认,如果修订影响当前和未来的期间.\n\n管理层在应用HKFRS时做出的判断对财务报表有重大影响,以及估计不确定性的主要来源,在注 2.18 中披露.\n\n为了符合本年度财务报表的要求,部分比较数据已被重新表述.\n\n# 2.3 附属公司和无控制权的股权\n\n附属公司是集团控制的实体.当它接触到或拥有与该实体相关的可变收益时,它有能力通过对该实体的权力来影响这些收益.在评估集团是否具有权力时,只考虑实质性权力 (由集团和其他方持有)."}

{"zh": "# 保持警惕，應對風浪\n\n2024年，金管局在錯綜複雜的外部環境中迎難而上。年內，區域性軍事衝突不斷、多國舉行重要的選舉，全球經濟走向欠明朗，令世界局勢持續震盪。然而，各地的決策者在控制通脹飈升和支持經濟發展之間尋求適當平衡，推動主要經濟體實現穩健增長。此外，隨着美國啟動四年來首次減息，加上內地連串支持經濟的政策出台，令市場情緒轉趨樂觀。整體而言，全球宏觀環境仍充滿變數。\n\n面對複雜形勢，我們的應對策略是繼續充分發揮香港離岸人民幣業務、金融科技與綠色和可持續金融的樞紐作用和獨特優勢，持續鞏固香港國際金融中心的領先地位。2024年，金管局在這些重點領域取得顯著進展。年度盛事「國際金融領袖投資峰會」等多項活動和計劃反應熱烈，充分展現出國際社會對香港國際金融中心發展前景的堅定信心。\n\n面對香港經濟的周期性調整和結構性轉型，我們與銀行界緊密合作，加強對中小型企業（中小企）的支援，紓緩企業在高息環境下的還款負擔，同時助力它們持續發展。加上中央和香港特區政府推出的多項政策措施，香港經濟得以穩步復甦。2024年，本港經濟錄得2.5%的溫和增長。\n\n踏入2025年，全球經濟在更趨複雜的地緣政治形勢下繼續面臨諸多不確定性。貿易保護主義升温和關稅壁壘增加，將導致全球供應鏈受阻，地緣經濟割裂加劇，為全球經濟前景增添更多變數。倘若地緣政治緊張局勢進一步升溫，將可能對實體經濟和環球金融市場造成雙重衝擊。\n\n面對複雜嚴峻的經濟和金融環境，金管局將保持警惕，切實履行我們的職責，竭力維護香港貨幣與銀行體系穩定，並持續鞏固香港國際金融中心地位。我們將深化與市場各界的聯繫，積極推動新興領域的發展，確保香港在全球金融格局中保持領先優勢。\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度：穩健基石\n\n聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）實施40多年來，一直是香港貨幣與金融穩定的基石，成功抵禦了多個經濟和利率周期的挑戰，展現出強大的抗震力。\n\n儘管2024年美國利率政策充滿不確定性，但港元貨幣市場繼續按照聯匯制度的機制暢順運行。年內港元滙率在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的兌換範圍內上落，在年初首四個月因流動性回軟而稍為走弱，其後逐步轉強，至年底時接近強方兌換保證水平。穩定的匯率充分反映了市場對聯匯制度的信心。同時聯匯制度亦持續獲得國際貨幣基金組織及國際金融界的高度認可。\n\n市場對聯匯制度的信心，建基於我們持續主動向公眾闡釋聯匯制度的運作機制和優點，以及嚴密的市場監察工作。通過收集詳細數據，結合先進的數據分析和人工智能技術，我們對市場進行更及時、更全面的監察和金融穩定性評估。\n\n# 銀行體系：多重挑戰下保持穩健\n\n2024年，香港銀行體系在多重宏觀挑戰下展現出強大的韌性，資本和流動性保持充裕。2024年底，本地銀行綜合總資本比率達21.8%，高於8%的國際最低要求。流動性方面亦同樣充裕，第4季度大型銀行流動性覆蓋比率達178.4%，高於100%的法定最低門檻。受利率持續高企、部分內地房企債務問題尚未完全緩解，以及本地商業房地產市場疲弱等因素影響，特定分類貸款比率於年底上升至1.96%。由於銀行恪守審慎的信用風險管理並維持充足撥備，相關風險總體可控。\n\n在持續密切監察銀行信貸風險包括物業按揭貸款相關風險的同時，金管局針對物業市場狀況及銀行體系相關風險的變化，於2024年對物業按揭貸款的逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施實施了兩輪調整。具體而言，所有住宅物業的最高按揭成數及供款與入息比率上限均回復至2009年實施逆周期宏觀審慎措施前的水平。\n\n在持續強化銀行信貸風險管理的同時，我們亦致力提升銀行的運作與科技穩健性，應對日益依賴第三方服務提供者所帶來的新挑戰。以去年7月的CrowdStrike全球事故為例，該事故凸顯了在當今全球高度連繫的環境下，運作故障可能造成連鎖的嚴重後果。雖然事故對香港銀行業影響有限，但反映出我們必須確保銀行建立穩健架構，即使發生嚴重的情況仍能維持關鍵業務運作。令人鼓舞的是，目前香港所有銀行均建立了運作穩健性架構，並已經進入配對工作及情景測試的重要階段，通過識別和修補脆弱環節，確保關鍵業務的運作。\n\n與此同時，為應對多變的網絡威脅，金管局去年着力加強銀行體系的網絡防衛能力，包括發布新指引、開展專題審查。我們並與本地其他金融監管機構合作推進跨行業「網絡地圖」項目，評估和應對金融機構、金融市場基礎設施及科技服務供應商相互連繫可能引發的系統性網絡風險。在2024年完成試行後，該項目將於今年全面展開。\n\n科技發展帶來的另一個重大挑戰是金融詐騙威脅不斷升級且手法日趨複雜，需要銀行、監管機構、執法機構和公眾聯手應對。我們已經要求銀行進一步加強網上銀行保安措施和監察系統。反訛騙及洗黑錢情報工作組（情報工作組）去年亦將覆蓋範圍擴大至所有主要零售銀行及六家儲值支付工具持牌機構，顯著提升了情報交換的效率和規模，沒收的犯罪得益亦隨之增加。同時，促進銀行間訊息分享的法例修訂諮詢獲得廣泛支持，該法例將有助進一步提升銀行偵測及防止金融罪案的能力。\n\n除上述措施外，提升公眾對可疑交易的警覺性及自我保護意識亦同樣重要。2024年，我們擴大了「可疑帳號警示」機制的覆蓋範圍，並推出《保障消費者防詐騙約章2.0》，引入更多參與機構，以擴大約章的保護網，進一步保障公眾。同時，我們亦推出「智安存服務，讓銀行存戶可選擇將部分存款分隔，提供額外保障。\n\n除上述各項協助客戶防範詐騙的措施外，我們亦針對個別客戶可能因衝動而過度借貸，在去年要求零售銀行為無抵押消費信貸產品提供至少七天的冷靜期，讓客戶在訂立貸款協議後能再三仔細考量和評估其財務責任和償還能力。同時，「信資通」個人資料基建項目亦於去年成功推出，在提升個人信貸資料服務方面取得重要進展。\n\n除監管工作外，2024年我們的另一工作重點是確保信貸供應以支持實體經濟，這對作為香港經濟重要支柱的中小企尤為重要。去年，我們與銀行業聯合推出「9+5」支持措施，協助中小企獲取銀行融資應對周轉需要，並助力其升級轉型。銀行已經作出承諾：不會要求按時供款的按揭客戶提前還款，亦不會純粹基於抵押品價值下跌而下調信貸額度。截至目前，已經有超過39,000家中小企獲得信貸支援及新批貸款，涉及信貸額度合共950億港元。銀行亦在貸款組合中預留約3,900億港元專項資金，支持中小企在市場環境變化中持續發展。此外，金管局與香港銀行公會聯合成立「中小企融資專責小組」，從具體個案及行業整體層面為中小企提供支援。鑑於當前貿易爭端及外圍經濟前景不明朗，我們於2025年4月再新增三項針對特定行業的支持措施，進一步加強對多個行業中小企的支持。與此同時，我們還推出了兩項措施以支持香港整體經濟發展。\n\n在維護銀行體系穩定和提升其運作效率方面，我們持續推動銀行業的科技應用，並着力加快銀行業採用金融科技的步伐。目前，香港所有零售銀行均已經將金融科技應用於日常營運。此外，鑑於生成式人工智能(GenAI)在強化銀行業風險管理、防範詐騙和提升客戶體驗方面的潛力，金管局與數碼港去年合作推出「GenAI沙盒」，鼓勵銀行在負責任的前提下應用GenAI。我們同時向銀行發布指引，明確規定銀行若在面向客戶的服務中應用GenAI ，必須確保客戶獲得充分保障。此外，金管局內部亦積極運用GenAI技術，提升分析和監管效率。除GenAI外，我們還通過推出全新FiNETech系列活動、建立配對平台「FintechConnect」，以及舉辦一系列跨行業交流活動，促進金融服務與科技界的連繫，推動金融科技生態圈的合作與創新發展。\n\n# 鞏固香港國際金融中心的地位\n\n儘管2024年充滿挑戰和不確定性，香港仍穩守國際金融中心的領先地位，更在多個領域和國際影響力方面持續拓展提升。\n\n香港作為連接中國內地與國際市場的重要橋樑，扮演着無可比擬的獨特角色。通過推出各項有利措施和加強與各方協作，香港不斷鞏固提升其作為區內金融科技與可持續金融樞紐的地位。有關我們在綠色和可持續金融方面的具體工作，可參閱《二零二四年可持續發展報告》。\n\n# 人民幣業務增長迅速，深化與內地金融合作\n\n2024年，香港人民幣業務持續保持良好勢頭，在貿易結算支付、離岸債券發行，尤其是離岸銀行貸款方面均錄得顯著增長。人民幣即時支付結算系統創下日均交易額的歷史新高，達3.1萬億元人民幣，反映香港全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的作用更為突出。\n\n與此同時，我們持續深化香港與內地的金融互聯互通。2024年推出的「三聯通、三便利」政策，加上今年初公布的六項新措施，均取得重大政策突破。其中，金管局推出1,000億元人民幣貿易融資流動資金安排，為銀行提供穩定且具成本效益的資金來源，以擴展人民幣貿易融資服務，從而支持實體經濟發展。另一項政策突破是允許投資者使用債券通「北向通」持有的在岸債券，特別是國家財政部和政策性銀行發行的在岸債券，作為金管局人民幣流動資金安排、香港場外結算公司及離岸人民幣債券回購業務的合資格抵押品。這一創新舉措提升了在岸債券對離岸投資者的吸引力，有助於促進全球投資者更大程度地參與在岸債券市場。我們去年亦推出「跨境理財通2.0」，實現了多方面的升級優化，包括提供更多元化的投資產品、更靈活的銷售與推廣安排，並擴大個人投資額度。這些措施不僅鞏固了香港作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位，也進一步強化了我們作為連接內地與國際市場的重要門戶角色。", "en": "# Be alert and face the waves\n\nThe year 2024 was challenging for the Kim administration in a complex external environment. Regional military conflicts, major elections, and a global economic downturn continued to shake the world. However, policymakers everywhere sought the right balance between controlling inflation and supporting economic development to drive steady growth in major economies.\n\nWe are pleased to note that the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has made significant progress in these key areas in 2024, and that the annual \"International Finance Leaders Investment Summit\" and other events and programs have been well received, fully demonstrating the international community's strong confidence in the future development of the Hong Kong International Finance Centre.\n\nIn the face of the cyclical adjustment and structural transformation of the Hong Kong economy, we have worked closely with the banking community to increase support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), ease the repayment burden of enterprises in a high interest rate environment, and help them develop sustainably. Added to the many policy measures introduced by the central and Hong Kong SAR governments, Hong Kong's economy has recovered steadily. In 2024, the economy of Hong Kong recorded a moderate growth of 2.5%\n\nAs we move into 2025, the global economy continues to face uncertainties amid a more complex geopolitical environment. The rise of trade protectionism and the rise of tariff barriers will lead to a tightening of the global supply chain and a deepening of geopolitical fractures, adding more variables to the global economic outlook. If geopolitical tensions continue to escalate, there could be a double blow to the real economy and global financial markets.\n\nIn the face of the complex and challenging economic and financial environment, the KING Administration will remain vigilant and will effectively carry out our duties, strive to maintain the stability of Hong Kong's monetary and banking system, and continue to consolidate Hong Kong's status as an international financial center. We will deepen our ties with all sectors of the market, actively promote the development of emerging areas, and ensure that Hong Kong remains a leading player in the global financial landscape.\n\n#ContactRate: A solid foundation for the future\n\nThe pegged rate system (the \"pegged system\") has been in place for over 40 years and has been the cornerstone of Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability, successfully withstanding the challenges of multiple economic and interest rate cycles, and exhibiting strong seismic resistance.\n\nDespite the uncertainties of US interest rate policy in 2024, the HKD currency market continued to operate smoothly in accordance with the mechanism of the peg system. The HKD exchange rate rose within the range of 7.75 to 7.85 HKD to 1 USD during the year, weakened slightly in the first four months of the year due to a weakening of liquidity, then gradually strengthened, and approached the level of the strong exchange rate guarantee at the end of the year. The stable exchange rate fully reflects the market's confidence in the peg system. The peg system also continues to receive high recognition from the International Monetary Fund and the international financial community.\n\nThe confidence of the market in the system of mutual funds is based on our continuous initiative to explain the mechanisms and advantages of the system of mutual funds to the public, as well as strict market surveillance work. By collecting detailed data, combining advanced data analysis and artificial intelligence technology, we conduct more timely and comprehensive monitoring of the market and financial stability assessment.\n\nBanking system: Resilient in the face of multiple challenges\n\nIn 2024, Hong Kong's banking system exhibited strong resilience, capital and liquidity to maintain abundance. At the end of 2024, local banks combined total capital ratio reached 21.8%, above the international minimum requirement of 8% . Liquidity is also abundant, large banks liquidity coverage ratio in the fourth quarter reached 178.4%, above the statutory minimum threshold of 100% . Some of the domestic real estate debt problems of enterprises are not yet fully alleviated by the continuing high interest rates, and weakness in the local commercial real estate market, the specific category loan ratio rose to 1.96% at the end of the year.\n\nIn the wake of the ongoing close monitoring of bank credit risk, including the risk associated with real estate mortgage loans, the KIMDA has implemented two rounds of adjustments to the reverse cycle macro-prudential oversight measures for real estate mortgage loans in 2024, in response to changes in the state of the real estate market and the risk associated with the banking system. Specifically, the highest mortgage percentage and the upper limit of the supply and interest rate of all residential properties have been restored to the level before the implementation of the reverse cycle macro-prudential measures in 2009.\n\nWhile continuing to strengthen the management of bank credit risk, we are also committed to enhancing the operational and technological stability of banks to meet the new challenges posed by the increasing reliance on third-party service providers.The global incident of CrowdStrike last July, for example, highlights the serious consequences of malfunctioning in today's highly connected global environment.Although the impact of the incident on the banking industry in Hong Kong is limited, it reflects the need to ensure that banks have a robust infrastructure that can maintain critical operations even in severe circumstances.It is encouraging that all banks in Hong Kong have now established a robust infrastructure and have entered the critical stage of matching work and scenario testing, identifying and correcting vulnerabilities, and ensuring critical operations.\n\nAt the same time, in response to the growing number of cyber threats, the KIM has been working to strengthen the banking system's cyber defence capabilities over the past year, including issuing new guidelines and conducting dedicated reviews. We are also working with other local financial regulators to promote the cross-sector \"Network Map\" project, which assesses and responds to systemic network risks that may arise from the interconnection of financial institutions, financial market infrastructure and technology service providers.\n\nAnother major challenge posed by the development of technology is the growing threat of financial fraud and the increasing complexity of the methods used to deal with it. We have asked banks to further strengthen their online banking security measures and surveillance systems. The Anti-fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Task Force (Intelligence Task Force) last year also expanded its coverage to all major retail banks and six major payment instrument licensees, significantly increasing the efficiency and scale of information exchange, and increasing the profits of crime.\n\nIn addition to the above measures, it is also important to raise public awareness and self-protection against suspicious transactions. In 2024, we expanded the coverage of the \"Suspicious Account Alert\" mechanism and introduced the Consumer Protection Fraud Prevention Protocol 2.0 and introduced more participating institutions to expand the protection network of the Protocol and further protect the public.\n\nIn addition to the above measures to help customers prevent fraud, we also targeted individual customers who may over-borrow on impulse, and last year we required retail banks to provide at least seven days of cooling off for unsecured consumer credit products so that customers could carefully review and evaluate their financial responsibility and ability to repay after concluding loan agreements.\n\nIn addition to regulatory work, another focus of our work in 2024 is to ensure that credit supply is available to support the physical economy, which is particularly important for SMEs as an important pillar of Hong Kong's economy. Last year, we partnered with the banking industry to launch the \"9+5\" support measure to help SMEs access bank loans to meet their turnover needs and assist their upgrading transition. The bank has made a commitment not to require advance payments from mortgage customers who deliver on time, nor to reduce the amount of credit based solely on the fall in mortgage values. To date, more than 39,000 SMEs have received credit support and new loans, involving a total of HK$95 billion. We also reserve HK$39 billion in bank credit unions to support specialised funds for SMEs in Hong Kong, which are a key pillar of the economy.\n\nIn order to maintain the stability and efficiency of the banking system, we continue to promote the application of technology in the banking sector and accelerate the adoption of financial technology. At present, all retail banks in Hong Kong have implemented financial technology in their daily operations. In addition, given the potential of generative AI to enhance risk management, fraud prevention and enhance customer experience, the FSA and Digital Port last year launched the \"GenAI Sandbox\", encouraging banks to use GenAI responsibly. We also issued guidelines to banks, specifying that if banks apply GenAI in customer services, they must ensure that customers are fully protected. In addition, the FSA is actively using GenAI technology to improve and regulate the efficiency.\n\n#Staying in the international financial center of Hong Kong\n\nDespite the challenges and uncertainties of 2024, Hong Kong is firmly maintaining its leading position as an international financial center and is continuing to expand its reach in multiple areas and international influence.\n\nHong Kong plays an unparalleled role as a key bridge between the Chinese mainland and the international market. Hong Kong has steadily strengthened its position as a regional fintech and sustainable finance hub by introducing various favorable measures and enhancing cooperation with all parties. For more information on our specific work in green and sustainable finance, see our 2012 Fourth Sustainable Development Report.\n\n#RMB business grows rapidly, deepening cooperation with local financial institutions\n\nIn 2024, the RMB business in Hong Kong continued to perform well, with significant growth in trade settlement payments, offshore bond issuance, and especially offshore bank loans. RMB instant payment settlement system set a record high of RMB 3.1 trillion in average daily transactions, reflecting the role of Hong Kong as the global hub for RMB offshore business.\n\nAt the same time, we continue to deepen financial interconnectivity between Hong Kong and the mainland. The Three-way, Three-Facility policy launched in 2024, together with six new measures announced earlier this year, are major policy breakthroughs. Among them, the HKSAR launched a RMB 100 billion trade finance capital flow scheme to provide banks with a stable and cost-effective source of funds to expand the RMB trade finance services, thereby supporting real economic development. Another policy breakthrough is to allow investors to use the bonds held offshore in the HKSAR North Stream, especially the offshore bonds issued by the Ministry of National Finance and Policy Bank, as a collateral for the HKSAR RMB capital flow scheme, our Hong Kong offshore accounting company and off-shore RMB bond repurchase business."}

The labor market remained stable, and inflation continued to decline under external price pressures. The Hong Kong stock market recovered significantly, while the real estate market was weakened by the continuing bull market. Due to the continuing escalation of trade tensions, Hong Kong's economy is expected to face a challenging external environment in 2025. However, China's domestic economic stimulus, coupled with the multifaceted support provided to local businesses, can strengthen business confidence. Hong Kong will continue to strengthen international exchanges and deepen regional cooperation.\n\nThe Hong Kong banking system is stable, capital and liquidity are abundant, and overall asset quality is controllable.\n\n# Currency is stable\n\nDespite the uncertainties surrounding the direction of U.S. monetary policy, global growth prospects, and geopolitics, the HKD's foreign exchange and money markets continued to remain in a good place. The HKD's exchange rate weakened in the first four months of 2024, but strengthened for the rest of the year. As a cornerstone of monetary and financial stability, the pegged exchange rate system has shown a strong ability to withstand external shocks.\n\n# Banking system is stable\n\nThe Banking Authority has taken swift action to support local small businesses and ensure the stability of the banking system through risk-based regulatory and response planning, and provides regulatory guidance and support to the industry to address emerging risks to enhance operational stability and network defense resilience in the banking industry. To encourage the use of financial technology, the Banking Authority has launched a series of cross-industry projects, including the \"generative artificial intelligence sandbox\".\n\nThe Bank of China introduced the Consumer Fraud Prevention Code 2.0 and the Smart Deposit and Transient Period for unsecured consumer credit products to strengthen the bank's consumer protection. In addition, the Bank of China provided guidance to banks on the application of generated artificial intelligence in customer-facing services and provided a variety of payment arrangements to closely cooperate with the industry on second-hand property transactions. The Bank of China also issued a digital asset activity guide to improve the \"cross-border financial transaction\" business pilot and ease the restrictions on multi-entity digital banks, and completed the full transition of personal credit information services to \"credit transactions\".\n\nThe Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) plays a key role in Hong Kong's anti-money laundering and terrorist financing regime. Through enhanced information exchange and cooperation with public-private partnership platforms, the number of suspicious transaction reports has increased significantly, which has led to more effective confiscation of criminal profits. The consultation on the revision of the law on promoting information sharing among banks has received widespread support and will further assist in the detection and prevention of financial crimes.\n\nThe HKMA has made good progress in implementing international regulatory standards, including capital adequacy and disclosure. In addition, several areas of the Hong Kong Deposit Guarantee Scheme have been improved to enhance the protection of depositors.\n\nThe Banking Authority continues to promote the credibility of the clearing house, implementing clearing standards, and requiring banks to renew financial contracts with counterparties to reduce the risk of disorderly early termination of the transaction. In addition, the Banking Authority has made significant progress in developing preferential clearing strategies for banks, addressing barriers to viability, and improving the ability to execute clearing.\n\nHong Kong's status as an international financial center is a matter of debate.\n\nThe Bank has launched a series of measures to jointly deepen and expand the interconnectivity of Hong Kong and the mainland financial markets, including the enhancement of \"cross-border financial flows\"; the expansion of the scope of eligible collateral for the RMB cash flow arrangement and \"northward interchangeability\" transactions; and the enhancement of \"northward interchangeability\". These measures help strengthen Hong Kong's role as a gateway and consolidate its position as a global hub for offshore RMB operations.\n\n\"The Bank has made good progress in strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong's financial platforms, including bond issuance, asset and wealth management, green and sustainable finance, and corporate finance hubs\". said Mr. Li, adding that \"in order to promote Hong Kong's financial services, the Bank has intensified its marketing efforts to overseas and domestic stakeholders, so that they can fully understand the stability of Hong Kong's financial system and the opportunities it offers\".\n\nThe KBA has made significant progress in all areas of its Fintech 2025 strategy, including central bank digital currency and data infrastructure. On the other hand, the KBA is working closely with the People's Bank of China to implement the interconnection of Hong Kong's \"Credit Transfer Express\" with the mainland's online cross-border clearing system to enable cross-border payments.\n\n# Reserves management\n\nGlobal financial markets performed well in 2024, with major economies recording steady growth and major central banks continuing to lower policy rates as inflation slowed. Against this backdrop, the OTC fund recorded an investment income of HK$218.8 billion, with a return on investment of 5.2%.\n\nThe Board continues to promote diversification of assets and responsible investment. At the same time, the long-term growth syndicate has an annualized internal rate of return of 11.2% since its inception in 2009.\n\n# Institutional work\n\nTo promote public awareness of the Bank's policies and activities through various channels and to maintain close contact with society and the market.\n\nInternally, the KIM is committed to building a flexible and professional response team, while maintaining strict fiscal discipline and enhancing digital capabilities, responding to change and ensuring effective implementation of policies and measures."}

At the same time, the market climate in mainland China and Hong Kong has improved after the announcement and successive introduction of economic stimulus measures, and the various support measures introduced by the government should further improve the tourism industry in Hong Kong. Hong Kong's financial system, with its strong seismic resistance and abundant buffer over the years, is sufficiently capable of withstanding adverse shocks.\n\nWe will continue to make prudent and flexible management of the shell fund. We will make appropriate prudent deployment and maintain high liquidity, and will continue to diversify investment, improve the long-term investment return of the shell fund, and ensure that the shell fund can continue to effectively maintain the monetary and financial stability of Hong Kong.\n\n# Financial system is stable and sound\n\nThe uncertainty in the global economy is expected to continue in 2025 as policy developments under the new US administration are unpredictable and have led to geopolitical fragmentation. The HKMA, which has the responsibility of promoting the stability and soundness of the Hong Kong financial system, will continue to be vigilant, guard against potential risks, ensure that it is aware of the latest developments, and be ready to provide support to the Hong Kong economy at any time.\n\n# Be alert to potential risks\n\nThe outlook for 2025 is that global financial markets may be volatile in the face of uncertain macroeconomic conditions. However, Hong Kong's financial system is sufficiently resilient to adverse shocks due to the seismic and buffer capacity it has built up over the years. The Gold Authority also has the ability, resources and determination to maintain Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability.\n\nThe FSA will continue to closely monitor risks and instabilities in the local and peripheral environment and take appropriate measures to maintain the stability of Hong Kong's monetary and financial system as required. We will also study matters affecting the Hong Kong economy and assess the potential risks associated with these matters.\n\n# Keeping the banking system stable\n\nThe uncertainty of the macroeconomic environment is likely to pose challenges to the banking system. At the same time, the continued development of digitalization and the application of innovative technologies such as generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) will bring many benefits, but will also add new business operations and technological risks to the banks. In the face of the above environment, the KIM will work to further strengthen the banks' resilience to various shocks by providing policy and practical guidance, and continuous regulatory links and communication with individual banks and the industry as a whole. We will also continue to strengthen and improve the banking regulatory and supervisory model by responding to technological developments, changing customer expectations, and international and standard best practices.\n\n#Risk-based regulation focus\n\n#Credit, liquidity and market risk\n\nIn a stressed credit environment, the KIM will continue to focus on monitoring the asset quality of the accredited institutions and evaluating the effectiveness of their credit risk management practices, especially in areas such as loan classification and provisioning, and problem loan management. At the same time, we will maintain close communication with the banking and business communities and encourage accredited institutions to continue to support the real economy while maintaining the first principles of prudent credit risk management.\n\nIn light of the uncertain interest rate outlook in major advanced economies and the heightened geopolitical tensions that are driving global financial markets to be more volatile, the FCA will continue to take proactive steps to monitor the market risk management of accredited institutions. In light of the uncertain macroeconomic environment and the increasing digitalization of banking services, we will also review how accredited institutions manage liquidity risk to strengthen their ability to cope with sudden cash flows.\n\n#Business operations and technology risk\n\nThe FSA will continue its work to improve the overall operational stability of the banking system by reviewing banks' progress in identifying and remediating potential risks to the maintenance of critical operations as part of the operational stability architecture.\n\nIn view of the banking industry's increasing reliance on third party service providers, the Banking Authority will further strengthen the management of third party risk by banks by developing new guidelines to implement the relevant international standards established by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (\"the Basel Committee\").\n\nIn the area of network defense resilience, the KIM will assess systemic network risks through the cross-border \"network mapping\" project. The project is being jointly promoted by the KIM and other local financial regulators in accordance with the recommendations of the International Monetary Fund. In addition, we will review the implementation of the \"stable triple data backup\" arrangement by banks and launch the network defense resilience testing framework to promote banks to strengthen their ability to restore critical operations in the event of a severe network incident.\n\nWhile we are aware of the benefits of the wider adoption of high-end technologies such as GenAI in the banking industry, we will remain vigilant to the emerging risks and provide guidance on the use of such technologies as needed.\n\nWe will also work with industry and other stakeholders to remain responsive and prevent risks to improve banks' ability to combat digital fraud and prevent the wide variety of fraudulent practices.\n\n# Fight against money laundering and terrorist financing\n\nIn 2025, the Kim administration will launch institutional reforms, innovations and other measures to enhance Hong Kong's overall capacity to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, reduce the threat of illicit financial flows, and align with the latest international standards and best practices.\n\nAs part of the Government's inter-agency cooperation, we will assist in the comprehensive assessment of the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing in Hong Kong III, to deepen our understanding of the potential vulnerabilities posed by technological developments, and to develop effective and appropriate guidance based on the results of the assessment, in line with the implementation of the new system of supervision of stablecoin issuers.\n\nWe will continue to lead and promote the responsible use of technology, including artificial intelligence, in areas that bring value to the public. This includes strengthening surveillance of suspicious activity, enabling banks to identify and stop more fraud and fraudulent accounts, and thus further increasing the quality of information submitted to law enforcement agencies and assisting in follow-up.\n\nTo strengthen the fight against fraud and other financial crimes, we will propose the necessary legislative amendments to create the necessary means and safeguards for the sharing of personal account information between banks. In order to strengthen the detection of the speed and quantity of illicit money flows, the Treasury will work on the payment data analytics platform.\n\n# Wealth management and compulsory public accounts\n\nIn 2025, the FSA will conduct on-site and off-site audits of the conduct of the accredited institution in the areas of securities, investment products, trusts, insurance and mandatory public ledger (\"forced deposit\") related activities. We will focus on high-yield complex products, digital assets and related investment products, cross-border \"smart wallet\" operations, digital distribution and advisory platforms, long-term insurance products and insurance financing operations, and will refer to the latest market developments and revisions to international standards.\n\nThe FSA will also liaise closely with other regulatory bodies and the banking community to provide guidance on regulatory standards for the sale of securities, investment, insurance and deposit products as needed. In order to promote the sustainable and responsible development of the digital asset industry, we will continue to work with governments and other regulatory bodies to ensure a stable, comprehensive and balanced regulatory framework for the digital asset industry.\n\nIn addition, the KIM will facilitate and monitor the implementation of the Cross-Border Cash Flow (CBFC) enhancement measures by the industry and continue to engage with the industry and relevant regulatory authorities to further enhance the scheme and other bank-related cross-border projects.\n\nWe will also consolidate and clarify existing guidance on wealth management and hard money related activities as needed to make it easier for the industry to understand and comply with the Gold Authority's regulatory requirements.\n\n# policy making\n\n# Basel standards to be implemented in Hong Kong\n\nThe three-tiered final reform package of the Basel Convention will enter into force in Hong Kong on 1 January 2025. The KIM will continue to provide guidance and clarification to accreditation bodies on common issues in the interpretation of the final reform package to ensure industry adoption of the package.\n\nThe Basel Committee issued new standards for prudent handling of crypto asset risk by banks in December 2022 and targeted revisions in July 2024 to further clarify the criteria for preferential regulatory treatment of stablecoins. At the same time, the Basel Committee also published a document entitled \"Crypto Asset Risk Disclosure\" listing updated crypto asset risk disclosure requirements. In order to implement the relevant standards in Hong Kong, the CMA may need to study the new capital adequacy rules, disclosure rules, risk limitation rules, and liquidity rules for banks. The CMA will also help the CMA to implement the new risk reporting and risk management guidelines for the industry and propose a time frame for the establishment of risk limitation rules for banks.\n\n# Other regulatory policies and risk management guidelines\n\nIn order to keep up with the latest international standards, regulatory approaches and developments in the banking industry, the Chinese Banking Regulatory Commission plans to update several key regulatory policy handbook key units, including CA-G-5 \"Regulatory Review Procedure\", CA-B-2 \"Systemically Important Banks\", IC-5 \"Stress Testing\", IR-1 \"Interest Risk in Bank Accounts\" and IC-3 \"Reporting by Institutional External Auditors in accordance with the Banking Regulations of the Chinese Banking Industry\".\n\nThe Basel Committee's main principles for effective banking supervision\n\nThe Basel Committee on Banking Supervision published the revised Banking Principles for Effective Supervision in April 2024. The revised Principles reflect developments in supervision and regulation since the last revision in 2012, as well as the impact of recent structural trends on banks and the banking system. The Banking Authority will undertake a detailed self-assessment in 2025 to ensure that its supervisory and regulatory framework is in line with the revised Principles.\n\n# Accounting standards\n\nThe International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) plans to issue a call for opinions on Dynamic Risk Management in 2025. The IASB will work with other relevant authorities to study the impact of the proposed dynamic risk management accounting model on existing prudential regulation.\n\n# Law enforcement\n\nThe Board will advise the banking industry on the extension of the investigative and enforcement powers of the Financial Controller in 2024, to ensure that he/she still has the necessary powers to effectively perform his/her functions under the Banking Regulation. After considering the comments received in the consultation, the Board will adjust the relevant recommendations and make the necessary legislative amendments to further advise the stakeholders.\n\n# Mechanism of disposal\n\nThe IMA is continuing a multi-year project to establish a well-functioning mechanism for the handling of accreditation bodies. In 2025, the IMA will prioritise the following areas of work (Table 1):\n\nTable 1 Highlights of the 2025 disposal mechanism\n\n# Disposal policy and standards\n\n- Advise on and complete the development of the relevant Code of Practice column on the approach of the Gold Regulatory Authority to valuation in disposal and the prior capabilities and arrangements required by the accrediting body to support timely and robust disposal of valuation - Promote the development of policy standards for disposal restructuring\n\n#International and cross-border cooperation\n\n- For its work on the development and effective implementation of international resolution policy, in particular the 12 resolution mechanism reform measures planned by the Financial Stability Board through its resolution mechanism oversight group and working groups for 2025"}

The Gold Authority was subsequently established on 1 April 1993.\n\nThe powers, duties and responsibilities of the Financial Controller are set out in the OTC Funds Regulations, the Banking Regulations, the Financial Institutions (Custody) Regulations, the Deposit Guarantee Scheme Regulations, the Payment Systems and the Payment Instruments Regulations, and other relevant regulations. The Exchange of Letters between the Director of Finance and the Financial Controller dated 25 June 2003 lists the distribution of duties and responsibilities in respect of money and financial affairs, and discloses that the Director of Finance has delegated certain powers to the Financial Controller. The corresponding letter is a public document and can be found on the website of the Financial Authority.\n\nThe Fund is established under the Fund Regulations and controlled by the Chief Financial Officer. The Chief Financial Officer may also use the Fund to maintain the stability and soundness of the monetary financial system in Hong Kong (while also taking into account the main purpose of the Fund), thereby maintaining Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre.\n\nThe Financial Controller is appointed by the President of the Board of Governors of the United States Federal Reserve System under the Overseas Funds Act to assist the Director of Finance in the exercise of the functions conferred upon him by that Act, and to perform such other functions as may be assigned to him by the Director of Finance. The office of the Financial Controller is called the Gold Board, and the Financial Controller is the President of the Gold Board.\n\nThe Financial Controller is responsible for regulating and supervising banking and deposit-taking activities in accordance with the Banking Regulations. The Financial Controller is responsible for the licensing of Hong Kong licensed banks, limited-licensed banks and deposit-taking companies.\n\nThe Financial Institutions Regulation (Solution Mechanism) and Regulation (Solution Mechanism) defines the Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA) as the authority for the resolution mechanism of banking sector entities.

The President of the HKSA and its staff are all civil servants. The daily operations of the HKSA are highly autonomous within the scope of the statutory powers granted or delegated to the Financial Management Commissioner.\n\nThe Director of Finance is responsible for determining Hong Kong's monetary policy objectives and monetary system. In a letter to the Financial Management Committee dated 25 June 2003, the Director of Finance clarified that the monetary policy objective of Hong Kong is to maintain monetary stability through the monetary board system, with the HKD pegged at around 7.80 to the HKD pegged at 1 USD. The Financial Management Committee is responsible for determining the monetary policy objectives, including the relevant strategies, tools and methods of implementation, and for maintaining the stability and soundness of the Hong Kong monetary system.\n\nThe Director of Finance, assisted by the Director of the Office of Financial Affairs and Treasury, is responsible for the policies that maintain the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's financial system and maintain Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre. To implement these policies, the Financial Management Officer's responsibilities include:\n\nTo promote the overall stability and efficient functioning of the banking system; to cooperate with other relevant institutions and organizations to develop the debt market; to handle matters related to the issuance and circulation of legal tender and coins; to promote the safety and efficiency of the financial infrastructure by developing the payment, settlement and exchange system and, where appropriate, by assuming responsibility for the operation of the relevant system; and to cooperate with other relevant institutions and organizations to promote confidence in the monetary and financial system of Hong Kong and to implement appropriate market development measures to help strengthen the international competitiveness of Hong Kong's financial services.\n\nThe Director of Finance has control over the management of the Fund. The Financial Management Officer is responsible to the Director of Finance for the management and investment management of the Fund, subject to the authority of the Director of Finance.\n\n# Advisory Board and management\n\n#Advisory committee\n\nThe Advisory Committee provides advice and guidance on the main areas of work of the Gold Authority.\n\nThe Overseas Fund Advisory Committee is established by the Hong Kong Overseas Fund Regulations to advise the Director of Finance on matters related to the exercise of control over the Overseas Fund. The Director of Finance is the Chairman of the Overseas Fund Advisory Committee, and the other members (including the Financial Management Committee) are appointed by the Director of Finance on the authority of the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. Each member of the Overseas Fund Advisory Committee is appointed by the Governor with his or her own expertise and experience. The Overseas Fund Advisory Committee is composed of five members who are responsible for the work and advice of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority in specific areas.\n\nThe Banking Advisory Committee and the Depository Receiving Company Advisory Committee advise the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on matters relating to the regulation of banking, particularly on matters relating to banks, depository receiving companies and banks with limited licences to carry on banking or accepting depository business (as the case may be). Both committees are chaired by the Director of Finance and include members appointed by the Director of Finance under the authority of the Chief Executive. For details on the Banking Advisory Committee and the Depository Receiving Company Advisory Committee, please refer to pages 64 to 65.\n\n# The management\n\nThe President's Commission is composed of the President, Vice-Presidents and other senior staff of the Gold Authority and is chaired by the President of the Gold Authority. The President's Commission meets regularly to inform the President of the progress of the work of the main departments of the Gold Authority and to advise the President on policy matters related to the operation of the Gold Authority. For a list of the members of the President's Commission, see pages 66-67.\n\n# Accountability and transparency\n\nThe KIM has maintained a high degree of autonomy in its day-to-day operations and in the approach it takes to implement government policy objectives, while maintaining a high degree of accountability and transparency.\n\nThe Financial Controller is appointed by the Director of Finance, and therefore the Financial Controller is accountable to the public through the Director of Finance; and since the functions of the Financial Controller are regulated by laws passed by the Legislative Assembly, the Financial Controller is also accountable to the public through the Legislative Assembly. The Financial Controller also understands that it has a broader responsibility to promote public awareness of the role and objectives of the Financial Controller, and to closely monitor the concerns of the public. The Financial Controller is committed to improving transparency and maintaining openness in its daily work and in its broad engagement with society.\n\n- To make the financial community and the public as aware as possible of the work of the Gold Authority, taking into account market sensitivities and legal restrictions on the disclosure of trade secrets and confidential information; and - To ensure that the Gold Authority is aware of the social context and responds appropriately to public opinion.\n\n#Communicating with the public\n\nThe Board is committed to promoting monetary and banking stability, effectively managing official reserves, developing and overseeing a stable and diversified financial infrastructure, and thereby consolidating Hong Kong's position as an international financial centre and driving Hong Kong's economic development.\n\nThe Gold Authority is responsible for publicly explaining its policies and work in a rigorous manner. The Gold Authority maintains extensive contacts with the media and uses social media platforms to communicate more effectively with the public in the digital age. The Gold Authority also endeavors to handle matters of social concern that relate to the scope of the Gold Authority's duties, especially through traditional and social media to clarify in a timely manner the false information and rumors about the Gold Authority's policies.\n\nIn addition, the office of the Gold Authority has an information center, divided into two parts, a library and an exhibition hall, which is open to the public for viewing and use six days a week. For more information on the work of the Gold Authority in communicating and contacting the public, see \"The functions of the institution chapter 1 (pages 185-191) \".\n\n# The Legislative Council\n\nThe relationship between the Treasury Board and the Legislature is important for accountability and transparency. The Treasury Board President undertakes to brief the Legislature's Financial Affairs Committee three times a year on the Treasury Board's work and policies and to respond to inquiries. The Treasury Board President regularly brief the Financial Affairs Committee on the Treasury Board's website.\n\nIn addition, representatives from the KING Administration attend the meetings of the Legislative Council's Committee on Public Affairs and Subcommittees from time to time to explain and discuss special matters and assist members in reviewing draft statutes.\n\n#Disclosure\n\nThe HKMA is committed to the highest international standards of transparency and publishes a variety of journals and specialized publications in Chinese and English. The HKMA's bilingual website (www.hkma.gov.hk) contains a large number of publications, press releases, speeches and briefing materials, in addition to a dedicated section listing economic research, statistics, regulatory resources, consumer information and other topics.\n\nThe FSA periodically reviews whether the disclosure of OTC funds and money issuer accounting information is sufficient. The FSA began participating in the International Monetary Fund's central bank \"Special Data Disclosure Standards\" program in 1999. The FSA also publishes minutes of meetings of the Money Issuing Committee under the FSA Advisory Committee, as well as reports on the operation of the money issuing system.\n\n# Internal controls and external audits\n\nThe Bank shall have a robust and effective oversight mechanism, ensuring a high level of staff discipline, prudent risk management, and appropriate controls. The internal and external audit function shall provide an independent assessment of the adequacy and effectiveness of the oversight mechanism.\n\n# Code of conduct\n\nThe Code of Conduct provides guidance on the ethical and legal responsibilities of employees and ensures that all employees at all levels of the organization conduct themselves in accordance with the specified standards.\n\n#Internal surveillance\n\n#Operational surveillance\n\nAs the first line of defence for risk management, all departments and agencies have the responsibility to identify and assess the risks in their work processes and to develop appropriate monitoring measures to ensure the smooth day-to-day operation of the Gold Authority.\n\n# Institutional risk management\n\nRisk management is also carried out at the institutional level. The Risk Committee, chaired by the President of the Gold Authority, is one of the cornerstones of the institutional risk management structure.\n\nThe Risk Committee reviews and alerts the departments on the potential and emerging risks identified, as well as the adequacy of the related monitoring measures and mitigation strategies, and determines the appropriate follow-up actions.\n\n# Internal accounting\n\nThe Internal Audit Unit of the MIB independently assesses the adequacy and effectiveness of the governance procedures, risk management and monitoring measures in the various departments and makes recommendations for improvement.\n\n# External accounting\n\nAccording to Article 7 of the Shell Funds Regulations, the financial statements of the Shell Funds are audited by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government Audit Office. The Audit Office does not charge for this service. The audited Shell Funds financial statements are published in the Annual Report of the Gold Authority."}

The labor market remained stable, and inflation continued to decline under external price pressures. The Hong Kong stock market recovered significantly, while the real estate market was weakened by the continuing bull market. Due to the continuing escalation of trade tensions, Hong Kong's economy is expected to face a challenging external environment in 2025. However, China's domestic economic stimulus, coupled with the multifaceted support provided to local businesses, can strengthen business confidence. Hong Kong will continue to strengthen international exchanges and deepen regional cooperation.\n\n# Economic reflection\n\n# Physical economic activity\n\nHong Kong's economy grew moderately in 2024. Real gross domestic product (GDP) rose 2.5% year-on-year in 2024, after a 3.2% increase in 2023 (Table 1 and Figure 1). On the external side, goods exports returned to positive growth, driven by improved external demand and the resumption of the global technology cycle, becoming the main driver of overall economic growth. Service exports also increased steadily with the continued recovery of port-to-port tourism and a significant increase in cross-border and financial capital activities in the second half of the year. However, the positive effect of service exports on overall economic growth was offset by a significant increase in imported services exports due to the continued growth of tourism.\n\nFigure 1 Composition of the contribution to real GDP growth.

Source: Government Statistics\n\n#Community and the labour market\n\nDespite the gradual rise in rent for newly signed private homes, local cost pressures remain largely contained, and combined with the gradual decline in external price pressures, local inflation remains moderate in 2024 (Figure 2)  The combined, basic and overall inflation rates for the full year 2024 are 1.1% and 1.7% respectively.\n\nThe labour market was stable in 2024, with the unemployment rate hovering between 2.9% and 3.1% for the full year (Figure 3). The total number of employed people (Figure 3) has been rising since Q1, and the labour force has also increased, reflecting the demand for labour and supply remained broadly stable. At the same time, nominal wages and labour income have both recorded steady growth as the economy continues to grow.\n\nFigure 2 Inflation in basic consumer goods Source: Office of Government Statistics\n\nFigure 3 Situation of the labour market. Source: Government Statistics\n\n# The stock market\n\nThe market sentiment improved significantly in 2024, following a sharp rebound in the stock market since mid-September. In general, the market atmosphere improved significantly with the US Federal Reserve cutting interest rates and introducing positive economic stimulus measures domestically, driving the HGX to an all-year high on October 7, earning 23,100 points (Figure 4). However, the US presidential election held in early November raised concerns about the global economic outlook and the pace of the Fed's monetary policy easing, and the HGX recovered slightly.\n\n# The property market\n\nThe residential property market was generally weak in the first three quarters of 2024, but showed signs of recovery in the fourth quarter. Supported by the easing of related policy measures in late February and October, and the interest rate cutting cycle that began in September, the total annual residential turnover rose significantly by 23.5% from a historic low of 43,002 units in 2023 to 53,099 units in 2024.However, continued high mortgage interest rates and the accumulation of inventory in the market at one hand continued to put downward pressure on the price of residential property.However, the price of residential property fell by 7.1% year-on-year in 2024, and therefore the rental affordability improved slightly, although it remained relatively weak.The non-residential property market remained weak.\n\nFigure 4 Asset prices as reported by the Hong Kong Property Valuation Agency and Hong Kong Trading and Settlement Ownership Limited\n\n# Economic Prospects\n\n# The economic environment\n\nWith the rising trade tensions and the potential for disruption to international trade and capital flows, the Hong Kong economy is expected to face a challenging external environment in 2025. However, the continuous support of the relevant authorities and the banking industry should improve the resilience of local businesses. The domestically active introduction of economic stimulus measures and the major breakthroughs in the field of cutting-edge technology should also boost business confidence. At the same time, Hong Kong will further deepen regional cooperation and accelerate the integration of emerging markets.\n\n#Community and the labour market\n\nThe local demand is expected to remain moderate in 2025. Local costs may face a slight upward pressure as rising rents will gradually be passed on to consumer prices. However, despite the increased uncertainty in the global economic outlook, external price pressures should remain moderate. On the other hand, the labor market may face challenges due to heightened trade tensions.\n\n# Banking system performance\n\nThe banking system in Hong Kong is expected to remain stable in 2024, with ample capital and liquidity. In a challenging macroeconomic environment, credit risk in the banking system has increased during the year, but the overall asset quality of the bank remains controllable. Benefitting from the investment returns from holding transactions and the rise in receipts and commission income, retail bank profits have increased compared to 2023.\n\n# Quality of assets\n\nThe specific classification loan ratio of the banking system increased from 1.57% at the end of 2023 to 1.96% at the end of 2024, and the ratio of overdue and restructured loans increased from 1.24% to 1.55%, mainly due to the downgrading of the credit rating of some inland real estate developers and small local developers and investors. However, the specific classification loan ratio of relevant inland loans in China decreased from 2.58% at the end of 2023 to 2.38% at the end of 2024.\n\nFigure 5 Quality of assets in the banking system. Source: Gold Board\n\nFigure 6 Default rates for residential mortgage loans and credit card loans.\n\n# The earnings trend\n\nThe retail banking sector saw an overall increase in operating profit before tax of 8.4% in 2024, while the average return on assets after tax rose from 0.88% to 0.93% in the same period (Figure 7). The increase in profit was mainly due to the increase in investment income from holding transactions (Figure 7) and the increase in fees and commission income (Figure 15) but was partially offset by a decrease in net interest income (Figure 5.2) in the same period. The net interest margin of the retail banking sector narrowed to 1.52% in 2024 from 1.67% in 2023 (Figure 8) and the retail banking cost-to-income ratio increased slightly from 38.9% in 2023 to 39.2% in 2024 (Figure 9).\n\nFigure 7 Performance of retail banks.\n\nFigure 8 Net interest rate differential of retail banks.\n\nFigure 9 Cost to revenue ratio of retail banking\n\n# The asset and liability index is moving\n\nThe Banking System's asset-liability ratio expanded by 4.3% in 2024, mainly due to the increase in transferable debt instruments (+13.4%). Due to high borrowing costs and pressure on borrowing demand, the total amount of loans decreased by 2.8% in 2024. Of these, loans used in Hong Kong and loans used outside Hong Kong decreased by 2.1% and 5.7%, respectively, while trade financing increased by 4.6% .\n\nIn terms of the debt to interest ratio of the asset-liability table, total deposits increased by 7.1% in 2024, compared to an increase of 5.1% in 2023. The total deposits increased due to a decrease in total loans, and the overall loan-to-deposit ratio decreased from 62.8% at the end of 2023 to 57.0% at the end of 2024 (Figure 10).\n\n# Capital is sufficient\n\nThe banking system is expected to maintain capital adequacy in 2024. The combined total capital ratio of locally registered accredited institutions at the end of 2024 was 21.8%, compared to 21.1% in the previous year; the Tier 1 capital ratio was 19.9% (Figure 11); both are well above the relevant international minimum requirements. The Basel III ratio at the end of 2024 was 8.0% (Figure 12).\n\nFigure 10 Loans and deposits in the banking system.

Source: Gold Authority\n\nFigure 12 The proportion of aluminum alloys used in the production of alloys by locally registered certified institutions.\n\n# Mobility\n\nThe liquidity situation of the banking system remains stable. The quarterly average liquidity coverage ratio of Category 1 institutions was 178.4% in Q4 2024 and the quarterly average liquidity maintenance ratio of Category 2 institutions was 67.0% (Figure 13). The main source of funds in the banking system remains customer deposits. At the end of 2024, the stable net capital ratio of Category 1 institutions and the core capital ratio of Category 2A institutions were 143.4% and 186.7% respectively (Figure 14). All four of the above ratios are well above the minimum legal requirements.\n\nFigure 13 Liquidity ratios of designated accredited institutions\n\nFigure 14 Capital ratios of the designated accredited institutions."}

The HKD exchange rate returned to a soft spot in the first four months of 2024, before strengthening for the rest of the year. Under the pegged rate regime, Hong Kong banks and industries have been dismantling their interest rates in line with the US dollar, while also being influenced by local supply.\n\n# Goals\n\nThe main objective of Hong Kong's monetary policy is to maintain monetary stability, i.e. to ensure that the HKD is stable against the US dollar in the foreign exchange market, so that the HKD's exchange rate against the US dollar remains within the range of 7.75 to 7.85 HKD to US$1. The monetary system mainly adopts the money issuing bureau system, which provides for a minimum of 100 percent support to the currency base by the dollar reserves held by the foreign exchange fund; if the currency base changes, the dollar reserves must be increased and decreased in proportion to the percentage change in the currency base.\n\nThe monetary base (Table 1) includes:\n\n- certificates of debt (providing adequate support for bank notes issued by the three issuing banks); - circulating banknotes and coins issued by the government; - balances on the settlement account of the Gold Board (i.e. total balances); and - foreign exchange fund notes and bonds issued by the Gold Board on behalf of the government.\n\nTable 1 Monetary base\n\nThe Board maintains the HKD exchange rate stable through an automatic rate adjustment mechanism and a firm commitment to fulfill the exchange rate guarantee. When the strong (or weak) exchange rate guarantee is triggered, the Board will respond to the bank's request by remitting HKD 7.75 per dollar to the bank to buy HKD out of the bank, into the dollar, or to buy HKD into the bank, withdrawing USD, or to buy HKD 7.85 per dollar, so that the total balance increases or decreases, and the HKD interest rate falls or rises, thereby restoring the HKD exchange rate to the range of HKD 7.75 to 7.85.\n\n#2024 looking back\n\n# The rate of inflation is stable\n\nIn early August, the market was concerned about a possible recession in the US economy, and the Federal Reserve was expected to cut interest rates more quickly and more substantially, triggering interest rate swaps and short-term HKD swaps, and the HKD was expected to move to the guaranteed area of the currency. The HKD was further strengthened in late September, benefitting from a series of economic stimulus measures announced by the local government. The HKD was later weakened in early November, partly due to a sharp decline in the HKD stock market, partly due to the strong performance of the US economy, and the Federal Market Committee was given the space to continue to exercise caution in the operation of the Fed's interest rate swap. The HKD was also able to raise its own funds in the end of the year.\n\nFigure 1 Market rate in 2024\n\nSince the exchange guarantee was not triggered during the year, the total balance remained unchanged at around HK$4.47 billion. At the same time, the total outstanding foreign exchange reserves and bonds increased slightly to HK$138.39 billion from HK$12.455 billion. Therefore, the total outstanding foreign exchange reserves and bonds increased from HK$129.04 billion at the end of 2023 to HK$142.87 billion at the end of 2024 (Figure 2).\n\nFigure 2 Balance at 2024 (before the window) and outstanding shell fund notes and bonds\n\n# The money market\n\nUnder the pegged rate system, the Hong Kong bank and industry's discount rate broadly followed the US dollar rate trend, and short-term discount rates were also affected by local supply and demand conditions. As the market grew warmer with expectations of a decline in US policy rates, the Hong Kong bank and industry's discount rate returned to a soft spot in the first eight months of 2024 (Figure 3).\n\nIn response to the US Federal Reserve target zone decline, the base rate decreased three times, totaling one percentage point (i.e., 100 basis points), from 5.75 to 4.75 (Figure 3). At the retail level, with the US policy rate decline, many banks lowered the most preferential loan rate by 25 basis points in mid-September, and again by 25 basis points and 12.5 basis points in early November and late December respectively. In this situation, the average interest rate on new mortgage loans also fell from 4.13 in 2023 to 3.59 in December 2024. Overall, the Hong Kong money market continued to operate normally.\n\nFigure 3 Bank of Hong Kong and its subsidiaries demolished in 2024\n\n#Contact rate system\n\nSince 1983, the Hong Kong Fed has been a key pillar of Hong Kong's financial system, demonstrating its ability to respond to challenges. Despite the uncertainties in US policy interest rates and geopolitical fragmentation, the HKD and money markets have remained orderly, reflecting the stability and effectiveness of the Fed. The government is also committed to maintaining the Fed.\n\nA sound banking system is critical to the smooth functioning of the FIS. Hong Kong's banking system continues to operate smoothly, with liquidity and capital levels that are very high by international standards. To ensure that the banking system has the ability to withstand shocks, the FIS has closely monitored banks' credit, liquidity and interest rate risk management, as well as stress test results, and maintained supervision of bank lending.\n\nIn order to improve transparency of the purpose of the MEB accounts, since October 1998, some of the assets of the OFC have been designated as the supporting currency base. The support ratio (the ratio of the supporting assets to the currency base) has increased from 110.73% at the end of 2023 to 112.65% at the peak of September 10, 2024, exceeding the 112.5% trigger cap (Figure 4), which mainly comes from interest on investments and investment re-valued at the market price.\n\nFigure 4 Daily changes in the support ratio in 2024\n\n# The Committee for the issuance of currency\n\nThe Monetary Issuing Committee, under the Overseas Fund Advisory Board, is responsible for monitoring and addressing issues related to Hong Kong's currency and financial stability. In 2024, the Monetary Issuing Committee's topics include the risk-taking of the Hong Kong banking industry towards non-bank financial institutions, and the latest monetary policy implementation framework for major advanced economies. The minutes of the Monetary Issuing Committee's meetings and the report on the functioning of the monetary issuing system submitted to it by the Gold Authority are available on the Gold Authority website.\n\n# Banknotes and coins\n\nFigure 5 Amount of banknotes in circulation at the end of 2024, as analyzed by the Bank of Distribution\n\nFigure 6 Distribution of banknotes in circulation at the end of 2024\n\nFigure 7 Banknotes in circulation at the end of 2024\n\nFigure 8 Government issued notes and coins in circulation at the end of 2024\n\nFigure 9 Government issuance of circulation notes and coins analysis at the end of 2024\n\n# Hong Kong currency\n\nThe Hong Kong Mint held 14 lectures on the design and anti-counterfeiting features of Hong Kong banknotes during the year, attracting over 2,600 participants, including bank teller staff, retail store cashiers and students, to help improve their knowledge and skills in banknote examination.\n\n# Coin collection project\n\nThe coin collection program continues to be well received by the public. Details of the program are provided in the chapter \"Gold for Sustainable Development\" of the 2014 Sustainable Development Report.\n\n# USD floating rate\n\nThe FSA introduced enhancements to the USD liquidity arrangement, including shortening the delivery cycle from T+1 to T+0, effective May 24. This perpetual liquidity arrangement provides reserve liquidity to the licensed banks when needed, especially in the event that the US begins to implement the delivery cycle shortened to T+1 on May 28.\n\n# Foreign exchange fund bills and bonds\n\nThe OTC fund notes and bonds program continues to operate smoothly. As of the end of 2024, the outstanding nominal value of OTC fund notes and bonds was approximately HK$13.068 billion (Table 2).\n\nTable 2 Unpaid receipts and bonds of shell funds\n\n# Currency research\n\nIn 2024, the Hong Kong Centre for Monetary and Financial Research (HCMF), the research arm of the School of Finance, published 15 research papers on monetary and financial research issues of strategic importance to Hong Kong and the region, and shared the results with readers worldwide through five open access electronic journals. The Centre also published two volumes of Insights from Monetary Research, providing the public with high-level technical overviews of its recent research papers.\n\nIn addition to its research work, the Research Centre hosts a series of knowledge exchange activities to promote contact with different participants.

{"zh": "# 銀行體系穩定\n\n儘管面對宏觀經濟挑戰及地緣政治的不確定性，香港銀行體系在2024年維持穩健。金管局迅速採取措施支援本地中小型企業，並透過風險為本監管與應變規劃保障銀行體系穩定，另又提供監管指引及支持業界應對新生風險，以提升銀行業的運作穩健性與網絡防衛韌性。為鼓勵應用金融科技，金管局推出連串跨行業項目，包括生成式人工智能「沙盒」。\n\n金管局推出《保障消費者防詐騙約章2.0》，以加強銀行消費者保障。我們又推出「智安存」協助存款人有效保護存款，以及有關銀行無抵押消費信貸產品的冷靜期以減低衝動及過度借貸的風險。此外，金管局向銀行提供有關在面向客戶的服務中應用生成式人工智能的指引，又就二手物業買賣交易提供多一種支付安排與業界緊密合作。金管局亦透過發出數碼資產相關活動的指引、優化「跨境理財通」業務試點，以及簡化銷售投資及保險產品程序，提升客戶體驗，並同時確保投資者保障。年內完成個人信貸資料服務全面過渡至「信資通」。\n\n金管局在香港的打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度方面扮演重要角色。透過提高經由反訛騙及洗黑錢情報工作組交換情報的速度及數量，與2023年相比，情報主導的可疑交易報告增加303%，促使凍結或充公的犯罪得益增加34%。有關促進銀行分享訊息以協助偵測及防止金融罪行的法例修訂的諮詢得到廣泛支持。金管局在4月根據交易監察系統專題審查結果提供指引，以及在9月推出計劃促進業界應用人工智能監察可疑活動。金管局亦與銀行業及香港警務處合作，優化「可疑帳號警示」機制及加強宣傳工作，並就防範、偵測及制止授權支付詐騙向銀行發出指引。\n\n香港在實施包括資本充足及披露等國際監管標準方面取得良好進展。香港存款保障委員會優化了存款保障計劃的多個範疇，以加強對存款人的保障。\n\n為確保處置機制具公信力，金管局實施處置標準，規定銀行須更新與對手方的金融合約，減低處置中的提前終止風險。此外，金管局在制定銀行的首選處置策略、應對處置可行性障礙以確保有足夠財政資源及處置中的運作持續性，以及提升處置執行能力方面均取得顯著進展。\n\n# 目標\n\n金管局的目標之一是促進銀行體系的安全及穩定。要達致這個目標，實有賴建立及維持具高度應對能力且能為香港經濟提供所需關鍵金融服務的金融體系。\n\n銀行可能因其營運方式，甚或在極端情況下因失序地倒閉而影響金融體系的穩定。作為監管當局，金融管理專員在保障金融穩定方面擔當重要角色，確保銀行有能力抵禦衝擊及應對危機，以最終有助防止出現倒閉。金融管理專員負責對銀行進行審慎監管，以及認可香港的持牌銀行、有限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司（統稱「認可機構」）。\n\n香港的審慎監管制度並非為確保「零風險」而設。事實上，作為一個處置機制當局，金融管理專員力求確保一旦有認可機構不再可持續經營，能有秩序地處理其倒閉。為此，香港已設立金融機構處置機制，金融管理專員在該機制下為認可機構的處置機制當局。為落實香港的處置機制，我們有必要制定處置規則及政策標準、進行處置規劃以排除認可機構處置可行性的障礙，以及建立金管局處置瀕臨倒閉認可機構的運作能力。為有效執行上述工作，金管局採納與國際一致及協調的方法。\n\n金融管理專員亦負責指定及監察某些金融市場基建。金管局監察金融市場基建的目的，是促進有關基建的整體安全及效率、減低系統性風險，以及提高透明度。提升金融市場基建面對金融危機的抗震能力，能保障香港的貨幣與金融體系，避免因金融市場基建運作中斷而影響其穩定。\n\n# 2024年回顧\n\n# 牌照事宜\n\n年內金管局向一間在香港成立為法團的銀行及一間在香港以外成立為法團的銀行授予銀行牌照。金管局亦核准一間在香港以外的交易商經紀成為貨幣經紀。此外，年內金管局撤銷三間持牌銀行、一間有限制牌照銀行及一間接受存款公司的認可資格。\n\n有關香港的認可機構及本地代表辦事處的更多資訊，請參閱分別載於第311至314頁及第320至323頁的附錄及表D至F。\n\n# 檢討銀行三級制\n\n在2024年，金管局完成有關簡化銀行三級制至二級制的公眾諮詢，回應者普遍支持簡化建議。經考慮所收到的意見，金管局就建議提出若干新的關鍵事項，以精簡過渡過程及減少對接受存款公司現有客戶的影響。\n\n# 「虛擬銀行」易名\n\n此外，金管局完成有關「虛擬銀行(Virtual Bank)」易名為「數字銀行(Digital Bank)」的公眾諮詢。易名建議得到廣泛支持，金管局遂於10月修訂法定指引《數字銀行的認可》，有關建議正式生效。\n\n# 數字銀行的檢討\n\n在2024年完成的另一項工作是全面檢討數字銀行，檢討報告已於8月發表。有關檢討顯示數字銀行發展至今已達到在香港引入數字銀行的三項政策目標，即推動金融科技與創新、提供新的客戶體驗，以及促進普及金融。在數字銀行和傳統銀行的多樣化發展下，金管局認為現時數字銀行牌照的數量合適，現階段沒有必要在市場上引入更多新的數字銀行參與者。10月發出的修訂指引《數字銀行的認可》放寬了數項對業界的限制，包括容許數字銀行經營零售銀行業務以外的銀行業務，以及在從客戶體驗與業務策略的角度而言屬合理的情況下設立實體分行，前提是數字銀行繼續主要透過數碼渠道提供銀行服務。\n\n# 銀行牌照費的檢討\n\n金管局於年內完成對牌照費的檢討，並於6月提高費用水平。\n\n# 香港的公司遷冊制度\n\n金管局就於香港引入公司遷冊制度向政府提供支援，包括協助修訂《銀行業條例》及其附屬法例以及其他與金管局有關的法例的立法程序。\n\n# 監管工作概覽\n\n年內金管局共進行174次非現場審查，涵蓋範圍甚廣，包括認可機構的CAMEL評估、企業管治及風險管理。為繼續加強認可機構的風險管治水平，金管局與認可機構董事局、獨立非執行董事或董事局轄下委員會共舉行36次會議，並與認可機構及其外聘核數師共舉行38次三方聯席會議。此外，金管局對認可機構的各項業務進行現場審查，包括信用、市場及流動性風險管理方面的管治與做法。\n\n鑑於認可機構應用科技的情況越趨普及，業務操作風險及科技風險管理是另一個監管重點。金管局亦進一步加強對認可機構氣候風險管理的監管，以提高認可機構應對氣候變化的能力。金管局在全球經濟不明朗的環境下維持金融穩定及促進經濟穩健增長等方面的工作得到肯定，獲《亞洲銀行家》雜誌(The AsianBanker)評選為「亞太區最佳宏觀經濟監管機構」(BestMacroeconomic Regulator in Asia Pacific)。\n\n助理總裁（銀行監理）朱立翹女士（中）代表金管局領取《亞洲銀行家》雜誌頒發的「亞太區最佳宏觀經濟監管機構獎項\n\n在操守監管方面，金管局對認可機構的證券、投資產品、信託、保險及強制性公積金（強積金）相關業務，以及消費者保障事項進行現場審查，並以專題評估作為配合，以審視新的項目或被評估為屬較高風險的範疇。\n\n表1載有金管局於2024年的監管工作概要。\n\n表 1 監管工作概要\n\na. 聚焦於運作穩健性的額外監管工作包括一項金管局調查及認可機構進行自我評估以審視實施進度和識別需要加強的環節，以及就架構制定與做法在雙邊與業界層面進行廣泛的外展活動。\nb. 此外，監管工作集中評估認可機構對特定信貸組合的審批和持續風險管理的策略與手法，例如對商用物業及中小型企業貸款。\nc. 包括與認可機構舉行諮詢會議，以檢視其實施金管局《監管政策手冊》單元GS-1「氣候風險管理」的情況。\n\n# 信用風險\n\n# 信貸增長及資產質素\n\n2024年貸款總額減少2.8%，2023年的跌幅為3.6%。表2列載各類貸款及墊款的增長情況。2024年內地相關貸款總額減少8.7%至38,590億港元（表3）。\n\n鑑於利率仍然高企、部分內地房地產發展商的債務問題還未完全緩解，以及本地商業房地產市場疲弱，金管局在2024年繼續密切監察認可機構的資產質素及評估其信用風險管理手法。年內銀行體系的資產質素持續面對壓力，但風險形勢仍屬可控。銀行體系的特定分類貸款比率於2024年底為1.96%，高於2023年底的1.57%，而同期內地相關貸款的特定分類貸款比率則由2.58%下降至2.38%。\n\n年內金管局進行專題評估，檢視認可機構的信用風險管理，當中重點包括對較易受影響行業的風險承擔、對私人銀行及財富管理客戶的有抵押貸款、無抵押零售貸款、對香港境外業務的信用風險的監察，以及對非銀行金融機構的風險承擔。\n\n表 2 貸款及墊款的增長\n\n表 3 內地相關貸款增長\n\n# 紓緩銀行客戶的資金流壓力\n\n# 支持本地中小企\n\n中小企是香港經濟的重要基石，金管局一直密切關注它們獲取銀行融資的情況。自金管局與銀行業於2019年成立「銀行業中小企貸款協調機制」（中小企協調機制）以來，合共推出多輪中小企支援措施，包括「預先批核還息不還本」計劃，協助中小企渡過新冠疫情期間的困境。\n\n在2024年，金管局與銀行業推出更多措施，支持經營情況因經濟轉型而仍然面對挑戰的中小企，並協助中小企持續發展和升級轉型。\n\n# 新的中小企支持措施\n\n金管局透過中小企協調機制於3月推出九項措施，協助中小企獲取銀行融資，以及支持其持續發展。\n\n於3月公布的九項支持中小企措施\n\n1. 不要求按時供款按揭客戶提前還款\n2. 調整信貸額度給予客戶最少六個月過渡期", "en": "# Banking system is stable\n\nDespite the macroeconomic challenges and geopolitical uncertainties, Hong Kong's banking system is stable in 2024. The HKMA has taken swift action to support local small businesses and safeguard the banking system through risk-based regulatory and response planning, as well as providing regulatory guidance and support to the industry to deal with emerging risks to enhance the operational stability of the banking sector and the resilience of network defense. In order to encourage the use of financial technology, the HKMA has launched a series of cross-industry projects, including the generation of artificial intelligence \"sandbox\".\n\nWe also introduced \"Smart Savings\" to help depositors effectively protect their deposits, and a cooling off period for unsecured consumer credit products to reduce the risk of impulsive and excessive borrowing. In addition, the Banking Authority provides guidance to banks on the use of AI in customer-facing services, and provides a variety of payment arrangements to work closely with the industry on second-hand property transactions. The Banking Authority also issued guidance on digital asset-related activities, optimizing the \"cross-border wallet\" business pilot, and simplifying the sales and insurance procedures for investment products, improving customer experience, and ensuring that investors are protected.\n\nThe Bank plays a key role in Hong Kong's anti-money laundering and terrorist financing system. By increasing the speed and number of information exchanges through the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Task Force, the number of information-driven suspicious transaction reports increased by 303% compared to 2023, which contributed to a 34% increase in the profits of crime that was frozen or disclosed. The consultation on promoting the sharing of bank information to help detect and prevent financial crimes was widely supported. The Bank provided guidance in April based on the results of its own review of the transaction monitoring system, and in September launched a plan to promote the use of AI to monitor suspicious activities in the industry.\n\nHong Kong has made good progress in implementing international regulatory standards, including capital adequacy and disclosure. The Hong Kong Deposit Guarantee Board has streamlined several areas of the deposit guarantee scheme to enhance the protection of depositors.\n\nIn order to ensure the credibility of the settlement mechanism, the KIM has implemented settlement standards, which require banks to renew financial contracts with counterparties, reducing the risk of early termination in the settlement. In addition, the KIM has made significant progress in developing the preferential settlement strategy of banks, addressing the barriers to the viability of the settlement to ensure sufficient financial resources and the continuity of operations in the settlement, and improving the ability to execute the settlement.\n\n# Goals\n\nOne of the objectives of the MRA is to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. To achieve this goal, it is essential to establish and maintain a highly resilient financial system that can provide the critical financial services needed by the Hong Kong economy.\n\nThe stability of the financial system may be affected by the way banks operate, or in extreme cases by disorderly failures. As a regulatory authority, the Financial Supervisory Authority plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability and ensuring that banks are able to withstand shocks and respond to crises, ultimately helping to prevent failures. The Financial Supervisory Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks, as well as licensed banks, limited-licensed banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong (the \"Licensed Entities\").\n\nHong Kong's prudential regulation system is not designed to ensure \"zero risk\". In fact, as a regulatory authority, the Financial Supervisory Authority seeks to ensure that once an authorized institution is no longer viable, it can be orderly handled. To this end, Hong Kong has established a financial institution resolution mechanism, under which the Financial Supervisory Authority is the authority for the resolution of authorized institutions. To implement the Hong Kong resolution mechanism, we have the necessary regulations and policy standards for the development of the necessary resolution rules and policies, the development of the resolution plan to eliminate viable obstacles to the resolution of authorized institutions, and the establishment of the operational capacity of the Gold Regulatory Authority to deal with the approval of institutions that are about to be overturned.\n\nThe Financial Supervisory Authority is also responsible for designating and overseeing certain financial market infrastructures. The purpose of the Financial Supervisory Authority overseeing financial market infrastructures is to promote overall security and efficiency, reduce systemic risk associated with infrastructure, and increase transparency. The purpose of the Financial Supervisory Authority is to improve the seismic resistance of financial market infrastructures in the face of financial crises, and to safeguard the stability of Hong Kong's monetary and financial system, avoiding disruption to financial market infrastructure.\n\n#2024 looking back\n\n# License issue\n\nIn July, the NRA granted a banking license to a bank incorporated in Hong Kong and a bank incorporated outside Hong Kong. The NRA also approved a dealer agent outside Hong Kong to act as a money broker. In addition, the NRA revoked the license of three licensed banks, a bank with limited license and a deposit-taking company.\n\nFor more information on the authorised agencies and local representative offices in Hong Kong, see the Appendix and Tables D to F on pages 311 to 314 and 320 to 323.\n\n# Check the three-tier system of banks\n\nIn 2024, the Gold Authority completed a public consultation on simplifying the banking system from tier three to tier two. Respondents generally supported the simplification recommendations. Taking into account the comments received, the Gold Authority recommended several new key points to streamline the transition process and reduce the impact on existing customers of deposit-taking companies.\n\n# The name of the virtual bank\n\nIn addition, the KIM completed a public consultation on the \"Virtual Bank\" and the \"Digital Bank\". The proposal received widespread support, and the KIM revised the regulatory guidelines for digital banks in October, with the recommendation coming into effect.\n\n#Digital Banking is being reviewed\n\nAnother work completed in 2024 was the comprehensive review of digital banks, which was published in August. The review showed that the development of digital banks has so far achieved the three policy objectives of introducing digital banks in Hong Kong, namely to promote financial technology and innovation, to provide new customer experiences, and to promote universal finance. In the context of the diversified development of digital banks and traditional banks, the Financial Supervisory Authority considers the current number of digital banking licenses to be adequate, and it is not necessary to introduce more new digital banking participants in the market at this stage.\n\n# Banking license fee review\n\nThe FCA completed its review of the license fee in the year and raised the fee level in June.\n\n# Hong Kong's corporate registration system is a mess\n\nThe CBA provides support to the Government in the legislative process for the introduction of the Company Transfer Scheme in Hong Kong, including assistance in the revision of the Banking Regulation and its subsidiary laws and other laws related to the CBA.\n\n# Overview of the work of the regulator\n\nThe Board conducted 174 off-site audits during the year, covering a wide range of issues, including CAMEL assessment, corporate governance and risk management of accredited institutions. To continue strengthening the level of risk management of accredited institutions, the Board of Governors of the Accredited Institutions, the Independent Non-Executive Directors or the Board of Governors of the Accredited Institutions held 36 meetings with the Board of Directors of the Accredited Institutions, the Independent Non-Executive Directors or the Board of Directors of the Accredited Institutions, and the Board of Governors of the Accredited Institutions held 38 meetings with the Accredited Institutions and their external auditors.\n\nThe Bank is also stepping up its oversight of the climate risk management of its licensors to improve their ability to respond to climate change. The Bank's work in maintaining financial stability and promoting stable economic growth in a context of uncertain global economic conditions has been recognized by the Asian Banker magazine as the \"Best Macroeconomic Regulator in Asia Pacific\".\n\nMs. Julie Yang, Assistant President (Banking Supervision) of the Bank of China, on behalf of the Bank of China, received the \"Best Macroeconomic Supervisory Institution in the Asia-Pacific Region\" award from the Asian Banker's Journal.\n\nIn terms of regulatory oversight, the CMA conducts on-site audits of the securities, investment products, trusts, insurance and mandatory deposit (forced deposit) related activities of the accredited institutions, as well as consumer protection issues, and conducts specialised assessments as a complement to review new projects or areas assessed as being of higher risk.\n\nTable 1 provides an overview of the regulatory work of the Gold Authority in 2024.\n\nTable 1 Summary of supervisory work\n\na. External oversight efforts focused on operational stability include a Gold Regulatory Authority investigation and self-assessment by the accrediting agencies to review implementation progress and identify areas for strengthening, and extensive outreach activities at the bilateral and industry levels on framework development and practices. b. In addition, oversight efforts focus on evaluating the accrediting agencies' policies and approaches to the approval of specific credit unions and ongoing risk management, such as loans to commercial real estate and small and medium-sized enterprises. c. Including consultations with accredited agencies to review the status of the GS-1 \"Climate Risk Management\" policy unit in the Gold Regulatory Authority's Supervisory Manual.\n\n# Credit risk\n\n#Credit growth and asset quality\n\nTotal loans decreased by 2.8% in 2024 and 3.6% in 2023. Table 2 shows the growth of various types of loans and deposits. Total loans related to the country decreased by 8.7% to HK$38.59 billion in 2024, as compared to HK$3.6 billion in 2023.\n\nWith interest rates still high, debt problems of some inland real estate developers not fully eased, and weakness in the local commercial real estate market, the FSA will continue to closely monitor the asset quality of accredited institutions and assess their credit risk management practices in 2024. The asset quality of the banking system continues to face pressure during the year, but the risk situation remains manageable.

{"zh": "# 儲備管理\n\n2024年環球金融市場表現大致良好。主要經濟體錄得穩定增長，而通脹亦回落至更接近政策目標的水平。多個主要央行陸續下調政策利率，有利投資環境。2024年全年計，外匯基金錄得2,188億港元的投資收入，投資回報率為5.2%。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》，外匯基金的首要目的是直接或間接影響港元匯價，亦可運用於保持香港貨幣及金融體系穩定健全，藉此保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。金管局根據財政司司長轉授的權力及轉授權力的條款，就外匯基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標及組合架構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會為外匯基金制定下列投資目標：\n\n(i) 保障資本；\n(ii) 確保整體貨幣基礎在任何時候都由流通性極高的美元資產提供十足支持；\n(iii) 確保流動資金足以維持貨幣及金融穩定；以及\n(iv) 在符合上述(i)至(iii)項的前提下盡量爭取投資回報，以保障外匯基金的長期購買力。\n\n以上目標全面顧及外匯基金的法定目的，並已於外匯基金的組合架構及目標資產配置中反映（圖示1）。\n\n圖示1 外匯基金的投資組合類別\n\n外匯基金大致上分成兩個主要組合：支持組合及投資組合。支持組合持有流通性極高的美元資產，按照貨幣發行局制度的規定為貨幣基礎提供十足支持。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員經濟體的債市及股市，以保障資產的價值及長期購買力。\n\n為能更妥善管理風險及提高中長期回報，金管局以審慎及循序漸進方式將外匯基金的部分資產配置於較多元化的資產類別，包括新興巿場及內地債券與股票、私募股權（包括基建）及房地產。新興巿場及內地債券與股票由投資組合持有，私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合持有。長期增長組合的目標資產配置與其他資產類別的配置，按審慎的風險管理原則及資產組合多元化策略一起制定。\n\n策略性資產組合於2007年設立，一直持有政府基於策略性目的而為外匯基金帳目購入的香港交易及結算所有限公司股份。由於這個組合性質獨特，因此外匯基金的投資表現評估並無將其包括在內。\n\n# 於外匯基金的存款\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定組織的存款，利率一般與投資組合的表現掛鈎，但未來基金屬主要個別例子，其存款的利率與投資組合及長期增長組合的回報掛鈎，利率視乎實際資產配置而定。於2024年，投資組合與長期增長組合在未來基金的目標資產配置約為35：65。\n\n# 投資程序\n\n外匯基金的投資程序分別以策略性資產配置及戰略性資產配置作基礎。策略性資產配置以投資基準方式反映，亦即外匯基金為達到投資目標而可作出的長線資產配置。外匯基金以策略性配置作為指引，透過戰略性的資產配置，以爭取超越基準的回報。因此，實際配置往往會與基準配置（亦即策略性配置）有所偏離，而實際與基準配置之間的差距稱為「戰略性偏離」。財政司司長經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後制定投資基準及循跡誤差限額，金管局獲授權決定戰略性資產配置及定出戰略性偏離的容許範圍。投資組合經理可在戰略性偏離的容許範圍內管理倉盤，從短期市場變化中獲利。\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局的外匯基金投資辦公室專責外匯基金的投資及相關風險管理職能。該辦公室職員負責直接管理外匯基金約70%的投資，包括整個支持組合及部分投資組合。該部分內部管理的投資組合包括環球定息市場投資，並透過不同的衍生工具執行外匯基金的宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 外聘投資經理\n\n除透過內部職員管理資產外，金管局亦僱用外聘投資經理負責管理外匯基金約30%的資產，包括所有上市股票組合及其他特別資產類別。僱用外聘投資經理的目的是要運用市場上最佳的專業投資專才為外匯基金投資，獲取可持續回報，並讓外匯基金受惠於多元化及互補的投資方式，以及汲取外聘投資經理的市場心得與專門的投資知識。\n\n僱用外聘投資經理的相關支出包括基金管理與託管費、交易費、預扣稅及其他稅項。這些支出主要受市場因素影響而每年不同。\n\n# 風險管理及監察\n\n投資環境越趨複雜，穩健的風險管理更見重要。金管局為內部及外聘投資經理所管理的投資組合均訂下嚴格管控措施及投資指引，並設立嚴謹的風險監察及合規制度。金管局為投資相關活動設有三重防線，以實施有效的風險管理及管治。金管局定期監察主要投資風險類別（包括信用、市場、流動性及業務操作風險），並設置風險管理程序，為策略性規劃及多元化投資工作提供穩健的框架。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n金管局相信適度強調負責任投資及投資的可持續長期表現，可更有效達致外匯基金的投資目標，並且減低投資活動涉及的環境、社會及管治(ESG)相關風險。為積極支持負責任投資，金管局已將ESG因素融入外匯基金的投資管理過程中，其指導性原則是：當ESG投資與其他投資項目的經風險調整長期收益相若時，一般會優先考慮ESG投資。有關金管局在負責任投資方面的工作，詳見《二零二四年可持續發展報告》之「負責任投資」一章。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2024年的金融市場\n\n2024年環球金融市場表現大致良好。\n\n主要股票市場於2024年升幅顯著，當中美國股市在經濟和通脹基調大致向好和人工智能熱潮背景下，首三季升幅尤其突出。不過第4季市況因憂慮通脹升溫及債息上升等而變得波動並從高位回落，投資者亦轉趨審慎。內地和香港股市方面，受惠於中央在第3季出台的一系列刺激經濟和股市的政策措施，投資者信心有所好轉。然而市場認為實體經濟增長依然不明朗的情況下，兩地股市於第4季回軟。\n\n環球債券市場在2024年的表現亦有較大波動。儘管主要央行大致確立減息的大方向，但減息的節奏和幅度年內出現多次轉變。及至第4季，市場開始注視美國2025年的財政政策，美國國債收益率季內大幅上升，債價受壓。\n\n貨幣市場方面，美元兌其他主要貨幣於2024年，特別是第4季，因為息口走勢和美國經濟表現相對強勁而走強。\n\n表1列載主要貨幣、債巿及股市在2024年的表現。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n外匯基金在2024年錄得2,188億港元的投資收入，其中包括：\n\n- 債券投資收益1,359億港元；\n- 股票投資收益909億港元（其中香港股票投資收益218億港元，其他股票的投資收益691億港元）；\n- 非港元資產外匯估值下調356億港元；及\n- 外匯基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資收益276億港元。\n\n另一方面，策略性資產組合錄得28億港元估值收益。\n\n於2024年底，外匯基金的資產總值達40,810億港元。長期增長組合投資的總市值為5,412億港元，其中私募股權為4,348億港元，房地產為1,064億港元。長期增長組合中已承擔但尚未提取作投資的總額為2,886億港元。\n\n外匯基金（不包括策略性資產組合）在2024年的投資回報率為5.2%，其中投資組合的回報率為7.2%，支持組合為4.1%。長期增長組合自2009年開展投資以來的年率化內部回報率為11.2%。\n\n圖1列明外匯基金由1994至2024年的年度回報率。表2顯示外匯基金在2024年的投資回報率及不同年期的平均投資回報率。外匯基金在2022至2024年的平均回報率為2.0%、2020至2024年為3.1%、2015至2024年為3.1%，以及自1994年起計為4.5%。表3列載外匯基金資產於2024年12月31日的貨幣比重。詳情參閱第203至309頁外匯基金的經審計2024年度財務報表。\n\n圖1 外匯基金投資回報率（1994至2024年）", "en": "# Reserves management\n\nGlobal financial markets generally performed well in 2024. The major economies recorded stable growth, while inflation also fell to levels closer to policy targets. Several major central banks continued to lower policy rates, creating a favorable investment environment. For the full year 2024, the foreign exchange fund recorded investment income of HK$218.8 billion, with an investment return of 5.2%.\n\n# The Outdoor Fund\n\nAccording to the Bank's Overseas Investment Fund Regulations, the primary purpose of the Overseas Investment Fund is to directly or indirectly influence the appreciation of the HKD, and it can also be used to maintain the stability and soundness of the monetary and financial system in Hong Kong, thereby maintaining Hong Kong's status as an international financial center. The Gold Authority is responsible to the Finance Minister for the operation of the Overseas Investment Fund and the management of investments, in accordance with the terms of the delegated powers and delegated powers of the Director of Finance.\n\n# Managing the foreign exchange fund\n\n# Investment goals and syndicate structure\n\nThe following investment objectives have been set by the OTC Advisory Board for the OTC Fund:\n\n(i) the safeguarding of capital; (ii) ensuring that the overall monetary base is adequately supported at all times by highly liquid dollar assets; (iii) ensuring that there is sufficient liquidity to maintain monetary and financial stability; and (iv) seeking the best return on investment to safeguard the long-term purchasing power of the hedge fund, subject to (i) to (iii) above.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the legal purpose of the shell fund and are reflected in the combined structure and target asset allocation of the shell fund (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 Investment groups of hedge funds\n\nThe foreign exchange funds are broadly divided into two main groups: support groups and investment groups. Support groups hold highly liquid dollar assets and provide adequate support on a currency basis as defined by the monetary authority system. Investment groups invest primarily in the bond and stock markets of the member economies of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to secure the value of the assets and their long-term purchasing power.\n\nIn order to better manage risk and improve medium-term returns, the Gold Authority has allocated some of the assets of the hedge fund in a prudent and gradual manner to more diversified asset classes, including emerging market and inland bonds and stocks, private equity (including infrastructure) and real estate. Emerging market and inland bonds and stocks are held by investment groups, while private equity and real estate investments are held by long-term growth groups. The target asset allocation of long-term growth groups is developed along with the allocation of other asset classes in accordance with the principles of prudent risk management and the diversification strategy of the asset group.\n\nThe Strategic Asset Group was established in 2007 and has been holding Hong Kong trading and settlement ownership shares of companies acquired by the government for the account of the shell fund for strategic purposes. Due to the unique nature of the group, the investment performance assessment of the shell fund does not include it.\n\n# Deposits to the shell fund\n\nVC funds sometimes accept deposits from fiscal reserves, government funds, and legal entities. The interest rate is generally pegged to the performance of the investment group, but the main exception is the future fund, whose interest rate on deposits is pegged to the return of the investment group and the long-term growth group, the interest rate depending on the actual asset allocation. In 2024, the investment group and the long-term growth group have a target asset allocation of about 35:65 in the future fund.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment procedures of the hedge fund are based on strategic asset allocation and strategic asset allocation respectively. Strategic asset allocation reflects the investment criteria, i.e. the long-term asset allocation that the hedge fund can make to achieve the investment goal. The hedge fund uses strategic allocation as a guide, through strategic asset allocation, to compete for the return of exceeding the standards. Therefore, the actual allocation tends to be deviated from the standard allocation (also called strategic allocation), and the difference between the actual and standard allocation is called \"strategic deviation\".\n\n# Direct investment\n\nThe Office of the IMF's Investment in Hedge Funds (OIF) is responsible for the investment and risk management functions of hedge funds. The staff of the office is responsible for directly managing approximately 70% of the investment in hedge funds, including the entire support group and some investment groups. The internally managed investment group includes investments in the global fixed income markets and implements the macro risk management strategy of the hedge fund through various derivatives.\n\n# Outsourcing investment managers\n\nIn addition to managing the assets through internal staff, the CMA also employs externally hired investment managers who are responsible for managing approximately 30% of the assets of the shell fund, including all listed stock combinations and other special asset classes. The purpose of hiring an externally hired investment manager is to use the best professional investment professionals in the market for investment in the shell fund, to obtain sustainable returns, and to allow the shell fund to benefit from diversified and complementary investment methods, as well as to draw on the market attention and specialized investment knowledge of the externally hired investment manager.\n\nThe associated expenses of hiring an outsourced investment manager include the management and custody fees, transaction fees, withholding taxes and other taxes. These expenses vary from year to year, mainly due to market factors.\n\n# Risk management and surveillance\n\nThe investment environment is becoming more complex and robust risk management is more important. The IORP has strict regulatory and investment guidelines for investment groups managed by internal and external investment managers, and has established a strict risk supervision and compliance system. The IORP has a triple line of defense for investment-related activities to implement effective risk management and governance. The IORP regularly monitors the main categories of investment risks (including credit market flow, mobility and operational risk), and establishes risk management procedures to provide a robust framework for strategic planning and diversified investment work.\n\n#Responsible investing\n\nThe Bank believes that a moderate emphasis on responsible investment and sustainable long-term performance of investments can more effectively achieve the investment objectives of the hedge fund and reduce the environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks associated with investment activities. In order to actively support responsible investment, the Bank has integrated ESG factors into the investment management process of the hedge fund. Its guiding principle is that ESG investments are generally prioritized when adjusting the long-term returns of ESG investments to the operational risks of other investment projects.\n\n# Performance of the foreign exchange fund\n\n# Financial markets in 2024\n\nGlobal financial markets are performing well in 2024.\n\nThe main stock markets rose significantly in 2024, with the US stock market rising in the first three quarters against the background of a generally positive economic and monetary base and the AI craze. However, the fourth quarter market conditions became volatile and fell back from highs due to concerns about the warming of the inflation and rising debt rates, and investors also turned cautious.\n\nThe global bond market also showed significant volatility in 2024. Although the major central banks have largely established the direction of interest rate cuts, the pace and magnitude of the cuts have changed several times over the years. And by Q4, the market began to look at the fiscal policy of the United States in 2025.\n\nIn the money market, the US dollar outperformed other major currencies in 2024, especially in Q4, due to the relative strength of the Fed and the US economy.\n\nTable 1 shows the performance of major currencies, bonds and equities in 2024.\n\n# Performance of the foreign exchange fund\n\nThe foreign investment fund recorded HK$218.8 billion in investment income in 2024, including:\n\n- bond investment income of HK$135.9 billion; - equity investment income of HK$90.9 billion (including HK$21.8 billion in equity investment income and HK$69.1 billion in other equity investment income); - non-HKD asset hedge valuation of HK$35.6 billion; and - other investment income of HK$27.6 billion held by affiliates of the hedge fund investment holding company.\n\nOn the other hand, strategic asset groups recorded a valuation gain of HK$2.8 billion.\n\nAt the end of 2024, the total assets of the hedge fund were HK$40.81 billion. The total market value of the long-term growth portfolio was HK$541.2 billion, of which private equity was HK$434.8 billion and real estate was HK$106.4 billion. The total amount of HK$288.6 billion of the long-term growth portfolio was underwritten but not yet drawn as investments.\n\nThe return on equity (excluding strategic asset groups) for the venture capital fund in 2024 was 5.2%, with 7.2% for the investment group and 4.1% for the support group. The long-term growth group has an annualized internal return of 11.2% since its investment in 2009.\n\nTable 1 shows the annual return of the hedge fund from 1994 to 2024. Table 2 shows the return on investment of the hedge fund in 2024 and the average return on investment for different years. The average return on investment of the hedge fund is 2.0% for 2022 to 2024, 3.1% for 2020 to 2024, 3.1% for 2015 to 2024, and 4.5% for each year since 1994.

Financial statements of the Fund for External Aid\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit\n\n#Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government to review the implementation of the project\n\n# Independent auditor reports to finance minister\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the shell fund and its subsidiary (\"Group\") as set out on pages 209 to 309, which include the statement of assets and liabilities of the shell fund and the Group as at 31 December 2024, the balance sheet for the year ending on that date, the comprehensive income statement, the statement of changes in equity and cash flows, and the notes to the financial statements, including material accounting policies.\n\nI consider that the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Hong Kong Accounting Standards for Financial Reporting issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Chartered Accountants and have faithfully reflected the financial position of the Fund and the Group as of 31 December 2024, the financial performance and cash flows for the year ended that date, and have been prepared in accordance with the instructions issued by the Executive Director under Article 7 of the Fund Regulations.\n\n# Based on opinion\n\nI have conducted my audit in accordance with the instructions of the Executive Director under Section 7 of the Shell Fund Regulations and the Audit Bureau's audit standards. My responsibilities under these standards are set out in the section \"Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of financial statements\" of this report. I am independent of the Group and have fulfilled other ethical responsibilities under these standards. I believe that the audit certificates I have obtained provide an adequate and appropriate basis for my audit opinion.\n\n# Key accounting issues\n\nThe critical audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, are of the greatest importance to the audit of the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024. I have dealt with these matters in the course of auditing and forming opinions on the financial statements as a whole, and I do not provide separate opinions on these matters.\n\n# Valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value\n\nPlease refer to the financial statements annexes 2.5, 2.6 and 37.1.\n\nThe Group has a total of HK$39.151.17 billion in financial assets and HK$13.862.99 billion in financial liabilities at fair value through December 31, 2024.\n\n86% of the fair value of such financial assets and all such financial liabilities are quoted in an active market for the same asset or liability (Tier 1 parameter) or are estimated using a valuation method, whereas the parameters used are based on observable market data (Tier 2 parameter).\n\nThe remaining 14% of the fair value of these financial assets is estimated by the valuation method, and the parameters used are not based on observable market data (the \"Tier 3\" parameters). The total value of the financial assets is HK$5,522.51 billion, mainly including non-listed investment funds.\n\nIn view of the large amount involved and the estimates involved, the valuation of gold loans and financial liabilities booked at fair value is a critical matter for accounting purposes.\n\nThe audit procedures for the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value include:\n\n- Understanding of the valuation procedures for different categories of financial assets and financial liabilities, including the relevant supervisory measures;\n\n- To evaluate and test surveillance measures, including those related to applications of computer systems;\n\n- Certificates of valuation, existence, rights and liabilities and integrity of financial assets and financial liabilities;\n\n- If using market quotes, verify prices from independent sources;\n\n- If the parameters of the valuation method used are based on observable market data, an assessment of the appropriateness of the valuation method and the reasonableness of the relevant assumptions, and verification of the parameters against independent sources; and\n\n- If the parameters of the valuation method used are not based on observable market data, an assessment of the appropriateness of the valuation method and the reasonableness of the assumptions and parameters involved.\n\n#Valuation of investment properties at fair value through profit\n\nPlease see the financial statements appendices 2.11 and 17.\n\nThe Group's investment properties are listed at fair value, with a total value of HK$21132 million as at 31 December 2024. The Group also has interests in affiliates and joint ventures, whose main business is holding overseas investment properties. Whether owned directly by the Group or by affiliates or joint ventures, the fair value of such investment properties is primarily based on the valuation of independent professional valuers. Such valuation involves significant judgments and estimates, including the valuation methods and assumptions used.\n\nThe audit process for valuing investment property at fair value includes:\n\n- Obtain and review valuation reports on investment property owned directly by the group or owned by associates or joint ventures and verify that the fair value is determined on the basis of the valuation reports listed in the relevant valuation reports;\n\n- Assess the independence and qualifications of the appraiser; and\n\n- whether the valuation method is appropriate and whether the assumptions and parameters are reasonable\n\n# Other\n\nThe Financial Controller is responsible for all other information. Other information includes all information contained in the Financial Controller's Annual Report for 2024, but does not include the financial statements and my auditor's report.\n\nI am not making any kind of expert opinion on the other material.\n\nWhereas, in the context of an audit of the financial statements, I am responsible for reading other material and thereby considering whether there is a material inconsistency with the financial statements or with the circumstances of which I became aware in the course of the audit, or whether there appears to be a material misstatement. Based on the work that I have performed, I am required to report the fact that if I believe that there is a material misstatement in other material. In this regard, I have no report.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Audit Committee under the Financial Management Committee and the OTC Advisory Committee\n\nThe financial controller shall be responsible for preparing the financial statements of the Bank of China in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Accounting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Chartered Accountants and the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under Article 7 of the Regulations of the Hong Kong Overseas Fund, and for implementing the internal controls he deems necessary to ensure that the financial statements do not contain material misstatements caused by fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing financial statements, the financial manager shall be responsible for assessing the Group's ability to operate in a sustainable manner and, where applicable, for disclosing matters related to sustainable operation and taking account of sustainable operation as a basis for accounting.\n\nThe Audit Committee, under the auspices of the Advisory Committee of the Overseas Fund, is responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process of the group.\n\n# The responsibilities of auditors in auditing financial statements\n\nMy objective is to obtain reasonable assurance that there are no material misstatements in the overall financial statements that result from fraud or error and to issue an auditor's report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but it is not guaranteed that an audit conducted in accordance with the audit standards of the Audit Bureau of Circulations will reveal any material misstatements that exist. Misstatements can be caused by fraud or error and are considered to be material misstatements if it is reasonably expected that, individually or in aggregate, they could affect the economic decisions made by users of the financial statements.\n\nI will use professional judgment and professional scepticism in the course of my audit under the Audit Bureau's audit standards. I will also:\n\n- Identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements resulting from fraud or error; designing and implementing audit procedures to address those risks; and obtaining adequate and appropriate audit certificates as the basis for my opinion. The risk of failure to detect fraud resulting in material misstatement is higher than the risk of failure to detect error resulting from fraud, as fraud may involve conspiracy, forgery, intentional omissions, false statements or overstepping internal controls;\n\n- to understand the internal controls related to auditing in order to design appropriate audit procedures. However, this is not intended to be an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal controls of the group;\n\n- To assess the appropriateness of the accounting policies adopted by the financial controller and the reasonableness of the accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the financial controller;\n\n- if the financial controller considers that the accounting basis for the continuing operations is appropriate and, on the basis of the audit certificates obtained, that there are significant uncertainties relating to events or circumstances that may create significant doubt as to the ability of the group to continue operations. If I consider that there are significant uncertainties, it is necessary to ask the user to pay attention to the disclosure of the relevant information in the financial statements in the auditor's report. If the relevant information is insufficient, I shall be required to issue an auditor's report without reservation. My conclusions are based on the audit certificates obtained as of the date of the auditor's report. However, future events or circumstances may lead to the group not being able to continue operations;\n\n- To evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including disclosures, and whether the financial statements accurately reflect transactions and matters; and\n\n- Plan and conduct group audits to obtain adequate and appropriate audit certificates on the financial information of the group entity or business unit as a basis for forming an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for directing, supervising and reviewing the audit work performed for the purpose of conducting the group audit. I assume full responsibility for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the audit committee under the advisory board of the hedge fund the scope and timing of the audit plan and the significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal controls that I identify during the audit.\n\nI will also make a statement to the Audit Committee under the auspices of the Advisory Committee on Outer Banks that I have met the relevant ethical requirements for independence and communicate to them all relationships and other matters that are reasonably believed to affect my independence and, where applicable, the relevant safeguards.\n\nFrom my communications with the audit committee under the advisory committee of the OTC Funds, I determine which matters are most important to the audit of the financial statements for the current period and therefore constitute critical audit matters. I describe these matters in the auditor's report unless the law or regulation does not permit public disclosure of a matter, or in extremely rare circumstances where there is a reasonable expectation that the negative consequences of communicating a matter in my report will outweigh the public interest it generates and I decide not to communicate the matter in the report.\n\nThe fund is a non-profit organization that provides financial assistance to the poor and the needy.\n\n(All amounts are in millions of Hong Kong dollars unless otherwise noted.\n\n#1 Primary business\n\nThe Financial Management Officer is empowered by the Director of Finance to manage the Fund in accordance with the provisions of the Fund Regulations, Chapter 66, and the Fund's principal function is to safeguard the Hong Kong dollar's exchange rate and maintain the stability of the monetary and financial system of Hong Kong.\n\nThe assets of the fund are managed by four different groups: the support group, the investment group, the long-term growth group and the strategic asset group. Under the Hong Kong Monetary Authority system, the assets of the support group are fully matched to the monetary base. The investment group primarily invests in the bond and stock markets of the member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The long-term growth group holds private equity and real estate investments. The strategic asset group holds shares of Hong Kong limited companies that are included in the fund's books and are traded and settled in Hong Kong for the purposes of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government strategy."}

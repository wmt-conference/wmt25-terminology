{"zh": "2022年是迎難而上的一年。\n\n2022年伊始，全球經濟環境一片暗淡。新冠病毒變異株Omicron肆虐，令全球經濟增長繼續受壓，通脹壓力亦持續上升。其後俄羅斯與烏克蘭爆發衝突，進一步推高通脹壓力，導致各主要央行採取前置式貨幣緊縮政策，擴大環球金融市場的波動，並加劇經濟增長放緩的風險。本地方面，第五波疫情爆發，感染個案急速上升，亦進一步打擊經濟。同時，圍繞防疫措施與檢疫限制的負面報道，更令外界對香港產生誤解，威脅香港作為國際金融中心的聲譽。全年計，香港實質本地生產總值收縮了3.5%。\n\n儘管面對重重挑戰，金管局繼續致力保障香港貨幣與金融穩定，並於主要策略範疇推進多項有利發展的措施，進一步鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位。經歷3年的旅遊限制後，我們成功向國際社會展示香港已全面復常，旅客亦能再次親身訪港體驗。金管局在去年11月舉辦「國際金融領袖投資峰會」，來自世界各地的金融領袖親身來港出席。外界如此熱烈的反應，成為印證香港全面復常最好不過的證明。\n\n展望未來，外圍環境仍然充滿前所未有的不確定性。儘管如此，內地經濟重啟會為香港以至整個地區重新注入動力。金管局將繼續緊守崗位，履行維持香港貨幣與銀行體系穩定的職能，並積極尋求更多有利香港發展的機會，展現及提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。我們亦會繼續為提升全球氣候應變能力及可持續發展出力。今年除《二零二二年年報》外，我們會另外發表《二零二二年可持續發展報告》，以便更詳細地介紹金管局在提升香港作為綠色和可持續金融樞紐的地位所進行的各項工作，以及金管局作為負責任投資者及可持續機構所作出的努力。\n\n# 貨幣及金融體系：堅穩如昔\n\n聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）自1983年實施至今，歷經多個經濟周期，成功抵禦各種各樣的外來衝擊。2022年再次見證聯匯制度的抗震能力。在美國聯邦儲備局（聯儲局）大幅收緊貨幣政策下，弱方兌換保證於2022年5月至11月期間被觸發41次，金管局按照既定機制，以有序及具透明度的方式從市場買入合共2,421億港元。其間港元匯率及貨幣市場繼續運作暢順，反映聯匯制度穩健有效。\n\n這份對聯匯制度的信心，來自於建立多年的穩固根基。正如國際貨幣基金組織在其《2022年對外部門報告》中重申，聯匯制度的公信力建基於多項因素，包括具高透明度的運作規則、充裕的外匯儲備、審慎的財政制度、穩健的金融監管，以及靈活的經濟結構。\n\n我們深信除了穩健的機制外，致力與公眾及市場溝通以加深其對聯匯制度的了解、進行有效的市場監察，以及就不同情景作出應變計劃，均有助鞏固各界對聯匯制度的信心。我們就聯匯制度運作機制推出的社交媒體宣傳活動，有助在年內弱方兌換保證多次被觸發的情況下，有效維護市場對聯匯制度的信心。內部方面，金管局亦善用數據分析技術加強市場監察，讓我們能適時回應最新市場形勢。\n\n年內，儘管面對宏觀層面的挑戰以及遞增的信用風險，香港銀行體系仍然維持穩健，資本及流動性均非常充裕。2022年底，本地銀行的綜合總資本充足比率為20.1%，遠高於國際最低要求的8%。2022年第4季，大型銀行的流動性覆蓋比率稍升至162.3%，亦遠高於法定最低要求的100%。鑑於信貸環境面對挑戰，銀行體系的資產質素略為轉差，特定分類貸款比率於2022年底升至1.38%，但有關水平仍屬穩健，並低於2000年以來的長期平均水平1.8%。\n\n# 銀行體系：有效監管確保運作穩健\n\n疫情持續3年，來自各方面的挑戰均有所加劇，例如地緣政治緊張局勢升溫及主要央行收緊貨幣政策。然而，全賴多年來妥善的風險管理及有效的監管，香港銀行體系得以維持穩健，繼續發揮支持經濟的重要作用。\n\n過去一年面對的一項主要監管挑戰，是在第五波新冠疫情後經濟仍充滿不確定性之下，確保銀行繼續為客戶提供所需支援的同時，維持穩健的信用風險管理。「預先批核還息不還本」計劃進一步展期，並加入自願性部分本金還款選項，讓借款人可以選擇開始償還部分本金，協助客戶就最終回復正常還款作好準備。\n\n因應主要經濟體大幅收緊貨幣政策令市場波動加劇，2022年金管局另一項主要監管工作是加強監察銀行的市場及流動性風險承擔。我們深入評估各經濟體同步收緊貨幣政策對銀行可能產生的影響，並就壓力測試引入新情景，以評估銀行應對長時間流動性壓力的韌性。\n\n與此同時，我們繼續採取具前瞻性的措施，促進在多個範疇的有效風險管理。在運作穩健性及網絡防衛能力方面，我們提供指引協助銀行制定綜合及全面的運作架構，以達致穩健經營，並就銀行具體的運作範疇提供詳盡監管指引，例如因應雲端技術普及而就使用雲端運算提供指引。此外，因應數碼化加速發展，我們亦加強了應對「網絡釣魚」騙案和推進消費者及投資者保障的工作。\n\n除了維持銀行體系穩健外，金管局亦致力推動普及金融及提高銀行服務的便利性。銀行對於金管局就提供基本銀行服務的呼籲反應正面，有銀行在新發展地區的大型公共屋邨增設分行及自助銀行服務設施。受到疫情相關的旅遊限制影響，許多香港市民無法使用其內地銀行戶口。有見及此，金管局與有關各方緊密合作，協助重新啓動約50萬個內地銀行戶口，受影響戶口持有人無需親身前往內地辦理。\n\n另一個對銀行業持續發展具策略重要性的範疇是提升專業能力。為擴展業務，銀行業對專業人才的需求仍然龐大。金管局在其人才發展策略 — 「連接人才與未來」— 的基礎上，在過去一年推出多項措施，協助銀行業吸引、培育及挽留人才，集中提升及再培訓現有從業員的技能，以及培育年輕一代，以建立可持續的人才庫。\n\n# 國際金融中心：香港重回國際舞台!\n\n實施多時的疫情相關旅遊限制於2022年逐步撤銷，我們作出了多方面的努力讓香港重回國際舞台。11月舉行的「國際金融領袖投資峰會」吸引超過200位來自環球金融機構的國際及地區負責人親臨香港，並獲得全球各地的關注及熱切迴響。儘管峰會舉行日期不巧遇上50年來首個在11月份發出的8號颱風訊號，峰會仍然十分成功，向世界傳遞了香港已全面復常並正展現無比朝氣與活力的有力訊息。我們很高興看到峰會產生了正面的漣漪效應，不少環球金融機構及國際組織現正或計劃在香港舉辦各類活動。\n\n除吸引各地訪客重臨香港外，我和金管局的同事體會到面對面交流聯繫的重要性，因此盡可能親身代表香港出席主要國際會議，積極參與全球政策討論，並藉外訪機會與環球金融機構的集團管理層會面，加深他們對香港穩健的金融體系以及在「一國兩制」下香港提供的各種機遇的了解。\n\n為確保香港保持作為國際金融中心的競爭力，我們在金融科技、內地機遇，以及綠色和可持續金融等策略性重點領域不斷開拓市場新界限。我們亦進一步加強本港的金融平台，提供頂尖的服務，吸引更多企業落戶香港。有關金管局在綠色和可持續金融方面的工作詳情，請參閱《二零二二年可持續發展報告》。\n\n# 金融科技\n\n繼2021年6月公布「金融科技2025」策略，2022年我們在五大範疇均取得顯著進展。\n\n我們在「全面推展銀行數碼化」方面的工作取得理想成果。根據金融科技應用評估的結果，香港銀行業在不同業務領域廣泛採用金融科技，而且所採用的科技類別亦持續增加。我們自2017年以來逐步推廣及支持數碼化的工作獲銀行積極回應，並持續取得成果，成續令人鼓舞。我們將繼續與業界緊密合作，根據評估的結果，進一步推動金融科技在特定銀行業務領域的應用及促進個別科技類別的發展。\n\n年內我們在央行數碼貨幣方面的工作邁進重要的新里程。「多種央行數碼貨幣跨境網絡」(mBridge)項目進入試行階段，並成為全球其中一個率先為企業跨境交易進行真實結算的央行數碼貨幣項目。在零售層面，數字人民幣跨境使用的技術測試已進入第二階段，主要測試通過「轉數快」為數字人民幣錢包增值。數碼港元方面，我們將採取三軌道方式為將來可能發行數碼港元作好準備，並推出第二軌道先導計劃，邀請業界深入研究數碼港元可行的應用場景。\n\n數據可全面釋放金融科技的潛力。我們於去年10月推出的「商業數據通」正是提升香港數據基建的重要一步。作為以數據擁有人授權為本的共享數據基建，「商業數據通」能方便金融機構提取企業的商業數據，使企業（尤其中小型企業）更容易獲得融資。截至2022年底，「商業數據通」已促成超過1,000宗中小企貸款，總額逾19億港元。\n\n最後，我們在擁抱金融創新和它帶來的好處的同時，亦明白有必要監察及處理好相關發展可能帶來的風險。我們正密切注視虛擬資產領域的發展，並參與相關監管事宜的國際討論。經考慮公眾諮詢收集到的意見及相關國際標準後，我們將採納「相同風險，相同監管」1 的方式制定穩定幣的監管制度及界定其監管範圍。未來我們率先規管的對象將是那些標榜與一種或以上法定貨幣的價值掛鈎的穩定幣，因為這類穩定幣可能對貨幣及金融穩定帶來更高及更迫切的潛在風險。我們相信在訂立適當的規範下，業界將可更安全穩妥地開拓數碼金融的潛力。\n\n科技正重塑我們的未來。金管局與銀行業界正積極準備迎向這個「新常態」。我們有信心我們正構建的金融科技生態圈將有助全面釋放金融科技的潛力，並提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。\n\n# 內地機遇", "en": "2022 is a year of challenges.\n\nThe global economic environment was gloomy at the beginning of 2022. The new coronavirus variant Omicron raged, causing global economic growth to continue to be suppressed, and inflation pressure continued to rise. The conflict between Russia and Ukraine followed, further increasing inflation pressure, leading major central banks to adopt a forward-looking monetary tightening policy, expanding the volatility of global financial markets, and increasing the risk of slowing economic growth.\n\n\"Despite the challenges, the Kim Administration continues to work to safeguard Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability, and to promote various development measures within the main strategic framework, further consolidating Hong Kong's status as an international financial center. After three years of travel restrictions, we have succeeded in showing the international community that Hong Kong is fully restored, and visitors can again visit the Port of Xiong'an\".\n\nLooking ahead, the external environment remains full of unprecedented uncertainty. Nevertheless, the domestic economic revival will re-inject momentum for Hong Kong and the region as a whole. The CMA will continue to maintain its position, perform its functions to maintain the stability of Hong Kong's currency and banking system, and actively seek more opportunities for the development of Hong Kong, to demonstrate and enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong as an international financial center. We will also continue to improve global climate resilience and sustainable development efforts this year. In addition to the 2022 Annual Report, we will also publish the 2030 Sustainable Development Report to provide more details about the work that can be done by the CMA in promoting Hong Kong as a green and sustainable financial hub, and the continuous efforts of the CMA as a responsible investor and institution.\n\n#Money and the financial system: strong as ever\n\nThe system has been in place since 1983 and has successfully withstood a variety of external shocks. The seismic resistance of the system was further demonstrated in 2022. Under the US Federal Reserve's (Fed) tightening monetary policy, weak-side swap guarantees were triggered 41 times between May and November 2022, with the Gold Board buying a total of HK$2421 billion from the market in an orderly and transparent manner.\n\nThis confidence in the Fed is based on a solid foundation that has been built over many years. As the IMF reiterated in its 2022 Foreign Sector Report, the credibility of the Fed is based on a number of factors, including highly transparent operating rules, ample foreign reserves, a prudent fiscal system, sound financial regulation, and a flexible economic structure.\n\nWe believe that in addition to a robust mechanism, the commitment to communicate with the public and the market to deepen its understanding of the system of federation, effective market surveillance, and response plans for different scenarios, all contribute to strengthening the confidence in the system of federation.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, the liquidity coverage ratio of large banks rose slightly to 162.3%, well above the statutory minimum requirement of 100%. Due to the challenging credit environment, the asset quality of the banking system was slightly shifted, and the specific category loan ratio rose to 1.38% at the end of 2022, but the relevant level remained stable and below the long-term average of 1.8% since 2000\".\n\n#Banking: Effective supervision ensures sound operations\n\nThe pandemic has been ongoing for three years, and challenges from various quarters have intensified, such as heightened geopolitical tensions and monetary tightening by major central banks. However, due to years of proper risk management and effective regulation, Hong Kong's banking system has remained stable and continues to play an important role in supporting the economy.\n\nA major regulatory challenge over the past year has been ensuring that banks continue to provide the necessary support to their customers while maintaining robust credit risk management amid the uncertainty in the economy following the fifth wave of the coronavirus pandemic. The \"pre-approval of non-repayment of interest\" program has been further extended and a voluntary partial principal repayment option has been added, allowing borrowers to choose to begin repayment of part of the principal, helping customers to prepare for eventual recovery to normal repayment.\n\nAs the tightening of monetary policy in major economies has exacerbated market volatility, another major regulatory task for the IMF in 2022 is to strengthen the monitoring of banks' market and liquidity risk. We have conducted an in-depth assessment of the possible impact of simultaneous monetary policy tightening in major economies on banks, and introduced new scenarios for stress tests to assess banks' resilience to long-term liquidity pressures.\n\nWe are also taking forward-looking measures to promote effective risk management across a range of areas. In terms of operational stability and network defense capabilities, we are providing guidance to help banks develop a coherent and comprehensive operational architecture to achieve stable operations, and providing detailed regulatory guidance on the scope of the bank's operations, such as guidance on the use of cloud computing in response to the adoption of cloud technologies. In addition, we are accelerating the development of digitalization, and we are also intensifying our work on responding to \"cyber fishing\" scams and promoting consumer and investor protection.\n\nIn addition to maintaining the stability of the banking system, the KBA is also committed to promoting financial inclusion and improving the accessibility of banking services. In response to the KBA's call for the provision of basic banking services, the bank has added large public housing branches and self-service banking facilities in developing regions. Affected by the epidemic-related travel restrictions, many Hong Kong citizens are unable to use their local bank accounts.\n\nAnother area of strategic importance for the banking sector is the development of professional skills. The banking sector continues to have a high demand for professional talent to expand its operations. On the basis of its talent development strategy \"Connecting Talent to the Future\", the Gold Authority has introduced several measures in the past year to help the banking sector attract, develop and retain talent, focus on upgrading and retraining existing professionals, and train younger generations to build a sustainable talent pool.\n\nThe International Financial Centre: Hong Kong is back on the international stage!\n\nThe implementation of the multi-hour pandemic-related travel restrictions will be phased out in 2022, and we have made a multi-pronged effort to return Hong Kong to the international stage. The International Finance Leaders Investment Summit in November attracted more than 200 international and regional officials from global financial institutions to Hong Kong, and received attention and enthusiastic response from around the world. Despite the fact that the date coincided with the first Hurricane 8 warning in 50 years in November, the summit was a great success, sending a powerful message to the world that Hong Kong has fully recovered and is showing unparalleled vitality. We are pleased to see the positive impact of the summit, and many global financial institutions and international organizations are planning or holding events in Hong Kong.\n\nIn addition to attracting visitors from around the world to Hong Kong, my colleagues and I at the CBO see the importance of face-to-face contacts, so that we can represent Hong Kong as closely as possible at major international conferences, actively participate in global policy discussions, and deepen our understanding of Hong Kong's robust financial system and the opportunities it offers under the One Country, Two Systems approach by visiting the world's financial institutions to meet with their group management.\n\nTo ensure Hong Kong remains competitive as an international financial centre, we continue to push the boundaries of the market in areas of strategic focus such as fintech, local opportunities, and green and sustainable finance. We are also further strengthening Hong Kong's financial platform, providing top-notch services, and attracting more businesses to Hong Kong. For more details on the Bank's work on green and sustainable finance, please see the Hong Kong 2022 Sustainability Report.\n\n#Fintech\n\nFollowing the announcement of the Fintech 2025 Strategy in June 2021, we have made significant progress in all five areas in 2022.\n\nWe have achieved the desired results in our work on \"Comprehensive Banking Digitalization\". According to the results of the Fintech Application Assessment, the banking industry in Hong Kong has widely adopted financial technology in various business areas, and the technology categories adopted have been increasing. Our work to promote and support digitalization has been positively received by banks since 2017, and the results have been encouraging.\n\nDuring the year, our work on central bank digital currency reached an important new milestone. The \"multiple central bank digital currency cross-border network\" (mBridge) project entered the pilot stage and became one of the first central bank digital currency projects in the world to provide real settlement for cross-border transactions. At the retail level, the technical test for cross-border use of digital renminbi has entered the second stage, mainly through the \"transformation of digital\" into digital renminbi wallets.\n\nThe data unlocking the potential of financial technology is a key reason why the Commercial Data Hub, which we launched in October last year, is a major step in the development of Hong Kong's data infrastructure. The data-driven, authorized-to-share data infrastructure, the Commercial Data Hub, will facilitate financial institutions to extract business data from enterprises, making it easier for businesses (especially small businesses) to access finance.\n\nFinally, while embracing financial innovation and its benefits, we also understand the need to monitor and manage the risks associated with its development. We are closely following the development of the virtual asset space and are involved in international discussions on relevant regulatory issues. After taking into account the opinions gathered in public consultations and relevant international standards, we will adopt a \"same risk, same regulation\" approach to the development of a stablecoin regulatory system and the definition of its regulatory scope.\n\n\"Technology is reshaping our future. The KBA and the banking industry are actively preparing for this 'new normal.' We are confident that the fintech ecosystem we are building will help unlock the full potential of fintech and enhance Hong Kong's competitiveness as an international financial center\".\n\n# Opportunities in the interior"}

The labor market first shifted, then gradually improved, while inflation remained moderate. Benefitting from the mainland and comprehensive connections with Hong Kong, Hong Kong's economic growth is expected to recover from a low level in 2023.\n\nThe Hong Kong banking system continues to remain stable in 2022 with ample capital and liquidity and healthy asset quality.\n\n# Currency is stable\n\nAs the US tightened monetary policy, the weakening of the HKD and the weakening of the exchange rate guarantee were triggered several times during the year. However, the HKD currency and money market continued to function in an orderly and smooth manner, proving the stability and effectiveness of the pegged rate system time and again.\n\n# Reserves management\n\nThe investment environment in 2022 was volatile, with prices falling across multiple asset classes, and the OTC fund recorded an overall negative return of 4.5%, with a relatively modest loss compared to the performance of most MTFs in the market.\n\nThe IGA also continues to promote responsible investment and asset diversification. At the same time, the long-term growth syndicate has an internal rate of return of 12.6% per annum since its inception in 2009.\n\n# Banking is stable\n\nIn the face of increased volatility in financial markets, the KIM has strengthened its oversight of banks' credit and market risk management and worked closely with banks to enhance their operational stability and cyber defence capabilities in response to the continuing increase in cyber threats and the accelerating pace of digital transformation in the banking industry.\n\nThe KSA further introduced consumer safeguards for \"pay-as-you-go\" products and new property transfer payment arrangements. In addition, the KSA worked with other regulatory agencies to develop a virtual asset supervision architecture, and issued guidelines for distributed investment products and launched a new trust business supervision system. The \"credit information platform\" in the \"multiple credit information service agency\" model for personal credit information was also activated during the year.\n\nThe FSA continues to work with banks to enhance Hong Kong's anti-money laundering and terrorist financing (AML) ecosystem and strengthen the response to fraud, further promoting the application of data and technology through the AML Compliance Technology Lab series, and accelerating the pace of the FSA's adoption of regulatory technology for AML work.\n\nThe Bank has made good progress in implementing international regulatory standards such as capital adequacy standards and disclosure standards locally. The Bank also works with the banking industry to build a sustainable talent pool and improve the skills of practitioners for future development.\n\nIn order to ensure that Hong Kong has a credible resolution mechanism, the CMA has set new resolution standards, conducted regional crisis simulation exercises, and established a new layer of loss absorbing capacity resources in all local systemically important banks, setting important milestones for the development of the resolution mechanism.\n\nHong Kong's status as an international financial center is a matter of debate.\n\nThe success of the Global Finance Leaders Investment Summit has cemented Hong Kong's status as a global financial hub and generated positive feedback.\n\nThe currency swap agreement between the People's Bank of China and the HKMA was improved during the year, further cementing Hong Kong's position as the global hub for offshore RMB operations. The HKMA also worked with other regulators and stakeholders to prepare for the opening of \"interchange\", and the launch of a dual desk mechanism with RMB quoted shares trading in Hong Kong. It also worked to develop the debt instrument central settlement system into a major international central securities depository platform in Asia.\n\nWelcoming the progress made in strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong's financial platforms, including bond issuance, asset and wealth management, corporate finance centres, and green and sustainable finance,\n\nThe FSA also continued to implement the Fintech 2025 strategy to promote the adoption of financial technology in the financial industry and promote Hong Kong as a financial technology hub. The use of the Fintech Fast Payment System (\"Fast Transfer\") has steadily increased with the enhancement of its functionality.\n\n# Institutional work\n\nTo promote public awareness of the Bank's policies and activities through effective communication with society and the market through various channels.\n\nThe Secretary-General noted that the Kim Administration had carefully established a working group that emphasized agile adaptation and sustainable development, while maintaining strict fiscal discipline and enhancing information technology capabilities, responding to change and ensuring effective implementation of policies and measures."}

Recent banking pressures in the United States and Europe, and the collapse of individual US-based banks in March 2023, have had a chilling effect on global financial markets, and the major central banks are tightening monetary policy, which is likely to slow or reverse global economic growth in 2023. On the other hand, geopolitical tensions, and the continued threat of de-globalization, may continue to drag global trade and cause global financial markets to fluctuate from time to time. Nevertheless, Hong Kong's financial system, with its stable seismic capacity and abundant buoyancy built up over the years, is able to withstand adverse shocks.\n\nThe Ministry of Finance, in its statement, said that the Ministry of Finance attaches great importance to safeguarding monetary and financial stability. Looking ahead, the Ministry of Finance will remain vigilant in the face of an uncertain macroeconomic environment, seeking to identify emerging risks quickly and respond flexibly. At the same time, the Ministry of Finance will continue to seize opportunities and create policy space to further enhance Hong Kong's status as a major international financial center.\n\n# Financial system remains stable and sound\n\nThe outlook for the global economy remains subject to significant uncertainty. The HKMA will closely monitor developments, increase vigilance and guard against potential risks to maintain the stability and soundness of the financial system, which is a prerequisite for the continued provision of critical financial services and therefore vital to the smooth functioning of the Hong Kong economy.\n\n# Be alert to potential risks\n\nThe uncertainty surrounding the future of U.S. interest rates and the stresses in the banking system of advanced economies may pose downside risks to the growth prospects of major advanced economies in 2023. In addition, ongoing geopolitical risks may continue to drag on global trade and cause occasional volatility in global financial markets. However, Hong Kong's financial system, with its seismic and buffer capacity built up over the years, is well-equipped to withstand adverse shocks.\n\nThe Board will continue to closely monitor risks and vulnerabilities in the local and peripheral environment and take appropriate measures to maintain the stability of Hong Kong's monetary and financial system as required. The Board will also study matters affecting the Hong Kong economy and assess the potential risks associated with these matters.\n\n# Keeping the banking system stable\n\nThe banking environment is expected to remain challenging in 2023 due to the heightened geopolitical tensions and the significant interest rate hikes by major central banks to contain inflation. On the other hand, the rapid development of technology and digitalization is both risky and organic for the banking industry. In the face of a rapidly changing financial environment, the Banking Authority is committed to ensuring that banks are sufficiently resilient to shocks through continuous regulatory work. At the same time, the Banking Authority will also refer to international standards and best practices to continue strengthening and optimizing banking regulatory structures and policies.\n\n#Risk-based regulation focus\n\n#Credit, liquidity and market risk\n\nIn 2023, the NRA will continue to closely monitor the asset quality of accredited institutions, with a focus on the loan classification and reserve practices of accredited institutions, and the management of borrowers in poor financial condition. The NRA will also strengthen its oversight system and take active measures to ensure that the overall credit risk level of the banking system remains controllable.\n\nOn the other hand, the KIM will continue to monitor the business environment and maintain close communication with the banking and business community to prepare for the eventual exit from the \"pre-emption non-repayment\" program, while ensuring that customers who are temporarily in difficulty still receive adequate credit support.\n\nIn addition, in the face of an uncertain macroeconomic environment, the CMA will also strengthen the liquidity and market risk management of the regulatory accredited institutions in 2023.\n\n#Business operations and technology risk\n\nAs banks adopt technology more broadly in their operations, the NRA will work to improve the operational stability and network defence capabilities of the banking industry. Following the release of the new \"Operational Stability\" unit in the NRA's supervisory policy manual in May, the NRA will remain in close contact with the industry to review the progress of the accredited institutions in developing the operational stability framework. At the same time, the NRA will improve the network defence capabilities of the banking industry by continuing to monitor the problems identified by the accredited institutions in the \"Cyber Defence Evaluation Framework 2.0\" and by examining the progress of the accredited institutions in implementing the Stability Triple Database.\n\nAs the pace of digitization accelerates, other regulatory priorities of the KIM include strengthening the supervision of risk management of banks' third-party service providers and enhancing the data governance capabilities of the banking industry.\n\n# Fight against money laundering and terrorist financing\n\n\"Wei Zhonghong, \"Wei Zhong, \"Wei Zhong, \"Wei Zhong, \"Wei Zhong, \"Wei Zhong, \"Wei Zhong, \"Wei Zhong, \"Wei Zhong, \"Wei Zhong, \"Wei Zhong, \"Wei Zhong, \"Wei Zhong, \"Wei Zhong, \"Wei Zhong, \"Wei Zhong, \"Wei Zhong, \"Wei Zhong, \"Wei Zhong, \"Wei Zhong, \"Wei Zhong, \"Wei Zhong, \"Wei Zhong, \"Wei Zhong, \"Wei Zhong, \"Wei Zhong, \"Wei Zhong, \"Wei Zhong, \"Wei Zhong, \"Wei Zhong, \"Wei Zhong, \"Wei Zhong, \"Wei Zhong, \"Wei Zhong, \"Wei Zhong, \"Wei Zhong, \"Wei Zhong, \"Wei Zhong, \"Wei Zhong, \"W\",Wei Zhong Zhong, \"W\", \"Wang, \"Wang, \"Wang, \"Wang, \"Wang, \"Wang, \"Wei Zhong\", Zhong Zhong Zhong, \"Zhong\", Zhong Zhong Zhong Zhong\", Zhong Zhong Zhong Zhong\", \"Z\", \"Zhong Zhong Zhong Zhong\", \"Z\", \"Zhong Zhong Zhong Zhong Zhong\", \"Z\", \"Zhong Zhong Zhong Zhong\", \"Z\", \"Z\", \"Zhong Zhong Zhong Zhong Zhong Z\", \"Z\", \"Zhong Zhong Zhong Zhong Z\", \"Z\", \"Z\", \"Z\", \"Zhong Zhong Zhong Zhong Zhong Zhong Zhong Z\", \"Z\", \"Z\", \"Z\", \"Zhong Zhong Zhong Zhong Zhong Zhong Zhong Z\", \"Z\", \"Z\", \"Z\", \"Z\", \"Z\", \"Z\", \"Z\", \"Zhong Zhong Zhong Zhong Zhong Zhong Zhong Zhong Zhong Zhong Zhong Zhong Z\", \"Z\", \"Z\", \"Z\", \"Z\", \"Z\", \"Z\", \"Z\", \"Z\", \"Z\", \"Z\n\n# Wealth management business\n\nThe Ministry of Finance will strengthen on-site audits and off-site monitoring of the conduct of authorized institutions in terms of wealth management and sale of securities, mandatory public deposits (\"forced deposits\") and other investment and insurance products in 2023. The focus in 2023 will be on the \"Cross-border Money Flow\" program, digital distribution and advisory platform, virtual assets, environmental, social and governance (\"ESG\") investment products and long-term insurance products. The Ministry of Finance will refer to the latest market developments and international standards in the process.\n\nThe Authority will also liaise closely with other regulatory bodies and the banking community and provide guidance to accredited institutions as required on regulatory standards for the sale of investment, insurance and deposit products, including guidance on the provision of investment-related services for virtual assets. In this regard, the Authority will actively engage with relevant international organizations and work with governments and other financial regulatory bodies to develop a comprehensive framework for the regulation of virtual assets in order to promote the sustainable and responsible development of the virtual asset industry.\n\nAs the cross-border financial transaction is successfully launched, the KMRA will engage with industry and relevant regulatory bodies to streamline the program. In addition, the KMRA will work with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and industry to streamline the sales process for investment products (including those for senior investors), and to begin the trust business of new units and new operating codes approved by regulatory bodies in accordance with the relevant regulatory policy handbook.\n\n#Monitoring the financial market infrastructure\n\nThe aim of the SBA is to evaluate the infrastructure in accordance with the principles of the SBA Payment Systems and Profit Payment Instruments Regulations, the SBA Financial Market Infrastructure Principles, and the guidelines issued by the Payment and Financial Infrastructure Commission to promote the safety and efficiency of the financial market infrastructure under its supervision, as appropriate, with reference to the latest international standards. The SBA shall participate in the monitoring and evaluation plan of the SBA and the International Certification Authority for the implementation of the SBA Principles, and shall participate in the work of the International Standards Organization, and shall refer to international practices or strengthen its own oversight provisions in response to market and technological developments.\n\n# policy making\n\nThe Banking Authority will continue to strengthen and improve its banking regulatory framework and policies in line with international standards and best practices.\n\n# Basel standards to be implemented in Hong Kong\n\n# Capital standards\n\nThe Board of Directors shall further enhance the capital framework through the implementation of the standards issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the \"Basel Committee\") in recent years, including: - the Basel III Accord of December 2017: Final Plan for Post-Crisis Reforms (January 2019 (February 2019 revision) - the Capital Minimum for Market Risk (January 2019) - the Capital Minimum for Market Risk (January 2019) - the Capital Minimum for Market Risk (January 2019 revision) - the Capital Minimum for Market Risk (January 2019 revision) - the Capital Minimum for Market Risk (January 2019 revision) - the Capital Minimum for Market Risk (January 2020 revision) - the Capital Minimum for Market Risk (January 2021 revision) - the Capital Minimum for Market Risk (January 2021 revision) - the Capital Minimum for Market Risk (January 2021 revision) - the Capital Minimum for Market Risk (January 2021 revision) - the Capital Minimum for Market Risk (January 2021 revision) - the Capital Minimum for Market Risk (January 2021 revision) - the Capital Minimum for Risk (January 2021 revision) - the Capital Minimum for Risk (January 2021 revision) - the Capital Minimum for Risk (January 2021 revision) - the Capital Minimum for Risk (January 2021 revision) - the Capital Minimum for Risk (January 2021 revision) - the Capital Minimum for Risk (January 2021 revision) - the Capital Minimum for Risk (January 2021 revision) - the Capital Minimum for Risk (January 2021 revision) - the Capital Minimum for Risk (January 2021 revision) - the Minimum for the Financial Regulation (January 2021\n\n# Risking is taking limits\n\nThe Advisory Board's March 2023 recommendation to revise the Banking Regulation (Risk Limitation) framework for the advisory industry. The proposed revision is primarily in response to the implementation by the Advisory Board of the revised capital adequacy standards under the Basel III Final Reform Plan referred to above. The advisory document also includes other corresponding revisions made to the treatment of risks related to official entities under the Basel III Final Reform Plan.

The regulatory authorities are also preparing to implement the new and revised disclosure rules in Hong Kong, after the review of the Banking Industry Model Disclosure Rules (the \"Preliminary Disclosure Rules\") and the revised model disclosure and industry disclosure rules, and will be subject to the review process, and will be subject to the approval of the Capital Accounting Standards for Hong Kong by the Hong Kong Government, which will be held in Hong Kong on 23 May."}

The Directorate's President and its staff are all civil servants. The day-to-day operations of the Directorate are highly autonomous within the scope of the statutory powers granted or delegated to the Financial Management Commissioner.\n\nThe Director of Finance is responsible for determining Hong Kong's monetary policy objectives and monetary system: In a letter to the Financial Management Committee dated 25 June 2003, the Director of Finance clarified that the monetary policy objective of Hong Kong is to maintain monetary stability through the monetary board system, maintaining the HKD exchange rate at around 7.80 HKD to the dollar. The Financial Management Committee is responsible for determining the monetary policy objectives, including the relevant strategies, tools and methods of implementation, and for maintaining the stability and soundness of the Hong Kong monetary system.\n\nThe Director of the Department of Finance and Administration, assisted by the Director of the Office of Financial Affairs and Treasury, is responsible for the policies that maintain the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's financial system and maintain Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre. To implement these policies, the Financial Management Officer's duties include: - promoting the overall stability and effective functioning of the banking system; - cooperating with other relevant institutions and organizations to develop the debt market; - handling matters related to the issuance and circulation of legal tender and coin; - promoting the safety and efficiency of the financial system by developing the payment, settlement and exchange system, and, where appropriate, the operating system; and - cooperating with other relevant institutions and organizations to promote confidence in Hong Kong's monetary and financial system and implement appropriate market development measures to enhance the international competitiveness of Hong Kong's financial services.\n\nThe Director of Finance has control over the management of the Fund. The Financial Management Officer is responsible to the Director of Finance for the management and investment management of the Fund, subject to the authority of the Director of Finance.\n\n# Accountability and transparency\n\nThe KIM has maintained a high degree of autonomy in its day-to-day operations and in the approach it takes to implement government policy objectives, while maintaining a high degree of accountability and transparency.\n\nThe Board is committed to promoting monetary and banking stability, effectively managing official reserves, developing and overseeing a stable and diversified financial infrastructure, and thereby consolidating Hong Kong's position as an international financial centre and driving Hong Kong's economic development.\n\nTo be effective in its duties, the Gold Authority must earn the trust of the public. Therefore, the Gold Authority takes a rigorous attitude, fulfills its responsibility to explain its policies and work to the public, and tries to handle matters of social concern that involve the scope of the Gold Authority's duties. In particular, the Gold Authority clarifies in a timely manner through traditional and social media false information and rumors about the Gold Authority's policies.\n\nThe Financial Supervisory Authority is responsible to the public through the Director of Finance, and since its powers are defined by laws passed by the Legislative Assembly, the Financial Supervisory Authority is also responsible to the public through the Legislative Assembly. The Financial Supervisory Authority also understands that it has a broader responsibility to promote public awareness of the role and objectives of the Financial Supervisory Authority and to closely monitor the concerns of the public. The Financial Supervisory Authority is committed to improving transparency and maintaining an open policy in its day-to-day work and in its broader engagement with the public. The policy has two main objectives: to ensure that the financial community and the public are fully informed of the work of the Financial Supervisory Authority, taking into account market sensitivities, commercial secrets and confidential information, and to ensure that the Financial Supervisory Authority is aware of the social context and responds to public opinion.\n\nThe HKMA is committed to the highest international standards of transparency and broad media coverage, and publishes a variety of Chinese and English journals and periodicals. The HKMA's bilingual website (www.hkma.gov.hk) contains a dedicated section listing economic research, statistics, regulatory resources, consumer information and other topics, as well as a large number of publications, press releases, speeches and briefing materials published by the HKMA. The HKMA also uses social media platforms to communicate more effectively with the public in the digital age. The HKMA's offices have an information center, divided into two sections, a library and an exhibition hall, which are open to the public for viewing and use on six days each week.\n\nThe Ministry of Finance has published the accounts of the OTC Funds and the Money Issuing Office (MEA) more and more frequently. The Ministry of Finance has been participating in the International Monetary Fund's Central Bank \"Special Standard for Data Publication\" program since 1999. The Ministry of Finance also publishes the minutes of the meetings of the Committee on Money Issuing under the OTC Funds Advisory Committee, as well as the report on the operation of the MEA system. Since 1996, the Ministry of Finance website has published banking supervision policies and guidelines.\n\nThe relationship between the Treasury and the Legislative Council is important for accountability and transparency. The Treasury President undertakes to brief the Treasury on its work and policies to the Legislative Council's Finance Committee three times a year and to answer inquiries. In addition, the Treasury is represented by the Treasury from time to time in the Legislative Council's Secretariat and subcommittee meetings, explaining and discussing special matters, and assisting the Legislative Council in the review of draft statutes.\n\n#Surveillance measures\n\nThe Board employs robust and effective internal and external monitoring mechanisms to ensure a high level of employee engagement, prudent risk management, and appropriate controls. The internal and external audit function provides an independent assessment of the adequacy and effectiveness of the monitoring mechanisms.\n\n# Code of conduct\n\nThe Code of Conduct provides guidance on the ethical and legal responsibilities of employees and ensures that all employees at all levels of the organization conduct themselves in accordance with the specified standards.\n\n#Internal surveillance\n\n#Operational surveillance\n\nAs the first line of defence in risk management, all departments and divisions are responsible for assessing the risks of their work processes and for establishing appropriate monitoring measures to ensure the smooth day-to-day operation of the Gold Authority.\n\n# Institutional risk management\n\nRisk management is also carried out at the institutional level. The Risk Committee, chaired by the President of the Gold Authority, is one of the cornerstones of the institutional risk management structure.\n\nThe Risk Committee reviews and discusses the potential and emerging risks identified by the sectors and the adequacy of the relevant monitoring measures and mitigation strategies, and determines the appropriate follow-up actions.\n\n# Internal accounting\n\nThe Internal Audit Unit of the Board of Directors shall independently assess the adequacy and effectiveness of the governance procedures, risk management and monitoring measures in the various departments and make recommendations for improvement.\n\n# External accounting\n\nAccording to Article 7 of the Fund's Articles of Association, the financial statements of the Fund are audited by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government Audit Office. The Audit Office does not charge for this service. The audited financial statements of the Fund are published in the Annual Report of the Hong Kong Gold Authority."}

The labor market continued to fluctuate for a while, then gradually improved, while inflation remained moderate. The asset market was also depressed.\n\n# Economic reflection\n\n# Physical economic activity\n\nThe local economy contracted by 3.5% in 2022 (Table 1 and Figure 1) as a result of the fifth wave of the coronavirus outbreak in Hong Kong. Private consumption fell sharply in Q1 and then increased again in the fourth quarter, benefitting from the gradual relaxation of social distancing measures and the stimulus of the government's voucher program. Overall investment expenditure fell significantly in 2021 amid a weak business climate and a worsening financial situation.\n\nFigure 1 Composition of the contribution to real GDP growth. Source: Office of Government Statistics\n\nTable 1 Growth in real gross domestic product by item of expenditure (as compared to the previous period) Note: The seasonally adjusted gross domestic fixed capital formation is not known. Source: Government Statistics\n\n# The Gathering\n\nDomestic inflation pressures eased slightly in 2022 but remained moderate. Specifically, the annual base inflation rate gradually rose to a moderate level of 2% in December, with the impact of higher energy and food prices on outlying businesses partially offset by moderate local cost pressures, especially soft housing rents (Figure 2). Additionally, nominal wage growth and commercial building rents continued to soften in the face of weak economic activity, contributing to the downturn.\n\n# The labour market\n\nThe labor market situation deteriorated rapidly in early 2022 but has continued to improve since then. Unemployment fell significantly to 3.5% in December after rising to a high of 5.4% in April (Figure 3), with most industries showing a decline. The total number of employees (Figure 3) and vacancies in private organizations rose again, reflecting a gradual recovery in overall labor demand, but the total number of employees remained below pre-pandemic levels. The annual growth in nominal wages and labor income also accelerated slightly. On the other hand, the labor force decreased by 1.5% in December compared to the same period last year, partly due to a slight decline in the labor force participation rate.\n\nFigure 2 Inflation in basic consumer goods Source: Government statistics and estimates by the Gold Bureau\n\nFigure 3 Situation of the labour market. Source: Government Statistics\n\n# The stock market\n\nThe Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKSE) experienced a large fluctuation in 2022. Taking on the downward trend of 2021, the Hengyang Index accelerated its decline, reporting 14,687 points on October 31, 2022, the lowest level since 2009 (Figure 4). The stock market's significant adjustment was initially triggered by the market's growing concern about the local coronavirus epidemic, the US interest rate hike and the situation in Russia.\n\n# The property market\n\nThe residential property market was also depressed by the tightening of financial conditions and weakening of economic activity. House prices fell 15% in 2022 (Figure 4), and turnover fell sharply by 39% to 45,050, setting a record low. Despite the fall in house prices, the affordability of housing remains skewed.\n\nFigure 4 Asset prices as reported by the Hong Kong Property Valuation Agency and Hong Kong Trading and Settlement Ownership Limited\n\n# Economic Prospects\n\n# The economic environment\n\nThe full connectivity of the mainland with Hong Kong is expected to boost growth in the economy in 2023 with a low recovery in real GDP growth of 3.55.5% in 2023. However, the growth prospects of Hong Kong are still affected by uncertainties and unfavorable factors, and are largely determined by the US Federal Reserve's policy on global interest rate growth, geopolitical tensions and the ongoing recovery of tourism in the country.\n\n#Community and the labour market\n\nLooking ahead, local inflation is expected to rise slightly, but should remain moderate if various factors offset each other. Although outbound prices should remain high, the upward momentum in outbound prices may weaken further due to the weakening of economic activity in some major economies and the easing of upward pressure on commodity prices. Similarly, local cost pressures may rise slightly with the recovery of the local economy and improvement in the labor market, but the soft rental housing should continue to offset its effects to some extent.\n\n# Banking system performance\n\nThe banking system in Hong Kong faced a challenging macroeconomic environment in 2022, including the outbreak of the fifth wave of the coronavirus epidemic at the beginning of the year, the geopolitical situation warming, and the significant interest rate hikes by major central banks worldwide in response to rising inflation. In the face of various challenges, Hong Kong banks have managed to maintain sufficient capital and liquidity. Credit risks faced by the banking system increased during the year, but the overall asset quality remained at a healthy level. At the same time, rising interest rates have led to an increase in bank net interest income, but its positive side has been offset by a decrease in the amount of reserves and costs and commission income.\n\n# Quality of assets\n\nThe specific classification loan ratio of the banking system increased from 0.89% at the end of 2021 to 1.38% at the end of 2022, and the ratio of overdue and restructured loans increased from 0.56% to 0.85% during the same period (Figure 5). The specific classification loan ratio of China's domestic loans was 2.21% at the end of 2022, compared to 0.89% at the end of 2021. The specific classification loan ratio increased mainly due to the credit rating downgrade of some domestic real estate developers. Despite this, the bank reserves are sufficient, and the bank credit reserve ratio (credit coverage ratio and specific classification loan ratio) remained at about 80% at the end of 2022.\n\nFigure 5 Quality of assets in the banking system Note: Figures include Hong Kong offices, overseas branches and major overseas subsidiaries. Source: Gold Authority\n\nFigure 6 Default rates for residential mortgage loans and credit card loans\n\n# The earnings trend\n\nThe banking system continued to record profitability in 2022. Retail banks' overall pretax operating premiums rose 19.0% in the year (Figure 7) ‒ the profit improvement was helped by net interest income (+34%) and increased margin and derivative income (+72%), but part of the increase was offset by increased bad debt reserves (+151%) and reduced cost and commission income (+19%). In a compound interest environment, the net interest margin expanded from 0.98% in the previous year to 1.31% in 2022 (Figure 8) ‒ increased market volatility in the year, which increased the bank's income from the margin and derivative business (Figure 8) ‒ increased margin and commission income decreased by 22.4% in 2021 (Figure 9) ‒ the increase in bad debt reserves was due to the need to reserve special funds for new loans of specific categories, while the financial market performance was weak, and the commission expense decreased.\n\nFigure 7 Performance of retail banks.\n\nFigure 8 Net interest rate differential of retail banks\n\nFigure 9 Cost to revenue ratio of retail banking\n\n# The asset and liability index is moving\n\nThe banking sector's asset-liability ratio increased by 2.5% in Q4 2022. The rise in assets was due to the increase in the market value of shell and derivative instrument holdings. In the face of uncertain external factors and rising interest rates, the demand for loans decreased during the year.\n\nIn terms of the debt-to-equity ratio, deposits in the banking system continued to record a moderate growth. Total deposits increased by 1.7% in 2022 compared to an increase of 4.6% in 2021. Total deposits increased due to a decrease in total loans, with the overall loan deposit ratio slightly decreasing from 71.8% at the end of 2021 to 68.5% at the end of 2022 (Figure 10).\n\n# Capital is sufficient\n\nThe Bank's capital position in 2022 is expected to remain robust. The combined total capital ratio of locally registered accredited institutions at the end of 2022 was 20.1%, compared to 20.2% in the previous year; the Tier 1 capital ratio was 18.1% (Figure 11); both are well above the relevant international minimum requirements. The Basel III ratio at the end of 2022 was 7.9% (Figure 12).\n\nFigure 10 Loans and deposits in the banking system.

The quarterly average liquidity coverage ratio of Category 1 institutions was 162.3% in Q4 2022 and the quarterly average liquidity retention ratio of Category 2 institutions was 63.2% (Figure 13). The main source of funding for the banking system remains customer deposits. At the end of 2022, the net stable capital ratio of Category 1 institutions and the core capital ratio of Category 2A institutions were 137.7% and 155.7% respectively (Figure 14). All four ratios are well above the minimum required by law.\n\nFigure 13 Liquidity ratios of designated accredited institutions\n\nFigure 14 Capital ratios of designated accredited institutions"}

Driven by the booming stock market in Hong Kong and the seasonal demand for funds at the end of the year, the HKD began to strengthen in November. Under the pegged rate system, Hong Kong bank co-deposits roughly followed the trend of US bank co-deposits.\n\n# Goals\n\nThe main objective of Hong Kong's monetary policy is to maintain monetary stability, i.e. to ensure that the HKD is stable against the US dollar in the foreign exchange market, so that the HKD's exchange rate remains within the range of 7.75 to 7.85 HKD to US$1. The monetary system mainly adopts the money issuing bureau system, which provides for a minimum of 100 percent support to the currency base by the dollar reserves held by the foreign exchange fund; if the currency base changes, the dollar reserves must be increased and decreased in proportion to the percentage change in the currency base.\n\nThe monetary base (Table 1) consists of: - certificates of debt (providing adequate support for the banknotes issued by the three issuing banks); - circulating banknotes and coins issued by the government; - the total balance on the settlement account of the Gold Board (i.e., the total balance); and - foreign currency notes and bonds issued by the Gold Board on behalf of the government.\n\nThe Board maintains the HKD exchange rate stable through an automatic rate adjustment mechanism and a firm commitment to fulfill the exchange rate guarantee. When the strong (or weak) exchange rate guarantee is triggered, the Board will respond to the bank's request by remitting HKD 7.75 per dollar to the bank to buy HKD out of the bank, into the dollar, or to buy HKD into the bank, withdrawing USD, or to buy HKD 7.85 per dollar, so that the total balance increases or decreases, and the HKD interest rate falls or rises, thereby restoring the HKD exchange rate to the range of HKD 7.75 to 7.85.\n\n# Looking back at 2022\n\n# The rate of inflation is stable\n\nThe HKD weakened in early 2022 and has been pegged to the weak side's conversion guarantee level in the months since. The weak side's conversion guarantee was triggered 41 times between May and November. Driven by the strong turnover of the HKD and seasonal capital demand at the end of the year, the HKD began to strengthen in mid-November.\n\nIn order to meet the continued demand of banks for foreign exchange fund notes, the HKSAR issued HK$40 billion worth of foreign exchange fund notes in early 2022. In addition, the HKSAR is required to purchase HK$242.1 billion of foreign exchange guaranteed notes at the level of the weak currency exchange rate between May and November 2022 in accordance with the design of the linkage rate system (linkage system). The total balance of HK$377.5 billion at the end of 2021 decreased to HK$96.3 billion at the end of 2022 reflecting the increased foreign exchange fund notes issued and the impact of the weak currency exchange guaranteed notes issued. At the same time, the total amount of unpaid foreign exchange fund notes and bonds issued by HK$11.488 billion increased to HK$12.004 billion during the year. Therefore, the total amount of unpaid foreign exchange fund notes and bonds issued by HK$125.263 billion at the end of 2021 decreased to HK$12.679 billion at the end of 2022\".\n\nFigure 1 Market rate of inflation in 2022\n\nFigure 2 Balance at the end of 2022 (before the window closure) and outstanding shell fund notes and bonds\n\n# The money market\n\nUnder the Fed, the Hong Kong interbank rate follows the trend of the US dollar interbank rate. Due to the US continuing to raise interest rates in 2022, the interbank rate in Hong Kong has gradually increased (Figure 3). Over the course of the year, overnight, one month and three months, the interbank rate in Hong Kong rose by 318, 419 and 473 basis points respectively to 3.23 cents, 4.35 cents and 4.99 cents at the end of the year.\n\nThe base rate was raised seven times, totaling 4.25 percentage points, from 0.5 to 4.75 basis points (Figure 3). At the retail level, as policy rates in the United States rose, most banks raised the maximum preferential lending rate by 12.5 basis points in late September, by 25 basis points in early November, and by 25 basis points in mid-December. Some banks also raised the new wholesale mortgage interest rate cap based on the discounting of bank and industry rates in Hong Kong during the year.\n\nFigure 3: Bank of Hong Kong to be demolished in 2022\n\n#Contact rate system\n\nThe Hong Kong government has maintained the currency and money markets in an orderly manner, reflecting the stability and effectiveness of the currency system. The government is also determined to maintain the currency system. In the 2022 Foreign Sector Report, the International Monetary Fund has repeatedly reaffirmed Hong Kong's transparent rules, large fiscal and foreign reserves, sound financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy, and a prudent financial structure to ensure the credibility of the currency system.\n\nA sound banking system is critical to the smooth functioning of the FIS. Hong Kong's banking system continues to operate smoothly, with liquidity and capital levels that are very high by international standards. To ensure that the banking system has the ability to withstand shocks, the FIS has closely monitored banks' credit, liquidity and interest rate risk management, as well as stress test results, and maintained supervision of bank lending.\n\nIn order to improve transparency of the purpose of the Money Issuing Agency's books, since October 1998, some of the assets of the shell fund have been designated as supporting the currency base. The support ratio (the ratio of support assets to the currency base) has risen between 109.3% and 111.0% in 2022 without touching the upper or lower limits. The ratio was reported as 110.1% on December 31 (Figure 4). Under the federal system, although some shell fund assets have been designated as supporting units, all of the assets of the shell fund can be used to support the HKD exchange rate. The huge financial resources of the shell fund, coupled with Hong Kong's robust banking system, provide a strong backing for the monetary and financial stability of Hong Kong.\n\nFigure 4 Daily changes in the support ratio in 2022\n\n# The Committee for the issuance of currency\n\nThe Monetary Issuing Committee, under the Overseas Fund Advisory Committee, is responsible for monitoring and exploring issues related to Hong Kong's currency and financial stability. In 2022, the issues explored by the Monetary Issuing Committee include the situation of the Chinese real estate market, the role of non-bank institutions in the residential mortgage market, the application of deep learning in credit risk assessment, and a supervisory framework for assessing the liquidity of the HKD. The minutes of the Monetary Issuing Committee meeting and the report of the Monetary Authority to the Monetary Authority on the operation of the monetary authority system are available on the website of the Monetary Authority.\n\n# Banknotes and coins\n\n# Hong Kong currency\n\nThe HKSAR continues to hold workshops for bank teller staff, retail store cashiers and students to improve their knowledge and skills in the design and anti-counterfeiting features of Hong Kong banknotes. In 2022, the HKSAR will hold 15 workshops, attracting more than 4,200 participants.\n\n# Coin collection project\n\nThe coin collection program continues to be well received by the public. Details of the program are provided in the chapter \"Gold for Sustainable Development\" of the UN Sustainable Development Report for the year 2022.\n\n# Foreign exchange fund bills and bonds\n\nThe Foreign Exchange Notes and Bonds program continued to operate smoothly. In response to the continuing demand of banks for foreign exchange notes and taking into account market conditions, the HKSAR increased the issuance of foreign exchange notes by HK$40 billion in the first two months of 2022, while the total balance decreased accordingly. As of the end of 2022, the total nominal value of outstanding foreign exchange notes and bonds was about HK$12.075 billion.\n\nTable 2 Unpaid shell fund notes and bonds\n\n# Currency research\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute of Monetary and Financial Research (HIMR) has published three policy research reports, 24 research papers and 16 webinars on monetary and financial research issues of strategic importance to Hong Kong and the region. The Institute has also taken steps to make its research results available to a wider audience through the publication of a new open access electronic journal. In addition, the Institute's website has launched a new series of publications, Insights from Monetary Research Digest, which provides a high-level, non-technical overview of the Center's recent research results to the public.\n\nIn addition to the research results, the Center hosts two international seminars and three online expert workshops to promote dialogue and exchange on economic and financial issues:\n\n- On April 12, the Chinese Academy of Finance and the Chinese Academy of Sciences jointly hosted the \"Macro Economic Developments, the Fed's Closing Monetary Policy and the Development of the Offshore RMB Market\" webinar, inviting the former President of the Gold Board, Mr. Ren Zhigang, and Professor Zhao Yiping, Vice Dean of the National Development Research Institute and Professor of Economics at the Beijing University, as guest speakers. The webinar was broadcast live on multiple platforms and attracted a total of 840,000 live webcasts.\n\n- The Chinese government held a webinar on \"Transformation and Policy Choices in China's Real Estate Industry\" on June 24, hosted by Ms. Liu Heong, a senior researcher at the People's University of China and former director of the Policy Research Center of the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, and hosted by Dr. Liu, the head of Asian Economic Research at RBRC and the chief Chinese economist.\n\n- An online workshop on \"Monetary Policy Spillover Effects\" was held on August 25 in partnership with the Asian Development Bank and the Bank for International Settlements, with more than 200 experts and scholars from central banks, international financial institutions and academia from around the world participating online.\n\n- As an extra-conference event of the International Finance Leaders Investment Summit, the Institute of Finance and Economics hosted a webinar on November 2 entitled \"Post-Coronavirus Inflation: Doomed or Avoidable?\" with the analysis of Dr. Prayuth Chan-ocha, Founder and Chief Economist of the International Monetary Observatory and the Former Chief Economist of the BIS. Nearly 200 economists participated in the webinar.\n\n- The 12th China International Economic Forum, the \"New Stage of China's Economic Development\", was held on November 23 in Beijing, China.

{"zh": "# 銀行體系穩定\n\n儘管宏觀環境充滿不確定性及挑戰，加上金融市場異常波動，香港銀行體系於2022年維持穩健。年內金管局亦加強對認可機構信用及市場風險管理的監管。此外，鑑於網絡威脅持續增加及銀行業數碼轉型步伐加快，金管局與認可機構緊密合作，提升認可機構的運作穩健性及網絡防衛能力。\n\n操守監管方面，金管局加強有關「先買後付」產品的消費者保障，並就物業轉按交易提供多一種支付安排。金管局又與其他監管機構合作，就虛擬資產的可持續發展制定監管架構，精簡投資產品銷售程序，以及推出全新的信託業務監管制度。年內有關個人信貸資料的「多間信貸資料服務機構」模式下的「信貸資料平台」啟用，並推出新的強制性背景查核計劃，以應對「滾動的壞蘋果」現象。此外，面對因疫情而實施的旅遊限制，金管局協助推出便利措施讓客戶重新啟動銀行戶口。\n\n因應最新的香港洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險評估，金管局與銀行透過公私營夥伴合作（包括反訛騙及洗黑錢情報工作組），鞏固香港的打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集生態圈，以及加強應對騙案。此外，金管局亦與策略夥伴合作，以能更充分了解及有效管理日益複雜的地緣政治環境所帶來的風險及不穩定因素。金管局又透過「反洗錢合規科技實驗室」系列進一步推動業界運用數據及科技，並同時加快金管局在反洗錢工作中採用監管科技的步伐。在國際事務方面，金管局積極參與財務行動特別組織的工作。\n\n在2022年，本地就有關資本充足標準及披露標準等國際監管標準的實施上取得良好進展。此外，金管局亦大力提升業界的軟實力，包括與銀行業合作建立可持續的人才儲備，以及提升現有從業員的技能。年內金管局一直與銀行業緊密合作，改進及精簡監管政策與程序。\n\n金管局亦繼續致力推進在本地及國際層面的工作，以確保香港備有具公信力的處置機制。具體工作包括制定新處置標準；進行地區危機模擬演習，以及在所有具本地系統重要性銀行建立一層新的吸收虧損能力資源，標誌着金管局在提升處置可行性上立下里程碑。\n\n# 目標\n\n金管局的整體目標之一是促進銀行體系的安全及穩定。要達致這個目標，實有賴建立及維持具高度應對能力且能為香港經濟提供所需關鍵金融服務的金融體系。\n\n銀行可能因營運方式，甚或在極端情況下因失序地倒閉而影響銀行體系的穩定。作為監管當局，金融管理專員在保障金融穩定方面擔當重要角色，確保銀行有能力抵禦衝擊及應對危機恢復常態，以最終有助防止出現倒閉。金融管理專員負責對銀行進行審慎監管，以及認可香港的持牌銀行、有限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司（統稱「認可機構」）。\n\n香港的審慎監管制度並非為確保「零風險」而設。作為其中一個處置機制當局，金融管理專員力求確保一旦有認可機構不再可持續經營，能有秩序地處理其倒閉。為此，香港已設立金融機構處置機制，金融管理專員在該機制下為認可機構（以及其他類型機構）的處置機制當局。為落實香港的處置機制，有必要制定處置規則及政策標準、進行處置規劃以排除認可機構處置可行性的障礙，以及建立金管局處置瀕臨倒閉認可機構的運作能力。為有效執行上述工作，金管局採納與國際一致及協調的方法。\n\n金融管理專員亦負責指定及監察某些金融市場基建。金管局監察金融市場基建的目的，是促進有關基建的整體安全及效率、控制系統性風險，以及提高透明度。提升金融市場基建的抗震能力，能保障香港的貨幣與金融體系，避免因金融市場基建運作中斷而可能影響其穩定。\n\n# 2022年回顧\n\n# 牌照事宜\n\n年內金管局核准6個境外交易平台成為貨幣經紀，另有5間持牌銀行及1間有限制牌照銀行被撤銷認可資格。\n\n有關香港的認可機構及本地代表辦事處的更多資訊，請參閱分別載於第283至286頁及第292至295頁的附錄及表D至F。\n\n# 監管工作概覽\n\n在2022年金管局共進行183次非現場審查，涵蓋範圍甚廣，包括認可機構的CAMEL評估、企業管治、風險管理及採用金融科技的情況。為繼續加強認可機構的風險管治水平，金管局與認可機構董事局、獨立非執行董事或董事局轄下委員會共舉行36次會議，並與認可機構及其外聘核數師共舉行38次三方聯席會議。\n\n除了非現場審查工作外，金管局亦對認可機構的各項業務進行定期現場審查。從審慎監管角度而言，信用風險管理為主要監管重點之一。同時，由於銀行運用科技的情況日趨普及，業務操作風險及科技風險管理是另一個監管重點。隨着綠色及可持續銀行業在香港急速發展，金管局亦已進行一輪以氣候風險管理為重點的專題審查。在操守監管方面，金管局對認可機構的證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（強積金）相關業務進行現場審查，並以專題評估作為配合，以審視被評估為屬較高風險的範疇。\n\n表1載有金管局於2022年的監管工作概要。\n\n表1 監管工作概要\n\n# 信用風險\n\n# 信貸增長及資產質素\n\n2022年貸款總額減少3.0%，2021年則增加3.8%。表2列載各類貸款及墊款的增長情況。2022年內地相關貸款總額亦減少4.4%至45,220億港元（表3）。\n\n年內銀行體系受到來自各方面的挑戰和衝擊，包括第五波新冠疫情、地緣政治局勢升溫、主要央行進取的加息步伐及部分內地房地產發展商的財務狀況惡化等。儘管面對上述各種挑戰，銀行體系依然保持穩定及健全。\n\n銀行體系的資產質素在年內惡化，但仍然維持在健康水平。銀行業的特定分類貸款比率於2022年底為1.38%，高於2021年底的0.89%。內地相關貸款的特定分類貸款比率由一年前的0.89%上升至2.21%。\n\n年內金管局提升其風險監察的廣度與深度，並與認可機構緊密聯繫，以便對經濟及市場形勢，以至認可機構的風險管理措施及時作出評估。銀行體系面對的整體信用風險仍屬可控。金管局的償債壓力測試結果顯示，銀行體系繼續維持充足資本緩衝，能承受極端壓力。\n\n金管局在年內進行專題評估，檢視認可機構的信用風險管理，重點放在資產質素、對較易受影響行業的風險承擔、香港以外分行的信用風險，以及提供予私人銀行及財富管理客戶的有抵押貸款。\n\n另一方面，在充滿挑戰的宏觀經濟環境下，越來越多企業面對財政困難，金管局鼓勵認可機構按照《香港企業財務困難處理守則》所載的原則處理企業出現還款困難的情況，從而使個別認可機構能夠從有關貸款機構的共同利益角度出發協調合作。\n\n表3 內地相關貸款增長\n\n# 紓緩客戶的資金周轉壓力\n\n考慮到第五波新冠病毒疫情的打擊，加上外圍與本港經濟的前景仍然複雜多變，金管局聯同「銀行業中小企貸款協調機制」延長「預先批核還息不還本」計劃至2023年7月底。此外，該計劃亦推出及其後優化部分本金還款選項，協助客戶就最終回復正常還款作好準備。\n\n截至2022年底，銀行共批出108,000多宗企業客戶貸款展期及其他支援措施的個案，涉及金額超過1.1萬億港元。個人客戶方面，銀行亦批出81,000多宗住宅按揭還息不還本及其他個人應急貸款的個案，涉及金額超過650億港元。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n金管局自2009年起先後推出多輪逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施，已經加強銀行的風險管理及香港銀行體系抵禦本港樓市一旦逆轉的能力。新批出住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數於2022年12月為57%，而有關按揭成數於2009年9月推出首輪逆周期措施前為64%。新批出按揭的平均供款與入息比率維持在低水平，於2022年12月為39%，而在2010年8月首度推出有關比率上限時為41%（圖1）。\n\n金管局在9月將物業按揭貸款壓力測試的假設按揭利率上升幅度由300基點下調至200基點。金管局作出此決定時已考慮目前的利率環境，以及按揭息率走勢與其過往的長期平均水平。金管局認為此水平已經足夠確保銀行按揭業務風險得到妥善管理。\n\n圖1 新批出住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數及供款與入息比率\n\n# 業務操作及科技風險\n\n過去一年金管局推出多項措施加強銀行體系的運作穩健性。有關措施包括在5月發出《監管政策手冊》新單元「運作穩健性」，載明金管局預期認可機構為確保運作穩健而應維持的管治及管控架構，並舉辦兩場業界對話，增進業界對新標準的了解，以及促進業內的經驗交流（圖示1）。\n\n金管局又就銀行營運的具體範疇提供詳細監管指引，包括客戶資料保障、支付系統運作、雲端運算、支付卡保安及分散式阻斷服務攻擊防禦機制等。\n\n因應不斷轉變的網絡威脅，金管局透過推動銀行採納穩固三重數據備份安排、監察認可機構實施「網絡防衛評估框架」2.0的進度，以及評估銀行應對供應鏈攻擊的能力，力求提升銀行體系的網絡防衛能力。\n\n因應「網絡釣魚」騙案及其他網上詐騙的風險明顯增加，金管局與香港銀行公會（銀行公會）於9月聯合推出以「數碼KEY睇緊啲，撳LINK前要三思！」為主題的新一輪大型推廣活動，提高公眾的防範意識，又在7月與香港警務處合辦工作坊，向銀行講解騙徒的最新犯案手法。\n\n以「數碼KEY睇緊啲，撳LINK前要三思！」為主題的宣傳活動的海報\n\n圖示1 業界對話「邁向運作穩健之旅」\n\n# 流動性及市場風險\n\n面對主要經濟體進一步收緊貨幣政策導致市場波動加劇，金管局加強監察銀行的市場及流動性風險承擔。金管局進行審查，以檢視認可機構的流動性風險管理是否足夠，並聚焦於分散資金來源及集團內部流動性風險管理的制度及管控措施。此外，金管局亦進行審查，以評估認可機構的市場風險管理架構及財資業務管控措施的成效。", "en": "# Banking system is stable\n\nDespite the uncertain and challenging macro environment, coupled with the unusual volatility of the financial market, Hong Kong's banking system remained stable in 2022. The CBA also strengthened its supervision of credit and market risk management of accredited institutions during the year. In addition, in light of the continuing increase in cyber threats and the acceleration of the digital transformation of the banking industry, the CBA works closely with accredited institutions to enhance the operational stability and cyber defense capabilities of accredited institutions.\n\nIn addition, the Chinese authorities have also cooperated with other regulatory agencies to develop a regulatory framework for the sustainable development of virtual assets, streamline the sales process for investment products, and introduce a new system for the supervision of trust operations. The \"Information Credit Platform\" in the \"Multiple Credit Information Service Agency\" model for personal credit information was launched during the year, and a new mandatory background check program was launched to respond to the \"Rolling Bad Apple\" phenomenon.\n\nIn response to the latest Hong Kong Money Laundering and Terrorist Fundraising Risk Assessment, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is working with banks through public-private partners (including the Anti-fraud and Anti-Money Laundering Intelligence Task Force) to strengthen Hong Kong's anti-money laundering and terrorist fundraising ecosystem and strengthen the response to fraud.In addition, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is working with strategic partners to better understand and effectively manage the risks and instabilities posed by the increasingly complex geopolitical environment.The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is also working with strategic partners to further advance the use of industry data and technology through the \"Anti-Money Laundering Compliance Technology Laboratory Series\", while accelerating the adoption of regulatory technology by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) in anti-money laundering efforts.\n\nIn addition, the Bank has made good progress in implementing international regulatory standards such as capital adequacy standards and disclosure standards in 2022. In addition, the Bank has also made significant progress in enhancing the industry's soft power, including working with the banking industry to build a sustainable talent pool and enhancing the skills of existing practitioners.\n\nThe CBP also continues to work locally and internationally to ensure Hong Kong has a credible resolution mechanism. Specific work includes the development of new resolution standards; the conduct of regional crisis simulation exercises, and the establishment of a new loss absorbing capacity resource in all banks of local systemic importance, marking a milestone in the CBP's efforts to improve resolution feasibility.\n\n# Goals\n\nOne of the overall objectives of the FSA is to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this objective relies on the establishment and maintenance of a highly resilient financial system that can provide the critical financial services needed by the Hong Kong economy.\n\nThe stability of the banking system may be affected by the way banks operate, or in extreme cases by disorderly failures. As a regulatory authority, the Financial Supervisory Authority plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability, ensuring that banks are able to withstand shocks and respond to crises to return to normal, ultimately helping to prevent failures. The Financial Supervisory Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks, as well as licensed Hong Kong-based banks, restricted-licensed banks and deposit-taking companies (the \"Licensed Entities\").\n\nThe prudential regulation system in Hong Kong is not designed to ensure \"zero risk\". As one of the authorities of the resolution mechanism, the Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA) seeks to ensure that once an authorized institution is no longer viable, its collapse can be handled in an orderly manner. To this end, Hong Kong has established a financial institution resolution mechanism, the Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA) under which the institution is authorized as a resolution mechanism (as well as other types of institutions).\n\nThe Financial Supervisory Authority is also responsible for designating and overseeing certain financial market infrastructure. The purpose of the Financial Supervisory Authority overseeing financial market infrastructure is to promote overall security and efficiency, control systemic risk associated with the infrastructure, and improve transparency. The purpose of the Financial Supervisory Authority is to enhance the seismic resistance of financial market infrastructure, which can protect Hong Kong's monetary and financial system from the potential impact on its stability due to disruption of financial market infrastructure.\n\n#2022 looking back\n\n# License issue\n\nIn the year, the Gold Authority approved six offshore platforms as money brokers, while five licensed banks and one with restricted licenses were revoked.\n\nFor more information on the authorised agencies and local representative offices in Hong Kong, see the Appendix and Tables D to F on pages 283 to 286 and 292 to 295, respectively.\n\n# Overview of the work of the regulator\n\nThe Bank has conducted 183 off-site audits in 2022 covering a wide range of issues including CAMEL assessment, corporate governance, risk management and adoption of financial technology by accredited institutions. To further strengthen the level of risk governance of accredited institutions, the Bank has held 36 meetings with the Board of Directors of accredited institutions, independent non-executive directors or committees under the Board of Directors, and 38 joint tripartite meetings with accredited institutions and external auditors.\n\nIn addition to the non-site audits, the KSA also conducts regular on-site audits of the activities of the accredited institutions. From the perspective of prudential supervision, credit risk management is one of the main regulatory priorities. At the same time, due to the increasing popularity of banking technology, business operational risk and technology risk management is another regulatory priority. With the rapid development of green and sustainable banking in Hong Kong, the KSA has also conducted a round of specific audits focused on climate risk management.\n\nTable 1 provides an overview of the regulatory work of the Gold Authority in 2022.\n\nTable 1 Summary of supervisory work\n\n# Credit risk\n\n#Credit growth and asset quality\n\nTotal loans decreased by 3.0% in 2022 and 3.8% in 2021 respectively. Table 2 shows the growth of various types of loans and deposits. Total loans related to the country also decreased by 4.4% to HK$45.22 billion in 2022 (Table 3).\n\nThe banking system has been subject to challenges and shocks from various quarters during the year, including the fifth wave of the coronavirus pandemic, the heightened geopolitical situation, the pace of interest rate hikes by major central banks and the deterioration of the financial situation of some domestic real estate developers. Despite the above challenges, the banking system has remained stable and sound.\n\nThe asset quality of the banking system deteriorated during the year, but remained healthy. The specific classification loan ratio of the banking sector was 1.38% at the end of 2022, up from 0.89% at the end of 2021. The specific classification loan ratio of the land-related loans rose to 2.21% from 0.89% a year ago.\n\nDuring the year, the Banking Authority increased the breadth and depth of its risk monitoring and liaised closely with the accrediting agencies to provide timely assessments of economic and market conditions as well as the risk management measures of the accrediting agencies. The overall credit risk faced by the banking system remained manageable. The results of the stress test of the debt servicing of the Banking Authority showed that the banking system continued to maintain sufficient capital buffers to withstand extreme stress.\n\nThe FCA conducts a year-long assessment of the credit risk management of the accredited institutions, focusing on asset quality, risk-taking in vulnerable industries, credit risk in branches outside Hong Kong, and collateralized loans to private banking and wealth management clients.\n\nIn a challenging macroeconomic environment, with an increasing number of enterprises facing financial difficulties, the HKMA encourages accrediting agencies to handle the emergence of repayment difficulties of enterprises in accordance with the principles contained in the Hong Kong Enterprise Financial Difficulties Handling Code, thereby enabling individual accrediting agencies to cooperate from the perspective of the common interests of the lending institutions concerned.\n\nTable 3 Growth in land-related lending\n\n# Easing the pressure on customers to move money around\n\nIn view of the impact of the fifth wave of the coronavirus pandemic, and the continued complexity of the outlook for the local and overseas economies, the Gold Authority has extended the Pre-Approval of Non-Repayment of Interest (PARR) program through the end of July 2023 in conjunction with the Banking SME Loan Coordination Mechanism. In addition, the program also introduces and subsequently optimizes some of the principal repayment options to help customers prepare for the eventual recovery of normal repayment.\n\nAs of the end of 2022, the Bank had approved more than 108,000 corporate customer loan extension and other support measures involving over HK$1.1 trillion. For individual customers, the Bank also approved more than 81,000 residential mortgage default and other personal emergency loans involving over HK$65 billion.\n\n# Mortgage loans for property\n\nThe MPA has introduced multi-round reverse cycle macro prudential supervision measures since 2009, which have strengthened the risk management of banks and the ability of the Hong Kong banking system to withstand a reverse market in Hong Kong. The average mortgage ratio for new residential mortgage loans issued in December 2022 was 57%, compared to 64% before the first round of reverse cycle measures in September 2009.[1] The average supply to yield ratio of new mortgages remained low, at 39% in December 2022 compared to 41% when the first round of reverse cycles was introduced in August 2010.[2]\n\nIn September, the FOMC lowered the hypothetical rate increase for the real estate mortgage loan stress test from 300 basis points to 200 basis points. The FOMC made this decision after taking into account the current interest rate environment, as well as the trend in mortgage interest rates and their historical long-term average. The FOMC believes that this level is sufficient to ensure that the mortgage risk of the bank's operations is properly managed.\n\nFigure 1: Average mortgage percentage and supply to yield ratio of new residential mortgage loans\n\n#Business operations and technology risk\n\nIn the past year, the Banking Authority has introduced several measures to strengthen the operational stability of the banking system. These measures include the issuance of a new unit \"Operational Stability\" in the Banking Regulatory Policy Manual in May, which outlines the governance and regulatory framework that the Banking Authority expects accrediting agencies to maintain to ensure operational stability, and the holding of two industry dialogues to increase the industry's understanding of the new standards and to promote the exchange of experience within the industry (Figure 1).\n\nThe FSA also provides detailed regulatory guidance on the specific scope of the bank's operations, including customer data protection, payment system operations, cloud operations, payment card security and decentralized blocking services attack protection mechanisms.\n\nIn response to the evolving cyber threats, the KIM is working to improve the cyber defence capabilities of the banking system by encouraging banks to adopt robust triple data backup arrangements, monitoring the progress of the Cyber Defence Assessment Framework 2.0 by accreditation bodies, and assessing the ability of banks to respond to supply chain attacks.\n\nIn response to the apparent increase in the risk of \"cyber fishing\" and other online fraud, the KIM and the Hong Kong Banking Association (HKB) launched a new round of large-scale publicity campaigns in September, titled \"Digital KEY Watch, Think Before You Link!\" to raise public awareness of the issue, and in July, they held a workshop with the Hong Kong Police Department to teach banks about the latest criminal tactics of fraudsters.\n\nPoster for the campaign \"Digital KEY is watching, think twice before you LINK!\"\n\nFigure 1: Industry conversations on the road to operational stability\n\n# Liquidity and market risk\n\nIn the face of further tightening of monetary policy in major economies, which has led to increased market volatility, the Banking Authority has increased its supervision of banks' market and liquidity risk-taking.

In order to promote Hong Kong's financial services, the Bank has intensified its marketing efforts to overseas and domestic stakeholders, raising awareness of Hong Kong's robust financial system and its prospects.\n\nAt the same time, the KING continued to implement the Fintech 2025 strategy to promote the widespread adoption of financial technology in the financial industry and consolidate Hong Kong's position as a financial technology hub. The rapid payment system, Fast Transfer, continued to grow steadily, with the number of registrations exceeding 10 million in March and the average daily transaction volume exceeding 1 million in September.\n\nThe Bank continues to actively participate in international and regional central banking and regulatory organizations, contributing to global efforts to maintain financial stability and promote market development.\n\n# Summary\n\nThe Hong Kong-based financial institution is continuing to take the lead in enhancing Hong Kong's competitiveness as an international financial centre. In November, the Hong Kong-based financial institution hosted the \"International Finance Leaders Investment Summit\", which was announced by the Finance Minister in the budget for the fiscal year 2022-23. The three-day summit brought together the international financial industry to share their unique perspectives on how to seize opportunities under uncertainty. The event attracted a great deal of publicity and more than 200 high-profile guests from around 120 international financial institutions, reflecting the support of the global financial community for Hong Kong.\n\nHong Kong further consolidated its position as an offshore RMB hub, with steady growth in offshore RMB operations during the year. Hong Kong and the mainland network is recognized as the preferred channel for international investors to enter the offshore capital market and locally invested assets offshore. In 2022, the bond channel \"North\" accounted for 61% of the total value of foreign investors in the bond market in China. The bond channel \"South\" and \"Cross-Border Financial\" have been operating since 2021. The financial regulatory authority and the People's Bank of China and the Securities and Exchange Commission announced the \"Development of Exchange\" to further expand the financial cooperation with Hong Kong to derivative markets and strengthen the management of the mainland.\n\nTo provide more yuan-denominated products in Hong Kong, a working group consisting of the Gold and Securities Regulatory Commission and the Hong Kong Trading and Settlement Company Limited (Hong Kong Stock Exchange) has completed a feasibility study on expanding the use of the renminbi in Hong Kong stock market trading. The working group has carried out preparatory work, including the launch of a dual-counter trading mechanism to optimize the trading mechanism of Hong Kong and renminbi dual-counter stocks.\n\nThe Ministry of Finance is continuing to work on enhancing the competitiveness of Hong Kong's financial platforms. In particular, the Ministry of Finance is working closely with the government and the financial industry to enhance the attractiveness of Hong Kong as a preferred fund management centre, and to create a more convenient tax and regulatory environment.\n\nThe Office of Financial Technology Promotion (FTD) of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKM) will continue to work with banking sectors to implement the \"Fintech 2025\" strategy to promote the widespread adoption of Fintech in the industry and enhance Hong Kong's position as the financial technology hub in Asia. The main measures to be implemented during the year include: - promoting the application of regulated technologies and conducting the assessment of Fintech applications; - promoting the work on wholesale central bank digital currency to improve cross-border payments; - deepening the research on the issuance of retail central bank digital currency (e-HKD) in Hong Kong; - introducing \"commercial digital currency\"; - strengthening talent development; - supporting the Fintech ecosystem through resource efficiency policies; - strengthening cross-border Fintech cooperation; - promoting the use of \"quick cash transfer\" at the payment gateway\".\n\nThe reliable and efficient operation of financial infrastructure is key to consolidating Hong Kong's position as a major international financial centre. In 2022, the four instant payment settlement systems for processing banking transactions (RTGS system), the debt instrument central settlement system (CMU) and the Hong Kong Transaction Data Warehouse all reached 100%2 of the system availability, above the 99.95% target level. The bond exchange \"Northbound\" and \"Southbound\" exchange services remained smooth. At the end of the year, the total amount of unpaid foreign exchange notes and bonds in the CMU system was HK$12.075 billion, and the total amount of unpaid other bonds increased to HK$15.73 billion, the level since 2013.\n\nThe use of the \"Fast Payment\" service continued to grow in 2022. As of the end of 2022, there were 11.48 million registrations, with an average daily transaction volume up 40% compared to 2021. In addition to the steady growth of person-to-person and business payments, the continuous increase in the value of e-wallets or bank accounts through the \"Fast Payment\" service to pay government bills, pay merchants and pay for value-added instruments is the main reason for the significant increase in the number of transactions through the \"Fast Payment\" service.\n\nTo promote the safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the ZIPC oversees six designated retail payment systems and supervises 17 licensed depository payment instruments (four of which are issued by the bank holding the license) under the ZIPC Payment Systems and Depository Payment Instruments Regulations. In order to continue to assist the government in the successful implementation of the voucher program, the ZIPC coordinates and promotes communication and cooperation between relevant government departments and depository payment instrument licensees commissioned for the program.\n\nThe summary of the Cryptoasset and Stablecoin Discussion Document issued by the FSA in January 2023 incorporates the views gathered from the discussion document and the FSA's responses. The summary document confirms that the FSA will regulate stablecoins in a risk-based and flexible manner, and outlines the expected regulatory scope, key regulatory requirements and next steps.\n\nInternationally, the KIM is active in central banking affairs, with leadership roles in several regional and international committees. Since 2018, the KIM has co-chaired the Financial Markets Working Group under the East Asia and Pacific Conference of Central Banks (EMEAP) 3 and the Policy and Standards Group under the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee). In addition, the KIM is co-chair of the Non-Banking Supervision Expert Group and the Financial Innovation Network under the Financial Stability Board, and leads the Financial Stability Board's monitoring of the progress and follow-up of the transition to financial standards.\n\n#2022 looking back\n\n#International Finance Leaders and Investors Summit\n\nThe International Finance Leaders Investment Summit is held from November 1 to 3.\n\nThe meeting was held on November 3 and was a highly attended event, bringing together 26 financial industry leaders to discuss how to deal with economic, financial, technological and geopolitical instability, and how to seize the opportunity to share unique views and ideas. The summit was attended by more than 200 participants from about 120 global financial institutions, including more than 40 institutions attended by the group's chairman or CEO. The participants included many of the world's largest banks, securities, asset management, sovereign wealth funds, private equity and venture capital funds, hedge funds and insurance companies.\n\nThe summit will send a clear message to the world that Hong Kong is back to normal, and that global financial leaders can experience firsthand the unique resilience and vitality of Hong Kong and the opportunities it can offer in developing their business in Asia.\n\n#Hong Kong as the main gateway to the mainland and the hub for global offshore RMB operations\n\nHong Kong is committed to consolidating its position as a global hub for offshore RMB operations, including enhancing offshore liquidity, further strengthening connectivity with the domestic financial market, and improving financial market infrastructure. RMB operations, including bank deposits, trade settlement, payments and offshore bond issuance, continued to record steady growth during the year. Encouraging progress and performance in enhancing liquidity, product development and expanding interconnection mechanisms.\n\nThe bond market, known as the \"Northward Pass\", continues to be the main channel for international investors to invest in the domestic bond market through Hong Kong's market infrastructure and financial services. The bond market, known as the \"Northward Pass\", has an average daily turnover of 322 billion yuan in 2022 (an increase of 25% compared to 2021), accounting for 61% of the overall turnover of foreign investors in the Chinese interbank bond market.\n\nIn July, the bond exchange introduced technological improvements, including the electronicisation of the process of issuing bonds in the domestic bond market and the reduction of service fees. These market-based improvements improve the efficiency of the bond exchange and reduce the transaction costs for investors.\n\nTo improve the support of the bond exchange \"North to South\" and facilitate international investors to manage the interest rate risk associated with domestic bond investment, Hong Kong and Hong Kong announced in July the launch of two interest rate swap market interactive cooperation (\"Interchange\"). Initially, \"Interchange\" will open north to allow international investors to trade domestic interest rate swap products through the connection between Hong Kong and the domestic infrastructure, thereby strengthening Hong Kong's position as a center for risk management.\n\nSince its launch in 2021, the bond market has been positive and operating smoothly, with transactions covering major bond products that can be bought and sold in the Hong Kong market and priced in multiple currencies.

{"zh": "# 儲備管理\n\n2022年的投資環境異常動盪，多種資產類別的價格同時下挫，不僅打破同時持有股票與債券可產生緩減風險作用的傳統投資智慧，更成為近半世紀以來唯一一次股票、債券及主要非美元貨幣匯兌同時錄得負回報的一年。在如此惡劣的投資環境下，外匯基金在2022年錄得投資回報率負4.5%。與年內大部分多元資產基金蒙受重大虧損的情況相比，外匯基金的表現反映金管局的多元化長期資產配置，以及因應外圍最新局勢變化而作出的防禦性部署及戰略性調整，有效減低市場風暴帶來的衝擊。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》，外匯基金的首要目的是直接或間接影響港元匯價，亦可運用於保持香港貨幣及金融體系穩定健全，藉此保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。金管局根據財政司司長轉授的權力及轉授權力的條款，就外匯基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標及組合架構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會為外匯基金制定下列投資目標：\n(i) 保障資本；\n(ii) 確保整體貨幣基礎在任何時候都由流通性極高的美元資產提供十足支持；\n(iii) 確保流動資金足以維持貨幣及金融穩定；以及\n(iv) 在符合上述(i)至(iii)項的前提下盡量爭取投資回報，以保障外匯基金的長期購買力。\n\n以上目標全面顧及外匯基金的法定目的，並已於外匯基金的組合架構及目標資產配置中反映（圖示1）。\n\n圖示1 外匯基金的投資組合類別\n\n外匯基金大致上分成兩個主要組合：支持組合及投資組合。支持組合持有流通性極高的美元資產，按照貨幣發行局制度的規定為貨幣基礎提供十足支持。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員經濟體的債市及股市，以保障資產的價值及長期購買力。\n\n為能更妥善管理風險及提高中長期回報，金管局以審慎及循序漸進方式將外匯基金的部分資產配置於較多元化的資產類別，包括新興巿場及內地債券與股票、私募股權（包括基建）及房地產。新興巿場及內地債券與股票由投資組合持有，私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合持有。長期增長組合的目標資產配置與其他資產類別的配置，按審慎的風險管理原則及資產組合多元化策略一起制定。\n\n策略性資產組合於2007年設立，一直持有政府基於策略性目的而為外匯基金帳目購入的香港交易及結算所有限公司股份。由於這個組合性質獨特，因此外匯基金的投資表現評估並無將其包括在內。\n\n# 於外匯基金的存款\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定組織的存款，利率一般與投資組合的表現掛鈎，但未來基金屬主要個別例子。未來基金存款的利率與投資組合及長期增長組合的回報掛鈎，實際利率視乎組合比重而定。未來基金在投資組合與長期增長組合的比重於2022年約為35：65。\n\n# 投資程序\n\n外匯基金的投資程序分別以策略性資產配置及戰略性資產配置作基礎。策略性資產配置以投資基準方式反映，亦即外匯基金為達到投資目標而可作出的長線資產配置。外匯基金以策略性配置作為指引，透過戰略性的資產配置，以爭取超越基準的回報。因此，實際配置往往會與基準配置（亦即策略性配置）有所偏離，而實際與基準配置之間的差距稱為「戰略性偏離」。財政司司長經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後制定投資基準及循跡誤差限額，金管局獲授權決定戰略性資產配置及定出戰略性偏離的容許範圍。投資組合經理可在戰略性偏離的容許範圍內管理倉盤，從短期市場變化中獲利。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局的外匯基金投資辦公室專責外匯基金的投資及相關風險管理職能。該辦公室職員負責直接管理外匯基金約70%的投資，包括整個支持組合及部分投資組合。該部分內部管理的投資組合包括不同的環球定息市場投資，並透過衍生工具執行外匯基金的宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 外聘投資經理\n\n除透過內部職員管理資產外，金管局亦僱用外聘投資經理負責管理外匯基金約30%的資產，包括所有上市股票組合及其他特別資產類別。僱用外聘投資經理的目的是要運用市場上最佳的專業投資專才為外匯基金投資，獲取可持續回報，並讓外匯基金受惠於多元化及互補的投資方式，以及汲取市場心得與專門的投資知識。\n\n僱用外聘投資經理的相關支出包括基金管理與託管費、交易費、預扣稅及其他稅項。這些支出主要受市場因素影響而每年不同。\n\n# 風險管理及監察\n\n投資環境越趨複雜，風險管理的重要性不言而喻。金管局為內部及外聘投資經理所管理的投資組合均訂下嚴格管控措施及投資指引，並設立嚴謹的風險監察及合規制度。金管局為投資相關活動設有三重防線，以實施有效的風險管理及管治。金管局定期監察主要投資風險類別（包括信用、市場、流動性及業務操作風險），而風險管理程序的設置為外匯基金的策略性規劃及多元化投資提供穩健的框架。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n金管局相信透過適度強調負責任投資及考慮各項投資的可持續長期表現，可更有效達致外匯基金的投資目標，並且減低投資活動涉及的環境、社會及管治(ESG)相關風險。當ESG投資與其他投資項目的經風險調整長期收益相若時，金管局一般會按既定指導性原則優先考慮ESG投資，並已將ESG因素併入外匯基金的公開市場及私募市場的投資管理過程中。有關金管局的負責任投資框架及落實情況，詳見《二零二二年可持續發展報告》之「負責任投資」一章。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2022 年的金融市場\n\n2022年環球金融市場異常波動，債市及股市分別累計下跌16.2%及19.8%，跌幅顯著。\n\n受累於全球通脹飆升、緊縮貨幣政策及經濟增長放緩，年內主要股市指數大幅下挫。儘管環球股市因市場出現通脹及利率見頂的憧憬而於年末稍作反彈，年內美國標準普爾500指數仍下跌19.4%，香港恒生指數則下跌15.5%。\n\n由於各國央行進取加息以對抗通脹，觸發主要市場國債收益率持續飆升。美國10年期國債收益率從2022年初的1.63%一直攀升，至第4季升穿4%，達2008年以來最高水平。美國國債收益率曲線自年中開始已出現倒掛，幅度不斷擴大，加深市場對經濟衰退的憂慮。\n\n貨幣市場方面，在美國聯邦儲備局連續加息帶動下，美元在2022年大幅走強。其他主要貨幣，包括歐元、英鎊、日圓及人民幣兌美元匯率大幅貶值，其中英鎊及日圓兌美元分別貶值10.7%及12.2%。\n\n表1列載主要貨幣、債巿及股市在2022年的表現。\n\n表1 2022年市場回報\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n外匯基金在2022年錄得2,054億港元的投資虧損，其中包括債券投資虧損532億港元、股票投資虧損805億港元（其中包括境外股票投資虧損610億港元及香港股票投資虧損195億港元）、非港元資產外匯估值下調400億港元，以及外匯基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資虧損317億港元。另一方面，策略性資產組合錄得87億港元估值虧損。\n\n於2022年年底，外匯基金的資產總值達40,080億港元。長期增長組合投資的總市值為4,847億港元，其中私募股權為3,700億港元，房地產為1,147億港元。長期增長組合中已承擔但尚未提取作投資的總額為2,708億港元。\n\n外匯基金（不包括策略性資產組合）在2022年的投資回報率為負4.5%，其中投資組合的回報率為負8.6%，支持組合為負0.4%。長期增長組合自2009年開展投資以來的內部回報率年率為12.6%。\n\n圖1列明外匯基金由1994至2022年的年度回報率。表2顯示外匯基金在2022年的投資回報率及不同年期的平均投資回報率。外匯基金在2020至2022年的平均回報率為1.5%、2018至2022年為2.3%、2013至2022年為2.4%，以及自1994年起計為4.5%。表3列載外匯基金資產於2022年12月31日的貨幣比重。\n\n有關外匯基金的經審計2022年度財務報表，見第173至281頁。\n\n圖1 外匯基金投資回報率（1994至2022年）", "en": "# Reserves management\n\nThe investment environment in 2022 was unusually turbulent, with prices falling simultaneously across multiple asset classes, breaking traditional investment wisdom that holding both stocks and bonds can produce risk-mitigating effects, and becoming the only year in nearly half a century in which stocks, bonds, and major non-dollar currencies recorded negative returns simultaneously. Under such a poor investment environment, the hedge fund recorded a negative investment return of 4.5% in 2022. Compared to most MTFs that suffered significant losses during the year, the performance of the hedge fund reflects the diversified long-term asset allocation of the MTF, as well as the hedge deployment and strategic adjustments made in response to the latest developments in the external environment, effectively mitigating the impact of market storms.\n\n# The Outdoor Fund\n\nAccording to the regulations of the Hong Kong Sovereign Wealth Fund, the primary purpose of the Sovereign Wealth Fund is to influence the value of the Hong Kong dollar, either directly or indirectly, and may be used to maintain the stability of Hong Kong's monetary and financial system, thereby maintaining Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre. The Gold Authority is responsible to the Finance Minister for the operation and investment management of the Sovereign Wealth Fund under the terms of the delegated powers and delegated powers of the Chief Financial Officer.\n\n# Managing the foreign exchange fund\n\n# Investment goals and syndicate structure\n\nThe Advisory Committee on Hedge Funds has established the following investment objectives for hedge funds: (i) to safeguard capital; (ii) to ensure that the overall monetary base is adequately supported at all times by highly liquid dollar assets; (iii) to ensure that there is sufficient liquid capital to maintain monetary and financial stability; and (iv) to seek the highest return on investment, subject to (i) to (iii) above, to ensure the long-term purchasing power of the hedge fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the legal purpose of the hedge fund and are reflected in the combined structure and target asset allocation of the hedge fund (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 Investment groups of hedge funds\n\nThe foreign exchange funds are broadly divided into two main groups: support groups and investment groups. Support groups hold highly liquid dollar assets and provide adequate support on a currency basis as defined by the monetary authority system. Investment groups invest primarily in the bond and stock markets of the member economies of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to secure the value of the assets and their long-term purchasing power.\n\nIn order to better manage risk and improve medium-term returns, the Gold Authority has allocated some of the assets of the hedge fund in a prudent and gradual manner to more diversified asset classes, including emerging market and inland bonds and stocks, private equity (including infrastructure) and real estate. Emerging market and inland bonds and stocks are held by investment groups, while private equity and real estate investments are held by long-term growth groups. The target asset allocation of long-term growth groups is developed along with the allocation of other asset classes in accordance with the principles of prudent risk management and the diversification strategy of the asset group.\n\nThe Strategic Asset Group was established in 2007 and has been holding Hong Kong trading and settlement ownership shares of the Hong Kong-based company that the government purchased for the account of the shell fund for strategic purposes. Due to the unique nature of the group, the investment performance assessment of the shell fund does not include it.\n\n# Deposits to the shell fund\n\nFDI funds sometimes accept deposits from financial reserves, government funds, and legal entities. The interest rate is generally a function of the investment group's performance, but the futures fund is a major exception. The interest rate on the future fund deposit is a function of the return of the investment group and the long-term growth group. The actual interest rate depends on the ratio of the group.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment procedures of the hedge fund are based on strategic asset allocation and strategic asset allocation respectively. Strategic asset allocation reflects the investment criteria, i.e. the long-term asset allocation that the hedge fund can make to achieve the investment goal. The hedge fund uses strategic allocation as a guide, through strategic asset allocation, to compete for the return of exceeding the standards. Therefore, the actual allocation tends to be deviated from the standard allocation (also called strategic allocation), and the difference between the actual and standard allocation is called \"strategic deviation\".\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nThe Office of the IMF's Investment in Hedge Funds (OIF) is responsible for the investment and risk management functions of hedge funds. The staff of the office is responsible for directly managing approximately 70% of the hedge fund's investments, including the entire support group and some investment groups. The internally managed investment groups include various global fixed income market investments and implement the macro risk management strategy of the hedge fund through derivatives.\n\n# Outsourcing investment managers\n\nIn addition to managing the assets through internal staff, the CMA also employs an external investment manager responsible for managing approximately 30% of the assets of the shell fund, including all listed stock exchanges and other special asset classes. The purpose of employing an external investment manager is to use the best professional investment professionals in the market to invest in the shell fund, to obtain sustainable returns, and to allow the shell fund to benefit from diversified and complementary investment methods, as well as to draw on market-oriented and specialized investment knowledge.\n\nThe associated expenses of hiring an outsourced investment manager include the management and custody fees, transaction fees, withholding taxes and other taxes. These expenses vary from year to year, mainly due to market factors.\n\n# Risk management and surveillance\n\nThe investment environment is becoming more complex, and the importance of risk management is evident. The IORP has strict regulatory and investment guidelines for investment groups managed by internal and external investment managers, and has established a strict risk supervision and compliance system. The IORP has a triple line of defense for investment-related activities to implement effective risk management and governance. The IORP regularly monitors the main categories of investment risk (including credit market liquidity and operational risk), and the establishment of risk management procedures provides a solid framework for strategic planning of hedge funds and diversified investments.\n\n#Responsible investing\n\nThe Bank believes that by appropriately emphasizing responsible investment and considering the sustainable long-term performance of each investment, it can more effectively achieve the investment objectives of the hedge fund and reduce the environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks associated with its investment activities. The Bank generally considers ESG investments as a priority when adjusting the risks to the long-term benefits of other investment projects, in accordance with established guiding principles, and has incorporated ESG factors into the management process of the hedge fund's public market and private equity investments. For more information on the Bank's framework and implementation, see the Chapter \"Responsible Investment\" of the 2022 Sustainable Development Report.\n\n# Performance of the foreign exchange fund\n\n# The financial market in 2022\n\nThe global financial markets have been volatile in 2022, with yields on bond and equity markets falling by 16.2% and 19.8%, respectively.\n\nThe US Standard & Poor's 500 fell 19.4% in the year, while the Hong Kong Hingers fell 15.5% in the year, despite a slight rebound in global stock markets at the end of the year due to the emergence of inflation and the expectation of a peak in interest rates.\n\nThe US 10-year yield has risen from 1.63% in early 2022 to 4% in the fourth quarter, the highest level since 2008. The US yield curve has been in a downward trend since mid-year, expanding steadily, deepening market concerns about the economic downturn.\n\nIn the money market, the US dollar strengthened significantly in 2022 as the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates. Other major currencies, including the euro, pound sterling, yen and yuan, depreciated significantly against the US dollar, with the pound sterling and yen depreciating by 10.7% and 12.2% respectively.\n\nTable 1 shows the performance of the major currencies, bond markets and stock markets in 2022.\n\nTable 1 Market returns for the year 2022\n\n# Performance of the foreign exchange fund\n\nThe foreign exchange fund recorded a loss of HK$205.4 billion in 2022, including a loss of HK$53.2 billion in bond investments, HK$80.5 billion in equity investments (including HK$61 billion in overseas equity investments and HK$195 billion in Hong Kong equity investments), HK$40 billion in devaluation of non-HK assets, and HK$31.7 billion in other investments held by subsidiaries of foreign exchange fund investment holding companies. On the other hand, strategic asset groups recorded an estimated loss of HK$87 billion.\n\nIt has total assets of HK$40.08 billion at the end of 2022. The total market value of long-term growth portfolio investments is HK$484.7 billion, of which private equity is HK$370.0 billion and real estate is HK$114.7 billion. The total amount of HK$270.8 billion has been committed but not yet drawn as investments in long-term growth portfolio investments.\n\nThe investment fund (excluding strategic asset groups) has a negative return on investment of 4.5% in 2022, with the investment group returning a negative 8.6% and the support group returning a negative 0.4% [2]. The long-term growth group has an annual internal return of 12.6% since its investment in 2009 [3].\n\nThe following table shows the annual return of the hedge fund from 1994 to 2022: Table 1 shows the return on investment of the hedge fund in 2022 and the average return on investment for the different years. The average return on investment of the hedge fund was 1.5% in 2020-2022, 2.3% in 2018-2022, 2.4% in 2013-2022, and 4.5% since 1994.

In addition to being reflected in the formulation of policies, risk management is also applied at the level of daily operations. The Gold Authority's risk management framework has two high-level committees, namely the Macro-Supervisory Committee and the Risk Committee; both are chaired by the President of the Gold Authority.\n\nThe mandate of the Macro-Supervisory Committee is to: - identify potential risks and threats to the monetary and financial system of Hong Kong and discuss possible responses; - review the current risk management measures in the monetary and financial system, identify possible gaps and ensure that they are improved; and - encourage the sharing of macro-supervisory information across sectors, thereby enhancing the macro-supervisory capacity of the Monetary Authority.\n\nThe remit of the Risk Committee shall be to: - identify potential risks and threats facing the Gold Authority and develop strategies to mitigate their impact; - review the existing risk management systems in each sector, identify potential vulnerabilities and significant risks and ensure that appropriate measures are in place to address them; - establish uniform risk assessment criteria and methodologies and prioritize resource management for the identified risks; and - encourage and strengthen the risk management culture within the Gold Authority and promote appropriate authorization and supervision.\n\nThe IBA has a robust operational risk management framework that covers the risk of the organizational structure at the institutional and departmental levels. The institutional level of risk generally refers to the medium-term risks faced by the entire institution or the risks that require a joint response across departments. In the implementation process, departments need to review and report on their potential and emerging risks, as well as the proposed monitoring measures and mitigation strategies, and then follow the institutional risk management model from top to bottom.\n\n# Internal censorship\n\nThe Internal Audit Service independently and objectively assesses the adequacy and effectiveness of the governance, risk management and oversight procedures of the IWF. The functional review is reported to the Audit Committee under the Overseas Fund Advisory Committee, and the administrative review is reported to the IWF President. The internal audit service adopts a risk-based approach to operational and information system audits, covering all major risk areas.

My responsibilities under these standards are set out in the section \"Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of financial statements\" of this report. I am independent of the Group and have fulfilled other ethical responsibilities under these standards. I believe that the audit certificates I have obtained provide an adequate and appropriate basis for my audit opinion.\n\n# Key accounting issues\n\nThe critical audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, are of the greatest importance to the audit of the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022. I have dealt with these matters in the course of auditing and forming opinions on the financial statements as a whole, and I do not provide separate opinions on these matters.\n\n# Valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value\n\nPlease see the financial statements annexes 2.5, 2.6 and 38.1.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Group had financial assets at fair value of HK$38,361.82 billion and financial liabilities of HK$12,074.98 billion.\n\n87% of the fair value of such financial assets and all such financial liabilities is the price of the same asset or liability in an active market (Class 1 parameter) or is estimated by valuation methods using parameters based on observable market data (Class 2 parameter).\n\nThe remaining 13% of the fair value of these financial assets is estimated by the valuation method, and the parameters used are not based on observable market data (the \"Tier 3\" parameters). The total amount of HK$48,764.9 million related to financial assets, mainly including unlisted investment funds.\n\nIn view of the large amount involved and the estimates involved, the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities that are accounted for at fair value is a critical matter for the audit.\n\nThe audit procedures for the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value include: - understanding the valuation procedures for the different classes of financial assets and financial liabilities, including the related monitoring measures; - evaluating and testing the monitoring measures, including the relevant application monitoring measures for computer systems; - the assessment of the valuation, existence, rights and liabilities and integrity of financial assets and financial liabilities; - the assessment of the quality of the underlying asset and the quality of the underlying asset; - the assessment of the quality of the underlying asset if market prices are used, and the assessment of the quality of the underlying asset based on independent sources; - the assessment of the adequacy of the valuation method if parameters used are based on observable market data, and the assessment of the adequacy of the valuation method if parameters used are based on observable market data, and the assessment of the reasonableness of the relevant assumptions based on independent sources; and - the assessment of the adequacy of the valuation method if parameters used are not based on observable market data, and the assessment of the quality of the parameters based on independent sources.\n\n#Valuation of investment properties at fair value through profit\n\nPlease see the financial statements in Appendix 2.11 and Appendix 18 and Appendix 19.\n\nThe Group's investment properties are listed at fair value, with a total value of HK$23.394 billion as at 31 December 2022. The Group also owns interests in 4 subsidiaries and 22 associated companies, whose main business is holding overseas investment properties, with a total value of HK$3.9631 billion. Whether held directly by the Group or by subsidiaries or associated companies, the fair value of such investment properties is determined primarily based on the valuation of independent professional appraisers. Such valuation involves significant judgments and estimates, including the valuation methods and assumptions used.\n\nThe audit procedure for the valuation of investment property accounted for at fair value includes: obtaining and reviewing the valuation report for investment property owned directly by the Group or owned by an associate or joint venture and verifying that the fair value is based on the valuation adjustments set out in the relevant valuation report; assessing the independence and qualifications of the valuer; and assessing the appropriateness of the valuation method and the reasonableness of the assumptions and parameters involved.\n\n# Other\n\nThe Financial Controller is responsible for all other information. All other information is included in the Financial Controller's 2022 Annual Report, but not the financial statements and my auditor's report.\n\nI do not comment on the financial statements as a reflection of other material, nor do I make any kind of expert opinion of other material.\n\nWhereas, in the context of an audit of the financial statements, I am responsible for reading other material and thereby considering whether there is a material inconsistency with the financial statements or with the circumstances of which I became aware in the course of the audit, or whether there appears to be a material misstatement. Based on the work that I have performed, I am required to report the fact that if I believe that there is a material misstatement in other material. In this regard, I have no report.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Audit Committee under the Financial Management Committee and the OTC Advisory Committee on financial statements\n\nThe financial controller shall be responsible for preparing the financial statements of the Hong Kong and Macao SAR in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Chartered Accountants and the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under Article 7 of the Regulations of the Hong Kong and Macao SAR Funds, and for implementing the internal controls he deems necessary to ensure that the financial statements are free from material misstatement caused by fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing financial statements, the financial manager shall be responsible for assessing the Group's ability to operate in a sustainable manner and, where applicable, for disclosing matters related to sustainable operation and taking account of sustainable operation as a basis for accounting.\n\nThe Audit Committee, under the auspices of the Advisory Committee of the Overseas Fund, is responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process of the group.\n\n# The responsibilities of auditors in auditing financial statements\n\nThat my objective is to obtain reasonable assurance that there is no material misstatement in the overall financial statements resulting from fraud or error and to issue an auditor's report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but it is not guaranteed that an audit conducted in accordance with the audit standards of the Audit Bureau of Circulations will reveal any material misstatement. Misstatements can be caused by fraud or error and are considered material misstatements if it is reasonably expected that, individually or in aggregate, they could affect the economic decisions made by users of the financial statements.\n\nI will also: - identify and evaluate the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements resulting from fraud or error; design and implement audit procedures to address those risks; and obtain adequate and appropriate audit certificates as a basis for my opinion. - assess the financial statements and the financial statements of the auditors and the audit team as a whole, to determine whether the audit team is aware of the structure and disclosure of the audit activities involved; - continue to be responsible for the disclosure of information relevant to the audit; - maintain the auditors' ability to obtain the necessary information from the auditors and the audit team, to continue to employ the audit committee's audit policy, and to obtain appropriate and adequate audit certificates and financial statements, and to determine whether the audit committee is competent to assess the financial statements and the financial statements of the auditors and the audit team, if the audit committee considers that the audit committee's opinion is not based on the existence of material material information relevant to the audit activity and to determine whether the audit committee's opinion is based on the disclosure of material information relevant to the audit activity; - be responsible for the continuing use of the audit committee's audit policy, to obtain adequate and adequate audit evidence as a basis for my opinion, and to determine whether the financial statements are material and whether the financial statements of the audit activity involved, and, and, or are not, and, or are, material, or are, reflective or are, material, or are, material or are not, material or are, or are, or are not, or are, or are, or are not, or are, or are, or are not; - to be included in the financial statements, or are included in the financial statements, or are not, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are, or are\n\nI communicate with the audit committee under the advisory board of the hedge fund the scope and timing of the audit plan and the significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal controls that I identify during the audit.\n\nI will also make a statement to the Audit Committee under the auspices of the Advisory Committee on Outer Banks that I have met the relevant ethical requirements for independence and communicate to them all relationships and other matters that are reasonably believed to affect my independence and, where applicable, the relevant safeguards.\n\nFrom my communications with the audit committee under the advisory committee of the OTC Funds, I determine which matters are most important to the audit of the financial statements for the current period and therefore constitute critical audit matters. I describe these matters in the auditor's report unless the law or regulation does not permit public disclosure of a matter, or in extremely rare circumstances where there is a reasonable expectation that the negative consequences of communicating a matter in my report will outweigh the public interest it generates and I decide not to communicate the matter in the report.\n\nThe Director of the Audit Office, Professor Lin Zhiyuan\n\nThe Audit Bureau of Circulation at 66 Golden Bell Road\n\nThe following is a list of the most commonly used verbs."}

{"en":"The year of 2019 has been anything but uneventful.\n\nUS-China trade tensions remained a big wild card. Lingering uncertainties over trade talks between the world’s two largest economies rattled investor confidence and undermined international trade, manufacturing, investment and even consumption. Gone are the days when global economic expansion was a given. The global economy entered a synchronised slowdown during the year. In response to the slower growth, major central banks around the world have reversed course on their monetary policy normalisation.\n\nLocally, social incidents happening in the second half of the year dealt a further blow to the Hong Kong economy. The retail, tourism and catering sectors were among the hardest hit. For 2019 as a whole, the Hong Kong economy contracted by 1.2%, the first annual decline in a decade, while the unemployment rate rose to 3.3% from a multi-year low of 2.8% at the beginning of the year. As 2020 dawned, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak posed yet another significant threat to both global and local economies.\n\nIn the face of such an uncertain and challenging environment, it is of paramount importance to maintain monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong, as I made clear when taking over as Chief Executive of the HKMA on 1 October 2019.\n\n# Monetary and financial stability: the bedrock of an international financial centre\n\nThe Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) in place since 1983 has helped Hong Kong weather numerous challenges and shocks, demonstrating its important role as an anchor of Hong Kong’s economic prosperity and status as an international financial centre. Notwithstanding the challenging external and domestic environment during the year, the LERS continued to operate in a smooth and orderly manner, once again proving its resilience in times of uncertainty. Hong Kong’s banking system also remained sound and robust. The facts speak for themselves: the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained stable and has strengthened to the strong side of the Convertibility Zone in recent months, while bank deposits continued to grow during the year. In a nutshell, no noticeable outflow of funds from the Hong Kong dollar or the banking system was observed.\n\nThe stability of Hong Kong’s monetary and banking systems reflects not only the robustness of, but also strong confidence in, our systems. This did not happen overnight, but through years of efforts to build up buffers and strengthen surveillance, complemented by our swift response to rumours on social media platforms.\n\nOur preparations over the years for rainy days have built a solid foundation and strong buffers for Hong Kong’s monetary and banking systems. In addition to the vast foreign exchange reserves in our public coffers, our banking system has strong capital buffers, robust liquidity and very good asset quality, whether by international or historical standards. The eight rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures on property mortgages implemented since 2009 have also greatly enhanced banks’ resilience against a property market downturn.\n\nMarket surveillance and banking supervision make up the core part of our work in maintaining monetary and banking stability, and we have been strengthening our surveillance and supervisory framework from time to time. Apart from close monitoring of the credit and liquidity risks of banks, one of our new endeavours in the year was to make use of technology and granular data collected from banks to enhance our capability to monitor Hong Kong dollar funding and financial market activities in a more in-depth and timely manner. Stress tests and contingency planning have also been augmented in the light of the fast evolving economic and operating environment.\n\nIndeed, our robust regulatory regime has won strong endorsements internationally. During the year, the International Monetary Fund reaffirmed that Hong Kong was well placed to address both cyclical and structural changes, given its significant buffers. Hong Kong’s effective legal and institutional framework for combatting money laundering and terrorist financing also obtained a positive assessment from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), making Hong Kong the first in the Asia-pacific region to achieve an overall compliant result in the FATF’s Mutual Evaluation.\n\nConfidence is the foundation for the proper functioning of markets and is crucial to the safeguarding of monetary and financial stability. To maintain market confidence, we have to be on high alert for, and respond swiftly to, any malicious rumours that may potentially cast doubt on Hong Kong’s monetary or banking systems. This is particularly important given the prevalent use of social media and instant messaging nowadays. While a variety of rumours were spread on social media platforms by fearmongers during the outbreak of social unrest, our quick and clear rebuttals to these rumours through social media, in addition to traditional media, proved useful and effective in clearing the air, quelling false rumours from spreading further, and upholding international and public confidence in our systems.\n\n# Banking system: an important pillar of economic activity\n\nThe banking sector, as an essential pillar of economic activity, plays a fundamental role in ensuring the smooth running of society and the economy. Despite the challenging operating environment since the latter half of the year, banks have been working hard alongside others and doing their utmost to maintain normal operation of their core functions and continue serving businesses and the public.\n\nIn addition to basic banking services like deposits and transfers, an important function of banks is in extending credit to borrowers in support of the real economy. We are well aware of, and concerned about, the cash-flow problem facing businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), under the difficult economic conditions. While safeguarding banking stability, we have launched a number of initiatives to ensure continued funding support to SMEs. In particular, the Countercyclical Capital Buffer ratio of banks was reduced on two occasions, in October 2019 and March 2020, by a total of 150 basis points to 1.0%; the level of regulatory reserve requirement on banks was also reduced by half in April 2020. These measures release a total of around HK$1 trillion in lending capacity, providing banks with more room for lending to enterprises including SMEs. We have also set up a platform – the Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism – bringing together major banks in Hong Kong to explore and discuss specific measures to strengthen funding support for SMEs. I am pleased to see that many banks have responded proactively to our call and introduced relief measures such as principal moratorium for customers in need to ride out the storm.\n\nIn view of some SMEs’ feedback about difficulties in opening bank accounts, which is the very first step in accessing various banking services, we have made dedicated efforts to address this issue over the past few years. Our work is bearing fruit, as improvement in account opening for businesses is visible. As a further step to promote financial inclusion, the HKMA spearheaded the launch of tiered account services – Simple Bank Accounts (SBAs) with a streamlined customer due diligence process – to provide start-ups and SMEs with an alternative to traditional bank accounts. More than 2,800 SBAs have been opened so far.\n\n# International financial centre: from strength to strength\n\nWe have always been mindful of the need to strike a reasonable balance between regulation and development. Given the intense competition among financial centres, we have to work hard to strengthen Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre and thereby ensure its longer term stability. There are four key areas of work: technology, green finance, financial connectivity with the Mainland, and talent development.\n\n# Embracing technology in the digital era\n\nHong Kong has been moving fast in promoting financial technology (fintech) since the establishment of the HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office in 2016 and the introduction of the Smart Banking initiatives in 2017.\n\nOn the payment front, the vibrancy of the fintech ecosystem is evident in the strong momentum in the adoption of the Faster Payment System (FPS), the world’s first multi-currency, cross-banks and e-wallets, real-time retail payment platform. FPS registrations reached four million within a short span of 15 months, representing a high rate of penetration in a population of 7.5 million people. The Government has also adopted the FPS to provide the public with greater convenience in paying taxes, rates and water charges. More and more businesses are expected to use this fast, safe and convenient means of receiving and making payment to enhance operational efficiency.\n\nIn the banking sector, significant progress was seen in applying fintech to their banking services and business operations. According to a study conducted by the HKMA, almost 90% of the surveyed retail banks have adopted, or are planning to adopt, artificial intelligence in their business applications. With the HKMA’s facilitation, banks have been applying big data and consumer behavioural analytics in their personal credit products. They have also launched over 800 Open Application programming Interfaces in the first two phases, covering a range of banking products and services. While encouraging banks to use fintech, we did not lose sight of the need for enhanced technology risk management and consumer protection in digital banking services. Timely supervisory guidance has been provided to banks in these areas.\n\nRegulatory technology (Regtech) is another area of great interest to banks, for its potential of enabling banks to conduct regulatory compliance and risk management, particularly in anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT), more efficiently and cost-effectively. To facilitate greater industry adoption of Regtech and the building of a wider Regtech ecosystem, the HKMA organised the inaugural AML\/CFT Regtech Forum and issued its first Regtech newsletter in November to discuss possible use cases of Regtech. At the same time, the HKMA, as a banking supervisor, is exploring the use of supervisory technology (Suptech), including new data science and analytics, to enhance work effectiveness and efficiency. We have embarked on a series of studies and developed a road map for the implementation of Suptech in the next few years.\n\nFrom a broader perspective, this is only the start of the fintech journey in the banking sector. The HKMA granted eight licences to virtual banks during the year. One of the virtual banks officially launched its services in March 2020, while some other virtual banks have commenced pilot trials through the HKMA’s Fintech Supervisory Sandbox. I look forward to the launch of the other virtual banks and the introduction of more innovative and diversified banking services to the people of Hong Kong that would help raise the global competitiveness of our banking sector.\n\nMore exciting developments are also expected at the international level. After successfully completing a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) trial to connect our blockchain-based trade finance platform, eTradeConnect, with its European counterpart, we are conducting another PoC trial with the platform of the people’s Bank of China, paving the way for the digitalisation of cross-border trades. We have begun a joint research project with the Bank of Thailand to study the application of Central Bank Digital Currency to cross-border payments. The Bank for International Settlements also put its first Innovation Hub Centre into operation in Hong Kong in November to foster fintech collaboration within the central banking community. All these developments present clear evidence of Hong Kong’s leading global position in fintech development.\n\n# Promoting green and sustainable finance for a better future\n\nClimate-related risks have drawn increasing global attention in recent years. To contribute to the global efforts in addressing this challenge, the HKMA unveiled three key measures in May to promote green finance development in Hong Kong in different capacities.\n\nAs a banking supervisor, the HKMA is undertaking a three-phased approach to promoting green and sustainable banking. A framework for assessing the “greenness” of banks has been developed for industry consultation under phase I, paving the way for the formulation of supervisory expectations and requirements for the banking industry under phase II and implementation under phase III.\n\nAs the manager of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA actively advances responsible investment by integrating environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into its investment activities. Specifically, we have adopted the principle of giving priority to green and ESG investments if their long-term return is comparable to other investments on a risk-adjusted basis. After venturing into the green bond market in 2015 as one of the early investors, we will continue to grow our green bond portfolio and invest in other ESG assets. We will also join hands with like-minded investors and regulators to promote best practices on ESG through our participation in international organisations in the ESG community.\n","terms":{"\"Capital

貨幣及金融穩定：國際金融中心的基石\n\n自1983年實施的聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）已協助香港應對無數挑戰和衝擊，證明其作為香港經濟繁榮和國際金融中心地位的支柱，具有重要作用。儘管該年面對艱難的外部和內部環境，聯匯制度仍能繼續平穩有序地運作，再次證明其在不確定時期的韌性。香港的銀行體系亦保持穩健和強韌。事實勝於雄辯：港元匯率保持穩定，並在最近幾個月升至兌換區間的強方，而銀行存款在該年亦持續增長。簡而言之，並未觀察到港元或銀行體系有明顯的資金外流情況。\n\n香港貨幣及銀行體系的穩定，不僅反映了我們體系的強韌性，也反映了人們對我們體系的高度信心。這並非一蹴而就，而是經過多年努力建立緩衝機制和強化監管，並輔以迅速回應社交媒體平台上的謠言而達致的。\n\n我們多年來為應對困難時期而作的準備，為香港的貨幣及銀行體系建立了堅實的基礎和強大的緩衝機制。除了龐大的外匯儲備，我們的銀行體系亦擁有強大的資本緩衝、充裕的流動性和優良的資產質素，無論是按國際標準還是歷史標準來看均如此。自2009年以來，我們實施了八輪逆周期宏觀審慎措施以規管按揭物業，亦大大增強了銀行抵禦物業市場下滑的能力。\n\n市場監察和銀行監管是我們維持貨幣及銀行穩定的核心工作，我們亦不時強化監察和監管框架。除了密切監察銀行的信用及流動性風險外，我們在該年的新舉措之一是利用科技和從銀行收集的細緻數據，以提升我們更深入和及時監察港元資金流向及金融市場活動的能力。鑑於經濟和營運環境迅速變化，壓力測試和應變規劃亦得到強化。\n\n事實上，我們強而有力的監管制度已獲得國際上的高度認可。在該年，國際貨幣基金組織重申，鑑於香港擁有龐大的緩衝機制，香港有能力應對周期性和結構性的變化。香港在打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集方面的有效法律及制度框架，亦獲得財務行動特別組織（FATF）的正面評價，令香港成為亞太區首個在FATF的相互評估中取得全面合規結果的地區。\n\n信心是市場正常運作的基礎，亦是保障貨幣及金融穩定的關鍵。為維持市場信心，我們必須高度警惕並迅速回應任何可能對香港貨幣或銀行體系造成質疑的惡意謠言。鑑於現今社交媒體和即時通訊的普及，這一點尤為重要。在社會動盪期間，恐懼散播者曾在社交媒體平台上散播各種謠言，但我們透過社交媒體及傳統媒體迅速和清晰地駁斥這些謠言，證明了這方法有效地澄清了事實、遏止了虛假謠言的進一步散播，並維持了國際社會和公眾對我們體系的信心。\n\n# 銀行體系：經濟活動的重要支柱\n\n銀行業作為經濟活動的重要支柱，在確保社會和經濟的順利運作方面發揮著根本性的作用。儘管自下半年以來營運環境充滿挑戰，銀行與各界攜手努力，竭盡所能維持核心功能的正常運作，並繼續為企業和市民提供服務。\n\n除了存款和轉帳等基本銀行服務外，銀行的重要功能之一是向借款人提供信貸以支持實體經濟。我們深知並關注企業（尤其是中小企）在艱難的經濟環境下所面對的現金流問題。在保障銀行體系穩定的同時，我們推出了一系列措施以確保中小企持續獲得資金支持。具體而言，銀行的逆周期緩衝資本比率在2019年10月及2020年3月兩次下調，共下調150基點至1.0%；銀行的監管儲備水平亦在2020年4月減半。這些措施釋放了合共約1萬億港元的借貸空間，為銀行提供更多空間向企業（包括中小企）提供貸款。我們亦設立了一個平台──銀行業中小企貸款協調機制──匯聚香港主要銀行，以探討和商議具體措施，強化對中小企的資金支持。我很高興看到，許多銀行已積極響應我們的呼籲，並推出紓緩措施，例如為有需要的客戶提供本金還款寬免，以助他們渡過難關。\n\n有見及部分中小企反映在開立銀行帳戶（這是使用各種銀行服務的第一步）時遇到困難，我們在過去幾年已作出專項努力以解決這個問題。我們的工作已取得成果，企業開立帳戶的情況已有顯著改善。為進一步推動普惠金融，金管局領先推出分層帳戶服務──簡易帳戶（SBAs），其客戶盡職審查程序經已簡化──為初創企業和中小企提供傳統銀行帳戶以外的選擇。迄今為止，已開立超過2,800個簡易帳戶。\n\n# 國際金融中心：從強到強\n\n我們一直謹記要在監管與發展之間取得合理平衡的需要。鑑於金融中心之間的競爭激烈，我們必須努力強化香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力，從而確保其長期穩定。有四個主要工作範疇：科技、綠色金融、與內地的金融聯繫，以及人才發展。\n\n# 在數位時代擁抱科技\n\n自2016年成立金融科技促進辦公室及2017年推出智慧銀行計劃以來，香港在推動金融科技方面發展迅速。\n\n在支付方面，金融科技生態系統的活力顯而易見，快速支付系統（FPS）的採用率強勁上升，就是明證。FPS是全球首個多貨幣、跨銀行及電子錢包的即時零售支付平台。FPS的註冊帳戶數目在短短15個月內已達400萬，在750萬人口中佔據了很高的滲透率。政府亦採用了FPS，為市民提供更便捷的稅款、差餉及水費繳交方式。預期將有更多企業使用這個快速、安全及便捷的收付款方式，以提升營運效率。\n\n在銀行業方面，在將金融科技應用於銀行服務和業務營運方面取得了顯著進展。根據金管局進行的一項研究，近90%受訪零售銀行已採用或計劃採用人工智能於業務應用中。在金管局的推動下，銀行已將大數據和消費者行為分析應用於個人信貸產品中。他們亦在首兩階段推出了超過800個開放應用程式介面，涵蓋一系列銀行產品及服務。在鼓勵銀行使用金融科技的同時，我們亦沒有忽視強化數位銀行服務的科技風險管理和消費者保障的需要。我們已及時向銀行提供這些範疇的監管指引。\n\n合規科技（Regtech）是銀行的另一個關注範疇，因其潛力可讓銀行更有效及更具成本效益地進行監管合規及風險管理，尤其是在打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集（AML\/CFT）方面。為促進業界更廣泛地採用合規科技及建立更龐大的合規科技生態圈，金管局在11月舉辦了首個AML\/CFT合規科技論壇，並發行了首份合規科技通訊，以探討合規科技的可能應用案例。同時，金管局作為銀行業監管機構，正在探索使用監管科技（Suptech），包括新的數據科學和分析技術，以提升工作成效和效率。我們已展開一系列研究，並制定了未來幾年實施監管科技的路線圖。\n\n從更廣闊的角度看，這只是銀行業金融科技之旅的開始。金管局在該年向八家虛擬銀行發出了牌照。其中一家虛擬銀行在2020年3月正式推出服務，而其他虛擬銀行亦已透過金管局的金融科技監管沙盒展開試點測試。我期待其他虛擬銀行的推出，以及為香港市民提供更多創新和多元化的銀行服務，以提升我們銀行業的全球競爭力。\n\n在國際層面，亦預期會有更多令人興奮的發展。在成功完成將我們的區塊鏈貿易融資平台eTradeConnect與其歐洲同類平台連接的概念驗證試驗後，我們正與中國人民銀行的平台進行另一項概念驗證試驗，為跨境貿易的數位化鋪路。我們亦與泰國中央銀行展開了一項聯合研究項目，以研究央行數位貨幣在跨境支付中的應用。國際結算銀行亦在11月於香港設立了首個創新樞紐中心，以促進央行界別內的金融科技合作。所有這些發展均明確顯示香港在金融科技發展方面的全球領先地位。\n\n# 推動綠色及永續金融，共創美好未來\n\n與氣候相關的風險近年來日益受到全球關注。為推動全球應對這一挑戰的努力，金管局在五月推出了三項關鍵措施，以不同身份促進香港綠色金融的發展。\n\n作為銀行業監管機構，金管局正採取三階段方法以推動綠色及永續銀行業務。在第一期下，已制定一個評估銀行「綠度」的框架供業界諮詢，為第二期制定銀行業的監管期望及要求，以及第三期的實施工作鋪路。\n\n作為外匯基金的經理，金管局積極推動負責任投資，將環境、社會及治理（ESG）因素納入投資活動中。具體而言，我們採用了一項原則，即在經風險調整後，若綠色及ESG投資的長期回報與其它投資相若，則優先考慮綠色及ESG投資。我們在2015年作為早期投資者之一進軍綠色債券市場後，將繼續擴大我們的綠色債券組合，並投資於其他ESG資產。我們亦將與志同道合的投資者和監管機構攜手合作，透過參與國際ESG組織，推廣ESG的最佳實踐。"}
{"en":"# Highlights of 2019\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nThe Hong Kong economy softens in 2019 amid global economic slowdown, lingering US-China trade tensions and local social incidents, while the labour market faces increasing pressures.\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector remains sound and resilient, with strong capital positions, robust liquidity and healthy asset quality.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nDespite the challenging external and internal environment, Hong Kong’s monetary system is firmly intact, as evidenced by the stable Hong Kong dollar exchange rate and the smooth functioning of the foreign exchange and money markets. This reflects not only the robustness of but also strong confidence in Hong Kong’s monetary system. \n\nA new Resolution Facility is introduced and a number of refinements are made within the HKMA’s updated Liquidity Facilities Framework.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA puts great effort in monitoring the credit and liquidity risk management of banks to maintain banking stability. Good progress is also made on promoting smart banking, including the granting of eight virtual bank licences and encouraging the adoption of regulatory technology. These efforts are complemented by strengthened supervision of banks’ technology risk management and enhanced consumer protection in digital financial services.\n\nThe HKMA streamlines investor protection measures to enhance customer experience while taking further steps to promote a customer-centric bank culture.\n\nHong Kong’s anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism regime earns positive assessment from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), making it the first FATF-member jurisdiction in the Asia-pacific region to achieve an overall compliant result in FATF’s fourth-round Mutual Evaluation.\n\nNew rules and regulations are rolled out to enhance the banking regulatory regime in line with the latest international standards. A three-phased approach is announced to promote green and sustainable banking in Hong Kong, contributing to global efforts in addressing climate change.\n\nAt the same time, the HKMA makes significant progress in operationalising the resolution regime for banks, in particular driving the build-up of a new layer of loss-absorbing capacity at domestic systemically important banks to promote financial stability.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\nThe fintech ecosystem in Hong Kong is gaining strong momentum, with good progress in the implementation of the Open Application programming Interface Framework in the banking sector, establishment of the world’s first Bank for International Settlements Innovation Hub Centre, and continued increase in the use of the Faster payment System for e-payments.\n\nHong Kong maintains a firm foothold as the global hub for offshore renminbi business. In the context of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area development, financial connectivity with the Mainland is being enhanced, and access to financial services by Hong Kong residents is made more convenient.\n\nMuch effort is made to open up new opportunities to further enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, particularly in infrastructure investment and financing, green finance and private equity funds.\n\nThe Hong Kong Academy of Finance is set up to serve as a centre of excellence for developing financial leadership and a repository of knowledge in monetary and financial research, including applied research.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\nBenefiting from a favourable investment environment, the Exchange Fund achieves the second highest investment income on record, of HK$262.2 billion, representing an investment return of 6.6%.\n\nThe HKMA deepens its effort in investment diversification, especially into the LongTerm Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The LTGP records an annualised internal rate of return of 12.6% since its inception in 2009. There is also encouraging progress in advancing responsible investment.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communication with the community and the market through traditional and social media, website, Information Centre and various other channels to facilitate public understanding of its policies and operations.\n\nWithin the institution, the HKMA attaches great importance to upholding corporate governance by supporting professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline and enhancing IT security to cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives and the increasing complexity of work.\n","terms":{"\"Capital preservation First, Long-Term Growth Next\"":["保本先行、長期增值"],"10 Years plus Caring Organisation

經濟及金融環境\n\n2019年，在全球經濟放緩、中美貿易緊張局勢持續，以及本地社會事件的影響下，香港經濟轉弱，勞工市場亦面臨日益增大的壓力。\n\n香港銀行業保持穩健及具彈性，資本狀況充裕、流動資金充足，資產質素亦維持健康。\n\n# 貨幣穩定\n\n儘管面對嚴峻的外部及內部環境，香港的貨幣體系依然穩健。港元匯率穩定，外匯市場及貨幣市場運作暢順，充分反映了香港貨幣體系的強韌性及市場對該體系的高度信心。\n\n金管局引入了一項新的處置資金安排，並對其更新的流動資金安排架構作出了多項優化。\n\n# 銀行體系穩定\n\n金管局為維持銀行體系穩定，在監察銀行的信貸及流動資金風險管理方面投放了大量資源。在推動智慧銀行方面亦取得良好進展，包括發出了八張虛擬銀行牌照，以及鼓勵採用合規科技。此外，金管局亦加強了對銀行科技風險管理的監管，並強化了數碼金融服務的消費者保障。\n\n金管局簡化了投資者保障措施，以提升客戶體驗，並採取進一步措施，推動以客為本的銀行文化。\n\n香港在打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集方面，獲得財務行動特別組織（FATF）的正面評估，成為亞太區內首個在FATF第四輪相互評估中達致全面合規結果的FATF成員地區。\n\n為強化銀行體系監管制度，以符合最新的國際標準，香港推出了新的規則及規例。香港亦宣布了一項分三階段的措施，以推動綠色及可持續銀行業務，為應對氣候變化作出全球性貢獻。\n\n同時，金管局在落實銀行處置機制方面取得重大進展，尤其是在本地具系統重要性銀行建立新的虧損吸收能力層面，以促進金融穩定。\n\n# 國際金融中心\n\n香港金融科技生態系統發展強勁，在銀行業落實開放應用程式介面（開放API）框架方面取得良好進展，成立了全球首個國際結算銀行創新樞紐中心，而「轉數快」快速支付系統在電子支付方面的使用量亦持續上升。\n\n香港繼續穩佔全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位。在粵港澳大灣區發展的背景下，與內地的金融聯繫正不斷強化，香港居民使用金融服務亦更為便捷。\n\n香港致力開拓新機遇，以進一步提升金融平台的競爭力，尤其是在基建投資及融資、綠色金融及私募股權基金方面。\n\n香港金融學院成立，旨在成為培育金融業領袖人才的匯聚點，以及貨幣與金融研究的知識庫，包括應用研究。\n\n# 儲備管理\n\n受惠於有利的投資環境，外匯基金錄得有記錄以來第二高的投資收入，達2,622億港元，投資回報率為6.6%。\n\n金管局加大力度推動投資多元化，尤其是長期增長組合（LTGP）。自2009年成立以來，LTGP的年化內部回報率為12.6%。在推動負責任投資方面，亦取得令人鼓舞的進展。\n\n# 機構職能\n\n金管局透過傳統媒體、社交媒體、網站、資訊中心及其他渠道，與社會及市場保持有效溝通，以促進公眾對金管局政策及運作的了解。\n\n在機構內部，金管局高度重視維護公司治理，支持員工的專業發展，建立嚴格的財政紀律，並強化資訊科技保安，以應對推行新措施及工作日益複雜化所帶來的挑戰。"}

{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nThe Hong Kong economy contracted in 2019, reflecting global economic slowdown, lingering US-China trade conflicts and local social incidents. As economic conditions deteriorated rapidly in the second half of the year, the labour market faced increasing pressures. Inflation also increased due to a sharp rise in pork prices. Economic performance for 2020 is expected to remain challenging as the novel coronavirus outbreak hits the already weakening economy. Given the difficult economic environment, the Government and the HKMA have rolled out measures to support the economy, especially households and small and medium-sized enterprises.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Real activities\n\nFollowing a 2.9% expansion in 2018, the Hong Kong economy contracted by 1.2% in 2019, marking the first annual contraction since 2009. In particular, the economy entered into a recession in the second half of the year, with the seasonally adjusted real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) shrinking consecutively in the second, third and fourth quarters (Table 1). The decline in economic activities reflected a notable reduction in domestic demand (Chart 1). As the local social incidents weighed significantly on consumption activities and sentiments in the latter part of the year, private consumption expenditure recorded the first annual decline since 2003. Overall investment spending also dropped amid dampened business sentiments. On the external front, slowing global economic growth and additional tariffs levied amid the US-China trade tensions led to a decline in Hong Kong’s exports of goods. Exports of services also saw the largest annual decline on record because the social incidents led to a severe deterioration in inbound tourism. With smaller domestic and re-export-induced demand, imports of goods and services also worsened. On a net basis, net trade contributed positively to GDP in 2019 (Chart 1) because total imports declined even faster than total exports.\n\nIn view of the strong economic headwinds, the Government introduced several rounds of measures between August and December 2019 to alleviate the financial burden of residents, safeguard jobs and support enterprises, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as well as those in the hard-hit sectors, such as retail, food services, transport and tourism. To allow banks to be more supportive to the domestic economy and help mitigate the economic cycle, the HKMA announced on 14 October a reduction in the Countercyclical Capital Buffer ratio of banks from 2.5% to 2.0%, thereby providing banks with more flexibility to release HK$200–300 billion in bank credit to enterprises including SMEs, and also established a Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism. A new relief measure for the 80% Guarantee product of the SME Financing Guarantee Scheme (SFGS) was introduced in September, allowing SME borrowers facing weakening cash flows to apply for principal moratorium to get immediate support. Further, a new 90% loan guarantee product under the SFGS was introduced in December to provide additional support to SMEs, businesses with relatively less operating experience, as well as professionals seeking to set up their own practices, to obtain financing.\n\n# Monetary conditions\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate and money markets functioned in a smooth and orderly manner in 2019. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained broadly stable throughout the year. As the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking was triggered in March, the HKMA purchased Hong Kong dollars from, and sold US dollars to, banks at the rate of HK$7.85\/US$1, leading to a decline in the Aggregate Balance in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System. The Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained largely steady at the longer end, while short-term rates generally picked up. At the retail level, several retail banks lowered their Best Lending Rates by 12.5 basis points in late October following the decreases in the target range for the US federal funds rate. As for monetary aggregates, total bank loans increased by 6.7% in 2019, up from 4.4% in 2018, and total deposits grew by 2.9% during the year.\n\n# Inflation\n\nThe underlying inflation rate, which nets out the effects of the Government’s one-off relief measures, rose slightly to 3.0% in 2019, from 2.6% in 2018. The mild increase in inflation was mainly driven by the elevated pork prices due to the disrupted supply of fresh pork since May (Chart 2). Excluding basic food items, price pressures were held at moderate levels throughout the year. In particular, the housing component of consumer price inflation softened in tandem with an earlier consolidation of fresh-letting private residential rentals. More broadly, the mild growth in nominal wages and the slower increase in commercial rentals1 helped keep local business costs in check. Externally, import price inflation moderated, in line with lower inflation in some of Hong Kong’s major import sources amid slower global economic growth.\n\n# Labour market\n\nThe labour market remained broadly resilient in the first half of 2019 but faced mounting pressures in the second half (Chart 3). After staying at a multi-year low of 2.8% in the first two quarters, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose to 2.9% in the third quarter and 3.3% in the final quarter, with those for the consumption and tourism-related sectors recording even more visible rises amid the social incidents. Overall labour demand also shrank visibly in the latter part of the year as total employment and the number of privatesector vacancies fell. The reduction in labour demand was particularly prominent in the retail, accommodation and food services sectors, as well as import\/export trade and construction sectors. On the supply side, the labour force participation rate edged down, partly due to a cyclical response to the economic recession. As the labour market came under increasing pressures, growth in nominal wage and earnings showed signs of a slowdown towards the end of the year.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe local stock market experienced sharp fluctuations during 2019. After a market rally in the first four months, the Hang Seng Index plunged in May due in part to concerns about the re-escalation of the US-China trade tensions (Chart 4). While recouping some lost ground in June in response to major central banks’ signals of a more accommodative monetary stance, stock prices came under pressure again amid slowing global economic growth and local social incidents. Towards the end of the year, stock prices regained some upward momentum following the announcement of a “phase one” trade agreement between the US and Mainland China. The Hang Seng Index finished the year at 28,190, registering an overall gain of 9.1% for the year. By contrast, the average daily turnover declined by about 19% from a year earlier. The listings of a major Mainland tech company and a leading beer manufacturer helped expand equity funds raised through initial public offerings (IpOs) to HK$314.2 billion in 2019. Hong Kong ranked first globally in terms of funds raised through IpOs for a second straight year in 2019.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market staged a strong rebound in the first five months of 2019 but generally softened in the remainder of the year. Market sentiment improved in early 2019 partly because concerns over US-China trade tensions temporarily eased, but the sentiment was dampened afterwards by the re-escalated US-China trade tensions, prolonged social incidents and weakened domestic economic conditions. Overall housing prices moderated by 5% from the peak in May through December, though still recording an annual growth of 5% due to a 10% rebound in the first five months (Chart 4). Transaction volume in 2019 increased by 4% to 59,797 units from a year earlier, reflecting the strong trading activities in the early part of the year. Housing affordability remained stretched, with the price-toincome ratio and the income-gearing ratio staying high at 17.9 and 80.9 respectively, far above their long-term averages.2 To assist home buyers with immediate housing needs, the Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation (HKMC) in mid-October raised the cap on the value of completed residential properties eligible for a mortgage loan under the Mortgage Insurance programme.3 On the other hand, the non-residential property market faced stronger downward pressures in 2019. In particular, both prices and rentals for retail premises registered the largest declines since the global financial crisis in 2008, reflecting the worsening business conditions during the year.\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nHong Kong’s economic performance for 2020 is expected to be very challenging, with significant near-term downside risks associated with the coronavirus outbreak. Some sectors, such as retail, accommodation, food services, tourism and transport, which have yet to recover from the disruptions caused by the social incidents, will be doubly hit. However, the countercyclical fiscal measures announced in the 2020\/21 Budget, which include a one-off cash handout and a new concessionary low-interest loan under the SFGS with 100% Government guarantee, are expected to provide some support to the economy, especially households and SMEs. On 16 March 2020, the HKMA further reduced the Countercyclical Capital Buffer ratio of banks from 2.0% to 1.0%, which will allow banks to be more supportive to the domestic economy, in particular those sectors and individuals that are expected to experience additional short-term stress due to the impact arising from the coronavirus outbreak. Analysed by GDP component, private consumption and investment are likely to remain weak because of the fragile consumer and business confidence. While government consumption will contribute to economic growth, public investment expenditure is anticipated to be relatively sluggish following the completion of some major infrastructure projects. On the external front, the “phase one” trade deal between the US and Mainland China is assessed to be slightly positive for the local economy in the short term. However, Hong Kong’s external trade performance will continue to be weighed down by weak global economic growth and trade flows. In particular, the coronavirus outbreak may lead to regional supply chain disruptions and slower cross-border economic activities, in tourism for example, thereby restraining Hong Kong’s exports. The Government forecasts real GDP growth for 2020 in the range of -1.5% to 0.5%, while growth forecasts by international organisations and privatesector analysts averaged -3.3%.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nInflationary pressures are expected to moderate in 2020 because of the sub-par economic conditions, the consolidation of private residential rentals and mild imported inflation. Market consensus forecasts a headline inflation rate for 2020 of 1.8%, and the Government projects the headline and underlying inflation rates to be 1.7% and 2.5% respectively. In the labour market, the unemployment rate is likely to rise further in the near term, given the weakened economic prospects and the coronavirus outbreak. privatesector analysts expect the unemployment rate to rise to about 4.0% in 2020.\n\n# Uncertainties and risks\n\nThe subdued economic outlook for 2020 is subject to a number of uncertainties and risks, including those stemming from the slowing global economy, US-China trade relations, Mainland’s economic performance, local social incidents and the persistence of the coronavirus outbreak. In particular, a prolonged coronavirus outbreak could trigger a more visible global economic slowdown and a repricing of assets, with the resulting unfavourable macroeconomic environment and tighter financial conditions posing further downward pressures on domestic real activities. However, the more concerted effort by major central banks to ease their monetary policies may provide a cushion against the negative economic impact inflicted by the outbreak.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector was resilient in 2019 despite the challenging environment with the global economic slowdown, US-China trade tensions and local social incidents. Bank balance sheet trends were stable, as both loans and deposits grew moderately. The capital and liquidity positions of the banking sector remained solid and asset quality held up well. The banking sector remained profitable with stable average return on asset.\n","terms":{"\"Capital preservation First, Long-Term Growth Next\"":["保本先行、長期增值"],"10 Years plus Caring Organisation

經濟及金融環境\n\n香港經濟於2019年出現萎縮，主因是全球經濟放緩、中美貿易摩擦持續，以及本地社會事件的影響。由於經濟情況在下半年迅速惡化，勞工市場面臨日益增大的壓力。通膨率也因豬肉價格飆升而上升。由於新型冠狀病毒爆發打擊本已疲弱的經濟，預期2020年的經濟表現仍將面臨嚴峻挑戰。有鑑於經濟環境困難，政府及金管局已推出措施支持經濟，尤其是家庭及中小企業。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 實體經濟活動\n\n2018年香港經濟成長2.9%，但2019年則萎縮1.2%，是自2009年以來首次出現年度衰退。尤其是經濟在下半年陷入衰退，經季節性調整後的實質國內生產毛額（GDP）在第二季、第三季及第四季連續萎縮（表1）。經濟活動下滑反映出國內需求顯著減弱（圖1）。由於本地社會事件在下半年對消費活動及信心造成重大影響，私人消費支出錄得自2003年以來首次全年下滑。營商信心疲弱亦導致整體投資支出下跌。對外方面，由於全球經濟成長放緩，加上中美貿易緊張局勢導致額外關稅被徵收，香港商品出口因而下跌。服務輸出亦錄得歷來最大年度跌幅，因為社會事件導致入境旅遊業嚴重受創。由於內需及轉口需求減弱，商品進口及服務輸入亦惡化。在淨額基礎上，由於進口總額跌幅大於出口總額，淨出口（貿易順差）在2019年對國內生產毛額仍有正面貢獻（圖1）。\n\n鑑於經濟面臨重大逆境，政府於2019年8月至12月期間推出多輪措施，以紓緩市民的財政負擔、保障就業和支持企業，尤其是中小企業，以及受重創行業（如零售、餐飲、運輸及旅遊業）的企業。為讓銀行更能支持國內經濟和協助緩減經濟週期，金管局於10月14日宣布將銀行的逆週期緩衝資本比率由2.5%下調至2.0%，讓銀行有更大空間釋放2,000億至3,000億港元的銀行貸款予企業（包括中小企業），並設立銀行業中小企業貸款協調機制。中小企業融資擔保計劃（中小企擔保計劃）於9月推出八成信貸擔保產品的新紓緩措施，讓面臨現金流轉弱化的中小企業借款人申請暫緩償還本金，以獲得即時支持。此外，中小企擔保計劃於12月推出一項新的九成信貸擔保產品，為中小企業、營商經驗較少的企業，以及有意創業的專業人士提供額外支援，以助他們取得融資。\n\n# 貨幣狀況\n\n2019年香港港元匯率及貨幣市場運作順暢有序。港元匯率在全年大致維持穩定。由於弱方兌換保證在3月被觸發，金管局按聯繫匯率制度的設計，向銀行買入港元及沽出美元，港元匯率定於7.85港元兌1美元，令結餘總額下跌。港元銀行同業拆息在較長期限大致維持平穩，而短期利率則普遍上升。在零售層面，多間零售銀行於10月下旬下調最優惠貸款利率12.5基點，以反映美國聯邦基金利率目標區間的下調。在貨幣總體數字方面，銀行總貸款在2019年上升6.7%，高於2018年的4.4%，而總存款在該年則上升2.9%。\n\n# 通膨\n\n扣除政府一次性紓困措施的影響後，基本通膨率在2019年略升至3.0%，高於2018年的2.6%。通膨輕微上升主要是由於豬肉供應自5月起受阻，導致豬肉價格上升（圖2）。若撇除基本食品項目，價格壓力在全年維持於溫和水平。尤其是消費物價指數中的租金項目隨著早前私人住宅新租約租金回穩而有所緩和。更廣泛而言，名義工資輕微上升，而商業樓宇租金升幅放緩，均有助控制本地營商成本。對外方面，進口貨價通膨緩和，與部分香港主要進口來源地的通膨因全球經濟成長放緩而下跌的情況相符。\n\n# 勞工市場\n\n勞工市場在2019年上半年大致維持穩健，但在下半年則面臨更大壓力（圖3）。經季節性調整的失業率在首兩季維持於2.8%的多年低點，但在第三季及第四季分別上升至2.9%及3.3%，當中消費及旅遊相關行業的升幅更為顯著，反映出社會事件的影響。整體勞工需求在下半年亦顯著收縮，總就業人數及私人機構職缺數目均下跌。勞工需求減弱的情況在零售、住宿及餐飲業，以及進出口貿易和營造業尤為明顯。在供應方面，勞動人口參與率有所下跌，部分原因是經濟衰退引致的週期性反應。隨著勞工市場面臨更大壓力，名義工資及收入的升幅在接近年底時顯現放緩跡象。\n\n# 股市\n\n本地股市在2019年出現大幅波動。市場在首四個月造好，但恒生指數在5月下跌，部分原因是市場憂慮中美貿易緊張局勢再度升級（圖4）。雖然股市在6月回升部分失地，反映主要央行發出採取更寬鬆貨幣政策的訊號，但股價在全球經濟成長放緩及本地社會事件的影響下再度受壓。臨近年底，股價重拾升勢，原因是中美兩國宣布達成「第一階段」貿易協議。恒生指數在年底收報28,190點，全年上升9.1%。相比之下，平均每日成交額較前一年下跌約19%。一間內地科技巨企及一間領先啤酒生產商上市，令2019年透過首次公開招股籌集的股本資金增至3,142億港元。香港在2019年連續第二年成為全球首次公開招股籌集資金最多的地區。\n\n# 房地產市場\n\n住宅房地產市場在2019年首五個月表現強勁，但其後在餘下時間普遍轉弱。市場氣氛在2019年初有所改善，部分原因是市場對中美貿易緊張局勢的憂慮暫時緩和，但其後氣氛因中美貿易緊張局勢再度升級、社會事件持續及本地經濟情況轉弱而受壓。整體房價由5月的高點至12月回落5%，但全年仍錄得5%的升幅，原因是房價在首五個月反彈10%（圖4）。2019年的成交量較前一年上升4%至59,797宗，反映年初的買賣活動暢旺。置業負擔能力仍然緊張，房價與收入比率及收入槓桿比率分別維持在高位的17.9及80.9，遠高於其長期平均值。為協助有即時置業需要的買家，香港按揭證券有限公司（按揭證券公司）於10月中調高按揭保險計劃下合資格新造住宅物業的按揭貸款金額上限。另一方面，非住宅房地產市場在2019年面臨更大的下跌壓力。尤其是零售物業的價格及租金均錄得自2008年全球金融危機以來最大跌幅，反映該年營商環境惡化。\n\n# 經濟展望\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n預期香港2020年的經濟表現將非常嚴峻，短期內面臨與冠狀病毒爆發相關的重大下行風險。零售、住宿、餐飲、旅遊及運輸等行業尚未從社會事件所造成的衝擊中復原，將再受雙重打擊。然而，2020至21年度《財政預算案》宣布的逆週期財政措施，包括一次性派發現金及中小企擔保計劃下由政府百分百擔保的特惠低息貸款，預期會為經濟（尤其是家庭及中小企業）提供一定支持。2020年3月16日，金管局進一步將銀行的逆週期緩衝資本比率由2.0%下調至1.0%，讓銀行更能支持國內經濟，尤其是那些預期會因冠狀病毒爆發所引致的影響而面臨額外短期壓力的行業及人士。按國內生產毛額各組成部分分析，由於消費者及營商信心脆弱，私人消費及投資預期會維持疲弱。政府消費將為經濟成長作出貢獻，但公共投資支出預期會較為疲弱，原因是部分大型基礎建設項目已完成。對外方面，中美兩國達成的「第一階段」貿易協議預期在短期內對本地經濟略為有利。然而，香港對外貿易表現將繼續受全球經濟成長及貿易流量疲弱所拖累。尤其是冠狀病毒爆發可能導致區域供應鏈運作受阻及跨境經濟活動（例如旅遊業）放緩，從而限制香港的出口。政府預測2020年實質國內生產毛額成長介乎負1.5%至0.5%之間，而國際組織及私人機構分析師的成長預測平均為負3.3%。\n\n# 通膨及勞工市場\n\n由於經濟情況欠佳、私人住宅租金回穩及輸入通膨輕微，預期通膨壓力在2020年會有所緩和。市場普遍預測2020年的整體通膨率為1.8%，而政府預測整體及基本通膨率分別為1.7%及2.5%。在勞工市場方面，由於經濟前景轉弱及冠狀病毒爆發，預期失業率在短期內會進一步上升。私人機構分析師預期失業率在2020年會上升至約4.0%。\n\n# 不確定因素及風險\n\n2020年的經濟展望疲弱，受多項不確定因素及風險所影響，包括全球經濟放緩、中美貿易關係、內地經濟表現、本地社會事件，以及冠狀病毒爆發持續。尤其是，若冠狀病毒爆發持續較長時間，可能引致更明顯的全球經濟放緩及資產價值重估，從而導致不利的宏觀經濟環境及更緊縮的金融狀況，對本地實體經濟活動構成進一步的下行壓力。然而，主要央行作出更協調一致的努力，放寬貨幣政策，可能有助緩減爆發對經濟造成的負面影響。\n\n# 銀行業表現\n\n儘管面臨全球經濟放緩、中美貿易緊張局勢及本地社會事件的嚴峻環境，香港銀行業在2019年仍保持穩健。銀行資產負債表走勢穩定，貸款及存款均溫和成長。銀行業的資本及流動性狀況維持穩健，資產品質亦保持良好。銀行業繼續錄得盈利，平均資產回報率穩定。"}
{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate and money markets functioned in a smooth and orderly manner in 2019. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained stable throughout the year and strengthened to the strong side of the Convertibility Zone towards the end of the year. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, the Linked Exchange Rate System has shown its resilience to shocks time after time.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability. This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n\n- Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks\n\n- Government-issued notes and coins in circulation the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of the clearing account balances of banks kept with the HKMA\n\n- Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs). When the demand for Hong Kong dollars is greater than the supply and the market exchange rate strengthens to the strong-side CU of HK$7.75 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to sell Hong Kong dollars to banks for US dollars upon request. The Aggregate Balance will then expand to push down Hong Kong dollar interest rates, creating monetary conditions that move the Hong Kong dollar away from the strong-side limit to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if the supply of Hong Kong dollars is greater than demand and the market exchange rate weakens to the weak-side CU of HK$7.85 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to buy Hong Kong dollars from banks upon request. The Aggregate Balance will then contract to drive Hong Kong dollar interest rates up, pushing the Hong Kong dollar away from the weak-side limit to stay within the Convertibility Zone.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2019\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nDespite uncertainties in the external environment and a slowdown in the domestic economy, the Hong Kong dollar remained stable and traded in a smooth and orderly manner in 2019. In the beginning of the year, the widening negative Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads attracted carry trade activities of selling Hong Kong dollars for US dollars, pushing the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate towards the weak-side CU of 7.85 (Chart 1). As the weakening of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate continued, the weak-side CU was eventually triggered eight times in March. Thereafter, the Hong Kong dollar continued to stay near the weak-side CU rate of 7.85. Since late May, the strong Hong Kong dollar demand arising from sizeable initial public offering (IPO) activities, corporates’ demand for dividend payment and the half-year closing had led the Hong Kong dollar to strengthen. While the Hong Kong dollar drifted lower after the half-year mark, it regained momentum from late October and stayed in the strong side of the Convertibility Zone towards the end of the year. This reflected partly equity-related demand including IPOs, and partly the unwinding of short Hong Kong dollar positions due to tightened liquidity near the year end. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market functioned normally throughout 2019.\n\nDue to the triggering of the weak-side CU, the total of the Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding EFBNs declined from HK$1,136.2 billion at the end of 2018 to HK$1,133.0 billion at the end of 2019 (Chart 2). During the year, the HKMA purchased a total of HK$22.1 billion at the request of banks at the weak-side CU of 7.85 in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), leading to a contraction of the Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) from HK$76.4 billion at the end of 2018 to HK$54.3 billion at the end of 2019. The outstanding EFBNs increased slightly from HK$1,059.8 billion to HK$1,078.7 billion during the year, reflecting the issuance of EFBNs to absorb EFBNs’ interest payments according to the established practice. The Monetary Base as a whole remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves. Total Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and Notes at HK$1,133 billion at end-2019.\n\n# Money market\n\nDuring 2019, the Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained largely steady at the longer end, while short-term rates broadly picked up (Chart 3). Short-term rates also experienced more fluctuations driven by IpO-related funding demand and seasonal liquidity needs. The reduction in the Aggregate Balance since April 2018 may have led to a higher sensitivity of the Hong Kong dollar interbank rates to changes in the supply and demand of Hong Kong dollar funding in the local market.\n\nThe Base Rate was adjusted downwards on 1 August, 19 September and 31 October by a total of 75 basis points, from 2.75% at the end of 2018 to 2.00% in early November, as the target range for the US federal funds rate moved downward three times by a total of 75 basis points from 2.25–2.50% to 1.50–1.75% during the year. On 18–26 November and 19–31 December, the Base Rate was set higher than 2.00%, reflecting a marked upward trend of the overnight and one-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs) in the last two months of the year. As such, the Base Rate closed at 2.49% at the end of 2019. The adjustment of the Base Rate was in accordance with the revised formula announced on 26 March 2009, which sets the Base Rate at either 50 basis points above the lower bound of the prevailing target range for the US federal funds rate or the average of the five-day moving averages of the overnight and one-month HIBORs, whichever is the higher. On the retail front, several retail banks lowered their Best Lending Rates by 12.5 basis points following the decrease in the target range for the US federal funds rate in late October.\n\nThe discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points widened during the first two months, broadly tracking the movements of the Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads, with the 12-month Hong Kong dollar forward points reaching about -708 pips in mid-February (Chart 4). Thereafter, along with the narrowing of the negative Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads, the discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points narrowed gradually and turned to premiums towards the end of the year. Overall, Hong Kong’s money markets operated in an orderly manner. Discount Window borrowing decreased to HK$38.3 billion in 2019 from HK$40.2 billion in 2018.\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nThe LERS has contributed significantly to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability for more than three decades and has shown its resilience in multiple regional and global financial crises. Against the backdrop of social incidents happening during the year, a number of unfounded rumours casting doubt on the LERS and financial stability of Hong Kong circulated in the social media. The HKMA acted promptly and vigorously to rebut the rumours and reassure the public through the use of both traditional and social media, reiterating that the LERS would remain in place and Hong Kong would not impose foreign exchange or capital controls. In addition, the HKMA issued a number of articles to help the public understand the LERS operation, the flow of funds and the interest rate outlook. These efforts were effective in maintaining public confidence in the LERS, as evidenced by the orderly functioning of the markets throughout the year. The Government is also firmly committed to the LERS. public confidence in the Government’s commitment and the use of the Hong Kong dollar as a means of payment and storage of value were further reinforced by the stability in the foreign exchange and money markets. In its 2019 Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund reaffirmed its long-standing support for the LERS as an anchor of Hong Kong’s financial stability, and commented that the LERS remained the appropriate exchange rate arrangement for Hong Kong underpinned by Hong Kong’s transparent rules, ample fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy, and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nA robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS. Hong Kong’s banking system is highly liquid and sound, with liquidity positions and capitalisation being well above the minimum international standards. To ensure the resilience of the banking sector, the HKMA has been closely monitoring banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and has maintained its supervisory efforts on corporate, propertyrelated and Mainland-related lending. With a smaller Aggregate Balance relative to previous years, banks have in general strengthened their liquidity management arrangements and have been more proactive in managing their day-to-day funding positions. Furthermore, the HKMA has maintained close dialogue with banks to ensure smooth recycling of liquidity in the market, especially ahead of and during the subscription periods of large IPOs. No settlement gridlocks were noted during the year, with the Discount Window continuing to function effectively and efficiently.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) moved within a range of 109.9–112.1% during 2019, without touching the Upper or Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 111.2% on 31 December (Chart 5). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. In the event of abrupt shocks, the sizeable amount of financial resources of the Exchange Fund, together with Hong Kong’s robust banking system, will provide powerful support to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\n# Other activities\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong. In 2019, the CBC considered issues including an event study on the LERS operations, the relationship between the Aggregate Balance and interest rates in Hong Kong, an improved and more flexible approach to options markets’ views about the LERS, and the impact of future IPOs on HIBORs. Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Research\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMR), formerly the Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research, pursues research studies on topics in monetary policy, banking and finance that are policy relevant. This is reflected in the wide array of topics explored by HKIMR researchers and overseas visitors and in its conferences and events. The HKIMR collaborates with major central banks and policy institutions to jointly organise policy-focused conferences. Its research visiting programmes support research projects on policy issues that are of importance to the HKMA, Hong Kong and the region.\n\nIn 2019, the HKIMR hosted 14 research scholars, published 17 working papers, and held 11 public seminars covering a broad range of economic, monetary and financial issues. It also organised three international conferences:\n\n- The Tenth Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy, titled “China’s Financial Reforms and Economic Transformation”, was held on 10–11 January in Hong Kong, organised jointly by the HKIMR, the Financial Research Institute of the people’s Bank of China and the Research Institute of Finance of the Development Research Centre of the State Council. The conference provided a world-class forum for economic experts from central banks, international institutions, academia and the financial industry to discuss issues related to the risks that Mainland’s financial sector faced in the light of changes introduced by financial reforms and Mainland’s economic development.\n","terms":{"\"Capital preservation First, Long-Term Growth

年，港元匯率和貨幣市場運作平穩有序。港元匯率全年保持穩定，並在年底趨向兌換區間的強方水平。聯繫匯率制度是香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石，屢次展現出其抵禦衝擊的能力。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的首要目標是維持貨幣穩定。這是指香港貨幣在對外匯市場上的匯率，以港元兌美元計算，維持在 7.75 至 7.85 的區間內，保持其對外匯兌換價值的穩定。貨幣體系的結構以貨幣發行局制度為特色，要求貨幣基礎至少 100% 由外匯基金持有的美元儲備支持，且貨幣基礎的變動需 100% 由相應的美元儲備變動匹配。\n\n貨幣基礎（表 1）包括以下部分：\n\n- 負債證明書，為三家發鈔銀行發行的紙幣提供全額擔保。\n\n- 政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣，以及總結餘，即銀行在金管局所持有的結算戶口結餘總和。\n\n- 金管局代表政府發行的外匯基金票據及債券（EFBNs）。\n\n港元匯率的穩定是透過自動利率調節機制和金管局對兌換保證的堅定承諾來維持的。當港元需求大於供應，市場匯率升至強方兌換保證匯率 7.75 港元兌 1 美元時，金管局會應銀行要求，以美元出售港元。屆時，總結餘將增加，推動港元利率下跌，創造貨幣條件，使港元匯率遠離強方上限，保持在 7.75 至 7.85 的兌換區間內。相反，當港元供應大於需求，市場匯率跌至弱方兌換保證匯率 7.85 港元兌 1 美元時，金管局會應銀行要求，買入港元。屆時，總結餘將減少，推動港元利率上升，使港元匯率遠離弱方上限，保持在兌換區間內。\n\n# 2019 年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定性\n\n儘管外部環境不確定，國內經濟放緩，但 2019 年港元匯率保持穩定，交易平穩有序。年初，港元與美元之間的負利差擴大，吸引了賣出港元買入美元的套息活動，使港元匯率趨向弱方兌換保證匯率 7.85（圖 1）。隨著港元匯率持續走弱，弱方兌換保證匯率在 3 月最終被觸發了八次。此後，港元匯率繼續維持在弱方兌換保證匯率 7.85 附近。自 5 月下旬起，大量新股集資活動、企業派息需求及半年結算等因素導致港元需求強勁，港元匯率因而走強。雖然港元匯率在半年結後有所下跌，但自 10 月下旬起重拾升勢，並在年底維持在兌換區間的強方水平。這部分反映了與股票相關的需求（包括新股集資活動），也部分反映了因年底流動性收緊而平倉港元短倉交易的情況。總體而言，2019 年港元匯率市場運作正常。\n\n由於弱方兌換保證匯率被觸發，總結餘（未計貼現窗）及未償還外匯基金票據及債券的總額由 2018 年底的 11,362 億元下降至 2019 年底的 11,330 億元（圖 2）。根據聯繫匯率制度的設計，金管局在年內應銀行要求，在弱方兌換保證匯率 7.85 共購買了 221 億元港元，導致總結餘（未計貼現窗）由 2018 年底的 764 億元收縮至 2019 年底的 543 億元。未償還外匯基金票據及債券在年內略有增加，由 10,598 億元增至 10,787 億元，反映了根據既定慣例發行外匯基金票據及債券以吸收其利息開支的情況。整體而言，貨幣基礎繼續獲外匯儲備充分支持。截至 2019 年底，總結餘（未計貼現窗）及未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額為 11,330 億元。\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n2019 年，港元銀行同業拆息在較長期限上大致保持穩定，而短期利率則普遍上升（圖 3）。短期利率亦因新股集資活動相關的資金需求及季節性流動性需求而出現較大波動。自 2018 年 4 月以來，總結餘的減少可能導致港元銀行同業拆息對本地市場港元資金供求變化的敏感度提高。\n\n由於美國聯邦基金利率目標區間在年內下調了三次，共 75 基點，由 2.25%-2.50% 降至 1.50%-1.75%，基本利率亦相應在 8 月 1 日、9 月 19 日及 10 月 31 日下調，共 75 基點，由 2018 年底的 2.75% 降至 11 月初的 2.00%。在 11 月 18 日至 26 日及 12 月 19 日至 31 日期間，基本利率被定於高於 2.00% 的水平，反映了年終兩個月港元隔夜及一個月銀行同業拆息（HIBOR）顯著上升的趨勢。因此，基本利率在 2019 年底收報 2.49%。基本利率的調整是根據 2009 年 3 月 26 日公佈的修訂公式進行的，該公式規定基本利率為美國聯邦基金利率目標區間下限加 50 基點，或隔夜及一個月 HIBOR 五個營業日的移動平均值的平均數，以較高者為準。在零售方面，由於美國聯邦基金利率目標區間在 10 月下旬下調，數家零售銀行將最優惠貸款利率下調了 12.5 基點。\n\n港元遠期匯率點子的折讓在首兩個月擴大，大致跟隨港元與美元利差的走勢，其中 12 個月港元遠期匯率點子在 2 月中旬跌至約 -708 點（圖 4）。此後，隨著港元與美元負利差的收窄，港元遠期匯率點子的折讓亦逐漸收窄，並在年底轉為溢價。總體而言，香港貨幣市場運作有序。貼現窗借貸額由 2018 年的 402 億元下降至 2019 年的 383 億元。\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n聯繫匯率制度在過去三十多年中為香港的貨幣及金融穩定作出了重大貢獻，並在多次區域及全球金融危機中展現出其韌性。在當年社會事件發生的背景下，社交媒體上流傳了許多無根據的謠言，質疑聯繫匯率制度及香港金融的穩定性。金管局迅速及有力地採取行動，通過傳統及社交媒體駁斥謠言，向公眾保證聯繫匯率制度將繼續維持，香港不會實施外匯或資本管制。此外，金管局發表了多篇文章，幫助公眾了解聯繫匯率制度的運作、資金流向及利率展望。這些努力有效地維持了公眾對聯繫匯率制度的信心，市場在全年亦運作有序，證明了這一點。政府亦堅定支持聯繫匯率制度。外匯及貨幣市場的穩定進一步強化了公眾對政府承諾及使用港元作為支付及價值儲存手段的信心。在 2019 年與香港進行的第四條磋商中，國際貨幣基金組織重申其長期支持聯繫匯率制度作為香港金融穩定的支柱，並表示聯繫匯率制度在香港透明的規則、充裕的財政及外匯儲備、強而有力的金融監管及監督、靈活的經濟及審慎的財政框架支持下，仍然是適合香港的匯率安排。\n\n強健的銀行體系對聯繫匯率制度的正常運作至關重要。香港銀行體系流動性充裕，狀況良好，流動性及資本水平遠高於國際最低標準。為確保銀行業的韌性，金管局一直密切監察銀行的信貸、流動性及利率風險管理情況及壓力測試結果，並繼續監督企業、物業及內地相關貸款。由於總結餘較往年為低，銀行普遍加強了流動性管理安排，並更積極地管理日常資金狀況。此外，金管局與銀行保持密切溝通，確保市場流動性的順暢循環，尤其是在大型新股集資活動的認購期之前及期間。全年沒有出現交收阻滯的情況，貼現窗亦繼續有效及高效地運作。\n\n為提高貨幣發行局帳目的透明度，自 1998 年 10 月起，外匯基金資產中特定部分已被分配用以支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（定義為支持資產除以貨幣基礎）在 2019 年介乎 109.9% 至 112.1% 之間，沒有觸及上限或下限觸發水平。該比率在 12 月 31 日收報 111.2%（圖 5）。在聯繫匯率制度下，雖然特定外匯基金資產已被指定為支持組合，但所有外匯基金資產均可用於支持港元匯率。在發生突發衝擊的情況下，外匯基金龐大的金融資源，加上香港強健的銀行體系，將為香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供強大支持。\n\n# 其他活動\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會下的貨幣發行委員會負責監察及檢討與香港貨幣及金融穩定相關的事宜。2019 年，貨幣發行委員會審議了多項議題，包括聯繫匯率制度運作的事件研究、總結餘與香港利率的關係、改善及更靈活地處理期權市場對聯繫匯率制度的看法，以及未來新股集資活動對 HIBOR 的影響。貨幣發行委員會就這些議題進行討論的記錄及提交給該委員會的貨幣發行局運作報告均刊登於金管局網站。\n\n# 研究\n\n香港貨幣及金融研究中心（前身為香港金融研究中心）就貨幣政策、銀行及金融等與政策相關議題進行研究。這反映在研究中心研究人員及海外訪客所探討的廣泛議題上，以及在中心舉辦的會議及活動中。研究中心與主要央行及政策機構合作，共同舉辦以政策為焦點的會議。其研究訪問計劃支持就對金管局、香港及本區域重要的政策議題進行的研究項目。\n\n2019 年，研究中心接待了 14 位研究學者，發表了 17 份工作論文，並舉辦了 11 場公眾研討會，涵蓋了廣泛的經濟、貨幣及金融議題。中心亦舉辦了三場國際會議：\n\n- 第十屆中國經濟年度國際研討會於 1 月 10 日至 11 日在香港舉行，主題為「中國的金融改革與經濟轉型」，由研究中心、中國人民銀行金融研究所及國務院發展研究中心金融研究所聯合舉辦。會議為來自央行、國際機構、學術界及金融業的經濟專家提供了一個世界級的論壇，以討論內地金融部門在金融改革及經濟發展所帶來的變化下所面臨的風險相關議題。"}
{"en":"# Banking Stability\n\nThe banking sector in Hong Kong remained sound and stable in 2019, notwithstanding the headwinds brought by the weakening global and local economies. Thanks to the concerted efforts of the industry, the banking sector continued to operate normally amidst the social events. Efforts were taken to ensure that inconvenience caused to the public was kept to a minimum. During the year, the HKMA focused its supervision on the credit and liquidity risk management of authorized institutions. In view of escalating cyber threats and the industry’s growing dependency on technology, the HKMA stepped up the supervision of authorized institutions’ technology risk management. On conduct supervision, the HKMA streamlined its investor protection measures to enhance customer experience while according protection to customers. We also enhanced consumer protection in digital financial services and continued to promote a customer-centric corporate culture.\n\nOn anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT), 2019 marked the conclusion of the Financial Action Task Force’s Fourth Round Mutual Evaluation of Hong Kong’s AML\/CFT regime, which was assessed as compliant and effective overall, and earned positive recognition particularly for the banking sector’s good understanding of risks and the HKMA’s risk-based supervisory work in AML\/CFT. The HKMA has continued to participate in the public-private partnership for intelligence sharing on fraud and money laundering, and its active support for the adoption of AML\/CFT regulatory technology in the banking sector.\n\nOn banking development, the HKMA granted banking licences to eight virtual banks in 2019 and announced a three-phased approach to facilitate the development of green and sustainable banking in Hong Kong. The HKMA has been in close collaboration with the banking industry to optimise supervisory policies and processes and to carry out capacity-building initiatives that facilitate talent development.\n\nMeanwhile, substantial progress was made on the local implementation of international supervisory standards, including capital adequacy standards, disclosure standards, liquidity standards and large exposure standards. The HKMA also continued its work to ensure there would be a credible resolution regime for authorized institutions, including implementing rules on loss-absorbing capacity requirements to enhance the resolvability of authorized institutions.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this objective is contingent upon the financial system being highly resilient and capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their businesses and, in extremis, by failing in a disorderly manner. The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring banks are resilient to shocks and are able to recover their positions in response to crises, ultimately helping to prevent failures. The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks in Hong Kong. It is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs). The Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs).\n\nHowever, the Monetary Authority cannot ensure, nor is the Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework designed to ensure, a zero-risk financial system. Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that, in the event of an AI becoming non-viable, its failure can be managed in an orderly manner. To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong has been established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs. To ensure that the resolution regime in Hong Kong is operational, it is important to lay down resolution legislation and policy standards, undertake resolution planning to remove impediments to AIs’ resolvability and develop the HKMA’s operational capability to resolve a failing AI. In order to carry out these tasks effectively, the HKMA adopts an internationally harmonised and co-ordinated approach.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2019\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nIn 2019, 196 off-site reviews were conducted covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL rating assessment, corporate governance, risk management and fintech strategies. As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance, 26 meetings were held with the boards of directors or board-level committees of AIs. Furthermore, 32 tripartite meetings were held among the HKMA, the AIs and their external auditors.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA conducts regular on-site examinations supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk. A total of 405 on-site examinations and thematic reviews were conducted during the year. Credit risk management remained a key focus of these examinations and reviews. Another major focus was in technology risk and operational risk management. The HKMA also increased the number of on-site examinations and thematic reviews targeted at liquidity and market risk management as well as the implementation of the Basel capital adequacy framework. At the same time, specialist teams performed on-site examinations and thematic reviews of AIs’ activities in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses.\n\nTable 1 contains an overall summary of the HKMA’s supervisory activities in 2019.\n\n# Supervision of credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nBank lending increased moderately in 2019. Total loans grew by 6.7%, compared with 4.4% in 2018. As shown in Table 2, loans for use in Hong Kong and loans for use outside Hong Kong registered growth of 7.7% and 5.8% respectively.\n\nMainland-related lending grew by 7.4% to HK$4,564 billion as at the end of 2019 (Table 3).\n\nThe asset quality of AIs remained healthy. Retail banks’ classified loan ratio edged down from 0.51% at the end of 2018 to 0.48% at the end of 2019, well below the long-run historical average of 2% since 2000. For the banking industry as a whole, the classified loan ratio increased slightly from 0.55% to 0.57%. Specifically in terms of Mainland-related lending, retail banks’ classified loan ratio increased from 0.63% in 2018 to 0.79% in 2019, which was still low by historical standard. For the banking industry as a whole, the ratio increased to 0.75% from 0.55% a year ago.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA devoted increased supervisory efforts in ensuring that AIs continued to adopt prudent credit risk management standards amid the uncertain economic environment. Solvency stress tests were enhanced to incorporate more comprehensive risk coverage and more severe stress assumptions. The results of the enhanced stress tests continued to indicate that banks generally had sufficient capital buffers to withstand extreme shocks. Targeted and thematic examinations were conducted to evaluate the credit risk management practices of AIs in different areas, such as lending to corporates engaged in high-risk business, complex financing arrangements, and collateralised lending to private banking and wealth management customers. Recognising that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) would more likely face greater challenges during economic downturns, the HKMA established a Banking Sector SME Lending Co-ordination Mechanism in October, with a view to encouraging banks to continue to support SMEs’ financing needs to the extent permitted by prudent risk management principles.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nThe resilience of the Hong Kong banking sector to withstand a downturn in the property market has been strengthened significantly by the eight rounds of countercyclical macro-prudential measures introduced by the HKMA since 2009. The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of new residential mortgage loans fell to 53% in December 2019 from 64% in September 2009, before the countercyclical measures were first introduced. The average debt servicing ratio (DSR) of new mortgages also decreased to 36% in December 2019 from 41% in August 2010, when a cap on DSR was first applied (Chart 1).\n\n# Supervision of operational and technology risk\n\nThe HKMA adopts a three-phased approach to implement the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework under the Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative (CFI). phase One assessment, involving all the major banks, was completed in 2018. The remaining AIs covered in the second and third phases have substantially completed the assessment as scheduled. The HKMA has also embarked on a comprehensive review of the CFI to fine-tune the initiative given the experience gained in the past years.\n\nIn October, the HKMA issued a revised Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module on “Risk Management of E-banking”. The revision sought to provide the industry with greater flexibility to meet changing customer expectations on electronic banking services. The HKMA also published a set of high-level principles on the use of artificial intelligence in order to provide guidance for the industry.\n\nSince the social events started in June, the HKMA have maintained close dialogue with the industry to monitor the impact on banking operations and services. Banks were requested to replenish automated teller machines (ATMs) more frequently and repair vandalised facilities as soon as practicable. The HKMA also acted quickly to refute malicious rumours that sought to undermine the public’s confidence in the banking system. Thanks to concerted efforts by the banking industry, the affected bank branches and facilities quickly resumed normal services and the inconvenience caused to the public was kept to a minimum. In view of the rising operational risk posed by the social events, banks were asked to take additional precautionary measures to strengthen their operational resilience.\n\n# Supervision of liquidity and market risk management\n\nDuring the year, a round of thematic reviews was conducted to assess AIs’ capability to cope with liquidity shocks. The reviews focused on the robustness of AIs’ liquidity stress testing programmes and contingency funding management. The HKMA also assessed AIs’ compliance with the regulatory requirements on the calculation of the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) to ensure the prudence and accuracy of the inputs used for the calculation.\n\nAs algorithmic trading gained popularity in the banking industry, the HKMA conducted a round of thematic reviews to evaluate AIs’ risk management practices in this area. Considering that the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) might cease to be published after end-2021, the HKMA reminded AIs to get prepared for the transition to alternative reference rates and conducted a survey to monitor their preparedness for the transition.\n\n# Combating money laundering and terrorist financing (ML\/TF)\n\nThe HKMA carries out risk-based supervision of AIs’ AML\/CFT systems. During the year, 18 on-site examinations and 61 off-site reviews were conducted, including targeted thematic reviews on private banking and the governance of the use of new technology. The HKMA shared with the industry the observations and best practices drawn from a thematic review of AIs’ application of risk-based AML\/CFT controls for SMEs, in order to assist AIs to adopt appropriate account opening processes and delivery of services for SMEs.\n\n# Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Mutual Evaluation (ME) Report on Hong Kong\n\nA highlight of 2019 for the HKMA and Hong Kong’s overall AML\/CFT regime was the publication of the FATF ME Report on Hong Kong in September. The Report represents one of the best overall results to date in the FATF’s fourth-round ME of its member jurisdictions. Hong Kong scored six “Substantial” ratings out of 11 “Immediate Outcomes” in the assessment of the effectiveness of its AML\/CFT regime, and a high mark for the technical compliance aspect of the ME.\n\nThe Report favourably assessed the HKMA’s risk-based approach to AML\/CFT supervision, noting that the HKMA had a good understanding of ML\/TF risks in the banking sector and a reasonable understanding of risks in the stored value facility (SVF) sector. The Report also positively assessed the collective AML\/CFT efforts of the banking sector, such as the increased use of data analytics by larger AIs, the fact that the great majority of suspicious transaction reports were filed by AIs, and the sector’s proactive participation in the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce (FMLIT).\n\nThe Report recommended several areas for improvement, including the understanding of some higher-risk areas, such as foreign corruption and tax crimes, and developing sectors such as SVFs. Work has already started to address these recommendations; the HKMA published an updated ML\/TF Risk Assessment on the SVF sector in July and has commenced thematic on-site examinations on private banking and the governance of the use of new technology.\n","terms":{"\"Capital preservation First, Long-Term Growth Next\"":["保本先行、長期增值"],"10 Years plus Caring Organisation

銀行穩定性\n\n2019年，儘管全球和本地經濟疲弱帶來逆風，香港銀行業仍然保持穩健和穩定。在業界共同努力下，銀行業在社會事件期間仍能維持正常運作。我們採取了措施，確保對公眾造成的不便降至最低。在該年度，金管局將監督重點放在認可機構的信用風險和流動性風險管理上。鑑於網絡威脅日益增加，以及業界對科技的依賴度不斷提高，金管局加強了對認可機構科技風險管理的監督。在行為監管方面，金管局精簡了投資者保護措施，以提升客戶體驗，同時為客戶提供保障。我們亦加強了數位金融服務的消費者保障，並繼續推動以客戶為中心的企業文化。\n\n在打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集（AML\/CFT）方面，2019年標誌著金融行動特別工作組對香港AML\/CFT制度的第四輪相互評估的完結。評估結果顯示，該制度整體上符合要求且有效，尤其在銀行業對風險的良好理解及金管局在AML\/CFT方面的風險為本監管工作上，獲得正面評價。金管局繼續參與公私營合作夥伴關係，以分享有關詐騙和洗錢的情報，並積極支持銀行業採用AML\/CFT監管科技。\n\n在銀行業發展方面，金管局於2019年向八家虛擬銀行發出銀行牌照，並公佈了三階段方案，以促進香港綠色及永續銀行業的發展。金管局與銀行業緊密合作，優化監管政策和程序，並推行提升人才專業能力的措施，以促進人才發展。\n\n同時，在本地落實國際監管標準方面取得了重大進展，包括資本充足標準、資訊披露標準、流動性標準及大額風險承擔標準。金管局亦繼續努力確保為認可機構建立一個可靠的處置機制，包括實施有關吸收虧損能力要求的規則，以提高認可機構的可處置性。\n\n# 目標\n\n金管局的總體目標是促進銀行體系的安全和穩定。要實現這一目標，金融體系必須具有高度的韌性，並能夠提供香港經濟所需的關鍵金融服務。\n\n銀行透過其業務運作方式，甚至在極端情況下因無序倒閉而失敗，均可能影響體系的穩定性。作為監管機構，金融管理專員在保障金融穩定方面發揮關鍵作用，確保銀行能夠抵禦衝擊，並在危機中恢復其地位，最終有助於防止失敗。金融管理專員負責對香港銀行進行審慎監管。其職責包括授權香港持牌銀行、有限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司（統稱認可機構）。金融管理專員亦負責指定及監督某些金融市場基礎設施。\n\n然而，金融管理專員無法確保，亦非香港審慎監管框架旨在確保零風險的金融體系。相反，作為處置機構，金融管理專員致力確保在認可機構無法維持營運的情況下，其失敗能以有序的方式進行管理。為此，香港已建立金融機構處置機制，金融管理專員為認可機構的處置機構。為確保香港處置機制的運作，制定處置法例及政策標準、進行處置規劃以消除認可機構可處置性的障礙，以及提升金管局的運作能力以處置失敗的認可機構均十分重要。為有效執行這些任務，金管局採用國際協調一致的方法。\n\n# 2019年回顧\n\n# 監管活動概覽\n\n2019年，共進行了196次非現場審查，涵蓋廣泛議題，包括CAMEL評級評估、企業治理、風險管理及金融科技策略。作為金管局持續努力促進更強風險治理的一部分，與認可機構的董事會或董事會層級委員會舉行了26次會議。此外，金管局、認可機構及其外聘會計師舉行了32次三方會議。\n\n除了非現場活動外，金管局亦定期進行現場檢查，並輔以對評估為高風險領域的專題審查。在該年度，共進行了405次現場檢查及專題審查。信用風險管理仍然是這些檢查和審查的焦點之一。另一個主要焦點是科技風險及營運風險管理。金管局亦增加了針對流動性及市場風險管理，以及巴塞爾資本充足架構實施情況的現場檢查及專題審查的次數。同時，專業團隊對認可機構在證券、投資產品、保險及強積金相關業務方面的活動進行了現場檢查及專題審查。\n\n表1載列了金管局2019年監管活動的整體概要。\n\n# 信用風險監管\n\n# 信貸增長及資產質素\n\n2019年，銀行貸款溫和增長，總貸款較2018年的4.4%增長6.7%。如表2所示，在香港使用的貸款及在香港境外使用的貸款分別錄得7.7%及5.8%的增長。\n\n與內地相關的貸款增長7.4%，截至2019年底達45,640億港元（表3）。\n\n認可機構的資產質素保持健康。零售銀行的特定分類貸款比率由2018年底的0.51%輕微下降至2019年底的0.48%，遠低於自2000年以來的長期歷史平均值2%。就銀行業整體而言，特定分類貸款比率由0.55%輕微上升至0.57%。具體而言，在與內地相關的貸款方面，零售銀行的特定分類貸款比率由2018年的0.63%上升至2019年的0.79%，但按歷史標準而言仍屬低水平。就銀行業整體而言，該比率由一年前的0.55%上升至0.75%。\n\n在該年度，金管局加大了監管力度，確保認可機構在不確定的經濟環境下繼續採用審慎的信用風險管理標準。償債壓力測試得到強化，以納入更全面的風險覆蓋範圍及更嚴峻的壓力假設。強化後的壓力測試結果繼續顯示，銀行普遍擁有充足的資本緩衝，以抵禦極端衝擊。我們進行了有針對性的專題檢查，以評估認可機構在不同領域的信用風險管理實務，例如向從事高風險業務的公司貸款、複雜的融資安排，以及向私人銀行及財富管理客戶提供抵押貸款。鑑於中小企業在經濟下行期間更可能面臨更大挑戰，金管局於十月成立了銀行業中小企業貸款協調機制，以鼓勵銀行在審慎風險管理原則容許的範圍內，繼續支持中小企業的融資需要。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n自2009年以來，金管局實施了八輪逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施，大大增強了香港銀行業抵禦物業市場下跌的能力。新住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數由2009年9月（即首次實施逆周期措施前）的64%下降至2019年12月的53%。新按揭的平均供款與入息比率亦由2010年8月（即首次實施供款與入息比率上限時）的41%下降至2019年12月的36%（圖1）。\n\n# 營運風險及科技風險監管\n\n金管局採用三階段方法，在網絡防衛計畫（CFI）下實施網絡防衛評估框架。第一階段評估於2018年完成，涵蓋所有主要銀行。第二及第三階段涵蓋的其餘認可機構已大致按計畫完成評估。金管局亦已展開對CFI的全面檢討，以根據過往數年的經驗，對該計畫進行微調。\n\n10月，金管局發出經修訂的《監管政策手冊》模組，主題為「電子銀行的風險管理」。該修訂旨在為業界提供更大靈活性，以滿足客戶對電子銀行服務不斷變化的需求。金管局亦發表了一套有關使用人工智慧的高層次原則，為業界提供指引。\n\n自六月社會事件開始以來，金管局與業界保持密切對話，以監察對銀行業務及服務的影響。銀行被要求更頻繁地補充自動櫃員機的現金，並盡快修復受損設施。金管局亦迅速採取行動，駁斥旨在損害公眾對銀行體系信心的惡意謠言。在銀行業的共同努力下，受影響的銀行分行及設施迅速恢復正常服務，對公眾造成的不便降至最低。鑑於社會事件對營運風險構成日益嚴重的威脅，銀行被要求採取額外預防措施，以強化其營運韌性。\n\n# 流動性及市場風險管理監管\n\n在該年度，我們進行了一輪專題審查，以評估認可機構應對流動性衝擊的能力。審查重點為認可機構流動性壓力測試方案及應急資金管理的穩健性。金管局亦評估了認可機構在計算流動性覆蓋比率（LCR）時對監管要求的遵守情況，以確保計算所用數據的審慎性和準確性。\n\n隨著演算法交易在銀行業日益普及，金管局進行了一輪專題審查，以評估認可機構在該領域的風險管理實務。鑑於倫敦銀行同業拆息（LIBOR）可能在2021年底後停止發佈，金管局提醒認可機構為過渡至備用參考利率做好準備，並進行了一項調查，以監察其過渡準備情況。\n\n# 打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集（ML\/TF）\n\n金管局對認可機構的AML\/CFT系統進行風險為本的監管。在該年度，共進行了18次現場檢查及61次非現場審查，包括針對私人銀行及新科技使用治理的專題審查。金管局與業界分享了從專題審查中得出的觀察結果及最佳實務，該審查涉及認可機構對中小企業應用風險為本的AML\/CFT監控措施，以協助認可機構採用適當的開戶程序及為中小企業提供服務。\n\n# 金融行動特別組織（FATF）對香港的相互評估（ME）報告\n\n2019年，金管局及香港整體AML\/CFT制度的一大亮點是，FATF於九月發表了對香港的相互評估報告。該報告是FATF對其成員司法管轄區進行第四輪相互評估以來，取得的最佳整體結果之一。在香港AML\/CFT制度有效性評估的11項「即時成果」中，香港取得了六項「實質性」評級，並在相互評估的技术合規方面獲得高分。\n\n報告對金管局在AML\/CFT監管方面採用的風險為本方法給予正面評價，指出金管局對銀行業的ML\/TF風險有良好的理解，并对儲值支付工具（SVF）行業的風險有合理的理解。報告亦對銀行業在AML\/CFT方面的集體努力給予正面評價，例如大型認可機構更多地使用數據分析、絕大多數可疑交易報告由認可機構提交，以及該行業積極參與反詐騙及洗錢情報工作組（情報工作組）。\n\n報告建議在若干領域作出改善，包括對某些高風險領域（如境外貪污及稅務罪行）及發展中行業（如SVF）的理解。我們已開始就這些建議採取行動；金管局於七月發表了經更新的SVF行業ML\/TF風險評估，並已開始對私人銀行及新科技使用治理進行專題現場檢查。"}
{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nHong Kong is a globally competitive international financial centre. The implementation of the Smart Banking initiatives has been in good progress to further develop Hong Kong as a fintech hub. Capitalising on opportunities arising from the opening up of the Mainland financial markets, much headway has been made to promote financial collaboration in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, especially in easing Hong Kong residents’ cross-border access to financial and banking services in the Area.\n\nAt the same time, much effort has been made to open up new opportunities to further strengthen the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, including infrastructure investment and financing, green finance and private equity funds. The Hong Kong Academy of Finance was set up to enhance Hong Kong’s soft power in a sustainable manner.\n\nIn the central banking and regulatory community, the HKMA plays a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees, which is a clear recognition of Hong Kong’s expertise and commitment to international work.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nTo strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia, the HKMA puts great effort into implementing the seven Smart Banking initiatives that were announced in September 2017, with an aim to facilitate the development and use of fintech in the banking and payment industries. The key progress of these initiatives during the year included:\n\n- expanding the adoption of the Faster Payment System (FPS);\n- facilitating the implementation of phases I and II of the Open Application programming Interface (Open API) Framework in the banking sector;\n- further enhancing fintech research and talent\ndevelopment;\n- stepping up cross-border collaboration in fintech; granting eight virtual bank licences;\n- facilitating the industry’s increasing use of Fintech Supervisory Sandbox (FSS) 2.0 for launching fintech initiatives; and\n- further facilitating the adoption of regulatory technology (Regtech) through the Banking Made Easy initiative.\n\nThe HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO), together with the banking departments of the HKMA, plays a pivotal role in driving the implementation of these initiatives.\n\nHong Kong plays an indispensable role in facilitating international investors’ allocation of renminbi assets, with its unparalleled access to the onshore markets through the Stock Connect and Bond Connect schemes. This was evident by the tripling of the number of registered investors and daily turnover under Bond Connect over the past year. Further enhancements have been introduced to both Bond Connect and Stock Connect, providing more convenience and flexibility for international investors to invest in onshore securities in the Mainland. The HKMA also worked closely with Mainland authorities to explore and implement a series of financial facilitation measures for Hong Kong residents to access financial and banking services across the border in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), including a prospective, two-way wealth management connect scheme. Hong Kong maintains a firm foothold as the global hub for offshore renminbi business. According to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Triennial Survey of Foreign Exchange (FX) and Derivatives Market Turnover, Hong Kong continued to be the largest offshore renminbi FX centre in the world.\n\nContinuous efforts were put into opening up new opportunities to further enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. To promote the development of the fund business in Hong Kong, the HKMA worked closely with the Government and industry to provide a more favourable tax and regulatory environment for fund formation. A number of large-scale events and targeted outreach activities were organised to promote Hong Kong as a hub for green finance, infrastructure investment and financing and corporate treasury centres (CTCs). In an effort to enhance Hong Kong’s soft power, the Hong Kong Academy of Finance (AoF) was set up in June to develop financial leadership and promote research collaboration.\n\nIn the central banking and regulatory community, the HKMA plays a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees. The HKMA chaired the Standing Committee on Supervisory and Regulatory Cooperation (SRC) of the Financial Stability Board (FSB) until 31 August 2019. Currently, the HKMA is chairing the Supervision and Implementation Group (SIG) of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), and the Working Group on Financial Markets (WGFM) established under the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP). The HKMA is also co-chairing the Non-Bank Monitoring Experts Group (NMEG) of the FSB with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure lays a solid foundation for Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre. The four interbank Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) and the Hong Kong Trade Repository (HKTR) achieved 100% system availability in 2019, beating the target of 99.95%. Through its accounts set up with the two Mainland central securities depositories, the CMU facilitates the settlement of transactions conducted under Bond Connect Northbound Trading and the holding of Mainland debt securities on behalf of relevant CMU members.\n\nThe FPS, which serves as an extension of Hong Kong dollar RTGS system to enable the public to make instant retail fund transfers and payments across different banks and stored value facilities (SVFs) on a round-the-clock basis, ran smoothly in its first year of operation. Users’ adoption of the facility had increased steadily, as manifested in the four million registrations and tripling of transaction volumes by the end of 2019. The FPS brings new opportunities to the retail payment industry and promotes fintech innovation.\n\nTo ensure the general safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA has designated and is overseeing a total of six retail payment systems (RPSs) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO). The HKMA also issued two new SVF licences in May, bringing the total number of SVF licensees to 18. SVF licensees continued to launch new products and services actively during the year to diversify customer choices and enhance user experience.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2019\n\n# Hong Kong as a Fintech Hub in Asia\n\n# Smart Banking initiatives\n\nThe seven Smart Banking initiatives were announced by the HKMA in September 2017 with the aim of helping the banking sector achieve higher standards of operation and embrace the enormous opportunities brought about by the convergence of banking and technology. During the year, considerable progress was made in implementing these initiatives and transforming the fintech ecosystem of Hong Kong.\n\n# Faster Payment System\n\nThe launch of the FPS in September 2018 was a major milestone in the financial infrastructure development of Hong Kong in the digital era. The FPS further promotes the adoption of e-payment in Hong Kong by providing efficient and convenient payment services to the general public and corporates. Since the launch of the FPS, the number of participating service providers had increased to 30 banks and 11 SVFs, with the addition of nine banks and one SVF, by the end of 2019.\n\nUsage of the FPS has also grown steadily. As of 31 December 2019, the FPS recorded four million registrations (Chart 1) and processed 44 million transactions involving an aggregate amount of HK$748.5 billion and RMB17 billion. In December 2019, average daily turnover reached 168,000 transactions worth HK$2.4 billion and RMB38 million (Chart 2), as compared with 51,000 transactions during its first full month of operation in October 2018.\n\nFaster payment System recorded: \n- 4 million registrations as of 31 December 2019\n- 44 million transactions as of 31 December 2019\n- 168,000 transactions worth HK$2.4 billion and RMB38 million of average daily turnover in December 2019\n\nThe HKMA works with the industry to extend FPS usage from person-to-person payments to bill payments and other merchant payments. For example, enhancements were made to enable merchants to use a variety of proxy identifiers and accept partial or over-payments via a QR code. A technical specification was developed to facilitate the invocation of a mobile banking or SVF e-wallet mobile application (app) from a business mobile app for FPS payment. This would greatly improve customer experience in making merchant and business payments via the FPS using mobile devices.\n\nThe HKMA also works closely with relevant Government departments to assist them in using the FPS to accept bill payments from the public. From 1 November, bills issued by the Inland Revenue Department, the Rating and Valuation Department and the Water Supplies Department were printed with an FPS QR code so that the public could scan the QR code easily with supporting mobile banking or SVF e-wallet apps to make payment. The HKMA will continue working with various Government departments and public bodies to explore other potential use cases which can make it convenient for the public to make payment via the FPS.\n\nTo raise public awareness of the FPS, the HKMA has developed a new series of education and publicity materials, such as Announcements in the public Interest for broadcast on television and radio, as well as videos and electronic banners for digital platforms. The HKMA also participated in trade fairs to promote the FPS to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and corporates. Various FPS participating banks and SVFs launched promotion campaigns and offered incentives to encourage customers to register with the FPS and to use it for fund transfer and bill payment.\n\nIn addition, the HKMA engaged a number of industry organisations and institutions to provide briefings on the FPS so as to introduce its functionalities and the potential benefits it may bring to different businesses in collecting and making payment.\n\nThe Government has adopted FPS for bill payments on taxes, rates and Government rent and water charges.\n\n# Open Application Programming Interface\n\nThe HKMA continued to facilitate the banking sector’s development and adoption of Open API in accordance with the four-phase approach of the Open API Framework. Under phase I, 20 retail banks opened up over 500 Open API endpoints in January, covering information of banking products and services. Under phase II, the banks opened up in October over 300 APIs to support applications for banking products and services.\n\n# Research and talent development\n\nOn trade finance, a proof-of-concept (PoC) study on linking up eTradeConnect and we.trade was completed in the first quarter of the year. In November, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between the subsidiaries of Hong Kong Interbank Clearing Limited and the Institute of Digital Currency of the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) to conduct a PoC study on linking up eTradeConnect and the PBoC Trade Finance platform to provide firms in both Hong Kong and Mainland China with more convenient trade finance services.\n\nOn Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), the HKMA and the Bank of Thailand embarked on a joint research project named project Inthanon-LionRock to study the application of CBDC to cross-border payments, with a view to facilitating HKD-THB payment-versus-payment (pvp) among banks in Hong Kong and Thailand.\n\nHKMA Executive Director (Financial Infrastructure), Mr Colin Pou (first from left), together with Director-General of the Institute of Digital Currency of the PBoC, Mr Mu Changchun (first from right), witness the signing ceremony of an MoU to conduct a PoC trial on linking up eTradeConnect and the PBoC Trade Finance Platform. The MoU is signed between Chief Executive Officer of the Hong Kong Trade Finance Platform Company Limited, Ms Haster Tang (second from left), and Deputy Director-General of the Institute of Digital Currency of the PBoC and Director of the Shenzhen Fintech Institute, Mr Di Gang (second from right).\n\nOn artificial intelligence (AI), the HKMA carried out a study on the application of AI technology in the Hong Kong banking industry. Key findings of an industry-wide AI survey were published in November, followed by the issuance of the full report, titled “Reshaping Banking with Artificial Intelligence”, in December.\n\nThe report “Reshaping Banking with Artificial Intelligence” is published in December.\n\nA fact sheet is published to highlight the key facts and figures derived from a survey on the use of AI in the Hong Kong banking industry.\n\nIn an effort to enlarge the fintech talent pool, the HKMA continued to run the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme 2.0 in collaboration with its strategic partners to nurture young talent at various stages of their career development. Over 220 students benefited from the programme last year.\n","terms":{"\"Capital preservation First, Long-Term Growth Next\"":["保本先行、長期增值"],"10 Years plus Caring Organisation

國際金融中心\n\n香港是一個具有全球競爭力的國際金融中心。智慧銀行倡議的實施進展良好，有助於進一步將香港發展成為金融科技樞紐。香港把握內地金融市場開放的機遇，在促進粵港澳大灣區金融合作方面取得了重大進展，尤其是在便利香港居民跨境使用大灣區內的金融及銀行服務方面。\n\n同時，香港亦作出不少努力，開闢新機遇，以進一步強化香港金融平台的競爭力，包括基礎建設投資及融資、綠色金融及私募股權基金。香港金融學院的成立旨在以可持續的方式提升香港的軟實力。\n\n在中央銀行及監管領域，金管局在多個區域及國際委員會中擔任領導角色，這充分體現了香港在國際工作上的專業知識和承擔。\n\n# 概述\n\n為強化香港作為亞洲金融科技樞紐的地位，金管局投入大量資源落實於2017年9月公布的七項智慧銀行倡議，以促進金融科技在銀行及支付行業的發展和應用。這些倡議在過去一年取得的主要進展包括：\n\n- 擴大快速支付系統（FPS）的採用範圍；\n- 促進銀行業落實開放應用程式介面（開放API）框架的第一及第二階段；\n- 進一步強化金融科技研究及人才發展；\n- 加強金融科技的跨境合作；發出八張虛擬銀行牌照；\n- 促進業界更多運用「金融科技監管沙盒」（沙盒）2.0 推出金融科技項目；以及\n- 透過「銀行易」倡議進一步促進合規科技（Regtech）的應用。\n\n金管局的金融科技促進辦公室（FFO）與金管局的銀行部門共同合作，在推動落實這些倡議方面發揮了關鍵作用。\n\n香港在促進國際投資者配置人民幣資產方面發揮著不可或缺的作用，透過滬港通及債券通機制，香港享有無與倫比的在岸市場準入。過去一年，債券通下的註冊投資者數目及日均成交額均增長了三倍，便可見一斑。滬港通及債券通均已進一步優化，為國際投資者投資內地證券提供更多便利和靈活性。金管局亦與內地監管機構緊密合作，為香港居民探索及落實一系列金融便利化措施，讓他們能夠跨越邊境，在粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）使用金融及銀行服務，包括一個潛在的雙向理財通機制。香港繼續穩佔全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位。根據國際結算銀行（BIS）三年一度的外匯與衍生工具市場成交額調查，香港仍然是全球最大的離岸人民幣外匯交易中心。\n\n香港持續努力開闢新機遇，以進一步提升金融平台的競爭力。為促進香港基金業的發展，金管局與政府及業界緊密合作，為基金成立提供更優惠的稅務及監管環境。香港舉辦了多項大型活動及目標明確的推廣活動，以宣傳香港作為綠色金融、基礎建設投資及融資，以及企業財資中心（CTCs）的樞紐地位。為提升香港的軟實力，香港金融學院（AoF）於6月成立，以培育金融業領袖人才及促進研究合作。\n\n在中央銀行及監管領域，金管局在多個區域及國際委員會中擔任領導角色。金管局擔任金融穩定委員會（FSB）監管合作常設委員會（SRC）主席，直至2019年8月31日。目前，金管局擔任巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（巴塞爾委員會）監管及實施準則小組（SIG）主席，以及東亞及太平洋中央銀行會議(EMEAP)下成立的金融市場工作小組（WGFM）主席。金管局亦與美國證券交易委員會共同擔任FSB非銀行監察專家小組（NMEG）的聯合主席。\n\n香港金融基礎建設的安全及高效運作，為香港作為國際金融中心的地位奠定了堅實基礎。四個銀行間即時支付結算系統（RTGS系統）、中央貨幣市場單位（CMU）及香港交易資料儲存庫（香港儲存庫）在2019年均達至100%系統可用率，超越了99.95%的目標。CMU透過其在內地兩家中央證券託管機構開設的帳戶，為「債券通」北向通下進行的交易結算，以及為相關CMU成員代為持有內地債務證券提供便利。\n\n快速支付系統（FPS）作為港元RTGS系統的延伸，讓市民可全天候即時進行跨銀行及儲值支付工具（SVF）的零售資金轉帳及繳費，該系統在首年運作暢順。市民對系統的採用率穩步上升，截至2019年底，註冊帳戶數目達四百萬，交易量亦增長了三倍。FPS為零售支付行業帶來新機遇，並促進金融科技創新。\n\n為確保本地零售支付行業的整體安全及效率，金管局根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（《支付條例》）指定及監管共六個零售支付系統（RPSs）。金管局亦在五月發出兩張新的儲值支付工具牌照，令儲值支付工具持牌人總數增至18個。儲值支付工具持牌人在過去一年繼續積極推出新產品及服務，以增加顧客選擇及提升用戶體驗。\n\n# 2019年回顧\n\n# 香港作為亞洲金融科技樞紐\n\n# 智慧銀行倡議\n\n金管局於2017年9月公布了七項智慧銀行倡議，旨在協助銀行業提升營運水平，並把握銀行與科技融合所帶來的龐大機遇。過去一年，這些倡議的落實工作取得重大進展，並成功轉化了香港的金融科技生態系統。\n\n# 快速支付系統\n\n快速支付系統（FPS）於2018年9月推出，是香港在數位時代金融基礎建設發展上的重要里程碑。FPS為市民及企業提供高效及便捷的支付服務，進一步促進了香港電子支付的應用。自FPS推出以來，參與的服務供應商數目截至2019年底已增至30間銀行及11個儲值支付工具，分別新增了9間銀行及1個儲值支付工具。\n\nFPS的使用量亦穩步增長。截至2019年12月31日，FPS錄得四百萬個註冊帳戶（圖1），並處理了4,400萬宗交易，涉及總金額7,485億港元及170億人民幣。2019年12月，日均交易宗數達168,000宗，涉及金額24億港元及3,800萬人民幣（圖2），而2018年10月（系統首個完整運作月份）的交易宗數則為51,000宗。\n\n快速支付系統錄得：\n- 截至2019年12月31日，註冊帳戶數目達四百萬\n- 截至2019年12月31日，交易宗數達4,400萬\n- 2019年12月日均交易宗數達168,000宗，涉及金額24億港元及3,800萬人民幣\n\n金管局與業界合作，將FPS的應用範圍由個人對個人付款擴展至繳費及其他商戶付款。例如，系統已作出優化，讓商戶可使用多種代理識別碼，並透過二維碼接受部分或超額付款。此外，亦制定了技術規格，以便利用戶從商業行動應用程式（app）喚起行動銀行或儲值支付工具電子錢包行動應用程式，進行FPS付款。這將大大提升顧客透過FPS使用行動裝置進行商戶及商業付款的體驗。\n\n金管局亦與相關政府部門緊密合作，協助他們使用FPS接受市民繳費。由11月1日起，稅務局、差餉物業估價署及水務署發出的賬單均印有FPS二維碼，讓市民可輕易使用支援的行動銀行或儲值支付工具電子錢包應用程式掃描二維碼進行繳費。金管局將繼續與各政府部門及公共機構合作，探索其他潛在的應用案例，讓市民更方便地透過FPS進行繳費。\n\n為提高市民對FPS的認識，金管局製作了一系列新的教育及宣傳材料，包括在電視及電台播放的《公眾利益通告》，以及在數位平台上發布的影片及電子橫幅。金管局亦參與了貿易展覽，向中小企及企業推廣FPS。多個FPS參與銀行及儲值支付工具亦推出推廣活動及優惠，鼓勵顧客註冊FPS及使用系統進行資金轉帳及繳費。\n\n此外，金管局亦邀請了多個業界組織及機構就FPS提供簡介，以介紹其功能及潛在好處，讓不同企業在收款及付款時受惠。\n\n政府已採用FPS進行稅款、差餉、政府租金及水費的繳費。\n\n# 開放應用程式介面\n\n金管局繼續根據開放API框架的四階段方案，促進銀行業發展及採用開放API。在第一階段下，20間零售銀行於一月開放了超過500個開放API接口，涵蓋銀行產品及服務資訊。在第二階段下，銀行於十月開放了超過300個API，以支援銀行產品及服務的申請。\n\n# 研究及人才發展\n\n在貿易融資方面，一項關於將eTradeConnect與we.trade連接的概念驗證試驗於今年首季完成。十一月，香港銀行同業結算有限公司的附屬公司與中國人民銀行（人民銀行）數位貨幣研究所簽署了一項諒解備忘錄，以進行一項概念驗證試驗，將eTradeConnect與人民銀行貿易金融平台連接，為香港及內地企業提供更便捷的貿易融資服務。\n\n在央行數位貨幣（CBDC）方面，金管局與泰國中央銀行展開了一項名為「Inthanon-LionRock」的聯合研究項目，研究CBDC在跨境支付上的應用，以促進香港及泰國銀行之間的港元及泰銖外匯交易同步交收。\n\n金管局助理總裁（金融基礎建設）鮑克運先生（左一）與人民銀行數位貨幣研究所所長穆長春先生（右一）見證了一項諒解備忘錄的簽署儀式，該備忘錄旨在進行一項概念驗證試驗，將eTradeConnect與人民銀行貿易金融平台連接。該備忘錄由香港貿易金融平台有限公司總裁鄧海星女士（左二）與人民銀行數位貨幣研究所副所長兼深圳金融科技研究院院長狄剛先生（右二）簽署。\n\n在人工智慧（AI）方面，金管局就AI技術在香港銀行業的應用進行了研究。十一月，金管局發表了全港銀行業AI應用調查的主要結果，並於十二月發表了題為《人工智慧重塑銀行業》的完整報告。\n\n報告《人工智慧重塑銀行業》於十二月發表。\n\n金管局發表了一份事實摘要，以突顯香港銀行業人工智慧應用調查所得出的主要事實及數據。\n\n為擴大金融科技人才庫，金管局繼續與策略夥伴合作，推行「金融科技人才培育計劃升級版」，以培育處於不同職業生涯階段的年輕人才。去年，超過220名學生從該計劃中受惠。"}
{"en":"# Reserves Management\n\nGlobal financial markets performed better than expected in 2019 as the effect of accommodative monetary policies from major central banks outweighed concerns about the global growth slowdown and US-China trade tensions. Global equity markets rebounded following a significant correction in the fourth quarter of 2018, while major government bond yields declined and bond prices went up. Under such a favourable environment, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$262.2 billion in 2019, representing an investment return of 6.6%.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The HKMA, under the delegated authority of the Financial Secretary (FS) and within the terms of the delegation, is responsible to the FS for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(a) to preserve capital;\n(b) to ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(c) to ensure that sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) subject to (a)–(c), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund.\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP). The BP holds highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under Currency Board arrangements. The IP invests primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of its assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA diversifies part of the Exchange Fund’s investments in a prudent and incremental manner into a wider variety of asset classes. This includes emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The cap for the market value of investments under the LTGP is set at the aggregate of one-third of the accumulated surplus of the Exchange Fund and the portion of the Future Fund and placements by subsidiaries of the Exchange Fund linked to the LTGP.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007, holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that have been acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes. This Portfolio is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of its unique nature.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by fiscal reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP, with the major exception of the Future Fund, which links its interest rate to both the IP and the LTGP with reference to the portfolio mix. As at the end of 2019, the portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 40:60.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation. The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents long-term asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark (or strategic) allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and tracking error limit are determined by the FS in consultation with the EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may assume positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nThe HKMA set up the Exchange Fund Investment Office (EFIO) in August 2018 to house its investment and related risk management functions. Staff members of the EFIO directly manage about 71% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, comprising the entire BP and part of the IP. This part of the IP includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 29% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes. The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to realise sustainable returns, draw on diverse and complementary investment styles, and gain their market insights and technical expertise in investment.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is determined primarily by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe growing complexity of the investment environment underlines the importance of risk management. Stringent controls and investment guidelines are in place for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and compliance with guidelines and regulations is closely monitored. As the investment environment has become more complex, risk assessment has been strengthened to support the Exchange Fund’s increased level of investment diversification. Risk-control tools are deployed to assess market risks under both normal and adverse market conditions. Detailed performance attribution analyses are also conducted to identify sources of performance, enabling the HKMA to assess how to make the best use of the investment skills of both internal and external managers.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nThe HKMA is supportive of responsible investment (RI) by weaving environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into the investment process for both public and private market investments of the Exchange Fund.\n\nIn terms of public market investments, the HKMA implements both process-related and investment-related measures. One process-related measure taken by the HKMA is the adoption of the Principles of Responsible Ownership (PRO) issued by the Securities and Futures Commission in 2016, which help investors determine how best to meet their ownership responsibilities in relation to their investments in Hong Kong-listed companies. In managing the Exchange Fund, the HKMA has developed internal guidelines on ESG factors covering the process of selection, appointment and monitoring of external fund managers. The appointed external fund managers for the HKMA’s Hong Kong equities and Mainland active equities portfolios are required to adhere to the pRO in managing the investments on a “comply-or-explain” basis, and external fund managers appointed to manage the HKMA’s portfolios in developed market equities need to adhere to internationally recognised ESG standards. Apart from externally managed funds, ESG factors are also incorporated into the credit risk analysis of the HKMA’s internally managed bond investment.\n\nAs for ESG investments in the public market, the HKMA has invested in green bonds since 2015 as one of the early investors in this market, and participates in the Managed Co-Lending Portfolio Programme, which is run by the International Finance Corporation with a focus on sustainable investments across emerging markets. Going forward, the HKMA will continue to grow its green bond portfolio by either direct investment or investing in green bond funds. The HKMA also plans to construct ESGthemed mandates in equities investment by adopting an ESG equities index as a benchmark for passive portfolios and engaging active equities managers who apply ESG factors in their investment decisions.\n\nWith respect to private market investments, the HKMA examines the ESG policies and practices of general partners as part of its due diligence process. In particular, ESG risk evaluation is conducted as a mandatory part of due diligence in all LTGP investments. For the LTGP, the HKMA invests in projects with sustainable features; for instance, the HKMA has invested in renewables since 2013 in direct and co-investments in the energy sector, as well as green buildings and warehouses with green and sustainable features in its real estate portfolio. Going forward, the HKMA will continue to source projects with sustainable features and include green accreditation as a predominant factor in real estate investment.\n\nThe HKMA will monitor the development of ESG standards closely and assess how these standards can be further integrated into its investment process. The process is facilitated by its collaboration with like-minded investors and relevant international organisations. In particular, being a signatory of the UN-supported principles for Responsible Investment, which is the world’s leading proponent of RI, the HKMA expects to participate in the formulation of ESG best practices and to motivate other investors in adopting RI. Besides, the HKMA is also a member of FCLTGlobal, a not-for-profit organisation that works to encourage a longer-term focus in business and investment decision-making through workshops and research studies. In 2019, the HKMA also became a supporter of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures.\n\nFor more details about the HKMA’s RI policy framework, see the Corporate Social Responsibility chapter.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2019\n\nDespite concerns about the global growth slowdown and US-China trade tensions, global financial markets performed well in 2019 on the back of accommodative monetary policies from major central banks. Following a significant correction in the fourth quarter of 2018, global equity markets rallied in 2019. In the bond markets, major government bond yields declined markedly while bond prices went up in the first three quarters of 2019 as a result of monetary easing. Although bond prices retreated in the fourth quarter amid a slight rebound in yields, the overall gains in the bond markets were still satisfactory in 2019.\n\nIn the currency markets, major currencies performed differently against the US dollar. After declining by 3.8% in the third quarter due to an escalation of US-China trade tensions, the renminbi recovered part of its earlier losses in the fourth quarter given easing trade tensions. Overall, the renminbi depreciated by 1.4% against the US dollar. While the pound fell by 3.2% in the third quarter due to the heightened risk of a no-deal Brexit, it had since rebounded significantly as more clarity on Brexit emerged in the fourth quarter, eventually gaining 4.0% against the US dollar.\n\nThe performances of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2019 are shown in Table 1.\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$262.2 billion in 2019. This comprised gains on bonds of HK$114.5 billion, gains on Hong Kong equities of HK$22.1 billion, gains on other equities of HK$100.7 billion, a negative currency translation effect of HK$13.0 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets, and gains of HK$37.9 billion on other investments held by the investment holding subsidiaries of the Fund. Separately, the Strategic portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$2.5 billion.\n\nThe total assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,206.7 billion at the year end. The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$335.1 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$233.4 billion and real estate at HK$101.7 billion. Outstanding investment commitments reached HK$219.3 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund in 2019, excluding the Strategic portfolio, was 6.6%. Specifically, the IP achieved a rate of return of 9.7%, while the Bp gained 2.5%. The LTGP has recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 12.6% since its inception in 2009.\n","terms":{"\"Capital preservation First, Long-Term Growth Next\"":["保本先行、長期增值"],"10 Years plus

年第四季大幅修正後反彈，主要政府債券收益率下跌，債券價格上漲。在如此有利的環境下，外匯基金 2019 年錄得投資收入 2,622 億港元，投資回報率為 6.6%。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n《外匯基金條例》規定，外匯基金的主要目標是直接或間接影響港元匯率。基金亦可用於維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定和完整，以協助香港維持其國際金融中心地位。金管局在財政司司長（FS）的授權下，根據授權條款，就外匯基金的運用和投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標及組合架構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）為外匯基金訂立了以下投資目標：\n\n(a) 保存資本；\n(b) 確保貨幣基礎在任何時候均獲高度流動的美元資產全面支持；\n(c) 確保有足夠的流動資金，以維持貨幣及金融穩定；及\n(d) 在符合 (a) 至 (c) 項的前提下，實現有助於保存基金長期購買力的投資回報。\n\n這些目標充分考慮了外匯基金的法定目的，並已納入基金的組合架構及目標資產配置中。\n\n概括而言，外匯基金有兩個主要組合：支持組合（BP）及投資組合（IP）。BP 持有高度流動的美元資產，以根據貨幣發行局制度的要求，為貨幣基礎提供全面支持。IP 主要投資於經濟合作暨發展組織成員國的債券及股票市場，以保存其資產的價值及長期購買力。\n\n為更好地管理風險及提升中長期回報，金管局以審慎及循序漸進的方式，將外匯基金部分投資分散至更多元化的資產類別，包括新興市場及內地債券和股票、私募股權（包括基建）及房地產。新興市場及內地債券和股票歸入 IP 持有，而私募股權及房地產投資則歸入長期增長組合（LTGP）。LTGP 下的投資市值上限為外匯基金累計盈餘的三分之一，加上未來基金及與 LTGP 掛鉤的外匯基金附屬公司存款的總和。\n\n2007 年成立的策略性資產組合持有香港交易及結算所有限公司的股份，該等股份由政府為外匯基金的賬目以策略性目的購入。由於該組合的性質獨特，故不納入基金的投資表現評估範圍內。\n\n# 於外匯基金的存款\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定機構的存款。利率一般與 IP 的表現掛鉤，但未來基金除外，其利率同時與 IP 及 LTGP 掛鉤，並參考組合比例。截至 2019 年底，未來基金在 IP 及 LTGP 之間的組合比例約為 40:60。\n\n# 投資流程\n\n外匯基金的投資流程以兩種資產配置決定為基礎：策略性資產配置及戰術性資產配置。策略性資產配置反映在投資基準中，代表了根據外匯基金的投資目標而作出的長期資產配置。在策略性配置的指引下，資產會進行戰術性配置，以圖取得超越基準的回報。這意味著實際配置往往與基準（或策略性）配置有所不同。實際配置與基準配置之間的差異稱為「戰術性偏離」。基準及循跡誤差限額由財政司司長與外匯基金諮詢委員會商討後決定，而戰術性決定及戰術性偏離的容許範圍則由金管局在授權下制定及設定。在戰術性偏離的容許範圍內，投資組合經理可採取倉位，以把握短期市場波動的機遇。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局於 2018 年 8 月成立外匯基金投資辦公室（EFIO），負責管理其投資及相關風險管理職能。EFIO 的工作人員直接管理約 71% 的外匯基金投資，包括整個 BP 及部分 IP。這部分 IP 包括一組投資於全球固定收益市場的投資組合，以及多個衍生工具疊加組合，以實施基金的宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 使用外部經理\n\n除了內部管理資產外，金管局亦聘用外部基金經理管理約 29% 的外匯基金資產，包括所有上市股票組合及其他特別資產類別。聘用外部經理的目的，是利用市場上最佳的投資專才以實現可持續回報，借鑑多元化及互補的投資方式，並獲取他們的市場洞見及投資技術專長。\n\n與使用外部經理相關的開支包括基金管理費及託管費、交易成本、預扣稅及其他稅項。該開支主要由市場因素決定，並可能每年有所波動。\n\n# 風險管理及合規\n\n投資環境日益複雜，突顯了風險管理的重要性。內部及外部管理的投資組合均設有嚴格的監控措施及投資指引，並密切監察對指引及規定的遵守情況。隨著投資環境變得更加複雜，風險評估工作已獲強化，以支持外匯基金提高投資多元化的程度。風險管控工具被用以評估正常及不利市場情況下的市場風險。此外，亦會進行詳盡的投資表現因素分析，以識別表現的來源，讓金管局能評估如何最佳地運用內部及外部經理的投資技巧。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n金管局支持負責任投資（RI），將環境、社會及管治（ESG）因素納入外匯基金的公共和私人市場投資流程中。\n\n在公開市場投資方面，金管局實施了與流程及投資相關的措施。金管局採取的一項與流程相關的措施，是採用證券及期貨事務監察委員會於 2016 年發出的《負責任的擁有權原則》（pRO），該原則協助投資者決定如何最好地履行其對香港上市公司的投資所承擔的擁有權責任。在管理外匯基金時，金管局制定了有關 ESG 因素的內部指引，涵蓋外部基金經理的遴選、委任及監察流程。獲委任管理金管局香港股票組合及內地股票主動投資管理組合的外部基金經理，須在「若未能遵守須作出解釋」的基礎上，遵守 pRO 以管理投資；而獲委任管理金管局已發展市場股票組合的外部基金經理，則須遵守國際公認的 ESG 標準。除了外部管理的基金外，ESG 因素亦已納入金管局內部管理的債券投資的信用風險分析中。\n\n至於公開市場的 ESG 投資，金管局自 2015 年起已投資於綠色債券，是該市場的早期投資者之一，並參與由國際金融公司管理的聯合貸款組合管理計劃，該計劃專注於新興市場的可持續投資。展望未來，金管局將繼續透過直接投資或投資於綠色債券基金，以擴大其綠色債券組合。金管局亦計劃在股票投資中建立以 ESG 為主題的投資任務，方法是採用 ESG 股票指數作為被動投資組合的基準，並聘用主動股票投資經理，他們在作出投資決定時會應用 ESG 因素。\n\n在私人市場投資方面，金管局在盡職審查過程中，會檢視普通合夥人的 ESG 政策及實務。尤其是，ESG 風險評估是所有 LTGP 投資的盡職審查中一個強制性部分。就 LTGP 而言，金管局投資於具備可持續特性的項目；例如，金管局自 2013 年起已投資於可再生能源，包括在能源領域的直接投資及合作投資，以及在房地產投資組合中投資於具備綠色及可持續特性的綠色建築物及倉庫。展望未來，金管局將繼續尋找具備可持續特性的項目，並在房地產投資中把綠色認證列為主要考慮因素。\n\n金管局將密切監察 ESG 標準的發展，並評估如何進一步將這些標準納入其投資流程中。該過程得到與志同道合的投資者及相關國際組織的合作所促進。尤其是，作為聯合國支持的《負責任投資原則》的簽署機構（該原則為全球負責任投資的主要倡導者），金管局期望參與制定 ESG 最佳實務，並激勵其他投資者採用負責任投資。此外，金管局亦是 FCLTGlobal 的成員，該組織是一個非牟利組織，透過工作坊及研究報告，致力於鼓勵在商業及投資決策中採取更長遠的視角。2019 年，金管局亦成為氣候相關財務資訊披露工作組的支持者。\n\n有關金管局負責任投資政策框架的更多詳情，請參閱企業社會責任章節。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2019 年的金融市場\n\n2019 年，儘管存在全球經濟增長放緩及中美貿易緊張局勢的疑慮，但得益於主要央行的寬鬆貨幣政策，全球金融市場表現良好。在 2018 年第四季大幅修正後，全球股市於 2019 年反彈。在債券市場方面，由於貨幣寬鬆政策，主要政府債券收益率在 2019 年首三季顯著下跌，而債券價格則上升。儘管債券價格在第四季因收益率略為回升而下跌，但 2019 年債券市場的整體表現仍令人滿意。\n\n在貨幣市場方面，主要貨幣對美元的表現各異。人民幣在第三季因中美貿易緊張局勢升級而下跌 3.8%，但在第四季因貿易緊張局勢緩和而收回部分早前虧損。總體而言，人民幣對美元貶值 1.4%。英鎊在第三季因無協議脫歐的風險增加而下跌 3.2%，但在第四季因脫歐情況更加明朗而顯著反彈，最終對美元升值 4.0%。\n\n2019 年主要貨幣、債券及股票市場的表現載於表 1。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n2019 年，外匯基金錄得投資收入 2,622 億港元。這包括債券收益 1,145 億港元、香港股票收益 221 億港元、其他股票收益 1,007 億港元、非港元資產的負面貨幣兌換影響 130 億港元，以及基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資收益 379 億港元。此外，策略性資產組合錄得估值收益 25 億港元。\n\n截至年底，外匯基金的總資產達 42,067 億港元。LTGP 下的投資市值總額為 3,351 億港元，其中私募股權為 2,334 億港元，房地產為 1,017 億港元。已承擔尚未提取作投資的總額達 2,193 億港元。\n\n2019 年，外匯基金的投資回報率（不包括策略性資產組合）為 6.6%。具體而言，IP 的回報率為 9.7%，而 BP 的回報率為 2.5%。自 2009 年成立以來，LTGP 的年化內部回報率為 12.6%。"}
{"en":"# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communication with the community and the market through the traditional media, social media platforms, its website, the Information Centre and various other channels to facilitate public understanding about its policies and operations. Within the institution, conscientious efforts are made to improve the HKMA’s corporate governance by supporting the professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline, enhancing information technology security, and promoting a culture of innovation to cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives and the increasing complexity of work.\n\n# ENGAGING THE COMMUNITY\n\n# Media relations and social media\n\nThe HKMA works closely with the media to enhance transparency and promote public understanding about its policies and work. During the year, 125 open press events were held, comprising 10 press conferences, 12 stand-up interviews and 103 other public functions. A further 25 media interviews were arranged. A total of 466 bilingual press releases were issued and a large number of media enquiries were handled every day.\n\nTo raise awareness of the HKMA’s key functions, the HKMA organised media briefings and educational workshops for local and overseas media as well as key opinion leaders in the community to facilitate understanding on a wide range of topics, such as the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), virtual banking, green finance, and Hong Kong as a competitive international financial centre.\n\nSince July 2018, the HKMA has launched various social media channels to strengthen public education and communication. Five social media channels are currently in operation: Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter and YouTube, reaching out to a total of over 45,000 followers as at end-December 2019. Amid the social incidents in the second half of 2019, the HKMA made use of social media to rebut unfounded rumours regarding banking operations and financial stability, a move which proved to be highly effective in disseminating facts and preventing the rumours from spreading further.\n\n# Public enquiries\n\nThe Public Enquiry Service provides an effective means for the public to better understand the key functions and operations of the HKMA. A total of 9,742 enquiries were handled in 2019, about half of which were related to banking policies and regulations, consumer banking, and notes and coins. Some of the notable enquiries raised were about the Coin Collection programme, banking products and services, banking-related guidelines and circulars, the Faster Payment System (FPS), and monetary and economic statistics.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received since 2016 and Chart 2 provides a breakdown by enquiry nature in 2019.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Eddie Yue, speaks at the Hong Kong Association of Banks Distinguished Speaker Luncheon.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Eddie Yue (left), and HKMA's then Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan, meet with media after the announcement of the appointment of Mr Eddie Yue as the next Chief Executive of the HKMA.\n\n# Publications\n\nApart from the HKMA Annual Report, in 2019 the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report, four issues of the Quarterly Bulletin, and regular updates of the Monthly Statistical Bulletin to provide up-to-date and thematic information and analyses on monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. In addition, the HKMA published 19 inSight articles, covering various topics related to its work. The inSight articles provide a useful channel for the HKMA to elucidate the rationale behind its major new initiatives or policies, and provide timely response to topical issues which are of interest to the public.\n\n# HKMA website\n\nThe HKMA official website (www.hkma.gov.hk) presents more than 40,000 pages of content in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, and is the public access gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It also contains the register of authorized institutions (AIs) and local representative offices and the register of the securities staff of AIs, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the register of stored value facility (SVF) licensees under the payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance. The HKMA official website underwent a major revamp and was relaunched in September with a new design layout, enriched content, an enhanced navigation structure, and more convenient search functions. The revamped website enables users to search information more easily and conveniently based on their own preferences. In particular, the revamped website carries a new section on “Smart Consumers”, where the public can find useful information and smart tips on a wide range of banking and related products or services. This is in line with the HKMA’s long-standing efforts to promote “smart and responsible” use of banking services.\n\nThe HKMA launches its revamped website.\n\nThe revamped HKMA website carries a new section on “Smart Consumers”.\n\nThe HKMA has been opening up financial data and important information published on its website via Open Application Programming Interface (Open API) by phases since 2018. By 2019, the HKMA has opened up 130 sets of Open ApIs on the HKMA’s website as originally planned. The HKMA embraces the development and application of Open API.\n\n# HKMA Information Centre\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre is an important resource introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters. It consists of an exhibition area and a library, and is open to the public six days a week. The exhibition area describes the HKMA’s work and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong. It also contains reading materials and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nThe HKMA completed the last phase of revamp of its Information Centre — the Historical Timeline — during the year. The revamped Historical Timeline, featuring multimedia and digital display panels for visitors to review the major monetary and financial events in Hong Kong and globally in a more interactive manner, was re-opened to the public in October.\n\nThe first section of the Historical Timeline is made up of a multimedia display panel presenting major events from 1842 to 1993.\n\nThe second section of the Historical Timeline is a digital display panel presenting major events from 1993, when the HKMA was established, to the present.\n\nThe Information Centre organises guided tours for visitors. During the year, it received more than 48,000 visitors and hosted over 480 guided tours for schools and other groups (Chart 3). More than 753,000 people have visited the Information Centre since it opened in December 2003.\n\nGuided tours of the Information Centre are organised for schools and other group visitors.\n\nThe library, situated next to the exhibition area, houses more than 26,000 books, journals and other publications for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs and central banking topics. It also maintains the register of AIs and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\n# Public and consumer education\n\nTo reach out to the community and raise public awareness of the HKMA’s work, the HKMA organised a public education seminar for over 400 secondary school students and teachers in 2019. Topics covered in the seminar included an introduction to the work of the HKMA, Hong Kong’s banknotes, the FPS, SVFs, fintech and the Deposit Protection Scheme. More than 60,000 teachers and students have participated in this programme since its launch in 1998.\n\nStudents and teachers from secondary schools in different districts attend the 2019 public education seminar.\n\nThe focus of the HKMA’s consumer education initiatives during the year was on educating the public to protect their “personal digital keys”, a concept introduced to help the public visualise the significance of safeguarding information for accessing their online accounts. The central message was that in the digital world, account login details and personal information related to internet banking and other digital financial services were as important as the keys to their home, and should be well protected. Extensive promotion was arranged across different media, including the TV, radio, mobile applications, social media, and other digital and out-of-home platforms, to highlight smart tips on how to protect personal digital keys.\n\nThe Flagship Campaign on Personal Digital Keys is conducted via extensive cross-media promotion.\n\nSustained initiatives were also carried out to educate the public to be smart and responsible financial consumers. For example, members of the public were urged to stay vigilant of bogus phone calls purportedly from banks, and of investment scams promoted on social media. Issues to note when handling personal credit products, in particular personal loans taken out during the tax season, were also promoted.\n\nTo enhance financial literacy among secondary school students, the HKMA co-organised the “Hong Kong Liberal Studies Financial Literacy Championship” with various stakeholders for the fifth year. Infographics were newly used in the Championship this year to help students better understand sophisticated financial concepts. An online quiz was conducted, attracting 10,450 submissions and culminating in the grand final competition, which was held at the HKMA for the first time. \n\nThe Championship, attracting over 10,000 online submissions, ends with a live competition at the HKMA.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA kicked off the Second phase of its Cross-generation Outreach Educational programme, which was organised jointly with an education institution. The programme comprised bank simulation games, parents’ talks and train-the-trainer workshops, targeting kindergarten pupils, their parents and teachers, as well as young adults. Other initiatives on youth education included producing comic storybooks for primary school students and parents jointly with a professional association, as well as delivering talks to tertiary school students.\n\nThe HKMA continued to support the Investor and Financial Education Council in promoting financial literacy and capacity in Hong Kong, and will explore further collaboration with different stakeholders to maximise the impact of consumer education.\n\nThe Achievement Ceremony for the First Phase of the Crossgeneration Outreach Programme is held alongside the launch of the Second Phase.\n\nKindergarten pupils participate in the bank simulation game.\n\nComic storybooks are produced jointly with a professional association to disseminate smart tips on using banking and financial services to primary school students and their parents.\n\n# OUR PEOPLE\n\nWhile the HKMA is an integral part of the Government, it employs staff on terms different from those of the civil service to attract people with the right experience and expertise. The HKMA recruits, develops and maintains a highly professional workforce to support its policy objectives and respond flexibly to changing work priorities.\n\nThe establishment of the HKMA in 2019 was 1,005. During the year, the HKMA conducted a cross-departmental re-engineering exercise to enhance the efficiency of various work processes and redeploy existing resources to support new initiatives. As a result of this rigorous exercise, the overall establishment of the HKMA in 2020 remains unchanged at 1,005. Resources have been redeployed to undertake the following new tasks:\n\n# Banking and Financial Stability\n- Develop and implement a supervisory regime for virtual banks and cope with the increasingly complex prudential supervision standards\n- Enhance supervisory capacity for the new regulatory regime for insurance intermediaries\n- Step up ongoing monitoring of banks’ culture reform, and conduct ongoing supervision of banks and other relevant entities providing trust services\n\n# Reserves Management\n- Strengthen investment and risk management and other necessary support for the further expansion and diversification of the Exchange Fund’s investment activities\n\n# Hong Kong as an International Financial Centre\n- Support reforms that enhance the international competitiveness of Hong Kong’s tax regime regarding different financial services sectors\n- Enhance the daily qualitative market surveillance and analyses of Trade Repository data\n\nTable 1 gives a breakdown of the establishment and strength of the HKMA.\n\n# Remuneration policies and pay review mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary (FS) determines the pay and conditions of service for HKMA staff on the advice of the Governance Sub-Committee (GSC) through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC), taking into account the prevailing market rates and practices. Remuneration comprises a total cash package and a provident fund scheme, with minimal benefits in kind. the cash package consists of monthly fixed pay (or basic pay) and variable pay that may be awarded to individual staff members as a lump sum once a year, depending on performance.\n\nPay for HKMA staff is reviewed annually by the FS in the light of recommendations made to him by the GSC through the eFAC, taking into account the GSC’s assessment of the performance of the HKMA in the preceding year, the pay-survey findings of the financial sector conducted by independent human resources consultants, and any other relevant factors. Special pay adjustments may be made from time to time to reward individual meritorious staff members and to maintain the competitiveness of their pay.\n","terms":{"\"Capital preservation First,

機構職能\n\n金管局透過傳統媒體、社交媒體平台、其網站、資訊中心及其他各種渠道，與社會及市場保持有效溝通，以促進公眾對該局政策及運作的了解。在機構內部，金管局亦積極努力改善企業管治，包括支持員工的專業發展、建立嚴謹的財務紀律、強化資訊科技保安，以及推動創新文化，以應對推行新措施及工作日益複雜化所帶來的挑戰。\n\n# 聯繫社會\n\n# 媒體關係及社交媒體\n\n金管局與媒體緊密合作，以提升透明度及促進公眾對該局政策及工作的了解。過去一年，金管局共舉行了125場公開傳媒活動，包括10場記者會、12場站立式訪問及103場其他公開活動，另安排了25場傳媒訪問。金管局合共發出了466份中英文雙語新聞稿，並每日處理大量傳媒查詢。\n\n為提升公眾對金管局主要職能的認識，金管局為本地及海外傳媒，以及社會上的主要意見領袖舉辦了傳媒簡介會及教育工作坊，以促進他們對多項議題的了解，包括聯繫匯率制度、虛擬銀行、綠色金融，以及香港作為具競爭力的國際金融中心等。\n\n自2018年7月起，金管局推出多項社交媒體渠道，以加強公眾教育及溝通工作。目前共有五個社交媒體渠道正在運作，包括Facebook、Instagram、LinkedIn、Twitter及YouTube，截至2019年12月底，合共吸引了超過45,000名追蹤者。在2019年下半年的社會事件中，金管局運用社交媒體駁斥有關銀行運作及金融穩定的不實謠言，這舉措在傳播事實及防止謠言進一步散播方面非常有效。\n\n# 公眾查詢\n\n公眾查詢服務為公眾提供一個有效途徑，以更深入了解金管局的主要職能及運作。2019年，金管局共處理了9,742宗查詢，當中約一半與銀行業政策及規例、銀行消費者事宜，以及紙幣及硬幣有關。部分較值得留意的查詢包括硬幣收集計劃、銀行產品及服務、銀行業相關指引及通告、快速支付系統「轉數快」，以及貨幣及經濟數據。\n\n圖1顯示自2016年起接獲的公眾查詢宗數，而圖2則列出2019年按查詢性質劃分的詳情。\n\n金管局總裁余偉文先生在香港銀行公會卓越人士講座暨午餐會上發言。\n\n金管局總裁余偉文先生（左）及金管局前總裁陳德霖先生在宣布余偉文先生獲委任為下任金管局總裁後，與傳媒見面。\n\n# 出版物\n\n除了金管局年報外，金管局在2019年亦發表了兩期《貨幣與金融穩定情況半年度報告》、四期《季報》，以及定期更新《金融數據月報》，提供有關香港貨幣、銀行及經濟議題的最新及專題資訊和分析。此外，金管局發表了19篇匯思文章，涵蓋與該局工作相關的各項議題。匯思文章為金管局提供一個有用的渠道，闡釋其主要新措施或政策背後的理據，並就公眾關注的議題提供及時回應。\n\n# 金管局網站\n\n金管局官方網站（www.hkma.gov.hk）提供超過40,000頁的英文、繁體中文及簡體中文內容，是公眾獲取金管局最新資訊的門戶。網站亦載有《銀行業條例》第20條規定的認可機構及本地代表辦事處名冊，以及認可機構證券業務員工名冊；還有《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》規定的儲值支付工具持牌人名冊。金管局官方網站在九月進行了重大改版及重新推出，採用了新的設計佈局、豐富了內容、強化了導覽結構，並提供了更便捷的搜尋功能。改版後的網站讓用戶可根據個人喜好，更輕易及便捷地搜尋資訊。改版後的網站特別增設了「智醒消費者」新專頁，讓公眾可找到有關各類銀行及相關產品或服務的實用資訊及智醒貼士。這與金管局長久以來推廣「智醒及負責任」使用銀行服務的努力一致。\n\n金管局推出改版後的網站。\n\n改版後的金管局網站增設了「智醒消費者」新專頁。\n\n自2018年起，金管局分階段透過開放應用程式介面（開放API）開放其網站上發佈的金融數據及重要資訊。截至2019年，金管局已按原定計劃在網站上開放了130套開放API。金管局擁抱開放API的發展及應用。\n\n# 金管局資訊中心\n\n金管局資訊中心位於國際金融中心二期55樓，是向社會介紹金管局工作及推廣貨幣及銀行業知識的重要資源。中心設有展覽區及圖書館，每週六天開放予公眾。展覽區介紹金管局的工作及香港貨幣及銀行業的發展，並設有閱讀材料及展品，供人士研究香港貨幣、銀行及金融事務。\n\n金管局在過去一年完成了資訊中心最後一期的改建設施 — 歷史長廊。改版後的歷史長廊設有多媒體及電子展板，讓訪客以更互動的方式回顧香港及全球的主要貨幣及金融事件，並於十月重新開放予公眾。\n\n歷史長廊的第一部分由一個多元展板組成，展示1842年至1993年的主要事件。\n\n歷史長廊的第二部分是一個電子展板，展示自1993年金管局成立以來的重大事件，直至現在。\n\n資訊中心為訪客舉辦導賞團。過去一年，中心共接待了超過48,000名訪客，並為學校及其他團體舉辦了超過480場導賞團（圖3）。自2003年12月開放以來，資訊中心已接待了超過753,000名訪客。\n\n資訊中心為學校及其他團體訪客舉辦導賞團。\n\n圖書館位於展覽區旁，藏有超過26,000本書籍、期刊及其他出版物，供人士研究香港貨幣、銀行、金融事務及中央銀行議題。圖書館亦按照《銀行業條例》第20條的規定，存有認可機構及本地代表辦事處名冊，以及認可機構證券業務員工名冊。\n\n# 公眾及消費者教育\n\n為聯繫社會及提升公眾對金管局工作的認識，金管局在2019年為超過400名中學學生及教師舉辦了一場公眾教育講座。講座的議題包括介紹金管局的工作、香港的紙幣、「轉數快」、儲值支付工具、金融科技及存款保障計劃。自1998年推出此計劃以來，超過60,000名教師及學生已參與其中。\n\n來自不同地區的中學學生及教師出席了2019年公眾教育講座。\n\n金管局在過去一年推出的消費者教育措施，重點是教育公眾保護其「個人數碼鎖匙」，這個概念旨在協助公眾了解保障網上帳戶登入資訊的重要性。核心信息是，在數碼世界中，與網上銀行及其他數碼金融服務相關的帳戶登入資料及個人資訊，與家居鎖匙一樣重要，應妥為保護。金管局透過不同媒體進行廣泛宣傳，包括電視、電台、流動應用程式、社交媒體及其他數碼及戶外平台，以推廣保護個人數碼鎖匙的智醒貼士。\n\n個人數碼鎖匙大型推廣計劃透過跨媒體廣泛宣傳進行。\n\n金管局亦持續推行措施，教育公眾成為智醒及負責任的金融消費者。例如，金管局敦促公眾提高警覺，提防假冒銀行的電話詐騙，以及社交媒體上推廣的投資騙局。金管局亦推廣在處理個人信貸產品時需要注意的事項，尤其是於稅季期間申請的個人貸款。\n\n為提升中學學生的金融知識，金管局與不同持份者合辦了第五屆「全港通識理財問答比賽」。比賽今年首度採用資訊圖表，以協助學生更容易理解複雜的金融概念。比賽設有網上問答環節，吸引了10,450人參加，並最終於金管局舉行首次現場決賽。\n\n比賽吸引了超過10,000人網上參加，並於金管局舉行現場決賽。\n\n在過去一年，金管局與一間教育機構合辦了「童心親親理財學堂」第二階段的跨代推廣教育計劃。計劃包括模擬銀行遊戲、家長講座及教師專業培訓工作坊，對象為幼稚園學童、其家長及教師，以及年青人。其他青年教育措施包括與專業團體合編小學學生及家長漫畫故事書，以及為大專學生舉辦講座。\n\n金管局繼續支持投資者及理財教育委員會在香港推廣金融知識及能力，並將與不同持份者探討進一步合作，以最大化消費者教育的影響力。\n\n跨代推廣計劃第一階段成就典禮與第二階段計劃的啟動儀式同時舉行。\n\n幼稚園學童參與了模擬銀行遊戲。\n\n金管局與專業團體合編漫畫故事書，向小學學生及家長傳播使用銀行及金融服務的智醒貼士。\n\n# 我們的員工\n\n金管局雖然是政府的一部分，但它以與公務員不同的條款聘用員工，以吸引具備相關經驗及專業知識的人才。金管局招聘、培育及保留一支高度專業的員工隊伍，以支持其政策目標，並靈活應對不斷變化的工作優先次序。\n\n金管局在2019年的編制為1,005人。過去一年，金管局進行了一項跨部門的重新規劃工作，以提升各項工作流程的效率，並調配現有資源以支持新措施。經過這項嚴謹的工作後，金管局在2020年的整體編制維持不變，為1,005人。資源已重新調配，以應付以下新工作：\n\n# 銀行業及金融穩定\n- 制定及實施虛擬銀行的監管制度，並應付日益複雜的審慎監管標準\n- 提升對保險中介人新監管制度的監管能力\n- 加強對銀行文化改革的持續監察，並持續監管銀行及其他提供信託服務的相關實體\n\n# 儲備管理\n- 強化投資及風險管理，以及提供其他必要支持，以進一步擴闊及分散外匯基金的投資活動\n\n# 香港作為國際金融中心\n- 支持改革措施，以提升香港在不同金融服務領域的稅務制度在國際上的競爭力\n- 強化每日對市場的質素監察，以及對交易資料儲存庫數據的分析\n\n表1列出金管局的編制及人手詳情。\n\n# 薪酬政策及薪酬檢討機制\n\n財政司司長根據管治委員會透過外匯基金諮詢委員會提出的建議，並考慮市場現行薪酬水平及慣例，釐定金管局員工的薪酬及服務條款。薪酬包括總現金酬金及公積金計劃，並附有少量實物福利。現金酬金包括每月固定薪金（或基本薪金）及浮動薪金，浮動薪金可按表現於每年年底以一筆過形式發放予個別員工。\n\n財政司司長每年根據管治委員會透過外匯基金諮詢委員會提出的建議，檢討金管局員工的薪酬，並考慮管治委員會對金管局上年度表現的評估、由獨立人力資源顧問進行的金融界薪酬調查結果，以及其他相關因素。金管局或會不時作出特別薪酬調整，以獎勵表現卓越的個別員工，並維持其薪酬的競爭力。"}
{"en":"# Corporate Social Responsibility\n\nThe HKMA is committed to fulfilling its corporate social responsibility, and aims to be a responsible and sustainable organisation. This commitment is manifested in various areas, including promoting a sustainable and environment-friendly marketplace, supporting the wider community, protecting the environment and nurturing a caring workplace.\n\n# MARKETPLACE\n\n# Green and sustainable banking\n\nClimate change is one of the major risks threatening the well-being of mankind and the sustainability of the world economy. The financial sector in which banks operate, being an integral part of the society, will also be impacted and hence should be more proactive in managing climate risks. The HKMA is committed to exploring ways to address this challenge. Against this background, the HKMA unveiled in May a number of measures for promoting the development of green finance in Hong Kong, including the adoption of a three-phased approach to promote green and sustainable banking.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nAs the investment manager of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA believes that the concept of responsible investment (RI) is highly relevant to its investment work. As the HKMA is one of the world’s largest asset owners, it will have a major impact on how fund managers pick assets.\n\n# Our Beliefs\n\nThe HKMA sees RI as an investment approach that takes into account the impact of various environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors on long-term investment returns and their sustainability. The HKMA believes that, by putting an appropriate emphasis on RI and sustainable long-term economic performance, it can better achieve the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund and reduce risks associated with the ESG-related matters of its underlying investments.\n\n# Our Principles\n\nThe HKMA’s guiding principle is that priority will generally be given to ESG investments if the long-term risk-adjusted return is comparable with other investments. Where appropriate, the HKMA adopts in its investment process the following RI principles that underpin its beliefs as a responsible long-term investor:\n\n# Integration\n\nThe HKMA incorporates ESG factors into its investment analysis processes to identify risks and opportunities, as it believes that these factors can materially affect the long-term value of its investments. Specifically, the HKMA has been integrating ESG factors into its investment process for both public and private market investments. For public market investments, the HKMA incorporates ESG factors in its credit risk analysis of bond investment. External managers that share the HKMA’s RI beliefs are selected and appointed. The HKMA communicates its RI beliefs to all its external managers and expects them to align in such a way that the overall sustainable long-term economic performance target is attainable. For private market investments, the ESG policies and practices of the HKMA’s general partners are examined as part of its due diligence process.\n\n# Active ownership\n\nThe HKMA exercises shareholder rights in its public equity holding in a manner that helps safeguard the long-term value of its investments. The HKMA believes that responsible corporate behaviour guided by ESG factors will help create shareholder value in the long term. The HKMA’s asset managers are expected to help the HKMA discharge its ownership responsibilities in the underlying investments by adopting active ownership through exercising voting rights and engaging with the corporates concerned.\n\n# Collaboration\n\nThe HKMA seeks to join hands with like-minded investors and regulators to promote good practices for the long-term management of investments. It participates in and speaks at public events to share views and encourage the investment community to adopt RI.\n\nSee the Reserves Management chapter for more details about the HKMA’s work on RI during the year.\n\n# Promoting financial inclusion\n\nThe HKMA attaches great importance to financial inclusion and has been making significant effort in promoting access to basic banking services by different segments of the society to meet the basic daily needs of the general public and the operational needs of legitimate businesses. In particular, the HKMA has been working closely with the banking industry on the following priority areas:\n\n- Encouraging banks to launch more physical banking facilities and develop digital and innovative channels for the delivery of basic banking services to serve the general public, particularly residents of remote areas and public housing estates, and the elderly;\n\n- Facilitating and monitoring the accessibility of bank accounts to individuals and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs);\n\n- Enhancing the accessibility of banking services to specific customer groups, for example, customers with disabilities and ethnic minorities;\n\n- Facilitating and monitoring the accessibility of bank credit to SMEs; and\n\n- Granting authorization to eight virtual banks, which will play an active role in promoting financial inclusion in delivering their banking services.\n\n# COMMUNITY\n\n# Promoting financial literacy\n\nThe HKMA promotes financial literacy through various channels. Apart from running educational programmes to promote smart and responsible use of banking and financial services by the public, the HKMA features on its revamped official website a new dedicated section on “Smart Consumers”, where the public can find useful information and smart tips on a wide range of banking and related products and services. Social media platforms such as Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube, Instagram and Twitter are used in addition to the HKMA official website and publications to provide up-to-date information on banking and financial affairs.\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre, serving as the HKMA’s major public education and research resource since 2003, introduces the work of the HKMA to the community and promotes public awareness of monetary and banking matters. Educational guided tours are offered daily for group visitors from schools and non-profit making organisations. public education seminars and other activities are also organised for students to enhance their financial knowledge and literacy. In addition, the HKMA works closely with the Investor and Financial Education Council to promote financial literacy in Hong Kong via its financial education platform, The Chin Family.\n\nSee the Corporate Functions chapter for more details about the HKMA’s work on promoting financial literacy during the year. See the Banking Stability chapter for more details about the HKMA’s work on promoting financial inclusion during the year.\n\n# Addressing the needs of special groups \n\n# Accessibility of Hong Kong banknotes\n\nThe 2018 Series of Banknotes retains accessibility features used in the previous series of banknotes to help the visually impaired differentiate between the denominations. These accessibility features include Braille, tactile lines and high-tactility numerals.\n\nTo help the visually impaired differentiate between the denomination of the banknotes, a mobile app, sponsored by the HKMA and developed by the Hong Kong Society for the Blind, uses the phone’s camera to scan the banknote patterns for the denomination. The app is available for download from Apple App Store and Google play Store for free. A note-measuring template sponsored by the HKMA and the three note-issuing banks has also been introduced to measure the length of the note. It can measure both the 2018 Series and the notes currently in circulation. The template is embossed with Braille on one side and symbols on the other. It is freely distributed at voluntary agencies serving the visually impaired community.\n\n# Coin Collection Programme\n\nUnder the Coin Collection programme, the HKMA collaborates with the Hong Kong Council of Social Service to deploy the Coin Carts to collect coins on flag days for non-governmental organisations.\n\n# Accessibility of public information\n\nThe revamped HKMA official website was launched in September. The revamped website has enhanced navigation structure to facilitate easy and convenient search by users based on their own preferences. In particular, the website contains a dedicated webpage “Information in Other Languages” under the “Smart Consumers” section, which provides useful information on banking services in seven languages commonly used by the ethnic minority community, namely Bahasa Indonesia, Hindi, Nepali, Punjabi, Tagalog, Thai and Urdu.\n\nThe HKMA is committed to ensuring that its website conforms to the maximum extent possible to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 Level AA standard, to facilitate barrier-free access to its online information by people with special needs.\n\n# volunteer and charitable activities\n\nThe HKMA supports community services by taking part in volunteer and charitable activities. The Senior Citizen Home Safety Association awarded the Community Engagement Crystal Award to the HKMA for participating in the 2018 Love & Peace of Mind Corporate Engagement Programme.\n\nCharitable events participated in by the HKMA Volunteer Team in 2019\n\n“Yo! Let’s Walk the Road” by the Youth Outreach.\n\nArtists and representatives from the social enterprise, Arts with the Disabled Association Hong Kong, visit the HKMA office, where its artworks are displayed.\n\nHKMA staff members take part actively in Blood Donation Day, Territory-Wide Flag Day, Community Chest’s Green Day, Love Teeth Day, Skip Lunch Day, Dress Casual Day and regular campaigns that collect clothes, toys and other reusable items for donation to charities.\n\nHKMA staff members take part actively in Blood Donation Day, organised by the Hong Kong Red Cross.\n\n# Caring organisation\n\nIn recognition of its commitment to care for the community, the HKMA was accredited with the “10 Years Plus Caring Organisation Logo” by the Hong Kong Council of Social Service for the 13th consecutive year.\n\n# ENVIRONMENT\n\n# Green office measures\n\nThe HKMA has an established environmental policy to protect and preserve the environment. The policy and implementation measures are promulgated among its staff regularly. Green office measures include:\n\n# Paper\/Photocopying\/Printing\n\n- Encouraging the use of recycled paper and envelopes;\nDistributing electronic copies instead of hard copies of documents;\n- printing on both sides of the paper;\n- Using colour printing and copying only when necessary;\n- Avoiding the use of paper cups; and \n- Using environmentally friendly paper and ink for the HKMA’s Annual Report.\n\n# Electricity\n\n- Switching off PCs, printers, lights, audio-visual systems and other electrical appliances when these devices are not in use. Reactivating the preset power-saving mode installed in most equipment, such as water dispensers, electric punching machines and shredders, after use outside their preset operating hours; and \n- Reviewing regularly the need for additional air-conditioning beyond normal business hours.\n\n# Recycling\n\n- Making good use of recycled bins to collect different categories of waste, including paper, cans, bottles, batteries, CDs and ink cartridges.\n\n# WORKPLACE\n\n# Diversity and inclusion\n\n# Equal Opportunities Policy\n\nThe HKMA is an equal opportunities employer. It believes that everyone should be able to work in an environment free of discrimination, harassment, vilification and victimisation. The equal opportunities policy applies to job advertisements, recruitment, terms and conditions of employment, performance assessment, promotion, transfer, training, dismissal, grievance procedures and general conduct.\n\n# Key statistics on diversity\n\npeople are central to the work of the HKMA. We value the diversity of our workforce, which has a balanced gender representation and a spectrum of different age groups.\n\nFemale representation at the senior management levels, that is, Executive Director and above, made up 31% as of February 2020.\n\n# Human capital key statistics on 1 January 2020\n\n# Quality workplace\n\nTo cater for projected operational needs, the HKMA renovated the offices during the year to create an open layout, increase capacity and allow for more efficient use of space. Breakout areas and ergonomic furniture are part of the new office design. To enhance the staff’s physical health, height-adjustable desks were offered to staff members, allowing them to change their postures easily throughout the day between sitting and standing.\n\nHeight-adjustable desks improve office ergonomics.\n\n# Staff well-being\n\nThe HKMA promotes work-life balance and cares about the health and work safety of the staff. Regular talks on healthy lifestyles, stress management and workplace safety are organised and indoor air quality is monitored. Annual on-site medical check-ups and flu vaccinations are arranged. The HKMA also sponsors a professional counselling service comprising experienced psychologists and social workers.\n\nThroughout the year, different activities are organised to enhance the staff’s physical wellness, promote their sense of belonging, and foster co-operation and team spirit. Interest classes are held for staff members and their families. Inter-organisational and cross-divisional activities such as basketball and football competitions with fellow regulators provide opportunities to socialise.\n","terms":{"\"Capital preservation First,

企業社會責任\n\n金管局致力履行企業社會責任，並致力成為一個負責任及可持續發展的機構。這項承諾體現在不同範疇，包括促進可持續及環保的市場、支持更廣泛的社區、保護環境及建立關懷職場。\n\n# 市場\n\n# 綠色及可持續銀行業務\n\n氣候變遷是威脅人類福祉及全球經濟永續性的主要風險之一。銀行所處的金融業是社會的重要組成部分，亦會受到影響，因此應更積極地管理氣候風險。金管局致力探索應對這項挑戰的方法。有鑑於此，金管局於五月公佈多項措施，以促進香港綠色金融的發展，包括採用三階段方法推動綠色及可持續銀行業務。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n作為外匯基金的投資經理，金管局認為「負責任投資」（RI）的概念與其投資工作高度相關。由於金管局是全球最大的資產擁有者之一，它將對基金經理如何挑選資產產生重大影響。\n\n# 我們的信念\n\n金管局視「負責任投資」為一種投資方式，會考慮各種環境、社會及治理（ESG）因素對長期投資回報及其永續性的影響。金管局相信，適當地重視「負責任投資」及可持續的長期經濟表現，可更好地實現外匯基金的投資目標，並降低與基礎投資的 ESG 相關事項相關的風險。\n\n# 我們的原則\n\n金管局的指導原則是，如果經風險調整後的長期收益與其它投資相若，一般會優先考慮 ESG 投資。在適當情況下，金管局在投資過程中採用下列「負責任投資」原則，以支持其作為負責任的長期投資者的信念：\n\n# 整合\n\n金管局將 ESG 因素納入其投資分析程序，以識別風險和機遇，因為它相信這些因素會對投資的長期價值產生重大影響。具體而言，金管局已將 ESG 因素納入其公共和私人市場投資的投資流程中。在公開市場投資方面，金管局在債券投資的信用風險分析中納入 ESG 因素。金管局挑選和委任了與金管局持有相同「負責任投資」信念的外聘投資經理。金管局向所有外聘投資經理傳達其「負責任投資」信念，並期望他們作出配合，以達致整體可持續的長期經濟表現目標。在私人市場投資方面，金管局一般合夥人的 ESG 政策和實務作為盡職審查程序的一部分受到檢視。\n\n# 積極行使資產擁有權\n\n金管局在上市公司股票持有權中行使股東權利的方式，有助於保障其投資的長期價值。金管局相信，由 ESG 因素引導的負責任企業行為，有助於在長遠為股東創造價值。金管局的資產經理應透過行使投票權及與有關企業接觸以實行積極的資產擁有權，協助金管局履行其於基礎投資的擁有權責任。\n\n# 合作\n\n金管局致力與志同道合的投資者和監管機構攜手合作，推廣良好實務以進行長期投資管理。它參與公開活動並發表演說，以分享觀點並鼓勵投資界採用「負責任投資」。\n\n有關金管局在該年度在「負責任投資」方面的工作詳情，請參閱「儲備管理」一章。\n\n# 推動金融普惠\n\n金管局非常重視金融普惠，並一直作出重大努力，促進社會不同階層人士使用基本銀行服務，以滿足市民的基本日常需要及合法企業的營運需要。具體而言，金管局一直與銀行業界在以下優先領域緊密合作：\n\n- 鼓勵銀行推出更多實體銀行設施，並開發數位及創新渠道，以提供基本銀行服務，服務大眾，尤其是偏遠地區和公共屋邨的居民及長者；\n\n- 促進和監察個人及中小企業使用銀行帳戶的情況；\n\n- 提升特定客戶群體使用銀行服務的便利性，例如殘疾人士及少數族裔客戶；\n\n- 促進和監察中小企業使用銀行貸款的情況；及\n\n- 向八間虛擬銀行發出牌照，它們將在提供銀行服務方面發揮積極作用，以促進金融普惠。\n\n# 社區\n\n# 推廣金融知識\n\n金管局透過不同渠道推廣金融知識。除了舉辦教育活動，以促進市民聰明及負責任地使用銀行及金融服務外，金管局亦在翻新後的官方網站增設「智醒消費者」專頁，讓市民可找到有關各類銀行及相關產品和服務的實用資訊及技巧。除了金管局官方網站及刊物外，亦會運用 Facebook、LinkedIn、YouTube、Instagram 及 Twitter 等社交媒體平台，提供最新的銀行及金融資訊。\n\n自 2003 年起，金管局資訊中心一直擔任金管局的主要公眾教育及研究資源，向社區介紹金管局的工作，並提高公眾對貨幣及銀行業事宜的認識。中心每日為學校及非牟利團體的團體訪客提供教育導覽團。此外，亦為學生舉辦公眾教育講座及其他活動，以提升他們的金融知識及識字能力。此外，金管局與投資者及理財教育委員會緊密合作，透過其理財教育平台「錢家有道」，在香港推廣金融知識。\n\n有關金管局在該年度推廣金融知識的工作詳情，請參閱「機構職能」一章。有關金管局在該年度推廣金融普惠的工作詳情，請參閱「銀行體系穩定」一章。\n\n# 回應特殊群體的需要\n\n# 香港鈔票的無障礙設施\n\n2018 鈔票系列保留了上一個鈔票系列的無障礙設施，以協助視障人士分辨不同面額。這些無障礙設施包括點字、手感線及凹凸銀碼。\n\n為協助視障人士分辨鈔票面額，由金管局贊助、香港盲人輔導會研發的行動應用程式，利用手機鏡頭掃描鈔票圖案以辨認面額。該程式可於 Apple App Store 及 Google Play Store 免費下載。金管局與三間發鈔銀行亦贊助推出量鈔器，以量度鈔票長度。它可量度 2018 鈔票系列及現時流通的鈔票。量鈔器一面印有點字，另一面印有符號。它於為視障人士服務的志願機構免費派發。\n\n# 硬幣收集計劃\n\n在硬幣收集計劃下，金管局與香港社會服務聯會合作，在賣旗日派出收銀車為非政府組織收集硬幣。\n\n#

{"en":"# The Exchange Fund\n\n- Report of the Director of Audit\n- Exchange Fund Financial Statements\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 187 to 293, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2019, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2019, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards. My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report. I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2019. These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.5, 2.6 and 38.1 to the financial statements.\n\nAs at 31 December 2019, the Group had financial assets totalling HK$3,874,223 million and financial liabilities totalling HK$1,158,686 million valued at fair value.\n\nFor 91% of these financial assets and all these financial liabilities, their fair values were quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 inputs) or were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data (Level 2 inputs).\n\nFor the remaining 9% of these financial assets, their fair values were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data (Level 3 inputs). Such financial assets totalled HK$338,758 million, including mainly unlisted investment funds.\n\nGiven the substantial amount and the estimations involved, valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value was a key audit matter.\n\nThe audit procedures on valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value included:\n\n- obtaining an understanding of the procedures, including relevant controls, for valuing different categories of financial assets and financial liabilities;\n\n- evaluating and testing the controls, including relevant application controls of the computer systems;\n\n- obtaining external confirmations on the valuation, existence, rights and obligations and completeness of the financial assets and financial liabilities;\n\n- where quoted market prices were used, verifying the prices to independent sources;\n\n- where valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions, and verifying the inputs to independent sources; and\n\n- where valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Valuation of investment properties at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.11, 18 and 19 to the financial statements.\n\nThe Group’s investment properties were stated at their fair values, totalling HK$22,481 million as at 31 December 2019. The Group also had interests in twenty two joint ventures totalling HK$44,506 million, whose principal activities were holding overseas investment properties. The fair values of these investment properties, whether held by the Group directly or by joint ventures, were mainly determined based on valuations by independent professional valuers. Such valuations involved significant judgments and estimates, including the valuation methodologies and the assumptions used.\n\nThe audit procedures on valuation of investment properties at fair value included:\n\n- obtaining and reviewing the valuation reports of investment properties held by the Group directly or by joint ventures, and verifying that the fair values were based on the valuations stated in the valuation reports;\n\n- assessing the independence and qualifications of the valuers; and\n\n- evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises all the information included in the 2019 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICpA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. I also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nJohn Chu\nDirector of

意見\n\n我已審計了外匯基金及其附屬公司（下稱「集團」）的財務報表，該報表載於第187至293頁，包括外匯基金及集團截至2019年12月31日的資產負債表，以及該年度的收支帳目、全面收益表、權益變動表和現金流量表，以及財務報表附註，包括重要會計政策概要。\n\n我認為，該財務報表根據香港會計師公會（「香港會計師公會」）頒布的《香港財務報告準則》（「香港財務報告準則」），真實而公允地反映了該基金及集團截至2019年12月31日的財務狀況，以及該年度的財務表現和現金流量，並已按照行政長官根據《外匯基金條例》（第66章）第7條發出的指示妥善編製。\n\n# 意見依據\n\n我按照行政長官根據《外匯基金條例》第7條發出的指示及審計署的審計準則進行審計。我根據這些準則所承擔的責任，在我報告中的「審計師對財務報表審計的責任」一節中作了進一步說明。我根據這些準則獨立於集團之外，並已履行了根據這些準則所承擔的其他道德責任。我相信我所獲取的審計憑證是充分及適當的，為我發表意見提供了依據。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項是指我在專業判斷中認為對2019年12月31日止年度財務報表審計最具重要性的事項。這些事項是在我對財務報表整體進行審計的背景下考慮的，並在形成我的意見時予以考慮，我不對這些事項單獨發表意見。\n\n# 以公允價值計量的金融資產及金融負債之估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.5、2.6及38.1。\n\n截至2019年12月31日，集團持有以公允價值計量的金融資產共3,874,223百萬港元，金融負債共1,158,686百萬港元。\n\n其中91%的金融資產及所有金融負債的公允價值，是根據相同資產或負債在活躍市場上的報價（第一層投入值）或使用以可觀察市場數據為基礎的估值方法估算而得（第二層投入值）。\n\n餘下9%的金融資產的公允價值，是使用以非可觀察市場數據為基礎的估值方法估算而得（第三層投入值）。這些金融資產總額為338,758百萬港元，主要包括非上市投資基金。\n\n鑑於所涉及的金額龐大及估算性質，以公允價值計量金融資產及金融負債的估值成為一項關鍵審計事項。\n\n以公允價值計量金融資產及金融負債的估值的審計程序包括：\n\n- 了解估值不同類別金融資產及金融負債的程序，包括相關監控措施；\n\n- 評估及測試監控措施，包括電腦系統的相關應用程式監控措施；\n\n- 就金融資產及金融負債的估值、存在、權利及義務和完整性取得外部確認；\n\n- 若使用市場報價，則向獨立來源核實該價格；\n\n- 若使用以可觀察市場數據為基礎的估值方法，則評估估值方法的適當性及假設的合理性，並向獨立來源核實投入值；及\n\n- 若使用以非可觀察市場數據為基礎的估值方法，則評估估值方法的適當性及假設和投入值的合理性。\n\n# 以公允價值計量投資物業的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.11、18及19。\n\n集團的投資物業按其公允價值列報，截至2019年12月31日總額為22,481百萬港元。集團亦持有二十二家合營公司的權益，總額為44,506百萬港元，其主要業務為持有海外投資物業。這些投資物業的公允價值，不論由集團直接持有或由合營公司持有，主要根據獨立專業估值師的估值而定。該等估值涉及重大判斷及估計，包括所用的估值方法及假設。\n\n以公允價值計量投資物業的估值的審計程序包括：\n\n- 取得及審閱集團直接持有或由合營公司持有的投資物業的估值報告，並核實公允價值是否以估值報告所述的估值為依據；\n\n- 評估估值師的獨立性及資格；及\n\n- 評估估值方法的適當性及假設和投入值的合理性。\n\n# 其他資訊\n\n其他資訊由金融管理專員負責。其他資訊包括香港金融管理局2019年年報中除財務報表及我就該報表所發表的審計師報告外的所有資訊。\n\n我對財務報表發表的意見並不涵蓋其他資訊，我亦不就其他資訊發表任何形式的保證結論。\n\n在審計財務報表時，我的責任是閱讀其他資訊，並考慮其他資訊是否與財務報表或我在審計中獲取的知識有重大不一致，或是否似乎有重大誤報。如果我根據所進行的工作得出結論，認為其他資訊存在重大誤報，我有責任報告該事實。我在此方面沒有任何報告。\n\n# 金融管理專員及外匯基金諮詢委員會審核小組委員會對財務報表的責任\n\n金融管理專員負責按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》及行政長官根據《外匯基金條例》第7條發出的指示，編製真實而公允的財務報表，並負責金融管理專員認為必要的內部控制，以使編製的財務報表不存在因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大誤報。\n\n在編製財務報表時，金融管理專員負責評估集團的持續經營能力，酌情披露與持續經營有關的事項，並採用持續經營的會計基礎。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會審核小組委員會負責監督集團的財務報告程序。\n\n# 審計師對財務報表審計的責任\n\n我的目標是取得合理保證，以確定財務報表整體是否不存在因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大誤報，並發表包含我意見的審計師報告。合理保證是高水平的保證，但並不能保證按照審計署的審計準則進行的審計能夠在存在重大誤報時總能發現該誤報。誤報可能因欺詐或錯誤而產生，如果其個別或合計起來可能影響用戶依據這些財務報表作出的經濟決策，則被認為是重大的。\n\n在按照審計署的審計準則進行審計時，我運用專業判斷並保持職業懷疑態度。我還：\n\n- 識別及評估財務報表因欺詐或錯誤而出現重大誤報的風險，設計及執行審計程序以應對這些風險，並取得充分及適當的審計憑證，作為我發表意見的依據。因欺詐而未發現重大誤報的風險高於因錯誤而未發現重大誤報的風險，因為欺詐可能涉及串通、偽造、故意遺漏、虛假陳述或凌駕於內部控制之上；\n\n- 了解與審計相關的內部控制，以設計適當的審計程序，但目的並非對集團的內部控制有效性發表意見；\n\n- 評估金融管理專員所採用的會計政策的適當性、會計估計的合理性及相關披露情況；\n\n- 就金融管理專員使用持續經營會計基礎的適當性作出結論，並根據所獲取的審計憑證，確定是否存在與可能對集團持續經營能力產生重大疑慮的事件或情況有關的重大不確定性。如果我得出結論認為存在重大不確定性，我有責任在審計師報告中提請注意財務報表中的相關披露，或如果披露不充分，則修改我的意見。我的結論是基於截至我發表審計師報告之日所獲取的審計憑證。然而，未來的事件或情況可能導致集團無法持續經營；\n\n- 評估財務報表的整體呈現、結構及內容，包括披露情況，以及財務報表是否以實現公允呈現的方式反映了基礎交易及事件；並取得有關集團內實體或業務活動的財務資訊的充分適當審計憑證，以對財務報表發表意見。我負責指導、監督及執行集團審計工作，並對我的審計意見負全部責任。\n\n我就審計的計劃範圍和時間安排及重大審計發現等事項，與外匯基金諮詢委員會審核小組委員會進行溝通，包括我在審計過程中識別出的任何重大內部控制缺陷。\n\n我亦向外匯基金諮詢委員會審核小組委員會提供一份聲明，表明我已遵守有關獨立性的相關道德要求，並向其溝通所有可能合理地被認為是影響我獨立性的關係及其他事項，以及適用的相關保障措施。\n\n從與外匯基金諮詢委員會審核小組委員會溝通的事項中，我確定了在本期財務報表審計中最為重要的事項，因此這些事項是關鍵審計事項。除非法律或法規禁止公開披露該事項，或在極為罕見的情況下，我確定某事項不應在我的報告中溝通，因為這樣做所造成的負面後果將合理地預期超過該溝通的公共利益，否則我會在我的審計師報告中描述這些事項。\n\n朱偉文\n審計署署長\n\n審計署\n26樓\n入境事務大樓\n灣仔告士打道7號\n香港\n\n2020年4月3日"}

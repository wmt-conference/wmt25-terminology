{"zh":"# 保持警惕，應對風浪\n\n2024年，金管局在錯綜複雜的外部環境中迎難而上。年內，區域性軍事衝突不斷、多國舉行重要的選舉，全球經濟走向欠明朗，令世界局勢持續震盪。然而，各地的決策者在控制通脹飈升和支持經濟發展之間尋求適當平衡，推動主要經濟體實現穩健增長。此外，隨着美國啟動四年來首次減息，加上內地連串支持經濟的政策出台，令市場情緒轉趨樂觀。整體而言，全球宏觀環境仍充滿變數。\n\n面對複雜形勢，我們的應對策略是繼續充分發揮香港離岸人民幣業務、金融科技與綠色和可持續金融的樞紐作用和獨特優勢，持續鞏固香港國際金融中心的領先地位。2024年，金管局在這些重點領域取得顯著進展。年度盛事「國際金融領袖投資峰會」等多項活動和計劃反應熱烈，充分展現出國際社會對香港國際金融中心發展前景的堅定信心。\n\n面對香港經濟的周期性調整和結構性轉型，我們與銀行界緊密合作，加強對中小型企業（中小企）的支援，紓緩企業在高息環境下的還款負擔，同時助力它們持續發展。加上中央和香港特區政府推出的多項政策措施，香港經濟得以穩步復甦。2024年，本港經濟錄得2.5%的溫和增長。\n\n踏入2025年，全球經濟在更趨複雜的地緣政治形勢下繼續面臨諸多不確定性。貿易保護主義升温和關稅壁壘增加，將導致全球供應鏈受阻，地緣經濟割裂加劇，為全球經濟前景增添更多變數。倘若地緣政治緊張局勢進一步升溫，將可能對實體經濟和環球金融市場造成雙重衝擊。\n\n面對複雜嚴峻的經濟和金融環境，金管局將保持警惕，切實履行我們的職責，竭力維護香港貨幣與銀行體系穩定，並持續鞏固香港國際金融中心地位。我們將深化與市場各界的聯繫，積極推動新興領域的發展，確保香港在全球金融格局中保持領先優勢。\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度：穩健基石\n\n聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）實施40多年來，一直是香港貨幣與金融穩定的基石，成功抵禦了多個經濟和利率周期的挑戰，展現出強大的抗震力。\n\n儘管2024年美國利率政策充滿不確定性，但港元貨幣市場繼續按照聯匯制度的機制暢順運行。年內港元滙率在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的兌換範圍內上落，在年初首四個月因流動性回軟而稍為走弱，其後逐步轉強，至年底時接近強方兌換保證水平。穩定的匯率充分反映了市場對聯匯制度的信心。同時聯匯制度亦持續獲得國際貨幣基金組織及國際金融界的高度認可。\n\n市場對聯匯制度的信心，建基於我們持續主動向公眾闡釋聯匯制度的運作機制和優點，以及嚴密的市場監察工作。通過收集詳細數據，結合先進的數據分析和人工智能技術，我們對市場進行更及時、更全面的監察和金融穩定性評估。\n\n# 銀行體系：多重挑戰下保持穩健\n\n2024年，香港銀行體系在多重宏觀挑戰下展現出強大的韌性，資本和流動性保持充裕。2024年底，本地銀行綜合總資本比率達21.8%，高於8%的國際最低要求。流動性方面亦同樣充裕，第4季度大型銀行流動性覆蓋比率達178.4%，高於100%的法定最低門檻。受利率持續高企、部分內地房企債務問題尚未完全緩解，以及本地商業房地產市場疲弱等因素影響，特定分類貸款比率於年底上升至1.96%。由於銀行恪守審慎的信用風險管理並維持充足撥備，相關風險總體可控。\n\n在持續密切監察銀行信貸風險包括物業按揭貸款相關風險的同時，金管局針對物業市場狀況及銀行體系相關風險的變化，於2024年對物業按揭貸款的逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施實施了兩輪調整。具體而言，所有住宅物業的最高按揭成數及供款與入息比率上限均回復至2009年實施逆周期宏觀審慎措施前的水平。\n\n在持續強化銀行信貸風險管理的同時，我們亦致力提升銀行的運作與科技穩健性，應對日益依賴第三方服務提供者所帶來的新挑戰。以去年7月的CrowdStrike全球事故為例，該事故凸顯了在當今全球高度連繫的環境下，運作故障可能造成連鎖的嚴重後果。雖然事故對香港銀行業影響有限，但反映出我們必須確保銀行建立穩健架構，即使發生嚴重的情況仍能維持關鍵業務運作。令人鼓舞的是，目前香港所有銀行均建立了運作穩健性架構，並已經進入配對工作及情景測試的重要階段，通過識別和修補脆弱環節，確保關鍵業務的運作。\n\n與此同時，為應對多變的網絡威脅，金管局去年着力加強銀行體系的網絡防衛能力，包括發布新指引、開展專題審查。我們並與本地其他金融監管機構合作推進跨行業「網絡地圖」項目，評估和應對金融機構、金融市場基礎設施及科技服務供應商相互連繫可能引發的系統性網絡風險。在2024年完成試行後，該項目將於今年全面展開。\n\n科技發展帶來的另一個重大挑戰是金融詐騙威脅不斷升級且手法日趨複雜，需要銀行、監管機構、執法機構和公眾聯手應對。我們已經要求銀行進一步加強網上銀行保安措施和監察系統。反訛騙及洗黑錢情報工作組（情報工作組）去年亦將覆蓋範圍擴大至所有主要零售銀行及六家儲值支付工具持牌機構，顯著提升了情報交換的效率和規模，沒收的犯罪得益亦隨之增加。同時，促進銀行間訊息分享的法例修訂諮詢獲得廣泛支持，該法例將有助進一步提升銀行偵測及防止金融罪案的能力。\n\n除上述措施外，提升公眾對可疑交易的警覺性及自我保護意識亦同樣重要。2024年，我們擴大了「可疑帳號警示」機制的覆蓋範圍，並推出《保障消費者防詐騙約章2.0》，引入更多參與機構，以擴大約章的保護網，進一步保障公眾。同時，我們亦推出「智安存服務，讓銀行存戶可選擇將部分存款分隔，提供額外保障。\n\n除上述各項協助客戶防範詐騙的措施外，我們亦針對個別客戶可能因衝動而過度借貸，在去年要求零售銀行為無抵押消費信貸產品提供至少七天的冷靜期，讓客戶在訂立貸款協議後能再三仔細考量和評估其財務責任和償還能力。同時，「信資通」個人資料基建項目亦於去年成功推出，在提升個人信貸資料服務方面取得重要進展。\n\n除監管工作外，2024年我們的另一工作重點是確保信貸供應以支持實體經濟，這對作為香港經濟重要支柱的中小企尤為重要。去年，我們與銀行業聯合推出「9+5」支持措施，協助中小企獲取銀行融資應對周轉需要，並助力其升級轉型。銀行已經作出承諾：不會要求按時供款的按揭客戶提前還款，亦不會純粹基於抵押品價值下跌而下調信貸額度。截至目前，已經有超過39,000家中小企獲得信貸支援及新批貸款，涉及信貸額度合共950億港元。銀行亦在貸款組合中預留約3,900億港元專項資金，支持中小企在市場環境變化中持續發展。此外，金管局與香港銀行公會聯合成立「中小企融資專責小組」，從具體個案及行業整體層面為中小企提供支援。鑑於當前貿易爭端及外圍經濟前景不明朗，我們於2025年4月再新增三項針對特定行業的支持措施，進一步加強對多個行業中小企的支持。與此同時，我們還推出了兩項措施以支持香港整體經濟發展。\n\n在維護銀行體系穩定和提升其運作效率方面，我們持續推動銀行業的科技應用，並着力加快銀行業採用金融科技的步伐。目前，香港所有零售銀行均已經將金融科技應用於日常營運。此外，鑑於生成式人工智能(GenAI)在強化銀行業風險管理、防範詐騙和提升客戶體驗方面的潛力，金管局與數碼港去年合作推出「GenAI沙盒」，鼓勵銀行在負責任的前提下應用GenAI。我們同時向銀行發布指引，明確規定銀行若在面向客戶的服務中應用GenAI ，必須確保客戶獲得充分保障。此外，金管局內部亦積極運用GenAI技術，提升分析和監管效率。除GenAI外，我們還通過推出全新FiNETech系列活動、建立配對平台「FintechConnect」，以及舉辦一系列跨行業交流活動，促進金融服務與科技界的連繫，推動金融科技生態圈的合作與創新發展。\n\n# 鞏固香港國際金融中心的地位\n\n儘管2024年充滿挑戰和不確定性，香港仍穩守國際金融中心的領先地位，更在多個領域和國際影響力方面持續拓展提升。\n\n香港作為連接中國內地與國際市場的重要橋樑，扮演着無可比擬的獨特角色。通過推出各項有利措施和加強與各方協作，香港不斷鞏固提升其作為區內金融科技與可持續金融樞紐的地位。有關我們在綠色和可持續金融方面的具體工作，可參閱《二零二四年可持續發展報告》。\n\n# 人民幣業務增長迅速，深化與內地金融合作\n\n2024年，香港人民幣業務持續保持良好勢頭，在貿易結算支付、離岸債券發行，尤其是離岸銀行貸款方面均錄得顯著增長。人民幣即時支付結算系統創下日均交易額的歷史新高，達3.1萬億元人民幣，反映香港全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的作用更為突出。\n\n與此同時，我們持續深化香港與內地的金融互聯互通。2024年推出的「三聯通、三便利」政策，加上今年初公布的六項新措施，均取得重大政策突破。其中，金管局推出1,000億元人民幣貿易融資流動資金安排，為銀行提供穩定且具成本效益的資金來源，以擴展人民幣貿易融資服務，從而支持實體經濟發展。另一項政策突破是允許投資者使用債券通「北向通」持有的在岸債券，特別是國家財政部和政策性銀行發行的在岸債券，作為金管局人民幣流動資金安排、香港場外結算公司及離岸人民幣債券回購業務的合資格抵押品。這一創新舉措提升了在岸債券對離岸投資者的吸引力，有助於促進全球投資者更大程度地參與在岸債券市場。我們去年亦推出「跨境理財通2.0」，實現了多方面的升級優化，包括提供更多元化的投資產品、更靈活的銷售與推廣安排，並擴大個人投資額度。這些措施不僅鞏固了香港作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位，也進一步強化了我們作為連接內地與國際市場的重要門戶角色。\n","terms":{"$mart理財321":["$mart

external environment. Throughout the year, regional military conflicts persisted, several countries held important elections, and the global economic outlook remained unclear, causing continued turbulence in the world situation. However, policymakers around the world sought an appropriate balance between controlling soaring inflation and supporting economic growth, driving robust growth in major economies. In addition, as the United States initiated its first interest rate cut in four years, coupled with a series of economic support policies implemented by mainland China, market sentiment turned optimistic. Overall, the global macroeconomic environment remains full of uncertainties.\n\nIn the face of this complex situation, our strategy is to continue to fully leverage Hong Kong’s role as a hub for offshore renminbi business, fintech, and green and sustainable finance, as well as its unique advantages, to further consolidate Hong Kong’s leading position as an international financial centre. In 2024, the HKMA made significant progress in these key areas. Major events such as the annual Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit and other activities and programmes received enthusiastic responses, demonstrating the international community’s strong confidence in the development prospects of Hong Kong as an international financial centre.\n\nIn the face of cyclical adjustments and structural transformation of Hong Kong’s economy, we have worked closely with the banking sector to strengthen support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), alleviate their repayment burden in a high interest rate environment, and help them continue to grow. Coupled with a number of policy measures introduced by the Central Government and the Hong Kong SAR Government, Hong Kong’s economy has recovered steadily. In 2024, Hong Kong’s economy recorded a moderate growth of 2.5%.\n\nAs we enter 2025, the global economy continues to face many uncertainties in an increasingly complex geopolitical environment. Rising protectionist trade policies and increased tariff barriers will disrupt global supply chains and exacerbate geo-economic fragmentation, adding more variables to the global economic outlook. If geopolitical tensions escalate further, they could have a dual impact on the real economy and global financial markets.\n\nIn the face of this complex and challenging economic and financial environment, the HKMA will remain vigilant, fulfil its responsibilities effectively, strive to maintain the stability of Hong Kong’s monetary and banking systems, and continue to consolidate Hong Kong’s position as an international financial centre. We will deepen our connections with the market, actively promote the development of emerging areas, and ensure that Hong Kong maintains its leading position in the global financial landscape.\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System: a solid foundation\n\nThe Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has been in operation for more than 40 years and has been the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, successfully withstanding the challenges of multiple economic and interest rate cycles and demonstrating strong resilience.\n\nDespite the uncertainties in US interest rate policy in 2024, Hong Kong’s currency market continued to operate smoothly under the LERS mechanism. During the year, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate fluctuated within the range of 7.75 to 7.85 Hong Kong dollars to 1 US dollar. It weakened slightly in the first four months of the year due to softer liquidity, but gradually strengthened thereafter, approaching the strong-side Convertibility Undertakings level by year-end. The stable exchange rate fully reflects the market’s confidence in the LERS. At the same time, the LERS continues to receive high recognition from the International Monetary Fund and the international financial community.\n\nMarket confidence in the LERS is based on our continued proactive efforts to explain the operation mechanism and advantages of the system to the public, as well as our rigorous market surveillance work. By collecting detailed data and combining it with advanced data analytics and artificial intelligence technologies, we are able to monitor the market more promptly and comprehensively and assess financial stability.\n\n# Banking system: remains robust amid multiple challenges\n\nIn 2024, Hong Kong’s banking system demonstrated strong resilience amid multiple macroeconomic challenges, with ample capital and liquidity. At the end of 2024, the consolidated total capital ratio of local banks stood at 21.8%, higher than the international minimum requirement of 8%. Liquidity was also ample, with the liquidity coverage ratio of large banks reaching 178.4% in the fourth quarter, higher than the statutory minimum threshold of 100%. Affected by factors such as persistently high interest rates, unresolved debt problems of some mainland property developers, and a weak local commercial property market, the classified loan ratio rose to 1.96% at year-end. As banks adhere to prudent credit risk management and maintain sufficient provisions, the related risks are generally under control.\n\nWhile continuing to closely monitor bank credit risks, including those related to property mortgage loans, the HKMA implemented two rounds of adjustments to the countercyclical macroprudential regulatory measures for property mortgage loans in 2024 in response to changes in property market conditions and related risks in the banking system. Specifically, the maximum loan-to-value ratio and the debt-service ratio limit for all residential properties were restored to the levels before the implementation of countercyclical macroprudential measures in 2009.\n\nWhile continuing to strengthen banks’ credit risk management, we are also committed to enhancing banks’ operational and technological resilience to address new challenges arising from increasing reliance on third-party service providers. The CrowdStrike incident in July last year highlighted the potentially severe consequences of operational failures in today’s highly interconnected global environment. Although the incident had limited impact on Hong Kong’s banking sector, it underscored the need for banks to establish robust frameworks to maintain critical operations even in severe situations. Encouragingly, all banks in Hong Kong have now established operational resilience frameworks and have entered the important stage of mapping and scenario testing exercises to identify and address vulnerabilities and ensure the continuity of critical operations.\n\nAt the same time, to address evolving cyber threats, the HKMA worked to strengthen the cyber resilience of the banking system last year, including issuing new guidelines and conducting thematic reviews. We also collaborated with other local financial regulators to advance a cross-industry Cyber Mapping exercise to assess and address systemic cyber risks that may arise from the interconnectedness of financial institutions, financial market infrastructures, and technology service providers. After a pilot run in 2024, the project will be fully launched this year.\n\nAnother major challenge brought about by technological development is the escalating threat of financial fraud and scams, with increasingly sophisticated methods, which requires collaboration among banks, regulators, law enforcement bodies and the public to address. We have required banks to further strengthen their internet banking security measures and monitoring systems. The Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce (FMLIT) also expanded its coverage last year to all major retail banks and six Stored Value Facility (SVF) licensees, significantly enhancing the efficiency and scale of intelligence exchange, with a corresponding increase in confiscated criminal proceeds. At the same time, the consultation on legislative amendments to facilitate bank-to-bank information sharing received widespread support. The amendments will help further enhance banks’ ability to detect and prevent financial crimes.\n\nIn addition to the above measures, it is equally important to raise public awareness of suspicious transactions and enhance self-protection. In 2024, we expanded the coverage of the pre-transaction alerts mechanism and launched the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter 2.0, bringing in more participating institutions to expand the protection network and further safeguard the public. At the same time, we also launched the Money Safe service, which allows bank depositors to choose to segregate part of their deposits for additional protection.\n\nIn addition to the above measures to help customers prevent fraud, we also addressed the issue of individual customers who may borrow excessively on impulse by requiring retail banks last year to provide a minimum seven-day cooling-off period for unsecured consumer credit products, allowing customers to carefully consider and assess their financial responsibilities and repayment capabilities after entering into a loan agreement. At the same time, the Credit Data Smart personal data infrastructure project was successfully launched last year, marking a significant step forward in enhancing consumer credit reference services.\n\nIn addition to regulatory work, another focus of our work in 2024 was to ensure credit supply to support the real economy, which is particularly important for SMEs, a key pillar of Hong Kong’s economy. Last year, we jointly launched the ‘9+5’ support measures with the banking sector to help SMEs obtain bank financing to meet their working capital needs and support their upgrading and transformation. Banks have made commitments not to require mortgage customers who are paying on time to repay early, and not to reduce credit limits solely on the basis of a decline in collateral value. To date, more than 39,000 SMEs have received credit reliefs and new loans, with a total credit line of HK$95 billion. Banks have also set aside about HK$390 billion in special funds in their loan portfolios to support SMEs’ continued development in a changing market environment. In addition, the HKMA and the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB) jointly established a Taskforce on SME Lending to provide support to SMEs at both the individual case and industry-wide levels. Given the current trade disputes and uncertain external economic outlook, we introduced three additional sector-specific measures in April 2025 to further strengthen support for SMEs in multiple sectors. At the same time, we also launched two measures to support Hong Kong’s overall economic development.\n\nIn terms of maintaining the stability of the banking system and enhancing its operational efficiency, we continue to promote the application of technology in the banking sector and accelerate the adoption of fintech. Currently, all retail banks in Hong Kong have applied fintech in their daily operations. In addition, given the potential of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in enhancing risk management, fraud prevention, and customer experience in the banking sector, the HKMA and Cyberport jointly launched the GenAI Sandbox last year to encourage banks to apply GenAI in a responsible manner. We also issued guidelines to banks, stipulating that if GenAI is applied in customer-facing applications, banks must ensure that customers are adequately protected. Furthermore, the HKMA has actively applied GenAI internally to enhance analytical and regulatory efficiency. In addition to GenAI, we have also launched a new FiNETech series, established a matching platform called Fintech Connect, and organised a series of cross-industry exchange activities to promote connections between the financial services and technology sectors and drive cooperation and innovation in the fintech ecosystem.\n\n# Consolidating Hong Kong’s position as an international financial centre\n\nDespite the challenges and uncertainties in 2024, Hong Kong has maintained its leading position as an international financial centre and continued to expand and enhance its presence in multiple areas and its international influence.\n\nHong Kong plays a unique and unparalleled role as a bridge connecting mainland China with international markets. By introducing favourable measures and strengthening collaboration with various parties, Hong Kong continues to consolidate and enhance its position as a regional hub for fintech and sustainable finance. For details on our work in green and sustainable finance, please refer to the Sustainability Report 2024.\n\n# Rapid growth in renminbi business and deepening financial cooperation with mainland China\n\nIn 2024, Hong Kong’s renminbi business continued to maintain strong momentum, with significant growth in trade settlement payments, offshore bond issuance, and especially offshore bank lending. The renminbi Real-Time Gross Settlement system recorded a historic high in daily transaction volume, reaching RMB 3.1 trillion, reflecting Hong Kong’s enhanced role as a global offshore renminbi business hub.\n\nAt the same time, we continue to deepen financial connectivity between Hong Kong and mainland China. The “Three Connections, Three Conveniences” policy introduced in 2024, together with six new measures announced earlier this year, represent major policy breakthroughs. Among them, the HKMA launched a RMB 100 billion RMB Trade Financing Liquidity Facility to provide banks with a stable and cost-effective source of funding to expand RMB trade financing services and support the development of the real economy. Another policy breakthrough is allowing investors to use onshore bonds held through Northbound Bond Connect, particularly those issued by the Ministry of Finance and policy banks, as eligible collateral for the HKMA’s RMB Liquidity Facility, OTC Clearing Hong Kong Limited, and the offshore RMB bond repo business. This innovative measure enhances the attractiveness of onshore bonds to offshore investors and facilitates greater participation by global investors in the onshore bond market. We also launched WMC 2.0 last year, which introduced a number of upgrades and enhancements, including a more diversified range of investment products, more flexible sales and marketing arrangements, and an increase in individual investment quotas. These measures not only consolidate Hong Kong’s position as a global offshore renminbi business hub, but also further strengthen our role as a key gateway connecting mainland China with international markets."}
{"zh":"# 2024 年摘要\n\n# 經濟及金融環境\n\n香港經濟在2024年錄得溫和增長，主要受惠於貨物出口在外部需求改善及全球科技周期復甦下有所反彈。勞工市場保持穩健，通脹在外圍價格壓力進一步減退下維持溫和。本港股市顯著回升，而物業市場則因市場氣氛在持續高息環境下受壓而大致疲弱。鑑於貿易緊張局勢不斷升級，預計2025年香港經濟將會面對充滿挑戰的外圍環境。然而，中國內地積極推出經濟刺激措施， 加上為本地企業提供的多方面支持，應能鞏固營商信心。香港亦會繼續加強國際交往合作，以及深化區域合作。\n\n香港銀行體系維持穩健，資本及流動性均十分充裕，整體資產質素維持可控。\n\n# 貨幣穩定\n\n儘管美國貨幣政策走向、環球增長前景及地緣政治局勢存在不明朗因素，港元外匯及貨幣市場繼續保持暢順有序。港元匯率在2024年首4個月回軟，然後在年內其餘時間轉強。作為香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石，聯繫匯率制度一直展現強大抵禦外來衝擊的能力。\n\n# 銀行體系穩定\n\n金管局迅速採取措施支援本地中小型企業，並透過風險為本監管與應變規劃保障銀行體系穩定，另又提供監管指引及支持業界應對新生風險，以提升銀行業的運作穩健性與網絡防衛韌性。為鼓勵應用金融科技，金管局推出連串跨行業項目，包括「生成式人工智能沙盒」。\n\n金管局推出《保障消費者防詐騙約章2.0》、「智安存」，以及有關銀行無抵押消費信貸產品的冷靜期，以加強銀行消費者保障。此外，金管局向銀行提供有關在面向客戶的服務中應用生成式人工智能的指引，又就二手物業買賣交易提供多一種支付安排與業界緊密合作。金管局亦發出數碼資產相關活動指引、優化「跨境理財通」業務試點及放寬多項對數字銀行的限制，並完成個人信貸資料服務全面過渡至「信資通」。\n\n金管局在香港的打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度方面扮演重要角色。透過加強公私營夥伴合作平台的情報交換和合作，可疑交易報告的數量顯著增加，因而能更有效沒收犯罪得益。有關促進銀行分享訊息的法例修訂的諮詢得到廣泛支持，並將進一步協助偵測及防止金融罪行。此外，金管局就應用人工智能監察可疑活動以及防範及制止授權支付詐騙向銀行發出指引，並優化「可疑帳號警示」機制。\n\n金管局在香港實施包括資本充足及披露等國際監管標準方面取得良好進展。此外，香港存款保障計劃的多個範疇均作出優化，以加強對存款人的保障。\n\n金管局繼續推進確保處置機制具公信力的工作，實施處置標準，規定銀行須更新與對手方的金融合約，減低處置中的失序地提前終止風險。此外，金管局在制定銀行的首選處置策略、應對處置可行性障礙，以及提升處置執行能力方面均取得顯著進展。\n\n# 香港的國際金融中心地位\n\n金管局與內地及香港有關當局合作，推出一系列措施，共同深化及擴展香港與內地金融市場的互聯互通，包括優化「跨境理財通」；擴大金管局人民幣流動資金安排及「北向互換通」交易的合資格抵押品範圍；以及優化「北向互換通」。這些措施有助強化香港的門戶角色，並鞏固其作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位。\n\n金管局在鞏固香港金融平台的競爭力方面亦取得良好進展，涵蓋債券發行、資產及財富管理、綠色和可持續金融，以及企業財資中心等範疇。為宣傳香港的金融服務，金管局加強向海外及內地持份者的市場推廣工作，讓大家充分認識香港金融體系的穩健及其帶來的機遇。第三屆「國際金融領袖投資峰會」及多項其他盛事成功舉辦，不僅有助提升香港作為主要國際金融中心的形象，更製造正面的漣漪效應。此外，金管局積極參與多個國際及區內的央行及監管組織，繼續對維持金融穩定及促進金融市場發展的全球工作作出貢獻。\n\n金管局在「金融科技2025」策略的各個範疇均取得顯著進展，包括央行數碼貨幣及數據基建。另一方面，金管局正與中國人民銀行緊密合作，推動落實香港「轉數快」與內地網上支付跨行清算系統互聯，實現跨境支付。\n\n# 儲備管理\n\n2024年環球金融市場表現大致良好，主要經濟體錄得穩定增長，主要央行亦隨着通脹逐步放緩而陸續下調政策利率。在此背景下，外匯基金錄得2,188億港元的投資收入，投資回報率為5.2%。\n\n金管局繼續致力推動資產多元化及負責任投資。與此同時，長期增長組合自2009年開展投資以來的年率化內部回報率為11.2%。\n\n# 機構職能\n\n金管局透過不同渠道與社會及市場保持密切聯繫，提升公眾對金管局政策及工作的了解。\n\n對內方面，金管局致力建立一支靈活應變及專業的工作團隊，同時遵守嚴格的財政紀律及提升數碼能力，應對變化及確保有效執行各項政策及措施。\n","terms":{"$mart理財321":["$mart Money Management 321"],"12個月預期信用虧損":["12-month

primarily driven by a rebound in goods exports, thanks to improved external demand and a recovery in the global tech cycle. The labour market remained robust, while inflation stayed moderate as external price pressures continued to ease. The local stock market saw a significant recovery, but the property market remained generally weak, weighed down by subdued market sentiment amid persistently high interest rates. Given escalating trade tensions, Hong Kong’s economy is expected to face a challenging external environment in 2025. However, mainland China’s proactive economic stimulus measures, coupled with multifaceted support for local businesses, should help consolidate business confidence. Hong Kong will also continue to strengthen international exchanges and deepen regional ties.\n\nHong Kong’s banking system remains robust, with ample capital and liquidity, and overall asset quality remains under control.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nDespite uncertainties surrounding US monetary policy, global growth prospects and geopolitical tensions, Hong Kong’s foreign exchange and currency markets continued to operate smoothly and in an orderly manner. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate weakened in the first four months of 2024 but strengthened for the remainder of the year. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, the Linked Exchange Rate System has consistently demonstrated its strong ability to resist external shocks.\n\n# Banking System Stability\n\nThe HKMA took swift measures to support local small and medium-sized enterprises and safeguarded the stability of the banking system through risk-based supervision and contingency planning. It also provided supervisory guidance and support to the industry to address emerging risks, thereby enhancing the operational resilience and cyber resilience of the banking sector. To encourage the application of fintech, the HKMA launched a series of cross-sectoral initiatives, including the Generative Artificial Intelligence Sandbox.\n\nThe HKMA introduced the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter 2.0, Money Safe and a cooling-off period for unsecured consumer credit products to enhance bank consumer protection. In addition, the HKMA provided guidance to banks on the application of generative artificial intelligence in customer-facing services and worked closely with the industry to provide an additional payment arrangement for secondary property market transactions. The HKMA also issued guidelines on digital asset-related activities, optimised the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect pilot scheme, relaxed several restrictions on digital banks, and completed the full transition of consumer credit reference services to Credit Data Smart.\n\nThe HKMA plays a key role in Hong Kong’s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing regime. By enhancing intelligence exchange and cooperation through the public-private partnership platform, the number of suspicious transaction reports has increased significantly, enabling more effective confiscation of criminal proceeds. The consultation on legislative amendments to facilitate bank-to-bank information sharing received widespread support and will further assist in detecting and preventing financial crimes. In addition, the HKMA issued guidance to banks on the application of artificial intelligence for suspicious activity monitoring and on preventing and stopping authorised payment scams, and enhanced the Suspicious Account Alert mechanism.\n\nThe HKMA has made good progress in implementing international supervisory standards, including capital adequacy and disclosure requirements, in Hong Kong. In addition, several areas of Hong Kong’s Deposit Protection Scheme have been enhanced to strengthen protection for depositors.\n\nThe HKMA continued to advance its work to ensure the credibility of the resolution regime by implementing resolution standards that require banks to update their financial contracts with counterparties to reduce the risk of disorderly early termination during resolution. The HKMA also made significant progress in developing banks’ preferred resolution strategies, addressing resolvability barriers and enhancing resolution execution capabilities.\n\n# Hong Kong’s Status as an International Financial Centre\n\nThe HKMA worked with relevant authorities on the mainland and in Hong Kong to introduce a series of measures to deepen and expand the interconnectivity between Hong Kong and mainland financial markets. These included optimising the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect; expanding the scope of eligible collateral for the HKMA’s RMB Liquidity Facility and Northbound Swap Connect transactions; and optimising Northbound Trading of Swap Connect. These measures will help strengthen Hong Kong’s role as a gateway and consolidate its position as a global offshore renminbi business hub.\n\nThe HKMA also made good progress in strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, covering areas such as bond issuance, asset and wealth management, green and sustainable finance, and corporate treasury centres. To promote Hong Kong’s financial services, the HKMA stepped up its market outreach to overseas and mainland stakeholders to raise awareness of the strengths of Hong Kong’s financial system and the opportunities it offers. The third Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit and other events were successfully held, not only enhancing Hong Kong’s image as a leading international financial centre but also creating a positive ripple effect. In addition, the HKMA actively participated in various international and regional central banking and regulatory forums, continuing to contribute to global efforts to maintain financial stability and promote financial market development.\n\nThe HKMA made significant progress in various areas of the Fintech 2025 strategy, including central bank digital currencies and data infrastructure. On the other hand, the HKMA is working closely with the People’s Bank of China to promote the interconnectivity between Hong Kong’s Faster Payment System and the mainland’s online interbank payment system to enable cross-border payments.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\nGlobal financial markets performed well in 2024, with major economies recording stable growth and major central banks gradually lowering policy rates as inflation eased. Against this backdrop, the Exchange Fund recorded investment income of HK$218.8 billion, with an investment return of 5.2%.\n\nThe HKMA continued to promote asset diversification and responsible investment. Meanwhile, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio has achieved an annualised internal rate of return of 11.2% since its inception in 2009.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintained close contact with society and the market through various channels to enhance public understanding of its policies and work.\n\nInternally, the HKMA is committed to building a flexible and professional workforce, adhering to strict financial discipline and enhancing digital capabilities to respond to changes and ensure the effective implementation of policies and measures."}

對潛在風險保持警惕\n\n展望2025年，鑑於宏觀經濟環境不明朗，環球金融市場或會出現波動。然而，香港金融體系憑藉過去多年所建立的抗震能力及緩衝，有足夠能力抵禦不利衝擊。金管局亦有能力、資源及決心維持香港貨幣及金融穩定。\n\n金管局將繼續密切注視本地及外圍環境的風險與不穩定因素，並會按需要採取適當措施維持香港的貨幣及金融體系穩定。我們亦會研究對香港經濟有影響的事項，並評估與這些事項相關的潛在風險。\n\n# 保持銀行體系穩定\n\n宏觀經濟環境的不確定性很可能會對銀行體系帶來挑戰。與此同時，數碼化的持續發展及生成式人工智能(GenAI)等創新科技的應用，既帶來眾多好處，亦不免為銀行增添新的業務操作與科技風險。面對上述環境，金管局將致力於透過提供政策與實務指引，以及與個別銀行以至整體業界的持續監管聯繫與溝通，進一步加強銀行抵禦不同衝擊的能力。同時，我們亦會因應科技發展、客戶預期的變化，以及國際標準與最佳做法，繼續加強及改進銀行規管架構與監管模式。\n\n# 風險為本的監管重點\n\n# 信用、流動性及市場風險\n\n在信貸環境面臨壓力下，金管局將繼續重點監察認可機構的資產質素，並評估它們的信用風險管理手法的成效，特別是涉及貸款分類與撥備，以及問題貸款管理等範疇。同時，我們會與銀行業及商界保持緊密溝通，並鼓勵認可機構在維持審慎信用風險管理的首要原則下，繼續支持實體經濟。\n\n主要先進經濟體利率前景不明朗及地緣政治緊張局勢升溫，致使環球金融市場更趨波動，有見及此，金管局會繼續採取主動，監管認可機構的市場風險管理。因應宏觀經濟環境不明朗，以及銀行服務日益數碼化，我們亦會審視認可機構如何管理流動性風險，以加強它們應付突發性資金流的能力。\n\n# 業務操作及科技風險\n\n金管局會繼續其提升銀行體系整體運作穩健性的工作，審視銀行在識別維持關鍵運作的潛在風險並作出補救方面的進度，以作為其實施運作穩健性架構的其中一部分。\n\n鑑於銀行業日益倚賴第三方服務供應商，金管局會進一步加強銀行對第三方風險的管理，制定新指引以實施巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（巴塞爾委員會）所制定的相關國際標準。\n\n在網絡防衛韌性方面，金管局會透過跨界別的「網絡地圖」項目評估系統性網絡風險。該項目正由金管局聯同其他本地金融監管機構按照國際貨幣基金組織的建議共同推進。此外，我們將審視銀行實施「穩固三重數據備份」安排的情況及推出網絡防衛韌性測試框架，以推動銀行加強在遇到嚴峻網絡事故時恢復關鍵運作的能力。\n\n儘管我們留意到銀行業更廣泛採用GenAI等高端技術所帶來的好處，但亦會保持警覺，留意新生風險，並按需要就相關技術的運用提供指引。\n\n我們亦會與業界及其他相關持份者合作，保持機動應對，防患未然，以提升銀行打擊數碼詐騙及防範千變萬化的詐騙手法的能力。\n\n# 打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集\n\n在2025年，金管局將推出制度改革、創新及其他措施，以提升香港打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集生態圈的整體能力、減低來自非法資金流的威脅，以及與最新的國際標準及最佳做法看齊。\n\n作為政府跨部門合作的一部分，我們將協助進行第三次香港洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險的全面評估，以加深對科技發展所帶來的潛在弱點的了解，並根據評估結果制定有效且適度的指引，以配合新的穩定幣發行人監管制度的實施。\n\n我們將會繼續在能帶來公眾價值的領域帶領及推廣負責任地應用科技，包括人工智能。相關工作包括加強可疑活動監察，讓銀行能識別及制止更多詐騙及傀儡戶口，從而進一步增加向執法機構提交的優質及有助作出跟進的情報。\n\n為加強打擊詐騙和其他金融罪行的力度，我們將提出所需的法例修訂建議，為銀行間分享個人戶口的訊息創造必要的途徑與保障。為加強偵測非法資金流的速度與數量，金管局將展開有關支付數據分析平台的工作。\n\n# 財富管理及強制性公積金相關業務\n\n在2025年，金管局會就認可機構在證券、投資產品、信託、保險及強制性公積金（強積金）相關業務方面的操守進行現場及非現場審查。我們會重點留意高收益複雜產品、數碼資產及相關投資產品、「跨境理財通」業務、數碼分銷及諮詢平台、長期保險產品及保費融資業務，並會參考市場最新發展及國際標準的修訂。\n\n金管局亦會與其他監管機構及銀行界緊密聯繫，按需要就銷售證券、投資、保險及強積金產品的監管標準提供指引。為促進數碼資產行業可持續及負責任地發展，我們會繼續與政府及其他監管機構合作，確保為數碼資產行業制定穩健、周全和平衡的監管架構。\n\n此外，金管局會促進及監察業界實施「跨境理財通」優化措施的情況，並繼續與業界及相關監管當局聯繫，以進一步優化該計劃及其他銀行相關的跨境項目。\n\n我們亦會按需要整合及釐清有關財富管理及強積金相關業務的現行指引，讓業界更容易掌握金管局的監管規定，便利遵守。\n\n# 制定政策\n\n# 在香港實施巴塞爾標準\n\n《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案於2025年1月1日在香港生效。金管局將就最終改革方案在詮釋方面的常見問題持續向認可機構提供指引並加以釐清，以確保業界一致地採納該方案。\n\n巴塞爾委員會在2022年12月發出銀行審慎處理加密資產風險承擔的新標準，再於2024年7月發出具針對性修訂，進一步釐清穩定幣得到優惠監管待遇的準則。同時，巴塞爾委員會亦發表題為「加密資產風險承擔的披露」的文件，列載更新的加密資產風險承擔披露規定。為於香港實施相關標準，金管局會研究可能需要對《銀行業（資本）規則》、《銀行業（披露）規則》、《銀行業（風險承擔限度）規則》（《風險承擔限度規則》）及《銀行業（流動性）規則》等各套規則作出的法例修訂。金管局亦會因應實施經驗及業界回饋，對《風險承擔限度規則》提出若干優化建議。金管局將於2025年上半年就修訂進行法定諮詢，以能按照巴塞爾委員會的時間表，在2026年1月1日實施新標準。金管局亦會制定相關銀行業申報表及輔助指引，以便利認可機構實施新標準。\n\n# 其他監管政策及風險管理指引\n\n為緊貼最新國際標準、監管方法及銀行業的發展，金管局計劃更新多個《監管政策手冊》單元，包括CA-G-5「監管審查程序」、CA-B-2「具系統重要性銀行」、IC-5「壓力測試」、IR-1「銀行帳內的利率風險」及IC-3「認可機構外聘核數師根據《銀行業條例》提交報告書的規定」。《監管政策手冊》單元CR-G-13「對手方信用風險管理」會作出修訂，以反映巴塞爾委員會在2024年12月發出的「對手方信用風險管理指引」提出的穩健做法。\n\n# 巴塞爾委員會的有效監管銀行業的主要原則\n\n巴塞爾委員會於2024年4月發出經修訂的《有效監管銀行業的主要原則》（《主要原則》）。經修訂《主要原則》反映自對上一次在2012年進行修訂以來監管與規管方面的發展，以及最近的結構性趨勢對銀行與銀行體系的影響。金管局將於2025年進行詳盡的自我評估，以確保其監管及規管架構符合經修訂《主要原則》。\n\n# 會計準則\n\n國際會計準則理事會計劃在2025年就動態風險管理(Dynamic Risk Management)發出徵求意見稿。金管局將與其他有關當局合作，就建議的動態風險管理會計模型對現行審慎監管規定的影響作出研究。\n\n# 執法\n\n金管局在2024年就擴大金融管理專員的調查及執法權力的建議諮詢銀行業，以確保他仍具備必要權力有效履行在《銀行業條例》下的職能。經考慮在諮詢中收到的意見後，金管局將調整有關建議，並制定必要的法例修訂，以進一步諮詢各持份者。\n\n# 處置機制\n\n金管局正繼續推行為期多年的項目，以建立運作暢順的認可機構處置機制。在2025年，金管局優先進行以下範疇的工作（表1）：\n\n表1 2025年處置機制的工作重點\n\n# 處置政策及標準\n\n- 就有關金管局對處置中的估值採取的方法，以及認可機構為支持適時穩健的處置估值而須具備的事前能力及安排的《實務守則》篇章進行諮詢，並完成相關制定工作\n- 推進制定處置重組的政策標準的工作\n\n# 國際及跨境合作\n\n- 參與國際處置政策發展及有效實施方面的工作，尤其金融穩定理事會透過轄下的處置機制督導小組及各工作小組計劃於2025年進行的12項處置機制改革措施\n","terms":{"$mart理財321":["$mart Money Management 321"],"12個月預期信用虧損":["12-month expected credit

uncertainties surrounding the United States’ economic and trade policies. Additionally, the upward risks to US inflation have heightened market concerns about the future trajectory of US policy rates. Meanwhile, following the announcement and implementation of economic stimulus measures in mainland China, market sentiment in both the mainland and Hong Kong has improved. The various support measures introduced by the government are expected to further boost inbound tourism to Hong Kong. Hong Kong’s financial system, bolstered by its robust resilience and ample buffers built up over the years, is well-equipped to withstand adverse shocks.\n\nThe HKMA will continue its efforts to promote the stability and soundness of Hong Kong’s financial system and infrastructure. Faced with an uncertain macroeconomic environment, we will remain vigilant, striving to swiftly identify emerging risks and respond flexibly. At the same time, we will actively seize opportunities and create policy space to further enhance Hong Kong’s position as an international financial centre. We will continue to manage the Exchange Fund prudently and flexibly, making appropriate defensive deployments and maintaining high liquidity. We will also continue to diversify investments to enhance the long-term investment returns of the Exchange Fund, ensuring it can continue to effectively maintain Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\n# Stability and Soundness of the Financial System\n\nUnder the new US administration, policy directions are difficult to predict, leading to geopolitical fragmentation. As a result, global economic uncertainty is expected to persist in 2025. The HKMA, tasked with promoting the stability and soundness of Hong Kong’s financial system, will remain vigilant against various potential risks, ensure it stays abreast of the latest developments, and be prepared to support the Hong Kong economy at any time.\n\n# Remaining Alert to Potential Risks\n\nLooking ahead to 2025, given the uncertain macroeconomic environment, global financial markets may experience volatility. However, Hong Kong’s financial system, with its resilience and buffers built up over the years, is well-positioned to withstand adverse shocks. The HKMA also has the capability, resources, and determination to maintain Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nThe HKMA will continue to closely monitor risks and instability factors in both local and external environments, taking appropriate measures as needed to maintain the stability of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems. We will also study matters that impact Hong Kong’s economy and assess the potential risks associated with these matters.\n\n# Maintaining Banking System Stability\n\nThe uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment are likely to pose challenges to the banking system. At the same time, the continued development of digitalisation and the application of innovative technologies such as generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) bring numerous benefits but also introduce new operational and technological risks for banks. In response to these challenges, the HKMA will work to further enhance banks’ ability to withstand various shocks by providing policy and practical guidance, as well as maintaining ongoing supervisory engagement and communication with individual banks and the industry as a whole. We will also continue to strengthen and improve the banking regulatory framework and supervisory approaches in response to technological developments, changes in customer expectations, and international standards and best practices.\n\n# Risk-Based Supervisory Focus\n\n# Credit, Liquidity and Market Risks\n\nIn a challenging credit environment, the HKMA will continue to closely monitor the asset quality of authorised institutions and assess the effectiveness of their credit risk management practices, particularly in areas such as loan classification, provisioning, and problem loan management. We will also maintain close communication with the banking sector and the business community, encouraging authorised institutions to continue supporting the real economy while adhering to the primary principle of prudent credit risk management.\n\nGiven the uncertain interest rate outlook in major advanced economies and heightened geopolitical tensions, which have increased volatility in global financial markets, the HKMA will continue to proactively supervise authorised institutions’ market risk management. In response to the uncertain macroeconomic environment and the increasing digitalisation of banking services, we will also review how authorised institutions manage liquidity risk to enhance their ability to cope with sudden fund flow changes.\n\n# Operational and Technology Risks\n\nThe HKMA will continue its efforts to enhance the overall operational resilience of the banking system by reviewing banks’ progress in identifying and remedying potential risks to the maintenance of critical operations, as part of their implementation of the operational resilience framework.\n\nGiven the banking sector’s increasing reliance on third-party service providers, the HKMA will further strengthen banks’ management of third-party risks by developing new guidelines to implement the relevant international standards formulated by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.\n\nIn terms of cyber resilience, the HKMA will assess systemic cyber risks through a cross-sectoral Cyber Mapping exercise, jointly promoted by the HKMA and other local financial regulators in accordance with the recommendations of the International Monetary Fund. We will also review banks’ implementation of robust tertiary data backup arrangements and introduce a cyber resilience testing framework to enhance banks’ ability to restore critical operations in the event of severe cyber incidents.\n\nWhile we recognise the benefits of the banking sector’s wider adoption of advanced technologies such as GenAI, we will remain vigilant to emerging risks and provide guidance on the use of such technologies as needed.\n\nWe will also collaborate with the industry and other relevant stakeholders to maintain agility and preparedness, in order to enhance banks’ ability to combat digital fraud and prevent ever-changing fraud tactics.\n\n# Combating Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing\n\nIn 2025, the HKMA will introduce institutional reforms, innovations, and other measures to enhance Hong Kong’s overall capability in combating money laundering and terrorist financing, reduce threats from illicit fund flows, and align with the latest international standards and best practices.\n\nAs part of the government’s cross-departmental cooperation, we will assist in conducting the third comprehensive assessment of money laundering and terrorist financing risks in Hong Kong to better understand the potential vulnerabilities arising from technological developments. Based on the assessment results, we will formulate effective and appropriate guidelines to support the implementation of the new regulatory regime for stablecoin issuers.\n\nWe will continue to lead and promote the responsible application of technology, including artificial intelligence, in areas that bring public value. This includes enhancing suspicious activity monitoring to enable banks to identify and stop more fraud and mule accounts, thereby increasing the submission of high-quality and actionable intelligence to law enforcement bodies.\n\nTo strengthen the fight against fraud and other financial crimes, we will propose necessary legislative amendments to create the necessary channels and safeguards for bank-to-bank information sharing on personal accounts. To enhance the speed and volume of detecting illicit fund flows, the HKMA will initiate work on an analytics platform for payments data.\n\n# Wealth Management and Mandatory Provident Fund Related Businesses\n\nIn 2025, the HKMA will conduct on-site and off-site reviews of authorised institutions’ conduct in securities, investment products, trust, insurance, and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) related businesses. We will focus on high-yield complex products, digital assets and related investment products, the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Scheme, digital distribution and advisory platforms, long-term insurance products, and premium financing activities, referring to the latest market developments and revisions to international standards.\n\nThe HKMA will also maintain close contact with fellow regulators and the banking sector to provide guidance on regulatory standards for the sale of securities, investments, insurance, and MPF products as needed. To promote the sustainable and responsible development of the digital asset industry, we will continue to work with the government and other regulators to ensure a robust, comprehensive, and balanced regulatory framework for the digital asset sector.\n\nIn addition, the HKMA will promote and monitor the industry’s implementation of optimisation measures for the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Scheme, and continue to liaise with the industry and relevant regulatory authorities to further optimise the scheme and other cross-border banking projects.\n\nWe will also consolidate and clarify existing guidelines on wealth management and MPF-related businesses as needed, to make it easier for the industry to understand and comply with the HKMA’s regulatory requirements.\n\n# Policy Formulation\n\n# Implementation of Basel Standards in Hong Kong\n\nThe final reform package of Basel III will take effect in Hong Kong on 1 January 2025. The HKMA will continue to provide guidance and clarification to authorised institutions on common interpretation issues related to the final reform package, to ensure consistent adoption by the industry.\n\nIn December 2022, the Basel Committee issued new standards for banks’ prudent management of cryptoasset exposures, followed by targeted revisions in July 2024 to further clarify the criteria for stablecoins to receive preferential regulatory treatment. The Basel Committee also published a paper titled “Disclosure of cryptoasset exposures”, setting out updated disclosure requirements for cryptoasset exposures. To implement the relevant standards in Hong Kong, the HKMA will study the possible legislative amendments needed to the Banking (Capital) Rules, Banking (Disclosure) Rules, Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules, and Banking (Liquidity) Rules. The HKMA will also propose some optimisation suggestions to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules based on implementation experience and industry feedback. The HKMA will conduct a statutory consultation on the revisions in the first half of 2025, with a view to implementing the new standards by 1 January 2026, in line with the Basel Committee’s timetable. The HKMA will also develop relevant banking returns and supporting guidance to facilitate authorised institutions’ implementation of the new standards.\n\n# Other Regulatory Policies and Risk Management Guidelines\n\nTo keep pace with the latest international standards, regulatory approaches, and developments in the banking sector, the HKMA plans to update several modules of the Supervisory Policy Manual, including CA-G-5 “Supervisory Review Process”, CA-B-2 “Systemically Important Banks”, IC-5 “Stress-testing”, IR-1 “Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book”, and IC-3 “Reporting Requirements Relating to Authorised Institutions’ External Auditors under the Banking Ordinance”. The SPM module CR-G-13 “Counterparty Credit Risk Management” will be revised to reflect the sound practices set out in the “Guidelines for counterparty credit risk management” issued by the Basel Committee in December 2024.\n\n# Basel Committee’s Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision\n\nIn April 2024, the Basel Committee issued a revised version of the Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision. The revised Core Principles reflect developments in supervision and regulation since the last revision in 2012, as well as the impact of recent structural trends on banks and the banking system. The HKMA will conduct a comprehensive self-assessment in 2025 to ensure that its supervisory and regulatory framework complies with the revised Core Principles.\n\n# Accounting Standards\n\nThe International Accounting Standards Board plans to issue an Exposure Draft on Dynamic Risk Management in 2025. The HKMA will collaborate with other relevant authorities to study the impact of the proposed Dynamic Risk Management accounting model on existing prudential requirements.\n\n# Enforcement\n\nIn 2024, the HKMA consulted the banking sector on proposals to expand the investigative and enforcement powers of the Monetary Authority to ensure that he continues to have the necessary powers to effectively discharge his functions under the Banking Ordinance. After considering the views received during the consultation, the HKMA will adjust the proposals and formulate the necessary legislative amendments for further consultation with stakeholders.\n\n# Resolution Regime\n\nThe HKMA is continuing to implement a multi-year project to establish an operational resolution regime for authorised institutions. In 2025, the HKMA will prioritise work in the following areas (Table 1):\n\nTable 1: Key Focus Areas for the Resolution Regime in 2025\n\n# Resolution Policies and Standards\n\n- Consult on and finalise a Code of Practice chapter on the HKMA’s approach to resolution valuations and the ex-ante capabilities and arrangements that authorised institutions need to have in place to support timely and robust resolution valuations.\n- Advance work on developing policy standards for resolution restructuring.\n\n# International and Cross-Border Cooperation\n\n- Participate in international efforts to develop and effectively implement resolution policies, particularly the 12 resolution regime reforms that the Financial Stability Board plans to implement in 2025 through its Resolution Steering Group and various working groups."}

金管局的法定授權\n\n立法會（前稱立法局）於1992年通過《外匯基金條例》修訂條文，授權財政司司長（前稱財政司）委任金融管理專員，金管局隨後在1993年4月1日成立。\n\n金融管理專員的權力、職能及責任由《外匯基金條例》、《銀行業條例》、《金融機構（處置機制）條例》、《存款保障計劃條例》、《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》及其他有關條例明文規定。財政司司長與金融管理專員於2003年6月25日的互換函件，列載彼此在貨幣與金融事務方面的職能與責任的分配，亦披露財政司司長將若干權力轉授予金融管理專員。有關函件為公開文件，可於金管局網站查閱。\n\n外匯基金根據《外匯基金條例》設立，由財政司司長掌有控制權。該條例規定外匯基金須主要運用於影響港元匯價。財政司司長亦可運用外匯基金以保持香港貨幣金融體系的穩定與健全（惟同時須顧及外匯基金的主要目的），藉此保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。\n\n金融管理專員根據《外匯基金條例》委任，以協助財政司司長執行其根據該條例獲授予的職能，以及執行其他條例及財政司司長所指派的職能。金融管理專員的辦公室稱為金管局，金融管理專員即為金管局總裁。\n\n金融管理專員根據《銀行業條例》賦予的職責及權力，規管及監管銀行業務與接受存款業務。根據《銀行業條例》，金融管理專員負責處理香港持牌銀行、有限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司的認可事宜。\n\n《金融機構（處置機制）條例》訂明金融管理專員為銀行界實體的處置機制當局。金融管理專員獲賦予一系列權力，對不可持續經營的銀行界實體進行有秩序處置（有關實體倒閉可能構成系統性風險），以維持金融穩定，同時力求保障公帑。\n\n《證券及期貨條例》及《強制性公積金計劃條例》賦予金融管理專員若干有關銀行證券及強制性公積金業務的權力。\n\n保險業監管局根據《保險業條例》就銀行的保險相關業務向金融管理專員轉授查察及調查權力。\n\n《打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集條例》授權金融管理專員監管銀行遵守該條例下有關客戶盡職審查及備存紀錄的規定。\n\n《存款保障計劃條例》授予金融管理專員責任，就存款保障計劃的運作提供協助，以及啟動從存款保障計劃基金向無力償付的持牌銀行的存款人發放補償。\n\n金融管理專員在《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》的法定架構下，可指定及監察某些重要的結算及交收系統，以及在香港營運的零售支付系統。該條例亦授權金融管理專員管理用作儲存金錢價值並符合該條例指明準則的電子及實物「工具」的發牌制度。\n","terms":{"$mart理財321":["$mart

four principal functions:\n\n- Maintaining monetary stability within the framework of the Linked Exchange Rate System;\n- Promoting the stability and integrity of the financial system, including the banking sector;\n- Helping to strengthen Hong Kong’s position as an international financial centre, including maintaining and developing its financial infrastructure; and\n- Managing the Exchange Fund.\n\n# The HKMA’s legal mandate\n\nIn 1992, the Legislative Council (formerly known as the Legislative Bureau) passed amendments to the Exchange Fund Ordinance, authorising the Financial Secretary (formerly known as the Secretary for the Treasury) to appoint a Chief Executive of the Monetary Authority. The HKMA was subsequently established on 1 April 1993.\n\nThe powers, functions, and responsibilities of the Chief Executive of the Monetary Authority are set out in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the Banking Ordinance, the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance, the Deposit Protection Scheme Ordinance, the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, and other relevant legislation. An exchange of letters between the Financial Secretary and the Chief Executive of the Monetary Authority dated 25 June 2003 outlines the allocation of their respective functions and responsibilities in monetary and financial matters. It also discloses that the Financial Secretary has delegated certain powers to the Chief Executive of the Monetary Authority. These letters are public documents and are available on the HKMA’s website.\n\nThe Exchange Fund is established under the Exchange Fund Ordinance and is controlled by the Financial Secretary. The Ordinance stipulates that the Exchange Fund shall be used primarily to influence the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar. The Financial Secretary may also use the Exchange Fund to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial system (while taking into account the Fund’s primary purpose), thereby preserving Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre.\n\nThe Chief Executive of the Monetary Authority is appointed under the Exchange Fund Ordinance to assist the Financial Secretary in carrying out the functions conferred upon him under that Ordinance, as well as to perform functions under other ordinances and tasks assigned by the Financial Secretary. The office of the Chief Executive of the Monetary Authority is known as the HKMA, and the Chief Executive of the Monetary Authority serves as its Chief Executive.\n\nThe Chief Executive of the Monetary Authority is responsible for regulating and supervising banking and deposit-taking businesses under the powers and duties conferred by the Banking Ordinance. Under this Ordinance, the Chief Executive of the Monetary Authority is responsible for handling the authorisation of licensed banks, restricted licence banks, and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong.\n\nThe Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance designates the Chief Executive of the Monetary Authority as the resolution authority for banking sector entities. The Chief Executive of the Monetary Authority is granted a range of powers to conduct the orderly resolution of banking sector entities that are no longer viable (where their failure may pose systemic risk), in order to maintain financial stability while seeking to protect public funds.\n\nThe Securities and Futures Ordinance and the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Ordinance confer certain powers on the Chief Executive of the Monetary Authority in relation to banking securities and mandatory provident fund business.\n\nUnder the Insurance Ordinance, the Insurance Authority has delegated powers of inspection and investigation in relation to banks’ insurance-related business to the Chief Executive of the Monetary Authority.\n\nThe Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance empowers the Chief Executive of the Monetary Authority to supervise banks’ compliance with customer due diligence and record-keeping requirements under the Ordinance.\n\nThe Deposit Protection Scheme Ordinance assigns the Chief Executive of the Monetary Authority the responsibility of providing assistance in the operation of the Deposit Protection Scheme and initiating compensation payments from the Deposit Protection Scheme Fund to depositors of licensed banks that are unable to repay their debts.\n\nUnder the statutory framework of the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, the Chief Executive of the Monetary Authority may designate and supervise certain important clearing and settlement systems, as well as retail payment systems operating in Hong Kong. The Ordinance also empowers the Chief Executive of the Monetary Authority to administer a licensing regime for electronic and physical facilities used to store monetary value that meet the criteria specified in the Ordinance."}
{"zh":"# 機構管治\n\n金管局作為香港的中央銀行機構，深明良好的管治對維持及維護公眾對金管局履行其法定職責的信任及信心的重要性，因此一直致力秉持高水平的機構管治。\n\n為實踐良好機構管治的承諾，金管局：\n\n- 建立了一套清晰的機構管治架構；\n- 維持高問責性及透明度，並與各持份者保持緊密聯繫；及\n- 實施完善穩健的監控措施以管理風險，並確保所有職級員工的行為及其日常運作均符合指定標準。\n\n金管局的管治架構涵蓋幾個主要部分，包括給予意見和指導的各法定諮詢委員會、問責性與透明度，以及內部監控與外部審計。\n\n# 金管局與特區政府\n\n金管局是中華人民共和國香港特別行政區政府（特區政府）架構的一部分，但可以按與公務員不同的聘用條款聘請員工，以吸引具適當經驗與專門知識的人才。金管局總裁及其員工均為公職人員。金管局的日常運作，在金融管理專員所獲賦予或轉授的法定權力範圍內高度自主。\n\n財政司司長負責釐定香港的貨幣政策目標及貨幣體制：財政司司長於2003年6月25日致金融管理專員的函件中，訂明應透過貨幣發行局制度維持貨幣穩定，將港元匯率保持在約7.80港元兌1美元的水平。金融管理專員須自行負責達成貨幣政策目標，包括決定有關的策略、工具及執行方式，並負責維持香港貨幣制度的穩定與健全。\n\n財政司司長在財經事務及庫務局局長的協助下，負責維持香港金融體系穩定與健全，以及保持香港的國際金融中心地位的政策。為推行這些政策，金融管理專員的職責包括：\n\n- 促進銀行體系的整體穩定與有效運作；\n- 與其他有關機構與組織合作，發展債務市場；\n- 處理與法定紙幣及硬幣的發行及流通有關的事宜；\n- 透過發展支付、結算及交收系統，以及在適當情況下負責操作有關系統，促進金融基建的安全與效率；及\n- 與其他有關機構與組織合作，促進對香港貨幣及金融體系的信心，並推行適當的發展市場措施，以協助加強香港金融服務的國際競爭力。\n\n外匯基金由財政司司長掌有控制權。金融管理專員須根據財政司司長轉授的權力，就外匯基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 諮詢委員會及管理層\n\n# 諮詢委員會\n\n諮詢委員會就金管局主要工作範疇給予意見和指導。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會根據《外匯基金條例》成立，就與財政司司長行使對外匯基金的控制權相關的事宜向其提供意見。財政司司長為外匯基金諮詢委員會的當然主席，其他委員（包括金融管理專員）以個人身分，由財政司司長根據香港特別行政區行政長官的授權委任。委員各以本身的專業知識及經驗獲得委任，使外匯基金諮詢委員會廣受裨益。外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下設有五個專責委員會，負責監察金管局特定範疇的工作和給予意見，並透過諮詢委員會向財政政司長報告及提出建議。有關外匯基金諮詢委員會及其轄下五個專責委員會的詳情，請參閱第53至63頁。\n\n銀行業務諮詢委員會及接受存款公司諮詢委員會就有關《銀行業條例》，特別是有關銀行、接受存款公司及有限制牌照銀行經營銀行業務或接受存款業務（視屬何情況而定）的事宜，向香港特別行政區行政長官提供意見。兩個委員會均由財政司司長擔任主席，成員包括金融管理專員及財政司司長根據行政長官的授權而委任的人士。有關銀行業務諮詢委員會及接受存款公司諮詢委員會的詳情，請參閱第64至65頁。\n\n# 管理層\n\n總裁委員會由金管局總裁、副總裁及其他高層人員組成，並由金管局總裁擔任主席。總裁委員會定期開會，向總裁匯報金管局各部門主要工作的進度，並就與金管局運作有關的政策事項向總裁提供意見。有關總裁委員會成員名單，請參閱第66至67頁。\n\n# 問責性與透明度\n\n就日常運作及推行政府政策目標所採用的方法，金管局一直保持高度自主，並同時輔以高問責性及透明度。\n\n金融管理專員由財政司司長委任，因此金管局透過財政司司長向公眾負責；而由於金管局的職權由立法會通過的法律制訂，因此金管局亦透過立法會向公眾負責。金管局亦明白本身肩負更廣泛的責任，促進公眾對金管局角色及目標的認識，並密切留意社會人士所關注的事項。金管局在執行日常工作及與社會保持廣泛聯繫時，堅守盡力提高透明度及保持開放的政策。這項政策有兩大目標：\n\n- 在顧及市場敏感性、商業秘密及機密資料披露的法定限制下，盡量使金融界及公眾充分了解金管局的工作；及\n- 確保金管局掌握社會脈搏，並對公眾意見作出適當回應。\n\n# 與公眾溝通\n\n金管局致力促進貨幣與銀行體系穩定，有效管理官方儲備，發展與監察穩健及多元化的金融基建，從而鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位，推動香港經濟發展。\n\n金管局要有效履行職責，便必須取得社會人士的信任。因此，金管局以嚴謹的態度，履行向公眾解釋其政策及工作的責任。金管局與傳媒保持廣泛聯繫，又利用社交媒體平台，以能在數碼時代中更有效與公眾溝通。金管局亦盡力處理備受社會關注而涉及金管局職責範圍的事項，尤其透過傳統及社交媒體適時澄清有關金管局政策的失實資訊及謠言。\n\n此外，金管局辦事處設有資訊中心，分為圖書館及展覽館兩部分，每星期開放六日予公眾參觀及使用。有關金管局與公眾溝通及聯繫的工作，詳見「機構職能一章（第185至191頁）。\n\n# 立法會\n\n金管局與立法會的關係對提高問責性及透明度非常重要。金管局總裁承諾每年三次向立法會財經事務委員會簡報金管局各項工作及政策，並回答有關查詢。金管局總裁定期在財經事務委員會作出的簡報載於金管局網站。\n\n此外，金管局代表不時出席立法會事務委員會及小組委員會會議，闡釋及商討特別事項，以及協助議員審閱條例草案。\n\n# 資訊披露\n\n金管局在透明度方面致力達致國際最高標準，出版各種中英文期刊及專題刊物。金管局的雙語網站(www.hkma.gov.hk)除有專門環節列載經濟研究、統計資料、監管資源、消費者資訊及其他課題外，還載有大量金管局出版的刊物、新聞稿、演講辭及簡報會資料文件。\n\n金管局不時檢討外匯基金及貨幣發行局帳目資料的披露是否足夠。金管局於1999年開始參與國際貨幣基金組織的中央銀行「數據公布特殊標準」計劃。金管局亦公布外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下貨幣發行委員會的會議紀錄，以及貨幣發行局制度運作報告。自1996年起，金管局網站載有銀行業監管政策及指引。\n\n# 內部監控與外部審計\n\n金管局採用穩健有效的監控機制，確保秉持高水平的員工操守、審慎的風險管理，以及適當的制衡。內部及外部審計職能就監控機制是否足夠及具成效提供獨立評估。\n\n# 行為守則\n\n《行為守則》就員工的道德與法律責任提供指引，確保所有職級員工的行為均符合指定標準。\n\n# 內部監控\n\n# 運作監控\n\n作為風險管理的第一度防線，所有部門及分處均有責任識別及評估其工作流程的風險，並制定適當的監控措施，確保金管局日常運作穩妥。\n\n# 機構風險管理\n\n風險管理亦在機構層面進行。由金管局總裁擔任主席的風險委員會，是機構風險管理架構的基石之一。\n\n風險委員會審視和匯報各部門所識別的潛在及新生風險，以及相關監控措施和緩解策略是否充足，並定出適當的跟進行動。\n\n# 內部審計\n\n金管局內部審核處獨立評估不同部門的管治程序、風險管理及監控措施是否足夠及具成效，並提出改善建議。\n\n# 外部審計\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》第7條，外匯基金的財務報表由香港特區政府審計署審核。審計署並無就此項服務收取費用。經審核的外匯基金財務報表刊載於金管局《年報》。\n","terms":{"$mart理財321":["$mart Money Management

governance in maintaining and safeguarding public trust and confidence in its fulfilment of its statutory mandate. It is therefore committed to upholding a high standard of corporate governance.\n\nTo fulfil its commitment to good corporate governance, the HKMA:\n\n- has established a clear corporate governance structure;\n- maintains high levels of accountability and transparency, and keeps in close contact with stakeholders; and\n- implements robust controls to manage risks and ensure that the conduct of employees at all levels and their day-to-day operations comply with specified standards.\n\nThe HKMA’s governance structure comprises several key elements, including statutory advisory committees that provide advice and guidance, accountability and transparency, and internal controls and external audit.\n\n# The HKMA and the HKSAR Government\n\nThe HKMA is part of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China (the HKSAR Government), but may employ staff on terms different from those of the civil service in order to attract people with appropriate experience and expertise. The Chief Executive of the HKMA and its employees are public officers. The HKMA’s day-to-day operations are highly autonomous within the statutory powers conferred on or delegated to the Monetary Authority.\n\nThe Financial Secretary is responsible for determining Hong Kong’s monetary policy objective and the structure of the monetary system. In a letter dated 25 June 2003 to the Monetary Authority, the Financial Secretary stipulated that monetary stability should be maintained through a Currency Board system, keeping the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate at around 7.80 Hong Kong dollars to the US dollar. The Monetary Authority is responsible for achieving the monetary policy objective on its own, including deciding on the relevant strategy, tools and operational means, and for maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary system.\n\nThe Financial Secretary, assisted by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, is responsible for policies to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s financial system and to preserve Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre. To implement these policies, the responsibilities of the Monetary Authority include:\n\n- promoting overall stability and effective operation of the banking system;\n- working with other relevant institutions and organisations to develop the debt market;\n- handling matters relating to the issuance and circulation of legal tender notes and coins;\n- promoting the safety and efficiency of financial infrastructure by developing payment, clearing and settlement systems, and, where appropriate, being responsible for operating such systems; and\n- working with other relevant institutions and organisations to promote confidence in Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems, and implementing appropriate market development initiatives to help enhance the international competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial services.\n\nThe Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary. The Monetary Authority is accountable to the Financial Secretary for the management and investment of the Exchange Fund under the powers delegated by the Financial Secretary.\n\n# Advisory committees and management\n\n# Advisory committees\n\nAdvisory committees provide advice and guidance on the HKMA’s major areas of work.\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) was established under the Exchange Fund Ordinance to advise the Financial Secretary on matters relating to the exercise of his control over the Exchange Fund. The Financial Secretary is the ex officio Chairman of the EFAC, and other members (including the Monetary Authority) are appointed by the Financial Secretary in their personal capacity under the authority of the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong SAR. Members are appointed on the basis of their professional knowledge and experience, which greatly benefits the EFAC. The EFAC has five sub-committees responsible for monitoring and advising on specific areas of the HKMA’s work and reporting and making recommendations to the Financial Secretary through the Advisory Committee. Details of the EFAC and its five sub-committees are set out on pages 53 to 63.\n\nThe Banking Advisory Committee (BAC) and the Deposittaking Companies Advisory Committee (DTCAC) advise the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong SAR on matters relating to the Banking Ordinance, particularly in relation to the conduct of banking business or deposit-taking business (as the case may be) by banks, deposit-taking companies and restricted licence banks. Both committees are chaired by the Financial Secretary, and their members include the Monetary Authority and persons appointed by the Financial Secretary under the authority of the Chief Executive. Details of the BAC and the DTCAC are set out on pages 64 to 65.\n\n# Management\n\nThe Chief Executive’s Committee (CEC) comprises the Chief Executive of the HKMA, the Deputy Chief Executive and other senior staff, and is chaired by the Chief Executive of the HKMA. The CEC meets regularly to report to the Chief Executive on the progress of major work in the HKMA’s departments and to advise the Chief Executive on policy matters relating to the HKMA’s operations. A list of CEC members is set out on pages 66 to 67.\n\n# Accountability and transparency\n\nThe HKMA has maintained a high degree of autonomy in its day-to-day operations and in the methods adopted to implement government policy objectives, while being supported by high levels of accountability and transparency.\n\nThe Monetary Authority is appointed by the Financial Secretary, and the HKMA is therefore accountable to the public through the Financial Secretary. Since the HKMA’s powers are established by laws passed by the Legislative Council, the HKMA is also accountable to the public through the Legislative Council. The HKMA also understands that it has a broader responsibility to promote public understanding of its role and objectives, and to keep a close eye on issues of concern to the community. In carrying out its day-to-day work and maintaining extensive contact with society, the HKMA adheres to a policy of striving to enhance transparency and maintain openness. This policy has two main objectives:\n\n- to enable the financial sector and the public to understand the HKMA’s work as fully as possible, subject to market sensitivities, commercial confidentiality and statutory restrictions on the disclosure of confidential information; and\n- to ensure that the HKMA is in touch with the social pulse and responds appropriately to public opinion.\n\n# Communication with the public\n\nThe HKMA is committed to promoting the stability of the monetary and banking systems, effectively managing official reserves, and developing and monitoring a robust and diversified financial infrastructure, thereby consolidating Hong Kong’s position as an international financial centre and promoting Hong Kong’s economic development.\n\nFor the HKMA to perform its duties effectively, it must gain the trust of the community. The HKMA therefore takes a rigorous approach to fulfilling its responsibility to explain its policies and work to the public. The HKMA maintains extensive contact with the media and uses social media platforms to communicate more effectively with the public in the digital era. The HKMA also strives to address issues of public concern that fall within its remit, particularly by using traditional and social media to clarify misinformation and rumours about the HKMA’s policies in a timely manner.\n\nIn addition, the HKMA’s office has an information centre, comprising a library and an exhibition hall, which is open to the public six days a week for visits and use. Details of the HKMA’s work in communicating and engaging with the public are set out in the chapter on Corporate Functions (pages 185 to 191).\n\n# Legislative Council\n\nThe relationship between the HKMA and the Legislative Council is important for enhancing accountability and transparency. The Chief Executive of the HKMA has undertaken to brief the Legislative Council’s Panel on Financial Affairs three times a year on the HKMA’s work and policies and to answer related questions. The briefings given by the Chief Executive of the HKMA to the Panel on a regular basis are available on the HKMA’s website.\n\nIn addition, representatives of the HKMA attend meetings of the Legislative Council’s panels and subcommittees from time to time to explain and discuss specific issues and to assist members in reviewing draft legislation.\n\n# Information disclosure\n\nThe HKMA strives to achieve the highest international standards of transparency by publishing various journals and special publications in both Chinese and English. The HKMA’s bilingual website (www.hkma.gov.hk) contains dedicated sections on economic research, statistics, regulatory resources, consumer information and other topics, in addition to a large number of publications, press releases, speeches and briefing papers published by the HKMA.\n\nThe HKMA reviews from time to time whether the disclosure of information on the Exchange Fund and Currency Board Accounts is adequate. The HKMA joined the IMF’s Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) programme for central banks in 1999. The HKMA also publishes the meeting minutes of the Currency Board Sub-Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, and reports on the operation of the Currency Board system. Since 1996, the HKMA’s website has contained supervisory policies and guidelines for the banking sector.\n\n# Internal controls and external audit\n\nThe HKMA adopts robust and effective control mechanisms to ensure high standards of employee conduct, prudent risk management, and appropriate checks and balances. Internal and external audit functions provide an independent assessment of whether control mechanisms are adequate and effective.\n\n# Code of conduct\n\nThe Code of Conduct provides guidance on the ethical and legal responsibilities of employees, ensuring that the conduct of employees at all levels complies with specified standards.\n\n# Internal controls\n\n# Operational controls\n\nAs the first line of defence in risk management, all departments and divisions are responsible for identifying and assessing risks in their operational processes and establishing appropriate control measures to ensure the soundness of the HKMA’s day-to-day operations.\n\n# Organisational risk management\n\nRisk management is also carried out at the organisational level. The Risk Committee, chaired by the Chief Executive of the HKMA, is one of the cornerstones of the organisational risk management framework.\n\nThe Risk Committee reviews and reports on potential and emerging risks identified by departments, and whether the relevant control measures and mitigating strategies are adequate, and determines appropriate follow-up actions.\n\n# Internal audit\n\nThe HKMA’s Internal Audit Division independently assesses whether governance processes, risk management and control measures in different departments are adequate and effective, and makes recommendations for improvement.\n\n# External audit\n\nUnder Section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the financial statements of the Exchange Fund are audited by the Audit Commission of the HKSAR Government. The Audit Commission does not charge a fee for this service. The audited financial statements of the Exchange Fund are published in the HKMA Annual Report."}
{"zh":"# 經濟及金融環境\n\n香港經濟在2024年錄得溫和增長，主要受惠於貨物出口在外部需求改善及全球科技周期復甦下有所反彈。勞工市場保持穩健，通脹在外圍價格壓力進一步減退下維持溫和。本港股市顯著回升，而物業市場則因市場氣氛在持續高息環境下受壓而大致疲弱。鑑於貿易緊張局勢不斷升級，預計2025年香港經濟將會面對充滿挑戰的外圍環境。然而，中國內地積極推出經濟刺激措施，加上為本地企業提供的多方面支持，應能鞏固營商信心。香港亦會繼續加強國際交往合作，以及深化區域合作。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 實體經濟活動\n\n香港經濟在2024年溫和增長。實質本地生產總值繼2023年錄得3.2%的增幅後，在2024年按年上升2.5%（表1及圖1）。外圍方面，貨物出口在外部需求改善及全球科技周期復甦的帶動下恢復正增長，成為整體經濟增長的主要動力。服務輸出亦隨着訪港旅遊業的持續復甦，以及跨境金融及集資活動於下半年顯著增加而進一步增長。然而，由於服務輸入在出境旅遊業持續增長下顯著上升，抵銷了服務輸出對整體經濟增長所帶來的正面效應。本地方面，私人消費開支在本地居民的消費模式轉變下有所回軟。相反，物業成交增加以及營商氣氛在貨幣狀況逐步放寬下有所改善，帶動整體投資支出錄得輕微增長。\n\n圖 1 組成部分對實質本地生產總值增長的貢獻\n資料來源：政府統計處\n\n表 1 按開支項目計的實質本地生產總值增長（比對上期）\n註：經季節性調整的本地固定資本形成總額按季增減幅度不詳。\n資料來源：政府統計處\n\n# 通脹及勞工市場\n\n儘管新簽訂私人住宅租金逐步上升，本地成本壓力仍大致受控，加上外圍價格壓力逐步減退，本地通脹在2024年維持溫和（圖2）。2024年全年合計，基本及整體通脹率分別為1.1%及1.7%。\n\n勞工市場在2024年表現穩健，失業率全年在2.9%至3.1%的低位徘徊（圖3）。自第1季起，總就業人數（圖3）逐步上升，勞動人口亦見增加，反映勞工需求與供應大致保持穩定。與此同時，隨着經濟持續增長，名義工資與勞工收入均錄得穩健增長。此外，政府在2024年《施政報告》中宣布進一步優化香港的吸引人才計劃，以紓緩不同行業的人手短缺問題，並透過吸納更多年輕人，為本地人口注入新動力。\n\n圖 2 基本消費物價通脹\n資料來源：政府統計處\n\n圖 3 勞工市場狀況\n資料來源：政府統計處\n\n# 股市\n\n本港股市隨着9月中以來的大幅反彈，於2024年顯著轉向。具體而言，隨着美國聯邦儲備局（美聯儲）減息及內地推出積極的經濟刺激措施，市場氣氛顯著改善，帶動恒生指數在10月7日升至全年高位，收報23,100點（圖4）。然而，11月初舉行的美國總統選舉觸發市場對全球經濟前景及美聯儲放寬貨幣政策步伐的憂慮，本港股市略為回調。儘管如此，恒生指數於年底收報20,060點，較2023年年底大幅上升17.7%，終結連續四年下挫的走勢。\n\n# 物業市場\n\n住宅物業市場在2024年首三季大致疲軟，但在第4季出現回穩跡象。在2月底及10月中相關政策措施放寬，以及9月開始的減息周期的支持下，全年住宅成交量由2023年43,002宗的歷史低位大幅上升23.5%至2024年的53,099宗。然而，持續高企的按揭利率及一手市場累積的庫存，繼續對樓價構成下調壓力。因此，樓價在2024年按年下跌7.1%，置業負擔能力亦因而稍為改善，雖然仍屬偏緊。非住宅物業市場仍然疲弱。其中，寫字樓的空置率在供應充裕的情況下仍然高企，零售商舖則面對旅客與本地居民消費模式轉變所帶來的挑戰。\n\n圖 4 資產價格\n資料來源：差餉物業估價署及香港交易及結算所有限公司\n\n# 經濟前景\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n鑑於貿易緊張局勢不斷升溫，並很可能會對國際貿易與資金流造成干擾，預計香港經濟於2025年將會面對充滿挑戰的外圍環境。然而，各有關當局及銀行業持續提供多方面的支持，應能提升本地企業的抗禦能力。內地積極推出經濟刺激措施，並且在前沿科技領域取得重大突破，亦應能提振營商信心。與此同時，香港會進一步深化區域合作，並加快聯動新興市場。同時，在內地當局的惠港旅遊政策，以及政府致力提振香港旅遊業的支持下，預計訪港旅遊業將會進一步增長。\n\n# 通脹及勞工市場\n\n預期本地通脹於2025年將保持溫和。由於房屋租金上升將逐步傳遞至消費物價，本地成本可能面對輕微的上升壓力。然而，儘管環球經濟前景的不確定性有所增加，但外圍價格壓力應會保持溫和。另一方面，勞工市場或會因貿易緊張局勢升溫而面對挑戰。然而，各項吸引人才計劃應有助繼續建立優質人才庫，為經濟長遠發展提供支持。\n\n# 銀行體系表現\n\n香港銀行體系在2024年維持穩健，銀行的資本及流動性均十分充裕。在宏觀經濟環境充滿挑戰下，年內銀行體系面對的信用風險增加，但銀行的整體資產質素維持可控。受惠於來自持有作交易的投資收益與收費及佣金收入上升，零售銀行盈利較2023年有所增長。\n\n# 資產質素\n\n銀行體系的特定分類貸款比率由2023年底的1.57%上升至2024年底的1.96%，逾期及經重組貸款比率於同期由1.24%升至1.55%（圖5）。特定分類貸款比率上升，主要是部分內地房地產發展商以及本地中小型發展商和投資者的貸款評級被下調所導致。然而，中國內地相關貸款的特定分類貸款比率由2023年底的2.58%，下降至2024年底的2.38%。銀行撥備維持充足。截至2024年底，銀行信貸撥備覆蓋率（即信貸撥備和特定分類貸款比率）約為65%。若將抵押品變現價值從呆壞帳餘額中扣除，經調整的銀行信貸撥備覆蓋率約145%。與此同時，2024年底住宅按揭貸款及信用卡貸款的拖欠比率仍然處於低水平，分別為0.11%及0.35%（圖6）。\n\n圖

盈利走勢\n\n零售銀行在2024年的整體除稅前經營溢利增加8.4%，同期除稅後平均資產回報率則由0.88%上升至0.93%（圖7）。盈利增長主要是由於持有作交易的投資收益（+97.0%）與收費及佣金收入增加（+15.4%），但部分升幅被淨利息收入減少（–5.2%）所抵銷。零售銀行淨息差由2023年的1.67%收窄至 2024 年的 1.52%（圖8）。與此同時，零售銀行成本與收入比率由2023年的38.9%微升至2024年的39.2%（圖9）。\n\n圖 7 零售銀行的表現\n資料來源：金管局\n\n圖 8 零售銀行淨息差\n資料來源：金管局\n\n圖 9 零售銀行成本與收入比率\n資料來源：金管局\n\n# 資產負債表走勢\n\n銀行體系資產負債表在2024年擴大4.3%，主要是因為可轉讓債務工具增加（+13.4%）。由於借貸成本高企，貸款需求受壓，2024年貸款總額減少2.8%。其中在香港使用的貸款與在香港境外使用的貸款分別減少2.1%及5.7%，貿易融資則增加4.6%。中國內地相關貸款於2024年減少8.7%。\n\n在資產負債表的負債方面，存款總額於2024年增加7.1%，相比2023年的增幅為5.1%。由於貸款總額減少而存款總額增加，整體貸存比率由2023底的62.8%降至2024年底的57.0%（圖10）。\n\n# 資本充足水平\n\n銀行體系在2024年資本維持充裕。2024年底本地註冊認可機構的綜合總資本比率為21.8%，相比上一年為21.1%；一級資本比率為19.9%（圖11）。兩者均遠高於相關國際最低要求。《巴塞爾協定三》槓桿比率於2024 年底為 8.0%（圖12）。\n\n圖 10 銀行體系的貸款及存款\n資料來源：金管局\n\n圖 11

流動性狀況\n\n銀行體系的流動性狀況維持穩健。第1類機構的季度平均流動性覆蓋比率在2024年第4季為178.4%，第2類機構的季度平均流動性維持比率為67.0%（圖13）。銀行體系的主要資金來源仍然是客戶存款。於2024年底，第1類機構的穩定資金淨額比率及第2A類機構的核心資金比率分別為143.4%及186.7%（圖14）。以上所有四個比率均遠高於法定最低要求。\n\n圖 13

rebound in goods exports, supported by improved external demand and a recovery in the global tech cycle. The labour market remained robust, while inflation stayed moderate as external price pressures continued to ease. The local stock market saw a significant recovery, while the property market remained generally weak due to subdued market sentiment amid persistently high interest rates. Given the escalating trade tensions, Hong Kong’s economy is expected to face a challenging external environment in 2025. However, mainland China’s proactive economic stimulus measures, coupled with multifaceted support for local businesses, should help bolster business confidence. Hong Kong will also continue to strengthen international exchanges and deepen regional ties.\n\n# Economic Review\n\n# Real Economic Activity\n\nHong Kong’s economy grew moderately in 2024. Real gross domestic product rose by 2.5% year-on-year in 2024, following a 3.2% increase in 2023 (Table 1 and Chart 1). Externally, goods exports resumed positive growth, driven by improved external demand and a recovery in the global tech cycle, becoming the main driver of overall economic growth. Exports of services also grew further, supported by a continued recovery in inbound tourism and a significant increase in cross-border financial and fundraising activities in the second half of the year. However, the positive effect of service exports on overall economic growth was offset by a significant increase in imports of services, driven by sustained growth in outbound tourism. Domestically, private consumption expenditure softened due to changes in local residents’ consumption patterns. In contrast, overall investment expenditure recorded a slight increase, driven by an increase in property transactions and an improvement in business sentiment amid easing monetary conditions.\n\nChart 1 Contribution of components to real GDP growth\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\nTable 1 Real GDP growth by expenditure component (compared with previous period)\nNote: The quarterly change in seasonally adjusted gross domestic fixed capital formation is not available.\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\n# Inflation and Labour Market\n\nDespite a gradual increase in newly signed private residential rentals, local cost pressures remained largely under control, and external price pressures continued to ease, keeping local inflation moderate in 2024 (Chart 2). For the whole of 2024, core and headline inflation rates were 1.1% and 1.7%, respectively.\n\nThe labour market performed well in 2024, with the unemployment rate hovering at a low level of between 2.9% and 3.1% throughout the year (Chart 3). Starting from the first quarter, total employment (Chart 3) gradually increased, and the labour force also grew, reflecting that labour demand and supply remained largely stable. Meanwhile, as the economy continued to grow, nominal wages and labour earnings recorded solid growth. In addition, the government announced in the 2024 Policy Address further enhancements to Hong Kong’s talent attraction schemes to alleviate manpower shortages in various industries and inject new impetus into the local population by attracting more young people.\n\nChart 2 Core consumer price inflation\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\nChart 3 Labour market conditions\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\n# Stock Market\n\nHong Kong’s stock market saw a significant turnaround in 2024, following a substantial rebound since mid-September. Specifically, market sentiment improved significantly as the US Federal Reserve cut interest rates and the mainland introduced proactive economic stimulus measures, driving the Hang Seng Index to a high of 23,100 points on 7 October, its highest level for the year (Chart 4). However, the US presidential election in early November triggered market concerns about the global economic outlook and the pace of monetary easing by the Fed, causing a slight pullback in Hong Kong’s stock market. Nevertheless, the Hang Seng Index closed at 20,060 points at the end of the year, up 17.7% from the end of 2023, ending a four-year decline.\n\n# Property Market\n\nThe residential property market was generally weak in the first three quarters of 2024 but showed signs of stabilisation in the fourth quarter. Supported by the easing of relevant policy measures in late February and mid-October, and the interest rate cut cycle that began in September, the number of residential transactions for the whole year rose sharply by 23.5% to 53,099 in 2024 from a historical low of 43,002 in 2023. However, persistently high mortgage rates and accumulated inventory in the primary market continued to put downward pressure on home prices. As a result, home prices fell by 7.1% year-on-year in 2024, and housing affordability improved slightly, although it remained tight. The non-residential property market remained weak. In particular, the office segment continued to have a high vacancy rate amid ample supply, while the retail premises segment faced challenges arising from changes in consumption patterns of tourists and local residents.\n\nChart 4 Asset prices\nSource: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited\n\n# Economic Outlook\n\n# Economic Environment\n\nGiven the escalating trade tensions, which are likely to disrupt international trade and fund flows, Hong Kong’s economy is expected to face a challenging external environment in 2025. However, the continued multifaceted support provided by relevant authorities and the banking sector should help enhance the resilience of local businesses. Mainland China’s proactive economic stimulus measures and its significant breakthroughs in frontier technology fields should also help boost business confidence. Meanwhile, Hong Kong will further deepen regional ties and accelerate its connectivity with emerging markets. In addition, inbound tourism is expected to grow further, supported by the mainland authorities’ tourism-related policy support and the government’s efforts to boost Hong Kong’s tourism industry.\n\n# Inflation and Labour Market\n\nLocal inflation is expected to remain moderate in 2025. As the increase in housing rentals gradually feeds through to consumer prices, local costs may face slight upward pressure. However, despite increased uncertainty in the global economic outlook, external price pressures should remain moderate. On the other hand, the labour market may face challenges due to escalating trade tensions. However, various talent attraction schemes should help continue to build a quality talent pool to support the economy’s long-term development.\n\n# Banking Sector Performance\n\nHong Kong’s banking sector remained robust in 2024, with banks maintaining ample capital and liquidity. Amid a challenging macroeconomic environment, credit risk faced by the banking sector increased during the year, but the overall asset quality of banks remained under control. Retail banking profits grew compared with 2023, driven by higher income from investments held for trading and higher income from fees and commissions.\n\n# Asset Quality\n\nThe banking sector’s classified loan ratio rose to 1.96% at the end of 2024 from 1.57% at the end of 2023, while the overdue and rescheduled loan ratio rose to 1.55% from 1.24% over the same period (Chart 5). The increase in the classified loan ratio was mainly due to rating downgrades of loans to some mainland property developers and local small and medium-sized property developers and investors. However, the classified loan ratio for mainland-related lending fell to 2.38% at the end of 2024 from 2.58% at the end of 2023. Banks’ provisions remained adequate. As at the end of 2024, banks’ provision coverage ratio (i.e. provisions to classified loans ratio) was around 65%. If the market value of collateral was deducted from non-performing loan balances, the adjusted provision coverage ratio for banks was around 145%. Meanwhile, the delinquency ratios for residential mortgage lending and credit card lending remained low at 0.11% and 0.35%, respectively, at the end of 2024 (Chart 6).\n\nChart 5 Asset quality of the banking sector\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 6 Delinquency ratios for residential mortgage lending and credit card lending\nSource: HKMA\n\n# Profitability Trends\n\nRetail banks’ aggregate pre-tax operating profit increased by 8.4% in 2024, while the post-tax return on average assets rose to 0.93% from 0.88% in the same period (Chart 7). Profit growth was mainly driven by higher income from investments held for trading (+97.0%) and higher income from fees and commissions (+15.4%), but was partly offset by a decline in net interest income (–5.2%). Retail banks’ net interest margin narrowed to 1.52% in 2024 from 1.67% in 2023 (Chart 8). Meanwhile, retail banks’ cost-to-income ratio edged up to 39.2% in 2024 from 38.9% in 2023 (Chart 9).\n\nChart 7 Performance of retail banks\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 8 Retail banks’ net interest margin\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 9 Retail banks’ cost-to-income ratio\nSource: HKMA\n\n# Balance Sheet Trends\n\nThe banking sector’s balance sheet expanded by 4.3% in 2024, mainly driven by an increase in negotiable debt instruments (+13.4%). As borrowing costs remained high, loan demand was subdued, and total loans decreased by 2.8% in 2024. Of these, loans for use in Hong Kong and loans for use outside Hong Kong decreased by 2.1% and 5.7%, respectively, while trade finance increased by 4.6%. Mainland-related lending decreased by 8.7% in 2024.\n\nOn the liability side of the balance sheet, total deposits increased by 7.1% in 2024, compared with an increase of 5.1% in 2023. As total loans decreased and total deposits increased, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio fell to 57.0% at the end of 2024 from 62.8% at the end of 2023 (Chart 10).\n\n# Capital Adequacy\n\nThe banking sector maintained ample capital in 2024. The consolidated total capital ratio of locally incorporated authorised institutions was 21.8% at the end of 2024, compared with 21.1% a year earlier; the Tier 1 capital ratio was 19.9% (Chart 11). Both ratios were well above the relevant international minimum requirements. The Basel III leverage ratio was 8.0% at the end of 2024 (Chart 12).\n\nChart 10 Loans and deposits of the banking sector\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 11 Consolidated capital ratios of locally incorporated authorised institutions\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 12 Consolidated leverage ratio of locally incorporated authorised institutions\nSource: HKMA\n\n# Liquidity Position\n\nThe banking sector’s liquidity position remained solid. The quarterly average liquidity coverage ratio for category 1 institutions was 178.4% in the fourth quarter of 2024, and the quarterly average liquidity maintenance ratio for category 2 institutions was 67.0% (Chart 13). Customer deposits remained the banking sector’s main source of funding. At the end of 2024, the net stable funding ratio for category 1 institutions and the core funding ratio for category 2A institutions were 143.4% and 186.7%, respectively (Chart 14). All four of these ratios were well above the statutory minimum requirements.\n\nChart 13 Liquidity ratios of designated authorised institutions\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 14 Funding ratios of designated authorised institutions\nSource: HKMA"}
{"zh":"# 貨幣穩定\n\n儘管美國貨幣政策走向、環球增長前景及地緣政治局勢緊張存在不明朗因素港元外匯及貨幣市場繼續保持暢順有序。港元匯率在2024年首四個月回軟，然後在年內其餘時間轉強。在聯繫匯率制度下，香港銀行同業拆息大致跟隨美元利率的走勢，同時亦受本地供求情況影響。作為香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石，聯繫匯率制度一直展現強大抵禦外來衝擊的能力。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的主要目標是維持貨幣穩定，即確保港元匯價穩定，使港元在外匯市場兌美元的匯率保持在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的區間內。該貨幣體制主要採用貨幣發行局制度，規定由外匯基金所持的美元儲備向貨幣基礎提供最少百分之百的支持；貨幣基礎若有變動，美元儲備亦必須作出相應增減，與貨幣基礎的變動百分之百配合。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n\n- 負債證明書（為三間發鈔銀行發行的銀行紙幣提供十足支持）；\n- 政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣；\n- 設於金管局的結算戶口結餘總額（即總結餘）；及\n- 金管局代表政府發行的外匯基金票據及債券。\n\n表1 貨幣基礎\n\n金管局透過自動利率調節機制及履行兌換保證的堅決承諾來維持港元匯率的穩定。當強方（或弱方）兌換保證被觸發，金管局會應銀行要求，按每美元兌7.75港元向銀行沽出港元、買入美元（或按7.85港元買入港元、沽出美元），使總結餘增加（或減少），令港元利率下跌（或上升），從而促使港元匯率回復到7.75至7.85的兌換範圍。\n\n# 2024年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n在2024年首四個月，港元隨着流動性回軟而稍為轉弱。在4月下旬至5月中期間，主要在股息相關資金需求及股票市場交投活躍的支持下，港元匯率轉強。在8月初，由於市場一度憂慮美國經濟可能出現衰退，以及預期美國聯邦儲備局將以更快及更大幅度減息，觸發套息交易平倉及港元短倉平倉，使港元轉強至兌換保證範圍的強方。港元在9月下旬進一步走強，受惠於內地公布一系列經濟刺激措施後，本港股市交投急增。港元其後於11月初稍為轉弱，部分由於本港股市的升幅有所回落，部分則由於其時美國經濟表現強勁，給予聯邦公開市場委員會空間謹慎地調低聯邦基金利率所致。其後港元在年底季節性資金需求帶動下回升。整體而言，港元外匯市場在2024年全年繼續運作正常（圖1）。\n\n圖 1 2024年市場匯率\n\n由於年內並無觸發兌換保證，總結餘變動不大，維持在447億港元左右。與此同時，未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額由12,455億港元，稍增至13,839億港元。因此，總結餘與未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額由2023 年底的 12,904 億港元，增加至 2024 年底的 14,287億港元（圖2）。整體貨幣基礎仍然由外匯儲備提供十足支持。\n\n圖 2 2024年總結餘（進行貼現窗活動前）及未償還外匯基金票據及債券\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n在聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）下，香港銀行同業拆息大致跟隨美元利率走勢，當中短期拆息亦受本地供求情況影響。隨着市場對美國政策利率下調的預期逐漸升溫，香港銀行同業拆息在2024年首八個月大致回軟（圖3）。在季末季節性資金需求及股市交投活躍的推動下，香港銀行同業拆息於9月下旬收緊，隔夜拆息於季末更一度升至6厘以上。其後香港銀行同業拆息大致穩定，至年底前因流動性相對減少而上升。全年計，隔夜、一個月及三個月香港銀行同業拆息分別下跌45、69及78基點至年底時的5.65厘、4.58厘及4.37厘。\n\n因應美國聯邦基金利率目標區間下調，基本利率下調三次，合共一個百分點（即100基點），由5.75厘下跌至4.75厘（圖3）。在零售層面，隨着美國下調政策利率，多間銀行在9月中調低最優惠貸款利率25基點，並在11月初及12月下旬分別再調低25基點及12.5基點。在此情況下，新造按揭貸款平均利率亦由2023年的4.13厘下跌至2024年12月的3.59厘。整體而言，香港貨幣市場繼續正常運作。貼現窗借貸由2023年的388億港元增至2024年的500億港元；貼現窗的使用情況未見異常。\n\n圖 3 2024年香港銀行同業拆息\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n自1983年以來，聯匯制度一直是香港金融體系的重要支柱，展現強大應對挑戰的能力。儘管美國政策利率走向存在不確定因素，以及地緣經濟碎片化，港元外匯及貨幣市場維持有序運作，反映聯匯制度穩健有效。政府亦堅決維持聯匯制度。國際貨幣基金組織（基金組織）在《2024年對外部門報告》一再重申香港擁有具透明度的規則、龐大的財政及外匯儲備、穩健的金融規管與監管、靈活的經濟，以及審慎的財政架構，確保聯匯制度具公信力。\n\n穩健的銀行體系對聯匯制度的正常運作具關鍵作用。香港銀行體系繼續運作暢順，流動性及資本狀況以國際標準而言均非常充裕。為確保銀行體系具備抵禦衝擊的能力，金管局一直密切監察銀行的信用、流動性與利率風險管理，以及壓力測試結果，並維持對銀行貸款的監管。\n\n為提高貨幣發行局帳目的透明度，自1998年10月起，外匯基金已有部分資產被指定用作支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（即支持資產相對貨幣基礎的比率）由2023年底的110.73%上升至2024年9月10日的112.65%高位，超出112.5%的觸發上限（圖4），當中主要來自投資的利息及投資按市價重估。按照外匯基金諮詢委員會批准的安排，從支持組合轉撥資產至投資組合，令支持比率於9月11日降至110.08%左右。其後支持比率大致保持穩定，於12月31日收報109.56%。在聯匯制度下，雖然已指定某些外匯基金資產作為支持組合，但外匯基金的全部資產均可用作支持港元匯率。外匯基金的龐大財政資源，加上香港穩健的銀行體系，為保障香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供強而有力的後盾。\n\n圖 4 2024年支持比率每日變動\n\n# 貨幣發行委員會\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的貨幣發行委員會負責監察及探討與香港貨幣及金融穩定有關的課題。在2024年，貨幣發行委員會探討的課題包括香港銀行業對非銀行金融機構的風險承擔，以及主要先進經濟體的最新貨幣政策實施框架。貨幣發行委員會會議紀錄及金管局向其呈交的貨幣發行局制度運作報告，均載於金管局網站。\n\n# 紙幣及硬幣\n\n圖 5

and geopolitical tensions, Hong Kong’s foreign exchange and currency markets continued to operate smoothly and in an orderly manner. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate weakened in the first four months of 2024, before strengthening for the remainder of the year. Under the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong interbank rates generally follow the trend of US dollar interest rates, while also being influenced by local supply and demand conditions. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, the Linked Exchange Rate System has consistently demonstrated strong resilience against external shocks.\n\n# Objectives\n\nThe primary objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is to maintain monetary stability, specifically by ensuring the stability of the Hong Kong dollar’s exchange rate, which is kept within the range of 7.75 to 7.85 HKD per 1 USD in the foreign exchange market. The monetary system operates primarily under a Currency Board system, which mandates that the US dollar reserves held by the Exchange Fund provide at least 100% backing to the monetary base. If the monetary base changes, the US dollar reserves must adjust accordingly, increasing or decreasing in line with 100% of the change in the monetary base.\n\nThe monetary base (Table 1) comprises the following:\n\n- Certificates of Indebtedness, which fully back the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks;\n- Currency notes and coins in circulation, issued by the government;\n- The total balance of settlement accounts held at the Monetary Authority (i.e. the Aggregate Balance); and\n- Exchange Fund Bills and Notes issued by the Monetary Authority on behalf of the government.\n\n**Table 1 Monetary Base**\n\nThe HKMA maintains the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and a firm commitment to honour its Convertibility Undertakings (CUs). When the strong-side (or weak-side) CU is triggered, the HKMA, upon request from banks, will sell Hong Kong dollars and buy US dollars at a rate of HK$7.75 per US dollar (or buy Hong Kong dollars and sell US dollars at HK$7.85 per US dollar). This action causes the Aggregate Balance to increase (or decrease), leading to a decline (or rise) in Hong Kong dollar interest rates, thereby prompting the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate to return to the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85.\n\n# 2024 in Review\n\n# Exchange Rate Stability\n\nIn the first four months of 2024, the Hong Kong dollar weakened slightly as liquidity softened. From late April to mid-May, the currency strengthened, primarily supported by dividend-related funding needs and active trading in the equity market. In early August, market concerns about a potential US recession and expectations of faster and more significant interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve triggered the unwinding of carry trades and Hong Kong dollar short positions, pushing the currency to the strong side of its Convertibility Zone. The Hong Kong dollar further strengthened in late September, benefiting from a surge in local stock market activity following the mainland’s announcement of a series of economic stimulus measures. The currency then weakened slightly in early November, partly due to a decline in local stock market gains and partly because strong US economic performance gave the Federal Open Market Committee room to cautiously lower the federal funds rate. Subsequently, the Hong Kong dollar rebounded, driven by seasonal year-end funding demand. Overall, the Hong Kong foreign exchange market continued to operate normally throughout 2024 (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 Market exchange rates in 2024\n\nSince no Convertibility Undertakings were triggered during the year, the Aggregate Balance remained relatively unchanged at around HK$447 billion. Meanwhile, the total outstanding amount of Exchange Fund Bills and Notes increased slightly, from HK$1,245.5 billion to HK$1,383.9 billion. As a result, the Aggregate Balance and the total outstanding amount of Exchange Fund Bills and Notes rose from HK$12,904 billion at the end of 2023 to HK$14,287 billion at the end of 2024 (Chart 2). The overall Monetary Base remains fully supported by foreign exchange reserves.\n\nChart 2 Aggregate Balance in 2024 (before Discount Window operations) and outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\n\n# Money Markets\n\nUnder the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), Hong Kong interbank offered rates largely follow US dollar interest rate trends, although short-term rates are also influenced by local supply and demand conditions. As market expectations of a cut in US policy rates grew, Hong Kong interbank offered rates eased during the first eight months of 2024 (Chart 3). Driven by seasonal funding demands at quarter-end and active stock market trading, Hong Kong interbank offered rates tightened in late September, with overnight rates rising above 6% at one point during the quarter-end period. Thereafter, Hong Kong interbank offered rates remained broadly stable before rising towards year-end due to relatively reduced liquidity. Over the year as a whole, overnight, one-month, and three-month Hong Kong interbank offered rates fell by 45, 69, and 78 basis points respectively, to 5.65%, 4.58%, and 4.37% at year-end.\n\nIn response to the reduction in the target range for the US federal funds rate, the Base Rate was lowered three times by a total of one percentage point (i.e. 100 basis points), falling from 5.75% to 4.75% (Figure 3). At the retail level, following the US policy rate cuts, several banks reduced their best lending rates by 25 basis points in mid-September, with further reductions of 25 basis points and 12.5 basis points in early November and late December, respectively. As a result, the average interest rate for new mortgage loans also declined from 4.13% in 2023 to 3.59% in December 2024. Overall, Hong Kong’s money markets continued to operate normally. Discount window lending increased from HK$38.8 billion in 2023 to HK$50 billion in 2024, with no unusual activity observed in the use of the discount window.\n\nFigure 3 Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates in 2024\n\n# Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nSince 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System has been a cornerstone of Hong Kong’s financial system, demonstrating a strong capacity to withstand challenges. Despite uncertainties surrounding US policy rate trends and geopolitical economic fragmentation, the Hong Kong dollar’s foreign exchange and currency markets have continued to operate in an orderly manner, underscoring the robustness and effectiveness of the Linked Exchange Rate System. The government remains firmly committed to upholding this system. In its 2024 External Sector Report, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) reiterated that Hong Kong’s transparent rules, substantial fiscal and foreign exchange reserves, robust financial regulation and supervision, flexible economy, and prudent fiscal framework collectively ensure the credibility of the Linked Exchange Rate System.\n\nA robust banking system is essential for the smooth functioning of the Linked Exchange Rate System. Hong Kong’s banking system continues to operate smoothly, with liquidity and capital levels that are more than adequate by international standards. To ensure the banking system’s resilience to shocks, the HKMA has been closely monitoring banks’ credit, liquidity, and interest rate risk management, as well as stress test results, while maintaining oversight of bank lending.\n\nTo enhance the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a portion of the Exchange Fund’s assets has been designated to back the monetary base since October 1998. The backing ratio (i.e., the ratio of backing assets to the monetary base) increased from 110.73% at the end of 2023 to a peak of 112.65% on 10 September 2024, surpassing the upper trigger limit of 112.5% (Chart 4). This rise was primarily driven by interest earned on investments and the mark-to-market revaluation of investments. Following arrangements approved by the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, assets were transferred from the backing portfolio to the investment portfolio, reducing the backing ratio to around 110.08% on 11 September. The ratio then remained largely stable, closing at 109.56% on 31 December. Under the Linked Exchange Rate System, while certain Exchange Fund assets are designated as the backing portfolio, all of the Exchange Fund’s assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. The substantial fiscal resources of the Exchange Fund, coupled with Hong Kong’s robust banking system, provide a strong safeguard for the city’s monetary and financial stability.\n\n**Figure 4: Daily Changes in the Backing Ratio for 2024**\n\n# Currency Board Sub-Committee\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee, under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, is responsible for monitoring and exploring issues related to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. In 2024, the Sub-Committee examined topics including the Hong Kong banking sector’s risk exposure to non-bank financial institutions and the latest monetary policy implementation frameworks in major advanced economies. The meeting minutes of the Currency Board Sub-Committee and the reports on the operation of the Currency Board system submitted by the HKMA to the Sub-Committee are available on the HKMA’s website.\n\n# Banknotes and coins\n\n**Figure 5 Amount of banknotes in circulation at the end of 2024, analysed by note-issuing bank**\n\n**Figure 6 Distribution of banknotes in circulation at the end of 2024**\n\n**Figure 7: Amount of banknotes issued by banks in circulation at the end of 2024**\n\n**Figure 8: Amount of banknotes and coins issued by the government in circulation at the end of 2024**\n\n**Figure 9: Analysis of Government-Issued Banknotes and Coins in Circulation by the End of 2024**\n\n# Hong Kong Banknotes\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA organised 14 seminars on the design and anti-counterfeiting features of Hong Kong banknotes, attracting over 2,600 participants, including bank counter staff, retail cashiers, and students. These seminars helped to enhance their knowledge and skills in identifying banknotes.\n\n# Coin Collection Programme\n\nThe Coin Collection Programme remains popular with the public. Details of the programme can be found in the chapter on 'Sustainable HKMA' in the Sustainability Report 2024.\n\n# US Dollar Liquidity Facility\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has introduced enhancements to the US Dollar Liquidity Facility, including a reduction in the settlement cycle from T+1 to T+0, effective from 24 May. This standing liquidity facility can provide licensed banks with backup liquidity when needed, particularly given that the US will begin implementing a shortened T+1 settlement cycle from 28 May.\n\n# Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\n\nThe Exchange Fund Bills and Notes Programme continued to operate smoothly. As of the end of 2024, the outstanding nominal value of Exchange Fund Bills and Notes was approximately HK$13,068 billion (Table 2).\n\nTable 2: Outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\n\n# Monetary Research\n\nIn 2024, the Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMR), which operates under the Hong Kong Academy of Finance and is responsible for research, published 15 research papers on monetary and financial topics of strategic importance to Hong Kong and the wider region. These findings were shared globally through five issues of an open-access electronic journal. The Institute also published two editions of *Insights from Monetary Research*, offering high-level, non-technical summaries of its recent research papers for the general public.\n\nIn addition to its research work, the Research Institute organises a series of knowledge-sharing events to foster connections with various participants. During the year, 31 seminars or webinars were held for local participants to discuss key issues in monetary and financial research. At the international level, the Academy of Finance and the Research Institute collaborated with academic institutions, central banks, and international financial institutions to organise four international conferences and five seminars or roundtable meetings, thereby facilitating dialogue and exchange on a wide range of economic and financial matters.\n\nThese international activities include:\n\n11 April\n\nCo-organised by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.\n\n**6–7 June: NBER East Asian Seminar on Economics 2024**\n\nCo-organised by the National Bureau of Economic Research, the Bank for International Settlements, and the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Business School.\n\n**15–16 July**\n\nCo-organised with the IMF, the Bank for International Settlements, and the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office.\n\n14–15 October\n\n14th Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy – “The Evolution of China’s and Global Trade Structures: Challenges and Opportunities”"}

銀行體系穩定\n\n儘管面對宏觀經濟挑戰及地緣政治的不確定性，香港銀行體系在2024年維持穩健。金管局迅速採取措施支援本地中小型企業，並透過風險為本監管與應變規劃保障銀行體系穩定，另又提供監管指引及支持業界應對新生風險，以提升銀行業的運作穩健性與網絡防衛韌性。為鼓勵應用金融科技，金管局推出連串跨行業項目，包括生成式人工智能「沙盒」。\n\n金管局推出《保障消費者防詐騙約章2.0》，以加強銀行消費者保障。我們又推出「智安存」協助存款人有效保護存款，以及有關銀行無抵押消費信貸產品的冷靜期以減低衝動及過度借貸的風險。此外，金管局向銀行提供有關在面向客戶的服務中應用生成式人工智能的指引，又就二手物業買賣交易提供多一種支付安排與業界緊密合作。金管局亦透過發出數碼資產相關活動的指引、優化「跨境理財通」業務試點，以及簡化銷售投資及保險產品程序，提升客戶體驗，並同時確保投資者保障。年內完成個人信貸資料服務全面過渡至「信資通」。\n\n金管局在香港的打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度方面扮演重要角色。透過提高經由反訛騙及洗黑錢情報工作組交換情報的速度及數量，與2023年相比，情報主導的可疑交易報告增加303%，促使凍結或充公的犯罪得益增加34%。有關促進銀行分享訊息以協助偵測及防止金融罪行的法例修訂的諮詢得到廣泛支持。金管局在4月根據交易監察系統專題審查結果提供指引，以及在9月推出計劃促進業界應用人工智能監察可疑活動。金管局亦與銀行業及香港警務處合作，優化「可疑帳號警示」機制及加強宣傳工作，並就防範、偵測及制止授權支付詐騙向銀行發出指引。\n\n香港在實施包括資本充足及披露等國際監管標準方面取得良好進展。香港存款保障委員會優化了存款保障計劃的多個範疇，以加強對存款人的保障。\n\n為確保處置機制具公信力，金管局實施處置標準，規定銀行須更新與對手方的金融合約，減低處置中的提前終止風險。此外，金管局在制定銀行的首選處置策略、應對處置可行性障礙以確保有足夠財政資源及處置中的運作持續性，以及提升處置執行能力方面均取得顯著進展。\n\n# 目標\n\n金管局的目標之一是促進銀行體系的安全及穩定。要達致這個目標，實有賴建立及維持具高度應對能力且能為香港經濟提供所需關鍵金融服務的金融體系。\n\n銀行可能因其營運方式，甚或在極端情況下因失序地倒閉而影響金融體系的穩定。作為監管當局，金融管理專員在保障金融穩定方面擔當重要角色，確保銀行有能力抵禦衝擊及應對危機，以最終有助防止出現倒閉。金融管理專員負責對銀行進行審慎監管，以及認可香港的持牌銀行、有限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司（統稱「認可機構」）。\n\n香港的審慎監管制度並非為確保「零風險」而設。事實上，作為一個處置機制當局，金融管理專員力求確保一旦有認可機構不再可持續經營，能有秩序地處理其倒閉。為此，香港已設立金融機構處置機制，金融管理專員在該機制下為認可機構的處置機制當局。為落實香港的處置機制，我們有必要制定處置規則及政策標準、進行處置規劃以排除認可機構處置可行性的障礙，以及建立金管局處置瀕臨倒閉認可機構的運作能力。為有效執行上述工作，金管局採納與國際一致及協調的方法。\n\n金融管理專員亦負責指定及監察某些金融市場基建。金管局監察金融市場基建的目的，是促進有關基建的整體安全及效率、減低系統性風險，以及提高透明度。提升金融市場基建面對金融危機的抗震能力，能保障香港的貨幣與金融體系，避免因金融市場基建運作中斷而影響其穩定。\n\n# 2024年回顧\n\n# 牌照事宜\n\n年內金管局向一間在香港成立為法團的銀行及一間在香港以外成立為法團的銀行授予銀行牌照。金管局亦核准一間在香港以外的交易商經紀成為貨幣經紀。此外，年內金管局撤銷三間持牌銀行、一間有限制牌照銀行及一間接受存款公司的認可資格。\n\n有關香港的認可機構及本地代表辦事處的更多資訊，請參閱分別載於第311至314頁及第320至323頁的附錄及表D至F。\n\n# 檢討銀行三級制\n\n在2024年，金管局完成有關簡化銀行三級制至二級制的公眾諮詢，回應者普遍支持簡化建議。經考慮所收到的意見，金管局就建議提出若干新的關鍵事項，以精簡過渡過程及減少對接受存款公司現有客戶的影響。\n\n# 「虛擬銀行」易名\n\n此外，金管局完成有關「虛擬銀行(Virtual Bank)」易名為「數字銀行(Digital Bank)」的公眾諮詢。易名建議得到廣泛支持，金管局遂於10月修訂法定指引《數字銀行的認可》，有關建議正式生效。\n\n# 數字銀行的檢討\n\n在2024年完成的另一項工作是全面檢討數字銀行，檢討報告已於8月發表。有關檢討顯示數字銀行發展至今已達到在香港引入數字銀行的三項政策目標，即推動金融科技與創新、提供新的客戶體驗，以及促進普及金融。在數字銀行和傳統銀行的多樣化發展下，金管局認為現時數字銀行牌照的數量合適，現階段沒有必要在市場上引入更多新的數字銀行參與者。10月發出的修訂指引《數字銀行的認可》放寬了數項對業界的限制，包括容許數字銀行經營零售銀行業務以外的銀行業務，以及在從客戶體驗與業務策略的角度而言屬合理的情況下設立實體分行，前提是數字銀行繼續主要透過數碼渠道提供銀行服務。\n\n# 銀行牌照費的檢討\n\n金管局於年內完成對牌照費的檢討，並於6月提高費用水平。\n\n# 香港的公司遷冊制度\n\n金管局就於香港引入公司遷冊制度向政府提供支援，包括協助修訂《銀行業條例》及其附屬法例以及其他與金管局有關的法例的立法程序。\n\n# 監管工作概覽\n\n年內金管局共進行174次非現場審查，涵蓋範圍甚廣，包括認可機構的CAMEL評估、企業管治及風險管理。為繼續加強認可機構的風險管治水平，金管局與認可機構董事局、獨立非執行董事或董事局轄下委員會共舉行36次會議，並與認可機構及其外聘核數師共舉行38次三方聯席會議。此外，金管局對認可機構的各項業務進行現場審查，包括信用、市場及流動性風險管理方面的管治與做法。\n\n鑑於認可機構應用科技的情況越趨普及，業務操作風險及科技風險管理是另一個監管重點。金管局亦進一步加強對認可機構氣候風險管理的監管，以提高認可機構應對氣候變化的能力。金管局在全球經濟不明朗的環境下維持金融穩定及促進經濟穩健增長等方面的工作得到肯定，獲《亞洲銀行家》雜誌(The AsianBanker)評選為「亞太區最佳宏觀經濟監管機構」(BestMacroeconomic Regulator in Asia Pacific)。\n\n助理總裁（銀行監理）朱立翹女士（中）代表金管局領取《亞洲銀行家》雜誌頒發的「亞太區最佳宏觀經濟監管機構獎項\n\n在操守監管方面，金管局對認可機構的證券、投資產品、信託、保險及強制性公積金（強積金）相關業務，以及消費者保障事項進行現場審查，並以專題評估作為配合，以審視新的項目或被評估為屬較高風險的範疇。\n\n表1載有金管局於2024年的監管工作概要。\n\n表 1 監管工作概要\n\na. 聚焦於運作穩健性的額外監管工作包括一項金管局調查及認可機構進行自我評估以審視實施進度和識別需要加強的環節，以及就架構制定與做法在雙邊與業界層面進行廣泛的外展活動。\nb. 此外，監管工作集中評估認可機構對特定信貸組合的審批和持續風險管理的策略與手法，例如對商用物業及中小型企業貸款。\nc. 包括與認可機構舉行諮詢會議，以檢視其實施金管局《監管政策手冊》單元GS-1「氣候風險管理」的情況。\n\n# 信用風險\n\n# 信貸增長及資產質素\n\n2024年貸款總額減少2.8%，2023年的跌幅為3.6%。表2列載各類貸款及墊款的增長情況。2024年內地相關貸款總額減少8.7%至38,590億港元（表3）。\n\n鑑於利率仍然高企、部分內地房地產發展商的債務問題還未完全緩解，以及本地商業房地產市場疲弱，金管局在2024年繼續密切監察認可機構的資產質素及評估其信用風險管理手法。年內銀行體系的資產質素持續面對壓力，但風險形勢仍屬可控。銀行體系的特定分類貸款比率於2024年底為1.96%，高於2023年底的1.57%，而同期內地相關貸款的特定分類貸款比率則由2.58%下降至2.38%。\n\n年內金管局進行專題評估，檢視認可機構的信用風險管理，當中重點包括對較易受影響行業的風險承擔、對私人銀行及財富管理客戶的有抵押貸款、無抵押零售貸款、對香港境外業務的信用風險的監察，以及對非銀行金融機構的風險承擔。\n\n表 2 貸款及墊款的增長\n\n表 3 內地相關貸款增長\n\n# 紓緩銀行客戶的資金流壓力\n\n# 支持本地中小企\n\n中小企是香港經濟的重要基石，金管局一直密切關注它們獲取銀行融資的情況。自金管局與銀行業於2019年成立「銀行業中小企貸款協調機制」（中小企協調機制）以來，合共推出多輪中小企支援措施，包括「預先批核還息不還本」計劃，協助中小企渡過新冠疫情期間的困境。\n\n在2024年，金管局與銀行業推出更多措施，支持經營情況因經濟轉型而仍然面對挑戰的中小企，並協助中小企持續發展和升級轉型。\n\n# 新的中小企支持措施\n\n金管局透過中小企協調機制於3月推出九項措施，協助中小企獲取銀行融資，以及支持其持續發展。\n\n於3月公布的九項支持中小企措施\n\n1. 不要求按時供款按揭客戶提前還款\n2. 調整信貸額度給予客戶最少六個月過渡期\n","terms":{"$mart理財321":["$mart Money Management

remained robust in 2024. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) took swift action to support local small and medium-sized enterprises, ensuring the stability of the banking system through risk-based supervision and contingency planning. It also provided regulatory guidance and support to help the industry address emerging risks, thereby enhancing the operational resilience and cyber resilience of the banking sector. To encourage the adoption of financial technology, the HKMA launched a series of cross-sector initiatives, including a generative artificial intelligence sandbox.\n\nThe HKMA introduced the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter 2.0 to strengthen consumer protection in banking. We also launched Money Safe to help depositors protect their funds effectively and introduced a cooling-off period for unsecured consumer credit products offered by banks, to reduce the risks of impulsive and excessive borrowing. Additionally, the HKMA provided guidance to banks on using generative artificial intelligence in customer-facing services and collaborated with the industry to introduce an additional payment arrangement for secondary property market transactions. The HKMA also enhanced customer experience and ensured investor protection by issuing guidelines on digital asset-related activities, optimising the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect pilot scheme, and simplifying the process for selling investment and insurance products. The full transition of consumer credit reference services to Credit Data Smart was completed during the year.\n\nThe HKMA plays a key role in Hong Kong’s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing regime. By increasing the speed and volume of intelligence exchanged through the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce, intelligence-led suspicious transaction reports rose by 303% compared to 2023, leading to a 34% increase in the freezing or confiscation of criminal proceeds. The consultation on legislative amendments to facilitate bank-to-bank information sharing for detecting and preventing financial crimes received widespread support. In April, the HKMA issued guidance based on a thematic review of transaction monitoring systems, and in September, it launched a programme to promote the use of artificial intelligence by the industry to monitor suspicious activities. The HKMA also worked with the banking sector and the Hong Kong Police Force to enhance the Suspicious Account Alert mechanism, strengthen publicity efforts, and issue guidance to banks on preventing, detecting, and stopping authorised payment scams.\n\nHong Kong has made good progress in implementing international supervisory standards, including those on capital adequacy and disclosure. The Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board has enhanced several aspects of the Deposit Protection Scheme to strengthen protection for depositors.\n\nTo ensure the credibility of the resolution regime, the HKMA implemented resolution standards requiring banks to update their financial contracts with counterparties to reduce the risk of early termination during resolution. The HKMA also made significant progress in developing banks’ preferred resolution strategies, addressing resolvability barriers to ensure sufficient financial resources and operational continuity during resolution, and enhancing resolution execution capabilities.\n\n# Objectives\n\nOne of the HKMA’s key objectives is to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this goal relies on establishing and maintaining a highly resilient financial system capable of providing the critical financial services needed by the Hong Kong economy.\n\nBanks may affect the stability of the financial system due to their operating methods or, in extreme cases, due to disorderly failure. As a regulator, the Monetary Authority plays a crucial role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring that banks can withstand shocks and manage crises effectively, thereby helping to prevent failures. The Monetary Authority is responsible for prudentially supervising banks and authorising licensed banks, restricted licence banks, and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong (collectively referred to as \"authorised institutions\").\n\nHong Kong’s prudential regulatory framework is not designed to ensure \"zero risk\". Instead, as a resolution authority, the Monetary Authority aims to ensure that if an authorised institution becomes non-viable, its failure can be managed in an orderly manner. To this end, Hong Kong has established a financial institution resolution regime, under which the Monetary Authority acts as the resolution authority for authorised institutions. Implementing this regime requires developing resolution rules and policy standards, conducting resolution planning to remove barriers to the resolvability of authorised institutions, and building the HKMA’s operational capability to resolve authorised institutions on the verge of failure. To carry out these tasks effectively, the HKMA adopts an internationally consistent and coordinated approach.\n\nThe Monetary Authority is also responsible for designating and supervising certain financial market infrastructures. The HKMA’s supervision of these infrastructures aims to promote their overall safety and efficiency, reduce systemic risk, and enhance transparency. Strengthening the resilience of financial market infrastructures to financial crises safeguards Hong Kong’s monetary and financial system by preventing disruptions caused by failures in their operation.\n\n# Review of 2024\n\n# Licensing Matters\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA granted banking licences to one bank incorporated in Hong Kong and one bank incorporated outside Hong Kong. It also approved a dealer broker located outside Hong Kong to become a money broker. In addition, the HKMA revoked the authorisation of three licensed banks, one restricted licence bank, and one deposit-taking company.\n\nFor more information on Hong Kong’s authorised institutions and local representative offices, please refer to the appendices and Tables D to F on pages 311 to 314 and 320 to 323, respectively.\n\n# Review of the Three-Tier Banking System\n\nIn 2024, the HKMA completed a public consultation on simplifying the three-tier banking system to a two-tier system, with respondents generally supporting the proposal. After considering the feedback, the HKMA proposed several new key measures to streamline the transition process and minimise the impact on existing customers of deposit-taking companies.\n\n# Renaming of \"Virtual Banks\"\n\nThe HKMA also completed a public consultation on renaming \"Virtual Banks\" to \"Digital Banks\". The proposal received widespread support, and the HKMA revised the statutory guideline on the Authorisation of Digital Banks in October, with the changes taking effect formally.\n\n# Review of Digital Banks\n\nAnother task completed in 2024 was a comprehensive review of digital banks, with the review report published in August. The review showed that digital banks have achieved the three policy objectives set for their introduction in Hong Kong: promoting fintech innovation, providing new customer experiences, and enhancing financial inclusion. Given the diversified development of digital banks and traditional banks, the HKMA considers the current number of digital bank licences to be appropriate and sees no need to introduce more new digital bank participants into the market at this stage. The revised guideline on the Authorisation of Digital Banks issued in October relaxed several restrictions on the industry, including allowing digital banks to conduct banking business other than retail banking and to establish physical branches if justified by customer experience and business strategy, provided that they continue to provide banking services primarily through digital channels.\n\n# Review of Banking Licence Fees\n\nThe HKMA completed a review of licence fees during the year and increased the fee levels in June.\n\n# Hong Kong’s Company Re-domiciliation Regime\n\nThe HKMA provided support to the government in introducing a corporate redomiciliation regime in Hong Kong, including assistance in amending the legislative procedures of the Banking Ordinance, its subsidiary legislation, and other laws related to the HKMA.\n\n# Overview of Regulatory Work\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA conducted 174 off-site reviews, covering a wide range of areas, including authorised institutions’ CAMEL assessments, corporate governance, and risk management. To further strengthen the risk governance of authorised institutions, the HKMA held 36 meetings with their boards, independent non-executive directors, or board committees, and 38 tripartite meetings with authorised institutions and their external auditors. Additionally, the HKMA conducted on-site examinations of various operations of authorised institutions, including governance and practices in credit, market, and liquidity risk management.\n\nGiven the increasing adoption of technology by authorised institutions, operational and technology risk management has become another regulatory focus. The HKMA has also intensified its oversight of authorised institutions’ climate risk management to enhance their capacity to address climate change. The HKMA’s efforts in maintaining financial stability and promoting robust economic growth amidst global economic uncertainty have been recognised, earning it the “Best Macroeconomic Regulator in Asia Pacific” award from The Asian Banker magazine.\n\nAssistant President (Banking Supervision) Ms Zhu Liqiao (centre) represented the HKMA in receiving the “Best Macroeconomic Regulator in Asia Pacific” award from The Asian Banker magazine.\n\nIn terms of conduct supervision, the HKMA conducted on-site examinations of authorised institutions’ businesses related to securities, investment products, trusts, insurance, and the Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF), as well as consumer protection matters. These examinations were complemented by thematic assessments to review new projects or areas deemed higher risk.\n\nTable 1 provides an overview of the HKMA’s regulatory work in 2024.\n\n**Table 1: Overview of Regulatory Work**\n\na. Additional regulatory work focused on operational resilience includes an HKMA survey and self-assessments by authorised institutions to review implementation progress and identify areas for improvement, as well as extensive outreach activities at bilateral and sectoral levels on framework design and practices.  \nb. Furthermore, regulatory efforts concentrated on assessing authorised institutions’ strategies and methods for approving and continuously managing risks associated with specific credit portfolios, such as commercial property and small and medium-sized enterprise loans.  \nc. This includes holding consultation meetings with authorised institutions to review their implementation of Module GS-1 “Climate Risk Management” of the HKMA’s Supervisory Policy Manual.\n\n# Credit Risk\n\n# Credit Growth and Asset Quality\n\nTotal loans decreased by 2.8% in 2024, compared with a 3.6% decline in 2023. Table 2 shows the growth of various types of loans and advances. Total mainland-related loans decreased by 8.7% to HK$3,859 billion in 2024 (Table 3).\n\nGiven persistently high interest rates, unresolved debt issues among some mainland property developers, and a weak local commercial property market, the HKMA continued to closely monitor authorised institutions’ asset quality and assess their credit risk management practices in 2024. While the banking system’s asset quality remained under pressure during the year, the risk situation was still manageable. The banking system’s classified loan ratio stood at 1.96% at the end of 2024, higher than 1.57% at the end of 2023. In contrast, the classified loan ratio for mainland-related loans decreased from 2.58% to 2.38% over the same period.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA conducted thematic assessments to review authorised institutions’ credit risk management, focusing on risk exposure to more vulnerable sectors, secured loans to private banking and wealth management clients, unsecured retail loans, monitoring of credit risks associated with offshore businesses in Hong Kong, and risk exposure to non-bank financial institutions.\n\n**Table 2: Growth of Loans and Advances**\n\n**Table 3: Growth of Mainland-related Loans**\n\n# Alleviating Cash Flow Pressure for Bank Customers\n\n# Supporting Local SMEs\n\nSMEs are a vital pillar of Hong Kong’s economy, and the HKMA has been closely monitoring their access to bank financing. Since the establishment of the Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism (SME Coordination Mechanism) by the HKMA and the banking sector in 2019, multiple rounds of SME support measures have been launched. These include the “pre-approved principal moratorium” scheme, which helped SMEs weather the difficulties during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn 2024, the HKMA and the banking sector introduced further measures to support SMEs whose operations still face challenges due to economic transformation, and to help SMEs continue to develop and upgrade.\n\n# New SME Support Measures\n\nIn March, the HKMA launched nine measures through the SME Coordination Mechanism to help SMEs access bank financing and support their continued development.\n\n**Nine SME support measures announced in March**\n\n1. Mortgage customers who are up to date with their payments are not required to make early repayments.  \n2. Adjust credit limits to provide customers with a minimum transition period of six months."}

概覽\n\n在2024年，金管局繼續致力提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。\n\n金管局擴展及優化香港與內地間的互聯互通機制，有助鞏固香港作為內地與國際金融市場間的橋樑角色。年內，多項有關「粵港澳大灣區跨境理財通」（「跨境理財通」）的優化措施出台，便利粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）個人投資者進行跨境投資。於2月，金管局將中華人民共和國財政部（國家財政部）發行的在岸國債和內地政策性銀行發行的政策性金融債納入人民幣流動資金安排的合資格抵押品名單。於7月，兩地相關部門公布進一步支持境外投資者使用通過「債券通」持有的在岸債券作為「北向互換通」交易的履約抵押品，並於2025年1月實施。此外，「北向互換通」於年內進行優化，增加投資者在對沖策略和管理投資組合方面的靈活性及效率。\n\n在2024年，香港的離岸人民幣業務穩健增長。金管局推出一級流動性提供行安排的優化措施，包括增加提供行數目及擴大安排規模。於年底前，香港人民幣即時支付結算系統的夜間跨境服務能力提升，以更好應付全球各地對跨境人民幣支付的需要。\n\n金管局推出大灣區金融合作下的多項利民便商措施，包括促進企業跨境融資的跨境徵信互通業務試點，以及便利香港居民在大灣區置業的跨境匯款支付安排。\n\n金管局繼續致力提升香港整體金融平台的競爭力。具體而言，為增強香港作為首選基金管理中心及家族辦公室業務樞紐的吸引力，金管局與政府及金融業緊密合作，締造更便利的稅務及監管環境。此外，金管局透過Evergreen項目發行第二批代幣化債券，並推出「EvergreenHub」一站式數碼債券知識庫和「數碼債券資助計劃」，繼續推動香港債券市場創新。於10月，金管局公布「可持續金融行動計劃」，訂明進一步鞏固香港作為區內綠色和可持續金融樞紐的具體目標。\n\n另一方面，金管局繼續加強市場拓展工作，向海外及內地持份者介紹香港的金融服務。金管局在11月舉辦第三屆「國際金融領袖投資峰會」。峰會為期三日，主題為「在變局中前航」，雲集全球各地金融業界翹楚分享各自獨到的觀點。峰會先由國務院副總理何立峰先生作開幕主題演講，接着是三間內地金融監管機構的分享環節，以及由國際金融領袖參與的專題討論。峰會共匯聚350多位來自超過120間國際金融機構的領袖參與，充分體現國際金融界對香港的支持和信心。\n\n年內金管局亦舉辦各項其他研討會及會議，包括：\n\n- 於9月與迪拜金融服務管理局合辦聯合氣候金融會議；\n- 於10月與全球風險管理專業人士協會合辦第15屆全球風險論壇；\n- 於10月亦與國際結算銀行合辦國際金融研討會；及\n- 於12月舉辦金融穩定理事會全體會議，是自2016年以來首次在亞洲舉行的同類會議，匯聚超過50個國家財政金融機關及12個國際標準制定機構的領袖和高級官員。\n\n年內金管局亦積極加強與其他地區的雙邊聯繫。於12月，金管局分別與阿拉伯聯合酋長國中央銀行（阿聯酋央行）及沙特中央銀行（沙特央行）在香港舉行雙邊會議，促進中東與亞洲地區之間的投資及金融市場聯繫。金管局與阿聯酋央行簽署諒解備忘錄，建立兩地債務資本市場基建的互聯互通，並促進跨境債務證券發行及投資活動。在此之前，金管局於10月訪問卡塔爾多哈，加強兩地金融服務領域的合作。\n\n此外，金管局於12月舉行第七次香港與瑞士金融合作對話，討論內容涵蓋區內及本地的前景與政策挑戰，以及可持續金融、金融科技與市場互聯互通領域的最新發展及潛在合作空間。\n\n金管局分別於1月及5月訪問泰國和馬來西亞，與中央銀行、金融機構和企業會面，推廣香港作為國際金融中心的地位，並進一步加強雙邊金融聯繫和合作。重點領域之一是推廣使用人民幣和本地貨幣作跨境投資和貿易結算，以及香港的競爭優勢。\n\n在國際層面，金管局積極參與中央銀行領域的事務，並繼續在多個區內及國際委員會擔當領導角色。金管局現為巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（巴塞爾委員會）轄下政策及標準小組和金融穩定理事會轄下亞洲區域諮詢小組的聯席主席，另又擔任金融穩定理事會轄下金融創新網絡聯席主席（至2024年7月止）。金管局亦為國際結算銀行轄下主要新興市場經濟體行長會議和金融穩定理事會轄下加密資產框架同業評審小組的主席。在2018至2024年間，金管局一直連任東亞及太平洋地區中央銀行會議(EMEAP)轄下金融市場工作小組主席。\n\n金管局金融科技促進辦公室與各銀行部門繼續實施「金融科技2025」策略，促進業界廣泛採用金融科技，並提升香港作為亞洲金融科技樞紐的地位。年內推行的主要措施包括：\n\n- 進一步推動銀行在五個主要範疇的金融科技應用，包括財富科技、保險科技、綠色科技、人工智能及分布式分類帳技術；\n- 推動央行數碼貨幣的工作，以了解其效益及潛在的應用場景，包括：\n    - 推進「多種央行數碼貨幣跨境網絡」(mBridge)項目，以改善跨境支付；\n    - 進一步研究在香港發行「數碼港元」(e-HKD)的可行性；及\n    - 開始探索以央行數碼貨幣支持香港代幣化市場的發展；\n- 透過「商業數據通」便利中小企借貸；\n- 加強跨境金融科技合作；及\n- 推動更廣泛使用快速支付系統「轉數快」。\n\n「轉數快」的使用在2024年繼續增加，登記數目與交易量在過去六年穩步上升。截至2024年底，「轉數快」登記數目增至1,580萬個，全年每日平均交易宗數較上年上升33%。除個人對個人支付及商業支付穩步增長外，透過「轉數快」繳付政府帳單、支付予商戶及為儲值支付工具電子錢包或銀行帳戶增值持續增加，是帶動「轉數快」交易量持續增長的主要原因。\n\n為確保本地零售支付業的安全及效率，金管局根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（《支付條例》）監察六個指定零售支付系統，並監管15項持牌儲值支付工具（其中四項由持牌銀行發行）。年內金管局繼續與業界緊密合作，因應詐騙風險上升加強管控措施及保障消費者。\n\n財經事務及庫務局與金管局就在香港實施穩定幣發行人監管制度的立法建議，於2月完成為期兩個月的公眾諮詢後，於7月聯合發表諮詢總結，並於12月將《穩定幣條例草案》提交立法會審議。為更了解穩定幣發行人的業務模式，並制定適切的監管制度，金管局亦推出穩定幣發行人「沙盒」，並於7月公布三間進入「沙盒」的參與機構。與此同時，金管局繼續積極參與國際組織在數碼資產相關課題（包括穩定幣及代幣化）的工作，確保相關監管框架符合國際標準及最佳做法。\n\n#

significant progress in strengthening Hong Kong’s position as a globally competitive international financial centre.\n\nThe HKMA worked with relevant authorities in mainland China and Hong Kong to introduce a series of measures aimed at deepening and expanding the interconnectivity between Hong Kong and mainland financial markets. These measures included optimising the “Wealth Management Connect” scheme in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area; expanding the scope of eligible collateral under the HKMA’s RMB Liquidity Facility and Northbound Swap Connect; optimising Northbound Swap Connect; and enhancing the Primary Liquidity Providers (PLPs) scheme. These initiatives helped reinforce Hong Kong’s role as a gateway and consolidate its position as a global offshore renminbi (RMB) business hub.\n\nThe HKMA also made good progress in bolstering the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, covering areas such as bond issuance, asset and wealth management, green and sustainable finance, and corporate treasury centres. To promote Hong Kong’s financial services, the HKMA intensified its market outreach efforts targeting overseas and mainland stakeholders, enabling them to fully understand the robustness of Hong Kong’s financial system and the opportunities it offers. The successful hosting of the third Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit and numerous other events not only enhanced Hong Kong’s image as a leading international financial centre but also generated a positive ripple effect. The HKMA actively participated in various international and regional central banking and regulatory forums, continuing to contribute to global efforts to maintain financial stability and promote financial market development.\n\nThe HKMA achieved significant progress across all areas of the Fintech 2025 strategy, including central bank digital currencies and data infrastructure.\n\nThe registration numbers and transaction volume of the Faster Payment System (FPS) continued to grow steadily, reaching 15.8 million registrations by the end of 2024. Over the same period, the average daily number of instant HKD transactions processed increased to 1.65 million. The HKMA is collaborating closely with the People’s Bank of China to promote the interconnection between Hong Kong’s FPS and mainland China’s online interbank payment and clearing system, with the aim of facilitating cross-border payments.\n\n# Overview\n\nIn 2024, the HKMA continued its efforts to enhance Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre.\n\nThe HKMA expanded and optimised the interconnectivity mechanisms between Hong Kong and mainland China, thereby reinforcing Hong Kong’s role as a bridge between mainland and international financial markets. Throughout the year, several optimisation measures were introduced for the “Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect” scheme in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), aimed at facilitating cross-border investment by individual investors within the GBA. In February, the HKMA added onshore government bonds issued by the Ministry of Finance of the People’s Republic of China (CMOF) and policy bank bonds issued by mainland policy banks to the list of eligible collateral under the RMB Liquidity Facility. In July, relevant authorities in both regions announced further support for offshore investors to use onshore bonds held through Bond Connect as margin collateral for Northbound Swap Connect transactions, with implementation scheduled for January 2025. Additionally, Northbound Swap Connect was optimised during the year to enhance investors’ flexibility and efficiency in hedging strategies and portfolio management.\n\nHong Kong’s offshore RMB business experienced steady growth in 2024. The HKMA implemented optimisation measures for the PLP scheme, including increasing the number of PLPs and expanding the scheme’s scale. By year-end, the nighttime cross-border service capability of Hong Kong’s RMB Real-Time Gross Settlement system was enhanced to better meet global demand for cross-border RMB payments.\n\nUnder the Greater Bay Area financial cooperation framework, the HKMA introduced several measures to benefit individuals and businesses. These included a pilot cross-border credit referencing scheme to facilitate cross-border financing for enterprises and payment arrangements for cross-border remittances to support property purchases by Hong Kong residents in the GBA.\n\nThe HKMA continued its efforts to enhance the overall competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. Specifically, to strengthen Hong Kong’s appeal as a preferred fund management centre and family office hub, the HKMA collaborated closely with the government and the financial industry to establish a more favourable tax and regulatory environment. Furthermore, the HKMA issued a second batch of tokenised bonds through Project Evergreen and launched EvergreenHub, a one-stop digital bond knowledge repository, along with the Digital Bond Grant Scheme, to drive further innovation in Hong Kong’s bond market. In October, the HKMA unveiled the Sustainable Finance Action Agenda, outlining concrete goals to reinforce Hong Kong’s position as a regional hub for green and sustainable finance.\n\nMeanwhile, the HKMA continued to strengthen its market outreach efforts, promoting Hong Kong’s financial services to overseas and mainland stakeholders. In November, the HKMA hosted the third Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit. The three-day event, themed “Navigating Through Change”, brought together financial leaders from around the world to share their insights. The summit began with an opening keynote speech by Vice Premier He Lifeng of the State Council, followed by presentations from three mainland financial regulators and panel discussions involving international financial leaders. The summit attracted over 350 leaders from more than 120 international financial institutions, underscoring the international financial community’s support for and confidence in Hong Kong.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA also organised several other seminars and conferences, including:\n\n- A joint climate finance conference co-hosted with the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) in September.\n- The 15th Global Risk Forum, co-organised with the Global Association of Risk Professionals in October.\n- An international finance seminar co-hosted with the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) in October.\n- The Financial Stability Board (FSB) Plenary Meeting in December, the first such meeting held in Asia since 2016, which brought together leaders and senior officials from over 50 national financial authorities and 12 international standard-setting bodies.\n\nThe HKMA also actively strengthened its bilateral ties with other regions during the year. In December, it held bilateral meetings in Hong Kong with the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates (CBUAE) and the Saudi Central Bank (SAMA) to promote investment and financial market linkages between the Middle East and Asia. The HKMA signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the CBUAE to establish interconnectivity between the debt capital market infrastructures of the two regions and facilitate cross-border debt securities issuance and investment activities. Prior to this, the HKMA visited Doha, Qatar, in October to enhance cooperation in financial services between the two regions.\n\nIn addition, the HKMA held its seventh financial cooperation dialogue with Switzerland in December, discussing regional and local prospects, policy challenges, and recent developments in sustainable finance, fintech, and market interconnectivity, as well as potential areas for cooperation.\n\nIn January and May, the HKMA visited Thailand and Malaysia, respectively, to meet with central banks, financial institutions, and businesses. The aim was to promote Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre and strengthen bilateral financial ties and cooperation. A key focus was promoting the use of the RMB and local currencies for cross-border investment and trade settlement, as well as highlighting Hong Kong’s competitive advantages.\n\nAt the international level, the HKMA actively participated in central banking affairs and continued to play a leadership role in various regional and international committees. The HKMA currently serves as co-chair of the Policy and Standards Group under the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the FSB Regional Consultative Group for Asia. It also chaired the FSB Financial Innovation Network until July 2024. Additionally, the HKMA chairs the BIS Meeting of Governors from Major Emerging Market Economies and the FSB Crypto-Asset Framework Peer Review Group. From 2018 to 2024, the HKMA was re-elected as chair of the Working Group on Financial Markets under the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP).\n\nThe HKMA’s Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO) and various banking departments continued to implement the Fintech 2025 strategy, promoting widespread adoption of fintech within the industry and enhancing Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia. Key measures implemented during the year included:\n\n- Further promoting fintech applications in banks across five key areas: wealthtech, insurtech, greentech, artificial intelligence, and distributed ledger technology (DLT).\n- Advancing work on central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) to understand their benefits and potential use cases, including:\n  - Progressing the Multiple CBDC Bridge (mBridge) project to improve cross-border payments.\n  - Further studying the feasibility of issuing a digital Hong Kong dollar (e-HKD).\n  - Exploring the use of CBDCs to support the development of Hong Kong’s tokenisation market.\n- Facilitating SME lending through the Commercial Data Interchange (CDI).\n- Strengthening cross-border fintech cooperation.\n- Promoting wider use of the Faster Payment System (FPS).\n\nThe use of FPS continued to grow in 2024, with registration numbers and transaction volumes rising steadily over the past six years. By the end of 2024, FPS registrations had reached 15.8 million, with the average daily transaction count increasing by 33% compared to the previous year. In addition to steady growth in person-to-person and business payments, the sustained increase in FPS transaction volume was primarily driven by growing use of the system for paying government bills, making payments to merchants, and topping up stored value facilities (SVFs) or bank accounts.\n\nTo ensure the safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA monitored six designated retail payment systems and supervised 15 licensed SVFs (four of which were issued by licensed banks) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO). During the year, the HKMA continued to collaborate closely with the industry to strengthen control measures and protect consumers in response to rising fraud risks.\n\nFollowing a two-month public consultation in February on proposals to regulate stablecoin issuers in Hong Kong, the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau and the HKMA jointly published a consultation summary in July and submitted the Stablecoins Bill to the Legislative Council for consideration in December. To better understand stablecoin issuers’ business models and develop an appropriate regulatory framework, the HKMA also launched a Stablecoin Issuer Sandbox, announcing three participating institutions in July. Simultaneously, the HKMA continued to engage actively with international organisations on digital asset-related issues (including stablecoins and tokenisation) to ensure that the regulatory framework aligns with international standards and best practices.\n\n# Overview of measures taken by the HKMA in 2024 to strengthen Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre\n\nDeepen financial market interconnectivity between Hong Kong and mainland China, consolidate Hong Kong’s position as an offshore RMB business hub, and strengthen ties within the Greater Bay Area:\n\n- Optimise the “Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect” and “Northbound Swap Connect” schemes.\n- Expand the scope of eligible collateral under the HKMA’s RMB Liquidity Facility and Northbound Swap Connect to include onshore RMB bonds issued by the Ministry of Finance and mainland policy banks.\n- Enhance the Primary Liquidity Providers (PLPs) scheme.\n- Improve the nighttime cross-border service capability of Hong Kong’s RMB Real-Time Gross Settlement system to meet global demand for cross-border RMB payments more effectively.\n- Support the issuance of dim sum bonds by the Shenzhen, Guangdong, and Hainan governments in Hong Kong.\n- Facilitate cross-border financing for enterprises through cross-border credit referencing cooperation.\n- Implement measures to streamline cross-border remittances for property purchases in the Greater Bay Area.\n- Strengthen communication and collaboration between mainland institutions and Hong Kong’s financial industry to explore new business opportunities.\n\n# Strengthen ties with regions worldwide\n\n- Host major international events, including the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit, the FSB Plenary Meeting, and a seminar co-organised with the BIS.\n- Enhance market outreach to promote Hong Kong’s financial services to overseas and mainland stakeholders and build stronger ties with the Middle East and ASEAN regions.\n- Actively participate in international and regional central banking and regulatory forums.\n\n# Enhance financial platform competitiveness\n\n- Drive bond market innovation through Project Evergreen, including supporting the government’s issuance of the world’s first multi-currency digital bond, launching the EvergreenHub digital bond knowledge platform, and introducing the Digital Bond Grant Scheme."}
{"zh":"# 儲備管理\n\n2024年環球金融市場表現大致良好。主要經濟體錄得穩定增長，而通脹亦回落至更接近政策目標的水平。多個主要央行陸續下調政策利率，有利投資環境。2024年全年計，外匯基金錄得2,188億港元的投資收入，投資回報率為5.2%。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》，外匯基金的首要目的是直接或間接影響港元匯價，亦可運用於保持香港貨幣及金融體系穩定健全，藉此保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。金管局根據財政司司長轉授的權力及轉授權力的條款，就外匯基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標及組合架構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會為外匯基金制定下列投資目標：\n\n(i) 保障資本；\n(ii) 確保整體貨幣基礎在任何時候都由流通性極高的美元資產提供十足支持；\n(iii) 確保流動資金足以維持貨幣及金融穩定；以及\n(iv) 在符合上述(i)至(iii)項的前提下盡量爭取投資回報，以保障外匯基金的長期購買力。\n\n以上目標全面顧及外匯基金的法定目的，並已於外匯基金的組合架構及目標資產配置中反映（圖示1）。\n\n圖示1 外匯基金的投資組合類別\n\n外匯基金大致上分成兩個主要組合：支持組合及投資組合。支持組合持有流通性極高的美元資產，按照貨幣發行局制度的規定為貨幣基礎提供十足支持。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員經濟體的債市及股市，以保障資產的價值及長期購買力。\n\n為能更妥善管理風險及提高中長期回報，金管局以審慎及循序漸進方式將外匯基金的部分資產配置於較多元化的資產類別，包括新興巿場及內地債券與股票、私募股權（包括基建）及房地產。新興巿場及內地債券與股票由投資組合持有，私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合持有。長期增長組合的目標資產配置與其他資產類別的配置，按審慎的風險管理原則及資產組合多元化策略一起制定。\n\n策略性資產組合於2007年設立，一直持有政府基於策略性目的而為外匯基金帳目購入的香港交易及結算所有限公司股份。由於這個組合性質獨特，因此外匯基金的投資表現評估並無將其包括在內。\n\n# 於外匯基金的存款\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定組織的存款，利率一般與投資組合的表現掛鈎，但未來基金屬主要個別例子，其存款的利率與投資組合及長期增長組合的回報掛鈎，利率視乎實際資產配置而定。於2024年，投資組合與長期增長組合在未來基金的目標資產配置約為35：65。\n\n# 投資程序\n\n外匯基金的投資程序分別以策略性資產配置及戰略性資產配置作基礎。策略性資產配置以投資基準方式反映，亦即外匯基金為達到投資目標而可作出的長線資產配置。外匯基金以策略性配置作為指引，透過戰略性的資產配置，以爭取超越基準的回報。因此，實際配置往往會與基準配置（亦即策略性配置）有所偏離，而實際與基準配置之間的差距稱為「戰略性偏離」。財政司司長經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後制定投資基準及循跡誤差限額，金管局獲授權決定戰略性資產配置及定出戰略性偏離的容許範圍。投資組合經理可在戰略性偏離的容許範圍內管理倉盤，從短期市場變化中獲利。\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局的外匯基金投資辦公室專責外匯基金的投資及相關風險管理職能。該辦公室職員負責直接管理外匯基金約70%的投資，包括整個支持組合及部分投資組合。該部分內部管理的投資組合包括環球定息市場投資，並透過不同的衍生工具執行外匯基金的宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 外聘投資經理\n\n除透過內部職員管理資產外，金管局亦僱用外聘投資經理負責管理外匯基金約30%的資產，包括所有上市股票組合及其他特別資產類別。僱用外聘投資經理的目的是要運用市場上最佳的專業投資專才為外匯基金投資，獲取可持續回報，並讓外匯基金受惠於多元化及互補的投資方式，以及汲取外聘投資經理的市場心得與專門的投資知識。\n\n僱用外聘投資經理的相關支出包括基金管理與託管費、交易費、預扣稅及其他稅項。這些支出主要受市場因素影響而每年不同。\n\n# 風險管理及監察\n\n投資環境越趨複雜，穩健的風險管理更見重要。金管局為內部及外聘投資經理所管理的投資組合均訂下嚴格管控措施及投資指引，並設立嚴謹的風險監察及合規制度。金管局為投資相關活動設有三重防線，以實施有效的風險管理及管治。金管局定期監察主要投資風險類別（包括信用、市場、流動性及業務操作風險），並設置風險管理程序，為策略性規劃及多元化投資工作提供穩健的框架。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n金管局相信適度強調負責任投資及投資的可持續長期表現，可更有效達致外匯基金的投資目標，並且減低投資活動涉及的環境、社會及管治(ESG)相關風險。為積極支持負責任投資，金管局已將ESG因素融入外匯基金的投資管理過程中，其指導性原則是：當ESG投資與其他投資項目的經風險調整長期收益相若時，一般會優先考慮ESG投資。有關金管局在負責任投資方面的工作，詳見《二零二四年可持續發展報告》之「負責任投資」一章。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2024年的金融市場\n\n2024年環球金融市場表現大致良好。\n\n主要股票市場於2024年升幅顯著，當中美國股市在經濟和通脹基調大致向好和人工智能熱潮背景下，首三季升幅尤其突出。不過第4季市況因憂慮通脹升溫及債息上升等而變得波動並從高位回落，投資者亦轉趨審慎。內地和香港股市方面，受惠於中央在第3季出台的一系列刺激經濟和股市的政策措施，投資者信心有所好轉。然而市場認為實體經濟增長依然不明朗的情況下，兩地股市於第4季回軟。\n\n環球債券市場在2024年的表現亦有較大波動。儘管主要央行大致確立減息的大方向，但減息的節奏和幅度年內出現多次轉變。及至第4季，市場開始注視美國2025年的財政政策，美國國債收益率季內大幅上升，債價受壓。\n\n貨幣市場方面，美元兌其他主要貨幣於2024年，特別是第4季，因為息口走勢和美國經濟表現相對強勁而走強。\n\n表1列載主要貨幣、債巿及股市在2024年的表現。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n外匯基金在2024年錄得2,188億港元的投資收入，其中包括：\n\n- 債券投資收益1,359億港元；\n- 股票投資收益909億港元（其中香港股票投資收益218億港元，其他股票的投資收益691億港元）；\n- 非港元資產外匯估值下調356億港元；及\n- 外匯基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資收益276億港元。\n\n另一方面，策略性資產組合錄得28億港元估值收益。\n\n於2024年底，外匯基金的資產總值達40,810億港元。長期增長組合投資的總市值為5,412億港元，其中私募股權為4,348億港元，房地產為1,064億港元。長期增長組合中已承擔但尚未提取作投資的總額為2,886億港元。\n\n外匯基金（不包括策略性資產組合）在2024年的投資回報率為5.2%，其中投資組合的回報率為7.2%，支持組合為4.1%。長期增長組合自2009年開展投資以來的年率化內部回報率為11.2%。\n\n圖1列明外匯基金由1994至2024年的年度回報率。表2顯示外匯基金在2024年的投資回報率及不同年期的平均投資回報率。外匯基金在2022至2024年的平均回報率為2.0%、2020至2024年為3.1%、2015至2024年為3.1%，以及自1994年起計為4.5%。表3列載外匯基金資產於2024年12月31日的貨幣比重。詳情參閱第203至309頁外匯基金的經審計2024年度財務報表。\n\n圖1

Major economies recorded stable growth, while inflation fell to levels closer to policy targets. Several major central banks successively lowered policy rates, thereby creating a favourable investment environment. For the whole of 2024, the Exchange Fund recorded investment income of HK$218.8 billion, with an investment return of 5.2%.\n\n# Exchange Fund\n\nUnder the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the primary purpose of the Exchange Fund is to influence the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar directly or indirectly. It can also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems, thereby preserving Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre. The HKMA is accountable to the Financial Secretary for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund under the powers delegated and sub-delegated by the Financial Secretary.\n\n# Management of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(i) to safeguard capital;\n(ii) to ensure that the overall monetary base is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar assets at all times;\n(iii) to ensure that liquidity is sufficient to maintain monetary and financial stability; and\n(iv) to achieve investment returns, within the constraints of (i) to (iii) above, in order to preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Exchange Fund.\n\nThese objectives fully take into account the statutory purpose of the Exchange Fund and are reflected in the Fund’s portfolio structure and target asset allocation (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 Categories of the Exchange Fund’s investment portfolio\n\nThe Exchange Fund is broadly divided into two main portfolios: the Backing Portfolio and the Investment Portfolio. The Backing Portfolio holds highly liquid US dollar assets to fully back the monetary base in accordance with the requirements of the Currency Board system. The Investment Portfolio primarily invests in the bond and equity markets of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) member economies to preserve the value of assets and their long-term purchasing power.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance medium- to long-term returns, the HKMA has prudently and progressively allocated some of the Exchange Fund’s assets to more diversified asset classes, including emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure) and real estate. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held by the Investment Portfolio, while private equity and real estate investments are held by the Long-Term Growth Portfolio. The target asset allocation of the Long-Term Growth Portfolio and other asset classes is formulated together in accordance with prudent risk management principles and portfolio diversification strategies.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio was established in 2007 and has been holding shares of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited purchased by the Government for strategic purposes on behalf of the Exchange Fund’s account. Due to its unique nature, this portfolio is not included in the assessment of the Exchange Fund’s investment performance.\n\n# Deposits with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund accepts deposits from time to time from fiscal reserves, government funds and statutory bodies. Interest rates are generally linked to the performance of the Investment Portfolio, but the Future Fund is a major exception. Its deposit interest rate is linked to the returns of the Investment Portfolio and the Long-Term Growth Portfolio, depending on the actual asset allocation. In 2024, the target asset allocation of the Investment Portfolio and the Long-Term Growth Portfolio in the Future Fund was approximately 35:65.\n\n# Investment process\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s investment process is based on both strategic asset allocation and tactical asset allocation. Strategic asset allocation is reflected in the investment benchmark, which represents the long-term asset allocation that the Exchange Fund can make to achieve its investment objectives. The Exchange Fund uses strategic allocation as a guide and employs tactical asset allocation to achieve returns above the benchmark. Therefore, actual allocations often deviate from the benchmark allocation (i.e. the strategic allocation), and the difference between the actual and benchmark allocations is called a “tactical deviation”. The Financial Secretary, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, sets the investment benchmark and tracking error limits, while the HKMA is authorised to determine the tactical asset allocation and set the permissible range for tactical deviations. Portfolio managers can manage positions within the permissible range of tactical deviations to profit from short-term market changes.\n\n# Direct investment\n\nThe Exchange Fund Investment Office of the HKMA is responsible for the investment and related risk management functions of the Exchange Fund. The staff of the office are responsible for directly managing about 70% of the Exchange Fund’s investments, including the entire Backing Portfolio and part of the Investment Portfolio. This internally managed portion of the portfolio includes global fixed-income market investments and implements the Exchange Fund’s macro risk management strategies through various derivative instruments.\n\n# External fund managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets through internal staff, the HKMA also employs external fund managers to manage about 30% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all listed equity portfolios and other special asset classes. The purpose of employing external fund managers is to utilise the best professional investment expertise available in the market to invest the Exchange Fund’s assets and achieve sustainable returns, as well as to enable the Exchange Fund to benefit from diversified and complementary investment approaches and to learn from the market insights and specialised investment knowledge of external fund managers.\n\nThe expenses associated with employing external fund managers include fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, withholding taxes and other taxes. These expenses vary from year to year, mainly due to market factors.\n\n# Risk management and monitoring\n\nAs the investment environment becomes increasingly complex, robust risk management is even more important. The HKMA has established strict control measures and investment guidelines for portfolios managed by both internal and external fund managers, as well as a rigorous risk monitoring and compliance system. The HKMA has established three lines of defence for investment-related activities to implement effective risk management and governance. The HKMA regularly monitors major investment risk categories (including credit, market, liquidity and operational risks) and establishes risk management procedures to provide a robust framework for strategic planning and diversified investment efforts.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nThe HKMA believes that placing appropriate emphasis on responsible investment and the sustainable long-term economic performance of investments can more effectively achieve the Exchange Fund’s investment objectives and reduce environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks associated with investment activities. To actively support responsible investment, the HKMA has integrated ESG factors into the investment management process of the Exchange Fund, with the guiding principle that ESG investments will generally be prioritised when their risk-adjusted long-term returns are comparable to those of other investment projects. For more information on the HKMA’s work on responsible investment, please refer to the “Responsible Investment” chapter of the Sustainability Report 2024.\n\n# Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Financial markets in 2024\n\nGlobal financial markets performed well overall in 2024.\n\nMajor equity markets recorded significant gains in 2024, with US equities performing particularly strongly in the first three quarters, driven by a generally positive economic and inflation outlook and an artificial intelligence boom. However, market conditions became volatile in the fourth quarter due to concerns about rising inflation and bond yields, causing equities to retreat from their highs and investors to become more cautious. Mainland and Hong Kong equities benefited from a series of policy measures introduced by the central government in the third quarter to stimulate the economy and the stock market, which improved investor confidence. However, as market participants believed that real economic growth remained uncertain, equities in both markets weakened in the fourth quarter.\n\nGlobal bond markets also experienced significant volatility in 2024. Although major central banks had largely established a direction of interest rate cuts, the pace and magnitude of cuts changed several times during the year. By the fourth quarter, the market began to focus on US fiscal policy in 2025, and US Treasury yields rose sharply during the quarter, putting pressure on bond prices.\n\nIn the currency markets, the US dollar strengthened against other major currencies in 2024, particularly in the fourth quarter, due to interest rate trends and the relatively strong performance of the US economy.\n\nTable 1 shows the performance of major currencies, bond markets and equity markets in 2024.\n\n# Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded investment income of HK$218.8 billion in 2024, which included:\n\n- bond investment income of HK$135.9 billion;\n- equity investment income of HK$90.9 billion (of which HK$21.8 billion was from Hong Kong equity investments and HK$69.1 billion from other equity investments);\n- a foreign exchange valuation loss of HK$35.6 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets; and\n- other investment income of HK$27.6 billion held by the Exchange Fund’s investment-holding subsidiaries.\n\nOn the other hand, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$2.8 billion.\n\nAt the end of 2024, the total assets of the Exchange Fund amounted to HK$40,810 billion. The total market value of the Long-Term Growth Portfolio’s investments was HK$5,412 billion, of which private equity accounted for HK$4,348 billion and real estate for HK$1,064 billion. The total amount committed but not yet drawn down for investment in the Long-Term Growth Portfolio was HK$2,886 billion.\n\nThe Exchange Fund (excluding the Strategic Portfolio) achieved an investment return of 5.2% in 2024, with the Investment Portfolio returning 7.2% and the Backing Portfolio returning 4.1%. The annualised internal rate of return of the Long-Term Growth Portfolio since the commencement of investment in 2009 was 11.2%.\n\nFigure 1 shows the annual returns of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2024. Table 2 shows the investment returns of the Exchange Fund in 2024 and the average investment returns over different periods. The Exchange Fund’s average return was 2.0% from 2022 to 2024, 3.1% from 2020 to 2024, 3.1% from 2015 to 2024, and 4.5% since 1994.

(HKMA), maintains high transparency and accountability, and delivers excellent efficiency and professionalism. To enhance public understanding of the HKMA’s policies and work, the HKMA actively engages with the wider community and market participants through traditional and social media, its website, the HKMA Information Centre, and other channels.\n\nInternally, the HKMA is committed to building a flexible and professional workforce, while adhering to strict financial discipline and enhancing digital capabilities to respond to changes and ensure effective implementation of policies and measures.\n\n# Maintaining Transparency\n\n# Media Relations and Social Media Applications\n\nThe HKMA maintains close contact with the media to enhance transparency and improve public understanding of its policies and operations. In 2024, the HKMA organised or participated in 207 events, including 14 press conferences, four media briefings, 14 stand-up interviews, and 175 other public events. To enhance public understanding of the HKMA’s key functions, it organised press conferences and media briefings for local, mainland, and overseas media, covering topics such as tokenisation, anti-scam initiatives, and support measures for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). During the year, the HKMA also arranged 25 media interviews, issued around 600 bilingual press releases, and handled a large number of daily media enquiries.\n\nChief Executive Mr Eddie Yue gave a stand-up interview to the media at Hong Kong FinTech Week 2024.\n\nDeputy Chief Executive Mr Darryl Chan delivered a welcome speech at the Interbank Account Data Sharing Showroom Day.\n\nMedia representatives actively participated in events organised by the HKMA in 2024, particularly the third Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit.

The HKMA creates creative social media content to raise public awareness of a range of issues and initiatives, such as anti-scam measures, fintech innovation, green and sustainable finance, support for SMEs, and major events organised by the HKMA.

As of the end of 2024, it had launched a total of 177 sets of Open APIs on the website as planned. For more details about the HKMA’s Open APIs, please visit the HKMA Open API Portal (https:\/\/apidocs.hkma.gov.hk).\n\n# Information Centre\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre, located on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre, consists of an exhibition gallery and a library. Its purpose is to introduce the HKMA’s work to the public and enhance public understanding of monetary and banking matters. The exhibition gallery introduces the HKMA’s work and the development of Hong Kong’s currency and banking system in an interactive manner, and provides materials and exhibits for research on Hong Kong’s currency, banking, and financial affairs.\n\nDuring the year, the Information Centre received over 68,000 visitors, an increase of about 120% compared to 2023. The Information Centre also provided over 570 guided tours for schools and other groups.\n\nAdjacent to the exhibition gallery, the library houses over 26,000 books, journals, and other publications covering topics such as Hong Kong’s currency, banking, finance, and central banking. The library also holds the “Register of Authorised Institutions and Local Representative Offices” and the “Register of Securities Staff of Authorised Institutions” maintained under Section 20 of the Banking Ordinance for public inspection.\n\nKindergarten students participated in a guided tour at the Information Centre to learn about the design of Hong Kong banknotes.\n\nInformation Centre staff introduced a mosaic artwork made of Hong Kong coins depicting the Victoria Harbour scenery to visitors.\n\n# Community Engagement and Public Education\n\nTo enhance public understanding of the HKMA’s work, the HKMA has been organising public education seminars since 1998, with over 68,000 participants to date. In 2024, it held online seminars that attracted over 800 teachers and students from 41 secondary schools. The seminars covered topics such as an introduction to the HKMA’s work, the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, anti-scam measures, the Deposit Protection Scheme, green finance, and career opportunities in the banking industry.\n\nThe HKMA uses various channels to engage and educate the public on how to be smart and responsible financial services consumers. In 2024, its activities attracted over 67,000 participants.\n\nIn line with the trend of digital payments and green living, the HKMA promoted the use of electronic red packets during the Lunar New Year through social media and radio broadcasts, and also encouraged the use of good-as-new banknotes for physical red packets.\n\nAn animation was produced to encourage the use of electronic red packets.\n\n# Anti-scam song – “Link咪亂撳”\n\nTo further strengthen anti-scam efforts, the HKMA released an anti-scam song performed by singer Jackson Wan Kwong and HKMA Deputy Chief Executive Mr Edmond Ngan, reminding the public “Don’t trust fake links, don’t let people scam you”, and to safeguard their sensitive personal and credit card information. The cross-media campaign was well-received and won international recognition.\n\nDeputy Chief Executive Mr Edmond Ngan (right) participated in the performance of the anti-scam song.\n\nThe cross-media campaign raised public awareness of anti-scam measures.\n\n# “New Opportunities for Cross-border Wealth Management” TV series\n\nThe HKMA collaborated with a local TV station to produce a TV series titled “New Opportunities for Cross-border Wealth Management” to help the public better understand the opportunities and convenience that the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) Scheme in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) brings to retail investors in cross-boundary investment. The series used “classic scenes” from five popular Hong Kong movies to explain the framework of the Cross-boundary WMC, investor eligibility requirements, the products offered by the Northbound Scheme and Southbound Scheme, risk management, and matters to note for cross-boundary investment. It was promoted through TV, digital, and social media platforms.\n\nThe series introduced the Cross-boundary WMC in a humorous and entertaining way.\n\n# Hong Kong Financial Literacy Championship\n\nTo enhance financial literacy among secondary school students, the HKMA collaborated with various organisations to organise the Hong Kong Financial Literacy Championship. In 2024, the event celebrated its 10th anniversary with the theme “Next-gen Finance”, aiming to help secondary school students understand early on the developments and future trends of innovation, fintech, artificial intelligence, and to promote the adoption of environmental, social and governance principles for sustainable development.\n\nThe first part of the Championship was an online quiz competition to test participants’ financial knowledge and understanding of popular financial topics. In 2024, a record-breaking 32,000 students from 290 secondary schools participated in the online quiz. Between 2015 and 2024, students from 440 secondary schools participated in the online quiz segment of the Championship around 125,000 times. The second part of the Championship, the Young Financial Talent Runway, was conducted in a mentorship format, with experienced professionals from different fields serving as mentors to train students for the Design Thinking Challenge. In 2024, this part of the Championship also featured a GBA Invitation Match to promote interaction and exchange among students from Hong Kong, Macau, and the mainland.\n\nDeputy Chief Executive Mr Brian Chan delivered a welcome speech at the Championship finals and cheered for the finalists.\n\nStudents participating in the Young Financial Talent Runway met with their mentors.\n\n# Educational board game\n\nThe HKMA launched its first financial education board game, $mart Money Management 321, in 2023, and continued to promote it in 2024 to raise awareness of this original board game and enhance its use as an educational tool. The game allows primary school students to learn about different payment methods, basic financial concepts, fintech, and cyber security in a simulated environment.\n\nAt the community level, the HKMA set up a booth at the 2024 Hong Kong Book Fair, organised workshops in the community during Christmas and the Lunar New Year, and held parent-child workshops at its office to further promote financial and money management concepts. It also arranged school visits for primary school students to try out the game and organised train-the-trainer workshops to encourage secondary school teachers to use the board game as teaching material in the financial education module of the newly established junior secondary subject “Citizenship, Economics and Society”. The board game was recognised by the Education Bureau as an excellent teaching tool and was used as a prize for winning schools in the 2023\/24 Financial Education School Award Scheme. In 2024, the HKMA organised around 40 board game workshops, attracting over 3,600 participants, including students, parents, teachers, and social workers.\n\nBased on the experience of developing the $mart Money Management 321 board game, the HKMA launched a strategy board game called Corporate Green Transformation, which was given away as a souvenir at its 2024 Hong Kong Book Fair booth. This is the first board game in Hong Kong that teaches students about green finance.\n\nIn addition, the HKMA continues to support the work of the Investor and Financial Education Council to enhance financial knowledge and money management skills among Hong Kong citizens, and will explore further collaboration with different stakeholders to improve the effectiveness of community engagement efforts.\n\nFinancial education is promoted to teachers, children, and parents through board game activities.\n\n# Financial Disclosure\n\nTo maintain high transparency, the HKMA adopts international financial disclosure standards applicable to central bank operations, including the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard. The Finance Division prepares the financial statements of the Exchange Fund in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards with the assistance of independent auditors and other accounting professionals. In addition, the HKMA provides detailed disclosure and in-depth analysis of budget and expenditure information in its Annual Report (please refer to the section on “Budgeting and Financial Control” on pages 193 to 194)."}
{"zh":"# 外匯基金\n\n- 審計署署長報告\n- 外匯基金財務報表\n\n# 審計署署長報告\n\n# 香港特別行政區政府審璚計毐署\n\n# 獨立審計師報告致財政司司長\n\n# 意見\n\n茲證明我已審計列載於第209至309頁外匯基金及其附屬公司（「集團」）的財務報表，該等財務報表包括外匯基金及集團於2024年12月31日的資產負債表與截至該日止年度的收支帳目、全面收益表、權益變動表和現金流量表，以及財務報表的附註，包括重大會計政策資料。\n\n我認為，該等財務報表已按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告會計準則》真實而中肯地反映外匯基金及集團於2024年12月31日的財務狀況及截至該日止年度的財務表現和現金流量，並已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》（第66章）第7條下所發出的指示妥為擬備。\n\n# 意見的基礎\n\n我已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示及審計署的審計準則進行審計。我根據該等準則而須承擔的責任，詳載於本報告「審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任」部分。根據該等準則，我獨立於集團，並已按該等準則履行其他道德責任。我相信，我所獲得的審計憑證是充足和適當地為我的審計意見提供基礎。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項是根據我的專業判斷，對截至2024年12月31日止年度財務報表的審計最為重要的事項。我對整體財務報表進行審計及形成意見時處理了這些事項，而我不會對這些事項提供單獨的意見。\n\n# 按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.5、2.6及37.1。\n\n於2024年12月31日，集團按公平值列帳的金融資產共 39,151.17 億港元，金融負債共 13,862.99 億港元。\n\n86%的該等金融資產及所有該等金融負債的公平值為相同資產或負債於活躍市場的報價（第1級參數），或是以估值方法估計，而所用的參數是以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第2級參數）。\n\n其餘14%的該等金融資產的公平值，是以估值方法估計，而所用的參數並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第3級參數）。有關金融資產共5,522.51億港元，主要包括非上市投資基金。\n\n鑑於所涉數額龐大及涉及估計，按公平值列帳的金 融資產及金融負債的估值屬關鍵審計事項。\n\n就按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值，審計程序包括：\n\n- 了解不同類別金融資產及金融負債的估值程序，包括相關監控措施；\n\n- 評價及測試監控措施，包括電腦系統的相關應用程式監控措施；\n\n- 就金融資產及金融負債的估值、存在、權利與責任及完整性取得函證；\n\n- 若使用市場報價，根據獨立來源核實價格；\n\n- 若所用估值方法的參數是以可觀察市場數據為基礎，評價估值方法是否適合及有關假設是否合理，以及根據獨立來源核實參數；及\n\n- 若所用估值方法的參數並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎，評價估值方法是否適合，以及有關假設與參數是否合理。\n\n# 按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.11、17及18。\n\n集團的投資物業按公平值列帳，於2024年12月31日共值211.32億港元。集團亦於聯營公司及合營公司擁有權益，該等公司主要業務為持有海外投資物業。不論是由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有，該等投資物業的公平值均主要根據獨立專業估值師的估值釐定。該等估值涉及重大判斷及估計，包括所用的估值方法及假設。\n\n就按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值，審計程序包括：\n\n- 獲取及審視由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有的投資物業的估值報告，並核實公平值是根據有關估值報告所列的估值釐定；\n\n- 評估估值師的獨立性及資歷；及\n\n- 評價估值方法是否適合，以及有關假設與參數是否合理。\n\n# 其他資料\n\n金融管理專員須對其他資料負責。其他資料包括金融管理局2024年年報內的所有資料，但不包括財務報表及我的審計師報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見並不涵蓋其他資料，我亦不對其他資料發表任何形式的鑒證結論。\n\n就財務報表審計而言，我有責任閱讀其他資料，從而考慮其他資料是否與財務報表或我在審計過程中得悉的情況有重大矛盾，或者似乎存有重大錯誤陳述。基於我已執行的工作，如果我認為其他資料存有重大錯誤陳述，我需要報告該事實。在這方面，我沒有任何報告。\n\n# 金融管理專員及外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會就財務報表而須承擔的責任\n\n金融管理專員須負責按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告會計準則》及行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示擬備真實而中肯的財務報表，及落實其認為必要的內部控制， 使財務報表不存有因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在擬備財務報表時，金融管理專員須負責評估集團持續經營的能力，以及在適用情況下披露與持續經營有關的事項，並以持續經營作為會計基礎。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會負責監督集團的財務報告過程。\n\n# 審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任\n\n我的目標是就整體財務報表是否不存有任何因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述取得合理保證，並發出包括我意見的審計師報告。合理保證是高水平的保證，但不能確保按審計署審計準則進行的審計定能發現所存有的任何重大錯誤陳述。錯誤陳述可以由欺詐或錯誤引起，如果合理預期它們個別或滙總起來可能影響財務報表使用者所作出的經濟決定，則會被視作重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在根據審計署審計準則進行審計的過程中，我會運用專業判斷並秉持專業懷疑態度。我亦會：\n\n- 識別和評估因欺詐或錯誤而導致財務報表存有重大錯誤陳述的風險；設計及執行審計程序以應對這些風險；以及取得充足和適當的審計憑證，作為我意見的基礎。由於欺詐可能涉及串謀、偽造、蓄意遺漏、虛假陳述，或凌駕內部控制的情況，因此未能發現因欺詐而導致重大錯誤陳述的風險，較未能發現因錯誤而導致者為高；\n\n- 了解與審計相關的內部控制，以設計適當的審計程序。然而，此舉並非旨在對集團內部控制的有效性發表意見；\n\n- 評價金融管理專員所採用的會計政策是否恰當，以及其作出的會計估計和相關資料披露是否合理；\n\n- 判定金融管理專員以持續經營作為會計基礎的做法是否恰當，並根據所得的審計憑證，判定是否存在與事件或情況有關，而且可能對集團持續經營的能力構成重大疑慮的重大不確定性。如果我認為存在重大不確定性，則有必要在審計師報告中請使用者留意財務報表中的相關資料披露。假若所披露的相關資料不足，我便須發出非無保留意見的審計師報告。我的結論是基於截至審計師報告日止所取得的審計憑證。然而，未來事件或情況可能導致集團不能繼續持續經營；\n\n- 評價財務報表的整體列報方式、結構和內容，包括披露資料，以及財務報表是否中肯反映交易和事項；及\n\n-計劃並執行集團審計，以就集團中實體或業務單位的財務資料獲取充足和適當的審計憑證，作為對財務報表形成意見的基礎。我負責指導、監督和審視為進行集團審計而履行的審計工作。我對我的審計意見承擔全部責任。\n\n我會與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通計劃的審計範圍和時間以及重大審計發現等事項，包括我在審計期間識別出內部控制的任何重大缺陷。\n\n我亦會向外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會提交聲明，說明我已符合有關獨立性的相關道德要求，並與他們溝通所有被合理認為可能會影響我獨立性的關係和其他事項，以及在適用的情況下，相關的防範措施。\n\n從與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通的事項中，我會決定哪些事項對本期財務報表的審計最為重要，因而構成關鍵審計事項。我會在審計師報告中描述這些事項，除非法律法規不允許對某件事項作出公開披露，或在極端罕見的情況下，因為有合理預期在我報告中溝通某事項而造成的負面後果將會超過其產生的公眾利益而我決定不應在報告中溝通該事項。\n\n# 外匯基金 – 財務報表附註\n\n（除特別註明外，所有金額均以港幣百萬元位列示。）\n\n# 1 主要業務\n\n金融管理專員根據財政司司長以外匯基金（基金）管理人身分授予的權力，按照《外匯基金條例》（第66章）的條文管理基金。基金的主要業務為捍衛港元匯率及維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定健全。\n\n基金的資產分作四個不同的組合來管理：支持組合、投資組合、長期增長組合及策略性資產組合。根據香港的貨幣發行局制度，支持組合的資產與貨幣基礎完全相配。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債券及股票市場。長期增長組合持有私募股權及房地產投資。策略性資產組合持有香港特別行政區（香港特區）政府為策略目的而購入，並列入基金的帳目內的香港交易及結算所有限公司的股票。經營分部資料載於附註31。\n","terms":{"$mart理財321":["$mart

My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the “Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements” section of my report. I am independent of the Group in accordance with these standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities under them. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.\n\n# Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2024. These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.5, 2.6 and 37.1 to the financial statements.\n\nAs at 31 December 2024, the Group’s financial assets measured at fair value totalled HKD 39,151.17 billion, and its financial liabilities totalled HKD 13,862.99 billion.\n\nThe fair values of 86% of these financial assets and all of these financial liabilities were quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 inputs), or were estimated using valuation techniques whose inputs were based on observable market data (Level 2 inputs).\n\nThe fair values of the remaining 14% of these financial assets were estimated using valuation techniques whose inputs were not based on observable market data (Level 3 inputs). These financial assets totalled HKD 5,522.51 billion and mainly comprised unlisted investment funds.\n\nThe valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value is a key audit matter given the significant amounts involved and the estimation required.\n\nThe audit procedures I performed in relation to the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value included the following:\n\n- Understanding the valuation processes for different categories of financial assets and financial liabilities, including related control measures;\n\n- Evaluating and testing control measures, including relevant application controls in computer systems;\n\n- Obtaining confirmations on the valuation, existence, rights and obligations, and completeness of financial assets and financial liabilities;\n\n- Verifying prices against independent sources when market quotations were used;\n\n- Evaluating whether the valuation techniques used were appropriate and whether the assumptions used were reasonable when the inputs used in the valuation techniques were based on observable market data, and verifying the inputs against independent sources; and\n\n- Evaluating whether the valuation techniques used were appropriate and whether the assumptions and inputs used were reasonable when the inputs used in the valuation techniques were not based on observable market data.\n\n# Valuation of investment properties measured at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.11, 17 and 18 to the financial statements.\n\nThe Group’s investment properties were measured at fair value and totalled HKD 211.32 billion as at 31 December 2024. The Group also had interests in associates and joint ventures whose principal activities were holding overseas investment properties. The fair values of these investment properties, whether held directly by the Group or by associates or joint ventures, were primarily determined based on valuations by independent professional valuers. These valuations involved significant judgement and estimation, including the valuation techniques and assumptions used.\n\nThe audit procedures I performed in relation to the valuation of investment properties measured at fair value included the following:\n\n- Obtaining and reviewing valuation reports for investment properties held directly by the Group or by associates or joint ventures, and verifying that the fair values were determined based on the valuations set out in those reports;\n\n- Assessing the independence and qualifications of the valuers; and\n\n- Evaluating whether the valuation techniques used were appropriate and whether the assumptions and inputs used were reasonable.\n\n# Other Information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises all information in the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s 2024 Annual Report, but does not include the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information, and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, I am responsible for reading the other information and considering whether it is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained during the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee in relation to the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for preparing financial statements that present fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with the HKFRS Accounting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the directions given by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for implementing such internal control as it determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the auditing standards of the Audit Commission will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with the auditing standards of the Audit Commission, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. I also:\n\n- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n\n- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.\n\n- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the Monetary Authority and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority.\n\n- Conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n\n- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\n- Plan and perform an audit of the Group in order to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence about the financial information of the entities or business units within the Group to form an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for directing, supervising and performing the audit work necessary to perform an audit of the Group. I am solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide a statement to the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and the related safeguards, if applicable.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements for the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n# Exchange Fund – Notes to the Financial Statements\n\n(All amounts are expressed in millions of Hong Kong dollars unless otherwise stated.)\n\n# 1 Principal Activities\n\nThe Monetary Authority manages the Exchange Fund (the Fund) under the powers delegated by the Financial Secretary as the Fund’s manager, in accordance with the provisions of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66). The Fund’s principal activities are to defend the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate and to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems.\n\nThe Fund’s assets are managed in four distinct portfolios: the Backing Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio and the Strategic Portfolio. Under Hong Kong’s Currency Board system, the assets of the Backing Portfolio fully match the Monetary Base. The Investment Portfolio is primarily invested in the bond and equity markets of OECD countries. The Long-Term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments. The Strategic Portfolio holds shares of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited purchased by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region for strategic purposes and recorded in the Fund’s accounts.

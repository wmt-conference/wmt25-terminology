{"zh":"2022年是迎難而上的一年。\n\n2022年伊始，全球經濟環境一片暗淡。新冠病毒變異株Omicron肆虐，令全球經濟增長繼續受壓，通脹壓力亦持續上升。其後俄羅斯與烏克蘭爆發衝突，進一步推高通脹壓力，導致各主要央行採取前置式貨幣緊縮政策，擴大環球金融市場的波動，並加劇經濟增長放緩的風險。本地方面，第五波疫情爆發，感染個案急速上升，亦進一步打擊經濟。同時，圍繞防疫措施與檢疫限制的負面報道，更令外界對香港產生誤解，威脅香港作為國際金融中心的聲譽。全年計，香港實質本地生產總值收縮了3.5%。\n\n儘管面對重重挑戰，金管局繼續致力保障香港貨幣與金融穩定，並於主要策略範疇推進多項有利發展的措施，進一步鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位。經歷3年的旅遊限制後，我們成功向國際社會展示香港已全面復常，旅客亦能再次親身訪港體驗。金管局在去年11月舉辦「國際金融領袖投資峰會」，來自世界各地的金融領袖親身來港出席。外界如此熱烈的反應，成為印證香港全面復常最好不過的證明。\n\n展望未來，外圍環境仍然充滿前所未有的不確定性。儘管如此，內地經濟重啟會為香港以至整個地區重新注入動力。金管局將繼續緊守崗位，履行維持香港貨幣與銀行體系穩定的職能，並積極尋求更多有利香港發展的機會，展現及提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。我們亦會繼續為提升全球氣候應變能力及可持續發展出力。今年除《二零二二年年報》外，我們會另外發表《二零二二年可持續發展報告》，以便更詳細地介紹金管局在提升香港作為綠色和可持續金融樞紐的地位所進行的各項工作，以及金管局作為負責任投資者及可持續機構所作出的努力。\n\n# 貨幣及金融體系：堅穩如昔\n\n聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）自1983年實施至今，歷經多個經濟周期，成功抵禦各種各樣的外來衝擊。2022年再次見證聯匯制度的抗震能力。在美國聯邦儲備局（聯儲局）大幅收緊貨幣政策下，弱方兌換保證於2022年5月至11月期間被觸發41次，金管局按照既定機制，以有序及具透明度的方式從市場買入合共2,421億港元。其間港元匯率及貨幣市場繼續運作暢順，反映聯匯制度穩健有效。\n\n這份對聯匯制度的信心，來自於建立多年的穩固根基。正如國際貨幣基金組織在其《2022年對外部門報告》中重申，聯匯制度的公信力建基於多項因素，包括具高透明度的運作規則、充裕的外匯儲備、審慎的財政制度、穩健的金融監管，以及靈活的經濟結構。\n\n我們深信除了穩健的機制外，致力與公眾及市場溝通以加深其對聯匯制度的了解、進行有效的市場監察，以及就不同情景作出應變計劃，均有助鞏固各界對聯匯制度的信心。我們就聯匯制度運作機制推出的社交媒體宣傳活動，有助在年內弱方兌換保證多次被觸發的情況下，有效維護市場對聯匯制度的信心。內部方面，金管局亦善用數據分析技術加強市場監察，讓我們能適時回應最新市場形勢。\n\n年內，儘管面對宏觀層面的挑戰以及遞增的信用風險，香港銀行體系仍然維持穩健，資本及流動性均非常充裕。2022年底，本地銀行的綜合總資本充足比率為20.1%，遠高於國際最低要求的8%。2022年第4季，大型銀行的流動性覆蓋比率稍升至162.3%，亦遠高於法定最低要求的100%。鑑於信貸環境面對挑戰，銀行體系的資產質素略為轉差，特定分類貸款比率於2022年底升至1.38%，但有關水平仍屬穩健，並低於2000年以來的長期平均水平1.8%。\n\n# 銀行體系：有效監管確保運作穩健\n\n疫情持續3年，來自各方面的挑戰均有所加劇，例如地緣政治緊張局勢升溫及主要央行收緊貨幣政策。然而，全賴多年來妥善的風險管理及有效的監管，香港銀行體系得以維持穩健，繼續發揮支持經濟的重要作用。\n\n過去一年面對的一項主要監管挑戰，是在第五波新冠疫情後經濟仍充滿不確定性之下，確保銀行繼續為客戶提供所需支援的同時，維持穩健的信用風險管理。「預先批核還息不還本」計劃進一步展期，並加入自願性部分本金還款選項，讓借款人可以選擇開始償還部分本金，協助客戶就最終回復正常還款作好準備。\n\n因應主要經濟體大幅收緊貨幣政策令市場波動加劇，2022年金管局另一項主要監管工作是加強監察銀行的市場及流動性風險承擔。我們深入評估各經濟體同步收緊貨幣政策對銀行可能產生的影響，並就壓力測試引入新情景，以評估銀行應對長時間流動性壓力的韌性。\n\n與此同時，我們繼續採取具前瞻性的措施，促進在多個範疇的有效風險管理。在運作穩健性及網絡防衛能力方面，我們提供指引協助銀行制定綜合及全面的運作架構，以達致穩健經營，並就銀行具體的運作範疇提供詳盡監管指引，例如因應雲端技術普及而就使用雲端運算提供指引。此外，因應數碼化加速發展，我們亦加強了應對「網絡釣魚」騙案和推進消費者及投資者保障的工作。\n\n除了維持銀行體系穩健外，金管局亦致力推動普及金融及提高銀行服務的便利性。銀行對於金管局就提供基本銀行服務的呼籲反應正面，有銀行在新發展地區的大型公共屋邨增設分行及自助銀行服務設施。受到疫情相關的旅遊限制影響，許多香港市民無法使用其內地銀行戶口。有見及此，金管局與有關各方緊密合作，協助重新啓動約50萬個內地銀行戶口，受影響戶口持有人無需親身前往內地辦理。\n\n另一個對銀行業持續發展具策略重要性的範疇是提升專業能力。為擴展業務，銀行業對專業人才的需求仍然龐大。金管局在其人才發展策略 — 「連接人才與未來」— 的基礎上，在過去一年推出多項措施，協助銀行業吸引、培育及挽留人才，集中提升及再培訓現有從業員的技能，以及培育年輕一代，以建立可持續的人才庫。\n\n# 國際金融中心：香港重回國際舞台!\n\n實施多時的疫情相關旅遊限制於2022年逐步撤銷，我們作出了多方面的努力讓香港重回國際舞台。11月舉行的「國際金融領袖投資峰會」吸引超過200位來自環球金融機構的國際及地區負責人親臨香港，並獲得全球各地的關注及熱切迴響。儘管峰會舉行日期不巧遇上50年來首個在11月份發出的8號颱風訊號，峰會仍然十分成功，向世界傳遞了香港已全面復常並正展現無比朝氣與活力的有力訊息。我們很高興看到峰會產生了正面的漣漪效應，不少環球金融機構及國際組織現正或計劃在香港舉辦各類活動。\n\n除吸引各地訪客重臨香港外，我和金管局的同事體會到面對面交流聯繫的重要性，因此盡可能親身代表香港出席主要國際會議，積極參與全球政策討論，並藉外訪機會與環球金融機構的集團管理層會面，加深他們對香港穩健的金融體系以及在「一國兩制」下香港提供的各種機遇的了解。\n\n為確保香港保持作為國際金融中心的競爭力，我們在金融科技、內地機遇，以及綠色和可持續金融等策略性重點領域不斷開拓市場新界限。我們亦進一步加強本港的金融平台，提供頂尖的服務，吸引更多企業落戶香港。有關金管局在綠色和可持續金融方面的工作詳情，請參閱《二零二二年可持續發展報告》。\n\n# 金融科技\n\n繼2021年6月公布「金融科技2025」策略，2022年我們在五大範疇均取得顯著進展。\n\n我們在「全面推展銀行數碼化」方面的工作取得理想成果。根據金融科技應用評估的結果，香港銀行業在不同業務領域廣泛採用金融科技，而且所採用的科技類別亦持續增加。我們自2017年以來逐步推廣及支持數碼化的工作獲銀行積極回應，並持續取得成果，成續令人鼓舞。我們將繼續與業界緊密合作，根據評估的結果，進一步推動金融科技在特定銀行業務領域的應用及促進個別科技類別的發展。\n\n年內我們在央行數碼貨幣方面的工作邁進重要的新里程。「多種央行數碼貨幣跨境網絡」(mBridge)項目進入試行階段，並成為全球其中一個率先為企業跨境交易進行真實結算的央行數碼貨幣項目。在零售層面，數字人民幣跨境使用的技術測試已進入第二階段，主要測試通過「轉數快」為數字人民幣錢包增值。數碼港元方面，我們將採取三軌道方式為將來可能發行數碼港元作好準備，並推出第二軌道先導計劃，邀請業界深入研究數碼港元可行的應用場景。\n\n數據可全面釋放金融科技的潛力。我們於去年10月推出的「商業數據通」正是提升香港數據基建的重要一步。作為以數據擁有人授權為本的共享數據基建，「商業數據通」能方便金融機構提取企業的商業數據，使企業（尤其中小型企業）更容易獲得融資。截至2022年底，「商業數據通」已促成超過1,000宗中小企貸款，總額逾19億港元。\n\n最後，我們在擁抱金融創新和它帶來的好處的同時，亦明白有必要監察及處理好相關發展可能帶來的風險。我們正密切注視虛擬資產領域的發展，並參與相關監管事宜的國際討論。經考慮公眾諮詢收集到的意見及相關國際標準後，我們將採納「相同風險，相同監管」1 的方式制定穩定幣的監管制度及界定其監管範圍。未來我們率先規管的對象將是那些標榜與一種或以上法定貨幣的價值掛鈎的穩定幣，因為這類穩定幣可能對貨幣及金融穩定帶來更高及更迫切的潛在風險。我們相信在訂立適當的規範下，業界將可更安全穩妥地開拓數碼金融的潛力。\n\n科技正重塑我們的未來。金管局與銀行業界正積極準備迎向這個「新常態」。我們有信心我們正構建的金融科技生態圈將有助全面釋放金融科技的潛力，並提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。\n\n#

The Omicron variant of COVID-19 raged across the world, continuing to weigh on global economic growth and fuelling inflationary pressures. The conflict between Russia and Ukraine then broke out, further pushing up inflation and prompting major central banks to adopt a front-loaded monetary tightening policy. This amplified volatility in global financial markets and exacerbated the risk of a slowdown in economic growth. Locally, the fifth wave of the pandemic saw a rapid rise in infections, further damaging the economy. Meanwhile, negative reports about anti-epidemic measures and quarantine restrictions led to misunderstandings about Hong Kong in the outside world, threatening the city’s reputation as an international financial centre. Overall, Hong Kong’s real GDP contracted by 3.5% for the year.\n\nDespite facing numerous challenges, the HKMA continued to work hard to safeguard Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability and implemented a number of measures conducive to development in key strategic areas, further consolidating Hong Kong’s position as an international financial centre. After three years of travel restrictions, we successfully demonstrated to the international community that Hong Kong has fully returned to normalcy, and visitors can once again experience the city in person. In November last year, the HKMA hosted the International Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit, which was attended in person by financial leaders from around the world. The enthusiastic response from the outside world was the best proof that Hong Kong has fully returned to normalcy.\n\nLooking ahead, the external environment remains fraught with unprecedented uncertainties. Nevertheless, the reopening of the Mainland economy will reinvigorate Hong Kong and the region as a whole. The HKMA will continue to perform its duties to maintain the stability of Hong Kong’s monetary and banking systems, actively seek more opportunities that are conducive to Hong Kong’s development, and demonstrate and enhance Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre. We will also continue to contribute to enhancing global climate resilience and sustainable development. In addition to the 2022 Annual Report, we will publish a separate 2022 Sustainability Report this year to provide more details on the HKMA’s work in enhancing Hong Kong’s position as a green and sustainable financial hub, as well as the HKMA’s efforts as a responsible investor and sustainable institution.\n\n# Monetary and financial systems: as robust as ever\n\nThe Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has been in operation since 1983 and has successfully withstood various external shocks over several economic cycles. 2022 once again demonstrated the resilience of the LERS. As the US Federal Reserve tightened its monetary policy significantly, the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking was triggered 41 times between May and November 2022. The HKMA followed the established mechanism and bought a total of HK$242.1 billion from the market in an orderly and transparent manner. During this period, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate and the monetary market continued to operate smoothly, reflecting the robustness and effectiveness of the LERS.\n\nThis confidence in the LERS stems from the solid foundation built over many years. As reiterated by the International Monetary Fund in its 2022 External Sector Report, the credibility of the LERS is based on a number of factors, including highly transparent operating rules, ample foreign exchange reserves, a prudent fiscal system, robust financial supervision, and a flexible economic structure.\n\nIn addition to a robust mechanism, we believe that efforts to communicate with the public and the market to deepen their understanding of the LERS, effective market monitoring, and contingency planning for different scenarios will help consolidate confidence in the LERS across all sectors. Our social media campaign on the operation of the LERS helped maintain market confidence in the system during a year when the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking was triggered multiple times. Internally, the HKMA also made good use of data analytics technology to enhance market monitoring, enabling us to respond to the latest market developments in a timely manner.\n\nDuring the year, despite facing macroeconomic challenges and increasing credit risks, Hong Kong’s banking system remained robust, with ample capital and liquidity. At the end of 2022, the consolidated total capital adequacy ratio of local banks was 20.1%, well above the international minimum requirement of 8%. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the liquidity coverage ratio of large banks edged up slightly to 162.3%, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 100%. Given the challenging credit environment, the asset quality of the banking system deteriorated slightly, with the ratio of classified loans rising to 1.38% at the end of 2022. However, this level remains sound and is below the long-term average of 1.8% since 2000.\n\n# Banking system: effective supervision ensures sound operation\n\nThe pandemic has lasted for three years, and challenges from all sides have intensified, such as heightened geopolitical tensions and tighter monetary policies by major central banks. However, thanks to years of sound risk management and effective supervision, Hong Kong’s banking system has remained robust and continued to play an important role in supporting the economy.\n\nOne of the major supervisory challenges faced last year was to ensure that banks continued to provide the necessary support to customers while maintaining sound credit risk management in an environment of economic uncertainty following the fifth wave of COVID-19. The “pre-approved principal payment holiday scheme” was further extended, with a voluntary partial principal repayment option added, allowing borrowers to choose to start repaying part of the principal to help customers prepare for an eventual return to normal repayments.\n\nIn response to heightened market volatility caused by major economies’ aggressive monetary tightening, another key supervisory task of the HKMA in 2022 was to strengthen the monitoring of banks’ market and liquidity risk exposures. We conducted in-depth assessments of the potential impact of synchronised monetary tightening across economies on banks and introduced new scenarios for stress testing to assess banks’ resilience to prolonged liquidity pressures.\n\nAt the same time, we continued to take forward-looking measures to promote effective risk management in various areas. In terms of operational resilience and cyber defence capabilities, we provided guidance to help banks establish a comprehensive and holistic operational framework to achieve sound operations, and issued detailed supervisory guidance on specific operational areas of banks, such as guidance on the use of cloud computing in response to the widespread adoption of cloud technology. In addition, in response to the accelerated development of digitalisation, we strengthened our efforts to combat “phishing” scams and enhance consumer and investor protection.\n\nIn addition to maintaining the soundness of the banking system, the HKMA is also committed to promoting financial inclusion and enhancing the accessibility of banking services. Banks responded positively to the HKMA’s call to provide basic banking services, with some banks setting up branches and self-service banking facilities in large public housing estates in new development areas. Due to travel restrictions related to the pandemic, many Hong Kong citizens were unable to use their Mainland bank accounts. In response, the HKMA worked closely with relevant parties to help reactivate around 500,000 Mainland bank accounts, without the need for the affected account holders to travel to the Mainland in person.\n\nAnother area of strategic importance for the continued development of the banking industry is the enhancement of professional capabilities. The banking industry still has a large demand for professional talent to expand its business. Building on its talent development strategy – “Connecting Talent with the Future” – the HKMA launched a number of initiatives last year to help the banking industry attract, nurture and retain talent, focusing on upgrading and retraining the skills of existing employees and cultivating the younger generation to build a sustainable talent pool.\n\n# International financial centre: Hong Kong is back on the international stage!\n\nAfter the prolonged pandemic-related travel restrictions were gradually lifted in 2022, we made efforts on various fronts to bring Hong Kong back to the international stage. The International Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit held in November attracted over 200 international and regional heads of global financial institutions to Hong Kong in person, and received attention and enthusiastic responses from around the world. Despite the Summit’s date coinciding with the first No. 8 typhoon signal issued in November in 50 years, it was still a great success, sending a powerful message to the world that Hong Kong has fully returned to normalcy and is demonstrating tremendous vitality and energy. We are pleased to see that the Summit has generated positive ripple effects, with many global financial institutions and international organisations now hosting or planning various events in Hong Kong.\n\nIn addition to attracting visitors from around the world to return to Hong Kong, my colleagues at the HKMA and I understand the importance of face-to-face communication, so we attended major international conferences in person as much as possible to represent Hong Kong, actively participated in global policy discussions, and took the opportunity to meet with senior management of global financial institutions during overseas visits to deepen their understanding of Hong Kong’s robust financial system and the opportunities Hong Kong offers under “One Country, Two Systems”.\n\nTo ensure that Hong Kong remains competitive as an international financial centre, we continue to explore new market frontiers in strategic areas such as financial technology, Mainland opportunities, and green and sustainable finance. We have also further strengthened Hong Kong’s financial platform, providing top-notch services to attract more businesses to set up in Hong Kong. For details of the HKMA’s work in green and sustainable finance, please refer to the 2022 Sustainability Report.\n\n# Financial technology\n\nFollowing the announcement of the “Fintech 2025” strategy in June 2021, we made significant progress in five areas in 2022.\n\nOur work on “promoting the comprehensive digitalisation of banks” has achieved good results. According to the assessment of fintech applications, Hong Kong’s banking industry has widely adopted fintech in various business areas, and the types of technology adopted have continued to increase. Our efforts to promote and support digitalisation since 2017 have received positive responses from banks and have continued to yield results, which is encouraging. We will continue to work closely with the industry to further promote the application of fintech in specific banking business areas and facilitate the development of individual technology categories based on the assessment results.\n\nWe made important new progress in our work on central bank digital currencies last year. The “multi-CBDC cross-border network” (mBridge) project entered the pilot stage and became one of the world’s first central bank digital currency projects to conduct real settlement for corporate cross-border transactions. At the retail level, the technical testing of cross-border use of digital renminbi has entered the second phase, mainly testing the topping up of digital renminbi wallets through the Faster Payment System. For digital HKD, we will adopt a three-track approach to prepare for the possible issuance of digital HKD in the future, and launch a second-track pilot programme to invite the industry to conduct in-depth research on feasible use cases for digital HKD.\n\nData can fully unlock the potential of fintech. The “Commercial Data Interchange” we launched in October last year is an important step in enhancing Hong Kong’s data infrastructure. As a data-sharing infrastructure based on data owner authorisation, the “Commercial Data Interchange” enables financial institutions to easily access corporate business data, making it easier for enterprises (especially SMEs) to obtain financing. As at the end of 2022, the “Commercial Data Interchange” had facilitated over 1,000 SME loans, with a total amount of over HK$1.9 billion.\n\nFinally, while embracing financial innovation and its benefits, we also understand the need to monitor and manage the risks that such developments may bring. We are closely monitoring developments in the virtual asset sector and participating in international discussions on related regulatory matters. After considering the views collected from the public consultation and relevant international standards, we will adopt a “same risk, same regulation” approach to formulate a regulatory regime for stablecoins and define its regulatory scope. In the future, we will first regulate those stablecoins that claim to peg their value to one or more fiat currencies, as they may pose higher and more urgent potential risks to monetary and financial stability. We believe that with appropriate rules in place, the industry will be able to unlock the potential of digital finance in a safer and more secure manner.\n\nTechnology is reshaping our future. The HKMA and the banking industry are actively preparing to embrace this “new normal”. We are confident that the fintech ecosystem we are building will help unlock the full potential of fintech and enhance Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre.\n\n# Mainland opportunities"}

Summary of 2022\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nHong Kong’s economy contracted significantly in 2022, affected by multiple adverse factors including the fifth wave of COVID-19, tightening financial conditions, and a challenging external environment. The labour market initially weakened but gradually improved, while inflation remained moderate. Thanks to the full resumption of border crossings between mainland China and Hong Kong, the city’s economic growth is expected to recover from a low base in 2023.\n\nHong Kong’s banking system remained robust in 2022, with ample capital and liquidity, and healthy asset quality.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nAs the US tightened its monetary policy, the Hong Kong dollar weakened, triggering the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking several times during the year. However, Hong Kong’s foreign exchange and monetary markets continued to operate smoothly and in an orderly manner, once again demonstrating the robustness and effectiveness of the linked exchange rate system.\n\n# Reserve Management\n\nThe investment environment in 2022 was exceptionally volatile, with prices of multiple asset classes falling simultaneously. The Exchange Fund recorded an overall investment return of negative 4.5%, which was relatively mild compared to the performance of most multi-asset funds in the market.\n\nThe HKMA also continued to promote responsible investment and asset diversification. Meanwhile, the annualised internal rate of return of the Long-term Growth Portfolio since its inception in 2009 was 12.6%.\n\n# Stability of the Banking System\n\nIn response to heightened financial market volatility, the HKMA strengthened its supervision of banks’ credit and market risk management. It also worked closely with banks to enhance their operational resilience and cyber defence capabilities, in light of growing cyber threats and the accelerating pace of digital transformation in the banking sector.\n\nThe HKMA introduced further consumer protection measures related to buy-now-pay-later products and new property mortgage transfer payment arrangements. Additionally, the HKMA collaborated with other regulators to develop a regulatory framework for virtual assets, issued guidelines on the distribution of investment products, and launched a new regulatory regime for trust businesses. The Credit Information Platform under the “Multiple Credit Information Service Providers” model for personal credit data was also launched during the year.\n\nThe HKMA continued to work with banks to enhance Hong Kong’s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML\/CFT) ecosystem, strengthen responses to scams, and further promote the application of data and technology through the “AML Compliance Technology Lab” series. It also accelerated the adoption of regulatory technology for AML\/CFT work within the HKMA.\n\nThe HKMA made good progress in implementing international regulatory standards on capital adequacy and disclosure requirements locally. It also worked with the banking sector to build a sustainable talent pool and enhance employees’ skills for future development.\n\nTo ensure Hong Kong has a credible resolution mechanism, the HKMA developed new resolution standards, conducted regional crisis simulation exercises, and established a new layer of loss-absorbing capacity resources in all banks of systemic importance in Hong Kong. This marked an important milestone in the development of the resolution mechanism.\n\n# Hong Kong’s Status as an International Financial Centre\n\nThe successful International Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit reinforced Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre and generated positive ripple effects.\n\nThe currency swap agreement between the People’s Bank of China and the HKMA was enhanced during the year, further consolidating Hong Kong’s position as a global offshore renminbi business hub. The HKMA also worked with other regulators and stakeholders to prepare for the launch of “Swap Connect” and introduce a dual-counter market maker mechanism to facilitate the trading of renminbi-denominated stocks in Hong Kong. It also sought to develop the debt instrument central clearing system into a major international central securities depository platform in Asia.\n\nGood progress was made in enhancing the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, covering areas such as bond issuance, asset and wealth management, corporate treasury centres, and green and sustainable finance.\n\nThe HKMA also continued to implement the “Fintech 2025” strategy to promote fintech adoption in the financial industry and strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub. Usage of the Faster Payment System (FPS) grew steadily as its functionalities were enhanced.\n\n# Institutional Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintained effective communication with society and the market through various channels to enhance public understanding of its policies and work.\n\nInternally, the HKMA built a team that emphasised agility and sustainable development, while adhering to strict fiscal discipline and enhancing information technology capabilities to respond to changes and ensure effective policy implementation."}

{"zh":"# 2023年工作重點及前瞻\n\n儘管香港經濟在2023 年初出現復甦跡象，但外圍環境仍然充滿挑戰及不確定性。近期美國和歐洲的銀行業受壓，個別美國本土銀行在2023 年3 月倒閉，對環球金融市場造成漣漪效應，而主要央行收緊貨幣政策，很有可能令2023 年全球經濟增長放緩甚或衰退。另一方面，地緣政治局勢緊張，以及去全球化的威脅持續，可能會繼續拖累全球貿易，並會令環球金融市場不時出現波動。儘管如此，香港金融體系憑藉多年來所建立穩健的抗震能力及充裕的緩衝，有足夠能力抵禦不利衝擊。\n\n金管局非常重視保障貨幣及金融穩定。展望未來，面對不明朗的宏觀經濟環境，金管局會保持警惕，力求迅速辨識正浮現的風險，並靈活應對。與此同時，金管局會繼續把握機遇及創造政策空間，進一步提升香港作為主要國際金融中心的地位。面對充滿挑戰的投資環境，金管局在管理外匯基金時會繼續審慎投資，同時保持足夠靈活性，按需要採取防禦措施，並維持高流動性。\n\n# 金融體系保持穩定健全\n\n環球經濟前景仍受制於重大的不確定因素。金管局會密切注視最新發展，提高警覺，防範各種潛在風險，以維持金融體系穩定健全；這是關乎持續提供關鍵金融服務的先決條件，因此亦是維繫香港經濟正常運作的命脈。\n\n# 對潛在風險保持警惕\n\n在2023年，美國利率未來走勢的不確定性，以及在先進經濟體銀行體系出現的壓力，可能會對主要先進經濟體的增長前景帶來下行風險。此外，持續的地緣政治風險，可能會繼續拖累全球貿易，並會令環球金融市場不時出現波動。然而，香港金融體系憑藉過去多年所建立的抗震能力及緩衝，有足夠能力抵禦不利衝擊。金管局亦有能力、資源及決心維持香港貨幣及金融穩定。\n\n金管局將繼續密切注視本地及外圍環境的風險與脆弱性，並會按需要採取適當措施維持香港的貨幣及金融體系穩定。金管局亦會研究對香港經濟有影響的事項，以及評估與這些事項相關的潛在風險。\n\n# 保持銀行體系穩定\n\n鑑於地緣政治緊張局勢升級，以及各主要央行大幅加息以遏抑通脹，預計2023年銀行業的經營環境仍然充滿挑戰。另一方面，科技發展迅速及數碼化對銀行業來說既有危又有機。面對瞬息萬變的金融環境，金管局致力透過持續的監管工作確保銀行具足夠能力抵禦衝擊。與此同時，金管局亦會參照國際標準及最佳做法，繼續加強及優化銀行監管架構與政策。\n\n# 風險為本的監管重點\n\n# 信用、流動性及市場風險\n\n在2023年，金管局將繼續密切注視認可機構的資產質素，並聚焦於認可機構的貸款分類及撥備做法，以及對財務狀況較差的借款人的管理。金管局亦會加強其監察系統，並採取積極措施確保銀行體系的整體信用風險水平維持可控。\n\n另一方面，金管局會繼續留意企業的營運環境，並與銀行業及商界保持緊密溝通，以就最終退出「預先批核還息不還本」計劃作好準備，並同時確保暫時面對困難的客戶仍然得到適切的信貸支援。\n\n此外，面對不明朗的宏觀經濟環境，金管局於2023年亦會加強監管認可機構的流動性及市場風險管理。\n\n# 業務操作及科技風險\n\n隨着銀行在業務營運中更廣泛應用科技，金管局會致力提升銀行業的運作穩健性及網絡防衛能力。繼5月發出《監管政策手冊》新單元「運作穩健性」後，金管局會與業界保持緊密聯繫，審視認可機構在制定運作穩健性框架方面的進度。同時，金管局將透過跟進認可機構在「網絡防衛評估框架2.0」評估下發現的問題以及檢視認可機構實施穩固三重數據備份的進展，提高銀行業的網絡防衛能力。\n\n隨着數碼化的步伐加快，金管局的其他監管重點包括加強對銀行的第三方服務供應商風險管理的監管，以及提升銀行業的數據管治能力。\n\n# 打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集\n\n在2023年，金管局的工作重點包括更新監管資訊、加強打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集（反洗錢）生態系統各持份者的合作以應對洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集（洗錢）風險，以及進一步推動反洗錢監管科技與合規科技的發展。金管局的《打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集指引》亦會作出修訂，並會就「政治人物」採取與風險相稱的措施發出具體指引，從而促進業界以有效及風險為本的方法落實法例的主要修訂。與此同時，金管局會擴大現有公私營夥伴合作的涵蓋範圍以加強訊息共享，以及支持推出銀行之間的訊息共享平台，藉以加快偵測可疑戶口及防範戶口被濫用，並加強對騙案受害人的保障和協助受害人追討損失。金管局亦會透過「反洗錢合規科技實驗室」及其他反洗錢合規科技項目，進一步集中推動採用合規科技（包括數據分析），並致力發展宏觀分析能力，以配合其數據為本的反洗錢監管工作。透過實施上述各項措施，金管局將能更迅速針對傀儡戶口網絡等系統性洗錢風險採取相應措施，以及靈活應對不斷轉變的威脅。\n\n# 財富管理業務\n\n金管局在2023年會加強有關認可機構在財富管理以及銷售證券、強制性公積金（強積金）與其他投資及保險產品方面的操守的現場審查及非現場監察。2023年的重點將會是「跨境理財通」計劃、數碼分銷及諮詢平台、虛擬資產、環境、社會及管治(ESG)投資產品及長期保險產品。金管局在有關過程中會參考市場最新發展及國際標準的修訂。\n\n金管局亦會與其他監管機構及銀行界緊密聯繫，並按需要就銷售投資、保險及強積金產品的監管標準向認可機構提供指引，其中亦會包括有關提供虛擬資產相關投資服務的指引。就此而言，為促進虛擬資產行業可持續及負責任地發展，金管局會積極參與相關國際組織，並與政府及其他金融監管機構合作，制定全面的虛擬資產監管架構。\n\n隨着「跨境理財通」順利推出，金管局會與業界及相關監管機構聯繫，以優化該計劃。此外，金管局亦會與證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）及業界合作，精簡投資產品銷售程序（包括適用於資深投資者的銷售程序），以及開始根據相關《監管政策手冊》新單元及新營運守則監管認可機構的信託業務。\n\n# 監察金融市場基建\n\n金管局的目標是按照《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（《支付條例》）、《金融市場基建的原則》（《基建原則》），以及支付及金融基建委員會發出的各項指引促進其所監察的金融市場基建的安全及效率，按需要參照最新的國際標準評估各項基建。金管局會參與支付及金融基建委員會與國際證監會組織對實施《基建原則》的監察及評估計劃，亦會參與國際標準制定組織的工作，並參照國際慣例或因應市場及科技發展加強本身的監察規定。同時，如有需要，金管局會與有關當局合作，進一步加強合作監察安排。\n\n# 制定政策\n\n金管局會因應國際標準及最佳做法，繼續加強及優化銀行監管架構與政策。\n\n# 在香港實施巴塞爾標準\n\n# 資本標準\n\n金管局會透過實施巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（巴塞爾委員會）近年發布的標準，進一步優化資本框架，當中包括：\n- 2017年12月《巴塞爾協定三：危機後改革的最終方案》、2019年1月（2019年2月修訂）《市場風險最低資本規定》，以及2020年7月《信用估值調整風險架構具針對性的修訂》所載的經修訂資本標準 — 上述經修訂資本標準統稱《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案，載明信用風險、市場風險、信用估值調整風險及業務操作風險的新監管處理方法，並引入出項下限規定，以及優化槓桿比率框架。經過2022年的多輪業界諮詢後，金管局計劃在2023年就《銀行業（資本）規則》（《資本規則》）的建議修訂進行法定諮詢，以實施上述各項規定及正值中性逆周期緩衝資本。有關修訂預計於同年內提交立法會進行先訂立後審議程序，並不早於2024年1月1日生效，作為最低要求。\n- 2022年12月《加密資產風險承擔的審慎處理方法》金管局計劃按照巴塞爾委員會的時間表，在2025年1月1日於本地實施有關標準，並打算於2023年就相關建議諮詢業界。\n\n# 風險承擔限度\n\n金管局於2023年3月就《銀行業（風險承擔限度）規則》的建議修訂諮詢業界。有關建議修訂主要是因應金管局實施上文提及的《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案下的經修訂資本標準而提出。諮詢文件亦包括就《資本規則》下有關官方實體集中風險的處理方法所作出的其他相應修訂。經修訂規則的目標實施日期將與落實《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案的經修訂《資本規則》中的信用風險部分的實施日期一致（即不早於2024年1月1日）。\n\n# 流動性標準\n\n金管局擬於2023年諮詢業界有關透過《2023年銀行業（流動性）（修訂）規則》（《2023年流動性修訂規則》）對《銀行業（流動性）規則》作出的建議修訂。相關修訂是因應同時期的《資本規則》建議修訂而作出，所以《2023年流動性修訂規則》的目標實施日期將與落實《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案的經修訂《資本規則》中的信用風險部分的實施日期一致（即不早於2024年1月1日）。\n\n# 披露標準\n\n《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案中與經修訂資本標準相關的新的及經修訂的披露規定，主要載於巴塞爾委員會分別於2018年12月及2021年11月發出的《第三支柱1 披露規定 — 更新框架》及《修訂市場風險披露規定》。巴塞爾委員會亦於2019年6月發出《修訂槓桿比率披露規定》，藉修訂槓桿比率的披露規定處理對潛在「粉飾櫥窗」（指銀行在報告日期前後減少某些交易的交易量，從而人為地提高報告及公開披露的槓桿比率）的關注。為在香港實施上述新的及經修訂的披露規定，金管局亦正擬備《銀行業（披露）規則》（《披露規則》）的相應修訂，以及經修訂後的標準披露模版及表格，並在過程中徵詢業界意見。預計《披露規則》的修訂將於2023年內連同《資本規則》的修訂一併提交立法會進行先訂立後審議程序。\n","terms":{"銀行":["bank","banking

Key tasks and outlook for 2023\n\nAlthough the Hong Kong economy showed signs of recovery at the beginning of 2023, the external environment remains challenging and uncertain. Recently, the banking sectors in the United States and Europe have come under pressure, with some US banks collapsing in March 2023, creating a ripple effect across global financial markets. Additionally, major central banks’ tightening of monetary policy is likely to slow or even reverse global economic growth in 2023. Meanwhile, geopolitical tensions and the threat of deglobalisation persist, which could continue to weigh on global trade and cause volatility in international financial markets. Nevertheless, Hong Kong’s financial system has built robust resilience and ample buffers over the years, enabling it to withstand adverse shocks.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) places great emphasis on safeguarding monetary and financial stability. Looking ahead, in the face of an uncertain macroeconomic environment, the HKMA will remain vigilant, strive to swiftly identify emerging risks, and respond flexibly. At the same time, the HKMA will continue to seize opportunities and create policy space to further enhance Hong Kong’s position as a leading international financial centre. In a challenging investment environment, the HKMA will continue to invest prudently in managing the Exchange Fund, while maintaining sufficient flexibility to take defensive measures as needed and preserve high liquidity.\n\n# Financial system remains stable and sound\n\nThe global economic outlook is still constrained by significant uncertainties. The HKMA will closely monitor the latest developments, remain alert, and guard against various potential risks to maintain the stability and soundness of the financial system. This is a prerequisite for the continued provision of critical financial services and is therefore vital to sustaining the normal functioning of Hong Kong’s economy.\n\n# Remaining vigilant against potential risks\n\nIn 2023, uncertainties surrounding the future path of US interest rates and pressures within the banking systems of advanced economies could pose downside risks to growth prospects in major advanced economies. Furthermore, persistent geopolitical risks could continue to weigh on global trade and cause volatility in international financial markets. However, Hong Kong’s financial system has built robust resilience and buffers over the years, enabling it to withstand adverse shocks. The HKMA also has the capacity, resources and determination to maintain Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nThe HKMA will continue to closely monitor risks and vulnerabilities in both the local and external environments and take appropriate measures as needed to maintain the stability of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems. The HKMA will also study matters that impact Hong Kong’s economy and assess the potential risks associated with these matters.\n\n# Maintaining stability in the banking system\n\nGiven the escalation of geopolitical tensions and major central banks’ significant interest rate hikes to curb inflation, the operating environment for the banking sector is expected to remain challenging in 2023. On the other hand, rapid technological advancements and digitalisation present both risks and opportunities for the banking industry. In the face of a rapidly changing financial environment, the HKMA is committed to ensuring, through continuous regulatory efforts, that banks have sufficient capacity to withstand shocks. At the same time, the HKMA will continue to strengthen and optimise the banking regulatory framework and policies by referencing international standards and best practices.\n\n# Risk-based regulatory focus\n\n# Credit, liquidity and market risks\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA will continue to closely monitor the asset quality of authorised institutions, focusing on their loan classification and provisioning practices, as well as the management of borrowers with weaker financial conditions. The HKMA will also enhance its monitoring system and take proactive measures to ensure that the overall credit risk level in the banking system remains controllable.\n\nOn the other hand, the HKMA will continue to monitor the operating environment of enterprises and maintain close communication with the banking sector and the business community to prepare for the eventual exit from the “pre-approved principal repayment holiday” scheme, while ensuring that customers temporarily facing difficulties continue to receive appropriate credit support.\n\nIn addition, in the face of an uncertain macroeconomic environment, the HKMA will strengthen its supervision of authorised institutions’ liquidity and market risk management in 2023.\n\n# Operational and technology risks\n\nAs banks increasingly apply technology in their operations, the HKMA will strive to enhance the operational robustness and cyber defence capabilities of the banking sector. Following the issuance of a new module on “Operational Resilience” in the Regulatory Policy Handbook in May, the HKMA will maintain close contact with the industry to review authorised institutions’ progress in developing operational resilience frameworks. At the same time, the HKMA will enhance the banking sector’s cyber defence capabilities by following up on issues identified by authorised institutions under the “Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0” and reviewing their progress in implementing robust triple data backups.\n\nAs digitalisation accelerates, the HKMA’s other regulatory priorities include strengthening the supervision of banks’ third-party service provider risk management and enhancing the banking sector’s data governance capabilities.\n\n# Combating money laundering and terrorist financing\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA’s priorities will include updating regulatory information, strengthening cooperation among stakeholders in the anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML\/CFT) ecosystem to address money laundering and terrorist financing risks, and further promoting the development of AML regulatory technology and compliance technology. The HKMA’s *Guidelines on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing* will also be revised, and specific guidance will be issued on taking measures proportionate to the risk posed by \"politically exposed persons\", thereby facilitating the industry’s implementation of key legislative amendments in an effective and risk-based manner. At the same time, the HKMA will expand the scope of existing public-private partnerships to enhance information sharing and support the launch of an interbank information-sharing platform to expedite the detection of suspicious accounts and prevent account misuse, as well as strengthen protection for scam victims and assist them in recovering losses. The HKMA will also further promote the adoption of compliance technology (including data analytics) through the \"AML Compliance Technology Lab\" and other AML compliance technology projects, and will strive to develop macro-analysis capabilities to support its data-based AML regulatory work. By implementing these measures, the HKMA will be able to respond more swiftly to systemic money laundering risks such as puppet account networks and to adapt flexibly to evolving threats.\n\n# Wealth management business\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA will strengthen on-site inspections and off-site monitoring of authorised institutions’ conduct in wealth management and the sale of securities, Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) products and other investment and insurance products. The focus in 2023 will be on the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect scheme, digital distribution and advisory platforms, virtual assets, environmental, social and governance (ESG) investment products, and long-term insurance products. In this process, the HKMA will refer to the latest market developments and revisions to international standards.\n\nThe HKMA will also maintain close contact with other regulators and the banking sector, and provide guidance to authorised institutions on regulatory standards for the sale of investment, insurance and MPF products as needed, including guidance on the provision of investment services related to virtual assets. In this regard, to promote the sustainable and responsible development of the virtual asset industry, the HKMA will actively participate in relevant international organisations and work with the government and other financial regulators to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for virtual assets.\n\nFollowing the successful launch of the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect, the HKMA will work with the industry and relevant regulators to optimise the scheme. In addition, the HKMA will work with the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the industry to streamline investment product sales procedures (including those applicable to experienced investors) and begin to regulate the trust business of authorised institutions under the new modules and new operating codes of the relevant *Regulatory Policy Handbook*.\n\n# Monitoring financial market infrastructure\n\nThe HKMA’s objective is to promote the safety and efficiency of the financial market infrastructures it oversees in accordance with the *Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance* (*Payment Ordinance*), the *Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures* (*Infrastructure Principles*), and the guidelines issued by the Payment and Financial Infrastructure Committee, and to assess the infrastructures as needed by reference to the latest international standards. The HKMA will participate in the Payment and Financial Infrastructure Committee’s and the International Organization of Securities Commissions’ monitoring and assessment programme for the implementation of the *Infrastructure Principles*, as well as in the work of international standard-setting organisations, and will strengthen its own monitoring requirements by reference to international practices or in response to market and technological developments. At the same time, if necessary, the HKMA will work with relevant authorities to further strengthen cooperative monitoring arrangements.\n\n# Policy formulation\n\nThe HKMA will continue to strengthen and optimise the banking regulatory framework and policies in line with international standards and best practices.\n\n# Implementation of Basel standards in Hong Kong\n\n# Capital standards\n\nThe HKMA will further optimise the capital framework by implementing standards issued in recent years by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), including:\n- The revised capital standards set out in the *Basel III: Finalising post-crisis reforms* of December 2017, the *Minimum capital requirements for market risk* of January 2019 (revised in February 2019), and the *Targeted revisions to the credit valuation adjustment risk framework* of July 2020 – collectively referred to as the final Basel III reform package, which sets out new regulatory approaches for credit risk, market risk, credit valuation adjustment risk and operational risk, introduces an output floor requirement, and optimises the leverage ratio framework. Following several rounds of industry consultation in 2022, the HKMA plans to conduct a statutory consultation in 2023 on proposed amendments to the *Banking (Capital) Rules* (*Capital Rules*) to implement these requirements and a neutrally calibrated countercyclical capital buffer. The amendments are expected to be submitted to the Legislative Council for negative vetting in the same year and to take effect no earlier than 1 January 2024 as a minimum requirement.\n- *Prudent treatment of cryptoasset exposures* of December 2022. The HKMA plans to implement the standard locally in accordance with the Basel Committee’s timetable on 1 January 2025, and intends to consult the industry on the relevant proposals in 2023.\n\n# Risk exposure limits\n\nIn March 2023, the HKMA consulted the industry on proposed amendments to the *Banking (Limits on Risk Exposures) Rules*. The proposed amendments are primarily in response to the HKMA’s implementation of the revised capital standards under the final Basel III reform package mentioned above. The consultation paper also includes other corresponding amendments to the treatment of concentration risk of official entities under the *Capital Rules*. The target implementation date of the revised rules will be aligned with that of the credit risk portion of the revised *Capital Rules* implementing the final Basel III reform package (i.e. no earlier than 1 January 2024).\n\n# Liquidity standards\n\nThe HKMA proposes to consult the industry in 2023 on proposed amendments to the *Banking (Liquidity) Rules* through the *Banking (Liquidity) (Amendment) Rules 2023* (*2023 Liquidity Amendment Rules*). The amendments are made in response to the proposed amendments to the *Capital Rules* at the same time, so the target implementation date of the *2023 Liquidity Amendment Rules* will be aligned with that of the credit risk portion of the revised *Capital Rules* implementing the final Basel III reform package (i.e. no earlier than 1 January 2024).\n\n# Disclosure standards\n\nThe new and revised disclosure requirements related to the revised capital standards in the final Basel III reform package are mainly set out in the *Pillar 3 disclosure requirements – updated framework* and the *Revised disclosure requirements for market risk*, issued by the Basel Committee in December 2018 and November 2021 respectively. The Basel Committee also issued the *Revised leverage ratio disclosure requirements* in June 2019, which revised the leverage ratio disclosure requirements to address concerns about potential \"window dressing\" (where banks reduce the volume of certain trades around the reporting date to artificially increase the reported and publicly disclosed leverage ratio). To implement the above new and revised disclosure requirements in Hong Kong, the HKMA is also preparing corresponding amendments to the *Banking (Disclosure) Rules* (*Disclosure Rules*) and revised standard disclosure templates and forms, and is consulting the industry in the process. It is expected that the amendments to the *Disclosure Rules* will be submitted to the Legislative Council for negative vetting together with the amendments to the *Capital Rules* in 2023."}

奉行具透明度及保持開放的政策，與各持份者保持緊密聯繫。\n\n# 金管局與香港特別行政區政府\n\n金管局是香港特別行政區政府（特區政府）架構的一部分，但可以按與公務員不同的聘用條款聘請員工，以吸引具適當經驗與專門知識的人才。金管局總裁及其員工均為公職人員。金管局的日常運作，在金融管理專員所獲賦予或轉授的法定權力範圍內高度自主。\n\n財政司司長負責釐定香港的貨幣政策目標及貨幣體制：財政司司長於2003年6月25日致金融管理專員的函件中，訂明應透過貨幣發行局制度維持貨幣穩定，將港元匯率保持在約7.80港元兌1美元的水平。金融管理專員須自行負責達成貨幣政策目標，包括決定有關的策略、工具及執行方式，並負責維持香港貨幣制度的穩定與健全。\n\n財政司司長在財經事務及庫務局局長的協助下，負責維持香港金融體系穩定與健全，以及保持香港的國際金融中心地位的政策。為推行這些政策，金融管理專員的職責包括：\n- 促進銀行體系的整體穩定與有效運作；\n- 與其他有關機構與組織合作，發展債務市場；\n- 處理與法定紙幣及硬幣的發行及流通有關的事宜；\n- 透過發展支付、結算及交收系統，以及在適當情況下負責操作有關系統，促進金融基建的安全與效率；及\n- 與其他有關機構與組織合作，促進對香港貨幣及金融體系的信心，並推行適當的發展市場措施，以協助加強香港金融服務的國際競爭力。\n\n外匯基金由財政司司長掌有控制權。金融管理專員須根據財政司司長轉授的權力，就外匯基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 問責性與透明度\n\n就日常運作及推行政府政策目標所採用的方法，金管局一直保持高度自主，並同時輔以高問責性及透明度。\n\n金管局致力促進貨幣與銀行體系穩定，有效管理官方儲備，發展與監察穩健及多元化的金融基建，從而鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位，推動香港經濟發展。\n\n金管局要有效履行職責，便必須取得社會人士的信任。因此，金管局以嚴謹的態度，履行向公眾解釋其政策及工作的責任，並盡力處理備受社會關注而涉及金管局職責範圍的事項。尤其，金管局透過傳統及社交媒體適時澄清有關金管局政策的失實資訊及謠言。\n\n金融管理專員由財政司司長委任，因此金管局透過財政司司長向公眾負責；而由於金管局的職權由立法會通過的法律制訂，因此金管局亦透過立法會向公眾負責。金管局亦明白本身肩負更廣泛的責任，就是促進公眾對金管局角色及目標的認識，並密切留意社會人士所關注的事項。金管局在執行日常工作及與社會保持廣泛聯繫時，堅守盡力提高透明度及保持開放的政策。這項政策有兩大目標：\n- 在顧及市場敏感性、商業秘密及機密資料披露的法定限制下，盡量使金融界及公眾充分了解金管局的工作；及\n- 確保金管局掌握社會脈搏，並對公眾意見作出適當回應。\n\n金管局在透明度方面致力達致國際最高標準，與傳媒保持廣泛聯繫之餘，亦出版各種中英文期刊及專題刊物。金管局的雙語網站(www.hkma.gov.hk)除有專門環節列載經濟研究、統計資料、監管資源、消費者資訊及其他課題外，還載有大量金管局出版的刊物、新聞稿、演辭及簡報會資料文件。此外，金管局又利用社交媒體平台，以能在數碼時代中更有效與公眾溝通。金管局辦事處設有資訊中心，分為圖書館及展覽館兩部分，每星期開放6日予公眾參觀及使用。有關金管局與公眾溝通及聯繫的工作，詳見「機構職能」一章（第157至162頁）。\n\n金管局公布外匯基金及貨幣發行局帳目資料的次數，一直逐步增加，內容亦越趨詳細。金管局於1999年開始參與國際貨幣基金組織的中央銀行「數據公布特殊標準」計劃。金管局亦公布外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下貨幣發行委員會的會議紀錄，以及貨幣發行局制度運作報告。自1996年起，金管局網站載有銀行業監管政策及指引。\n\n金管局與立法會的關係對提高問責性及透明度非常重要。金管局總裁承諾每年3次向立法會財經事務委員會簡報金管局各項工作及政策，並回答有關查詢。此外，金管局代表不時出席立法會事務委員會及小組委員會會議，闡釋及商討特別事項，以及協助議員審閱條例草案。\n\n# 監控措施\n\n金管局採用穩健有效的內部及外部監控機制，確保秉持高水平的員工操守、審慎的風險管理，以及適當的制衡。內部及外部審計職能就監控機制是否足夠及具成效提供獨立評估。\n\n# 行為守則\n\n《行為守則》就員工的道德與法律責任提供指引，確保所有職級員工的行為均符合指定標準。\n\n# 內部監控\n\n# 運作監控\n\n作為風險管理的第一度防線，所有部門及分處均有責任評估其工作流程的風險，並制定適當的監控措施，確保金管局日常運作穩妥。\n\n# 機構風險管理\n\n風險管理亦在機構層面進行。由金管局總裁擔任主席的風險委員會，是機構風險管理架構的基石之一。\n\n風險委員會審視和商討各部門所識別的潛在及新生風險，以及相關監控措施和緩解策略是否充足，並由該會定出適當的跟進行動。\n\n# 內部審計\n\n金管局內部審核處獨立評估不同部門的管治程序、風險管理及監控措施是否足夠及具成效，並提出改善建議。\n\n# 外部審計\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》第7條，外匯基金的財務報表由香港特區政府審計署審核。審計署並無就此項服務收取費用。經審核的外匯基金財務報表刊載於金管局《年報》。\n","terms":{"銀行":["bank","banking

Corporate governance\n\nAs Hong Kong’s central banking institution, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) understands the importance of good governance in maintaining and safeguarding public trust and confidence in the HKMA’s fulfilment of its statutory responsibilities. It has therefore been committed to upholding a high standard of corporate governance.\n\nTo fulfil its commitment to good corporate governance, the HKMA:\n- has established a clear corporate governance structure with a high level of accountability;\n- implements robust and sound monitoring measures to manage risks and ensure that the conduct of employees at all levels and their day-to-day operations comply with specified standards; and\n- adopts a policy of transparency and openness, and maintains close contact with stakeholders.\n\n# The HKMA and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government\n\nThe HKMA is part of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government, but can employ staff on terms different from those of civil servants in order to attract people with appropriate experience and expertise. The Chief Executive of the HKMA and its staff are public officers. The HKMA’s day-to-day operations are highly autonomous within the statutory powers conferred on or delegated to the Financial Secretary for Financial Administration.\n\nThe Financial Secretary is responsible for determining Hong Kong’s monetary policy objectives and monetary system. In a letter dated 25 June 2003 to the Financial Secretary for Financial Administration, the Financial Secretary stipulated that monetary stability should be maintained through a currency board system, keeping the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate at around 7.80 HKD to 1 USD. The Financial Secretary for Financial Administration is responsible for achieving the monetary policy objectives on his own, including determining the relevant strategies, tools and implementation methods, and is responsible for maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary system.\n\nThe Financial Secretary, with the assistance of the Director of the Financial Services and Treasury Bureau, is responsible for policies to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s financial system and to maintain Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre. To implement these policies, the responsibilities of the Financial Secretary for Financial Administration include:\n- promoting the overall stability and effective operation of the banking system;\n- working with other relevant institutions and organisations to develop the debt market;\n- handling matters relating to the issuance and circulation of legal banknotes and coins;\n- promoting the safety and efficiency of financial infrastructure by developing payment, clearing and settlement systems, and operating such systems where appropriate; and\n- working with other relevant institutions and organisations to promote confidence in Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems, and implementing appropriate market development measures to help strengthen the international competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial services.\n\nThe Exchange Fund is controlled by the Financial Secretary. The Financial Secretary for Financial Administration is accountable to the Financial Secretary for the management and investment of the Exchange Fund under the powers delegated by the Financial Secretary.\n\n# Accountability and transparency\n\nThe HKMA has maintained a high degree of autonomy in its day-to-day operations and in the methods adopted to implement government policy objectives, while being supported by a high level of accountability and transparency.\n\nThe HKMA is committed to promoting the stability of the monetary and banking systems, effectively managing official reserves, and developing and monitoring robust and diversified financial infrastructure, thereby consolidating Hong Kong’s position as an international financial centre and promoting Hong Kong’s economic development.\n\nFor the HKMA to perform its duties effectively, it must gain the trust of the community. Therefore, the HKMA takes a rigorous approach to fulfilling its responsibility to explain its policies and work to the public, and makes every effort to address issues of public concern that fall within the scope of the HKMA’s responsibilities. In particular, the HKMA uses traditional and social media to clarify misinformation and rumours about the HKMA’s policies in a timely manner.\n\nThe Financial Secretary for Financial Administration is appointed by the Financial Secretary, so the HKMA is accountable to the public through the Financial Secretary. And since the HKMA’s powers are established by laws passed by the Legislative Council, the HKMA is also accountable to the public through the Legislative Council. The HKMA also understands that it has a broader responsibility to promote public understanding of the HKMA’s role and objectives, and to keep a close eye on issues of public concern. In carrying out its day-to-day work and maintaining broad contact with society, the HKMA adheres to a policy of striving to increase transparency and maintain openness. This policy has two main objectives:\n- to enable the financial sector and the public to understand the HKMA’s work as fully as possible, subject to market sensitivities, commercial confidentiality and statutory restrictions on the disclosure of confidential information; and\n- to ensure that the HKMA is in touch with the pulse of society and responds appropriately to public opinion.\n\nThe HKMA strives to achieve the highest international standards of transparency. In addition to maintaining extensive contact with the media, it publishes various journals and special publications in Chinese and English. The HKMA’s bilingual website (www.hkma.gov.hk) contains dedicated sections on economic research, statistics, regulatory resources, consumer information and other topics, as well as a large number of publications, press releases, speeches and briefing papers published by the HKMA. In addition, the HKMA uses social media platforms to communicate more effectively with the public in the digital age. The HKMA office has an information centre, divided into a library and an exhibition hall, which is open to the public for six days a week. Details of the HKMA’s communication and liaison work with the public can be found in the chapter on “Institutional Functions” (pages 157 to 162).\n\nThe frequency with which the HKMA publishes information on the accounts of the Exchange Fund and the Currency Board has been gradually increasing, and the content has become more detailed. In 1999, the HKMA began to participate in the IMF’s Special Data Dissemination Standard for central banks. The HKMA also publishes the meeting minutes of the Currency Board Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, as well as reports on the operation of the Currency Board System. Since 1996, the HKMA’s website has contained banking supervision policies and guidelines.\n\nThe relationship between the HKMA and the Legislative Council is very important for enhancing accountability and transparency. The Chief Executive of the HKMA has undertaken to brief the Legislative Council’s Panel on Financial Affairs on the HKMA’s work and policies three times a year and to answer relevant questions. In addition, representatives of the HKMA attend meetings of the Legislative Council’s panels and subcommittees from time to time to explain and discuss specific issues, and to assist members in reviewing draft legislation.\n\n# Monitoring measures\n\nThe HKMA adopts robust and effective internal and external monitoring mechanisms to ensure a high standard of employee conduct, prudent risk management, and appropriate checks and balances. The internal and external audit functions provide an independent assessment of whether the monitoring mechanisms are adequate and effective.\n\n# Code of conduct\n\nThe Code of Conduct provides guidance on the ethical and legal responsibilities of employees, ensuring that the conduct of employees at all levels complies with specified standards.\n\n# Internal monitoring\n\n# Operational monitoring\n\nAs the first line of defence in risk management, all departments and branches are responsible for assessing the risks in their work processes and establishing appropriate monitoring measures to ensure the smooth day-to-day operation of the HKMA.\n\n# Enterprise risk management\n\nRisk management is also carried out at the corporate level. The Risk Committee, chaired by the Chief Executive of the HKMA, is one of the cornerstones of the corporate risk management framework.\n\nThe Risk Committee reviews and discusses potential and emerging risks identified by departments, and whether the relevant monitoring measures and mitigation strategies are adequate, and determines appropriate follow-up actions.\n\n# Internal audit\n\nThe HKMA’s Internal Audit Division independently assesses whether the governance procedures, risk management and monitoring measures of different departments are adequate and effective, and makes recommendations for improvement.\n\n# External audit\n\nUnder Section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the financial statements of the Exchange Fund are audited by the Audit Commission of the HKSAR Government. The Audit Commission does not charge a fee for this service. The audited financial statements of the Exchange Fund are published in the HKMA’s Annual Report."}
{"zh":"# 經濟及金融環境\n\n面對第五波新冠病毒疫情、金融狀況收緊及充滿挑戰的外圍環境，香港經濟在2022年顯著收縮。勞工市場持續一段時間轉差，其後逐步改善，而通脹則維持溫和。資產市場亦有所受壓。受惠於內地與香港全面通關，預計2023年香港經濟增長將由低位復甦。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 實體經濟活動\n\n受本地及外圍環境各項不利因素拖累，香港經濟在2022年收縮3.5%（表1及圖1）。本地方面，由於香港爆發第五波新冠病毒疫情，私人消費在第1季急跌，其後受惠於社交距離措施逐步放寬及政府消費券計劃的刺激，私人消費再度錄得按季增長。在營商氣氛疲弱及金融狀況收緊下，整體投資支出較2021年顯著下跌。對外方面，隨着外部需求轉弱，加上內地與香港之間的跨境陸路貨運受阻，香港貨物出口下挫。服務輸出依然大致疲弱，部分反映訪港旅遊活動低迷，但其後隨着政府於9月下旬撤銷抵港強制檢疫要求，情況於第4季稍為改善。\n\n圖1 組成部分對實質本地生產總值增長的貢獻\n資料來源：政府統計處\n\n表 1 按開支項目計的實質本地生產總值增長（比對上期）\n註：經季節性調整的本地固定資本形成總額按季增減幅度不詳。\n資料來源：政府統計處\n\n# 通脹\n\n本地通脹壓力於2022年稍升，但仍屬溫和。具體而言，按年基本通脹率逐步上升至12月2%的溫和水平，其中外圍能源及食品價格高企的影響部分被溫和的本地成本壓力所抵銷，尤其是偏軟的房屋租金（圖2）。此外，在經濟活動疲弱下，名義工資增長及商業樓宇租金持續偏軟，亦有助遏抑通脹。2022年全年合計，基本及整體通脹率分別為1.7%及1.9%。\n\n# 勞工市場\n\n疫情下勞工市場狀況在2022年初急速惡化，但隨後持續改善。失業率在4月升至5.4%的高位後，於12月顯著回落至3.5%（圖3），當中大多數行業的失業率均有所下降。總就業人數（圖3）及私營機構職位空缺回升，反映整體勞工需求逐步回復，惟總就業人數仍低於疫情前水平。名義工資和勞工收入的按年升幅亦略為加快。另一方面，與去年同期比較，勞動人口於12月略為減少1.5%，部分原因是勞動人口參與率輕微下跌。\n\n圖2 基本消費物價通脹\n資料來源：政府統計處及金管局職員估計數字\n\n圖3 勞工市場狀況\n資料來源：政府統計處\n\n# 股市\n\n本港股市在2022年出現大幅波動。承接2021年的下行趨勢，恒生指數加速下跌，在2022年10月31日收報14,687點，是自2009年以來的最低水平（圖4）。股市顯著調整，最初是由市場對本地新冠病毒疫情、美國加息及俄烏局勢的憂慮加劇所觸發，其後由於環球金融狀況收緊及內地新冠病毒疫情導致環球經濟前景轉差，令股市調整幅度進一步擴大。股市在年內最後兩個月重拾一些上升動力，部分受到內地優化防疫抗疫措施所支持。恒生指數於年底收報19,781點，較2021年底顯著下跌15.5%，連續第三年下挫。\n\n# 物業市場\n\n在金融狀況收緊及經濟活動疲弱下，住宅物業市場亦有所受壓。樓價於2022年回落15%（圖4），成交量也大幅縮減39%至45,050宗，創下有紀錄以來的新低。儘管樓價下跌，置業負擔能力仍然偏緊。實際按揭利率於年內由約1.6厘上升至3.375至3.625厘，增加供樓人士的按揭供款負擔。非住宅物業市場亦進一步回軟。在空置率高企下，其價格有所回落，租金亦維持偏軟。\n\n圖4 資產價格\n資料來源：差餉物業估價署及香港交易及結算所有限公司\n\n# 經濟前景\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n受惠於內地與香港全面通關，預期2023年香港經濟增長將由低位復甦。儘管先進經濟體增長預期放緩將繼續拖累香港貨物出口，但內地經濟復甦及跨境陸路貨運限制撤銷，應能為本港經濟提供支持。內地與香港全面通關亦有望令香港入境旅遊及其他服務輸出顯著受惠，並提振本地營商氣氛及資本開支。私人消費亦將會在勞工市場轉強下進一步改善。政府預測2023年全年實質本地生產總值會顯著增長，介乎3.5至5.5%。然而，香港經濟增長前景仍受眾多風險及不明朗因素所影響，並很大程度上取決於美國聯邦儲備局政策利率走勢、全球增長前景、地緣政治局勢持續緊張以及本地入境旅遊的復甦步伐。\n\n# 通脹及勞工市場\n\n展望未來，預期本地通脹將輕微上升，但在各種因素互相抵銷下應保持溫和。儘管外圍價格應會維持高企，但由於部分主要經濟體的經濟活動轉弱及商品價格上行壓力緩和，外圍價格的上升動力或會進一步減弱。同樣地，隨着本地經濟復甦及勞工市場改善，本地成本壓力或會輕微上升，但房屋租金偏軟應繼續在一定程度上抵銷其影響。政府預測2023年全年合計的整體及基本通脹率分別為2.9%及2.5%。另一方面，勞工市場狀況有望隨着本地經濟活動復常而進一步改善。\n\n# 銀行體系表現\n\n香港銀行體系在2022年面對充滿挑戰的宏觀經濟環境，包括年初爆發第五波新冠病毒疫情、地緣政治局勢升溫，以及全球各大央行大幅度加息應對通脹上升等。面對各項挑戰，香港銀行應付裕如，資本及流動性狀況繼續保持充裕。年內銀行體系面對的信貸風險增加，但整體資產質素維持於健康水平。與此同時，利率上升促使銀行淨利息收入增加，但其正面影響因呆壞帳準備金增加及費用與佣金收入減少而被局部抵銷。整體而言，零售銀行盈利較2021年改善。\n\n# 資產質素\n\n銀行體系的特定分類貸款比率由2021年底的0.89%上升至2022年底的1.38%，逾期及經重組貸款比率於同期由0.56%升至0.85%（圖5）。中國內地相關貸款的特定分類貸款比率於2022年底為2.21%，亦較2021年底的0.89%上升。特定分類貸款比率上升，主要是由於部分內地房地產發展商的貸款評級被下調。儘管如此，銀行撥備充足，截至2022年底，銀行信貸撥備覆蓋率（即信貸撥備和特定分類貸款比率）約維持於80%。若將抵押品變現價值從呆壞帳餘額中扣除，銀行信貸撥備覆蓋率約140%。另一方面，2022年底住宅按揭貸款及信用卡貸款的拖欠比率仍然處於低位，分別為0.06%及0.23%（圖6）。\n\n圖5 銀行體系的資產質素\n註：數字涵蓋香港辦事處、境外分行及境外主要附屬公司。\n資料來源：金管局\n\n圖6 住宅按揭貸款及信用卡貸款的拖欠比率\n資料來源：金管局\n\n# 盈利走勢\n\n銀行體系在2022年繼續錄得盈利。年內零售銀行的整體除稅前經營溢利上升19.0%（圖7）。盈利改善是受惠於淨利息收入（+34%）及外匯與衍生工具收入增加（+72%），但部分升幅被呆壞帳準備金增加（+151%）及費用與佣金收入減少（–19%）所抵銷。在加息環境下，淨息差由上一年的0.98%擴闊至2022年的1.31%（圖8）。年內市場波動增加，亦令銀行來自外匯及衍生工具業務的收入增加。呆壞帳準備金增加是由於須為新的特定分類貸款預留特殊準備金，而在金融市場表現疲弱下，費用及佣金收入減少。零售銀行成本與收入比率由2021年的54.7%，降至2022年的48.0%（圖9）。\n\n圖7 零售銀行的表現\n資料來源：金管局\n\n圖8 零售銀行淨息差\n資料來源：金管局\n\n圖9 零售銀行成本與收入比率\n資料來源：金管局\n\n# 資產負債表走勢\n\n2022年銀行體系資產負債表擴大2.5%。資產上升是由於外匯及衍生工具持倉按市價計值增加。面對外圍不明朗因素及利率趨升，年內貸款需求減弱。相比2021年錄得3.8%的增幅，2022年貸款總額減少3.0%。其中在香港境外使用的貸款減少10.2%，貿易融資減少13.5%，在香港使用的貸款則稍增0.9%。中國內地相關貸款繼2021年增長3.7%後，於2022年減少4.4%。\n\n在資產負債表的負債方面，銀行體系存款繼續錄得溫和增長。存款總額於2022年增加1.7%，相比2021年的增幅為4.6%。由於貸款總額減少而存款總額增加，整體貸存比率由2021年底的71.8%稍降至2022年底的68.5%（圖10）。\n\n# 資本充足水平\n\n銀行在2022年的資本狀況維持充裕。2022年底本地註冊認可機構的綜合總資本比率為20.1%，相比上一年為20.2%；一級資本比率為18.1%（圖11）。兩者均遠高於相關國際最低要求。《巴塞爾協定三》槓桿比率於2022年底為7.9%（圖12）。\n\n圖10 銀行體系的貸款及存款\n資料來源：金管局\n\n圖11 本地註冊認可機構的綜合資本比率\n資料來源：金管局\n\n圖12 本地註冊認可機構的綜合槓桿比率\n資料來源：金管局\n\n# 流動性狀況\n\n銀行體系的流動性狀況繼續維持穩健，成為在宏觀經濟環境不明朗因素加劇下的重要支柱。第1類機構的季度平均流動性覆蓋比率在2022年第4季為162.3%，第2類機構的季度平均流動性維持比率為63.2%（圖13）。銀行體系的主要資金來源仍然是客戶存款。於2022年底，第1類機構的穩定資金淨額比率及第2A類機構的核心資金比率分別為137.7%及155.7%（圖14）。以上所有4個比率均遠高於法定最低要求。\n\n圖13

Economic and Financial Environment\n\nHong Kong’s economy contracted significantly in 2022 amid the fifth wave of COVID-19, tightening financial conditions and a challenging external environment. The labour market deteriorated for a period before gradually improving, while inflation remained moderate. Asset markets also came under pressure. Thanks to the full resumption of border crossings between mainland China and Hong Kong, the city’s economic growth is expected to recover from a low base in 2023.\n\n# Economic Review\n\n# Real Economic Activity\n\nHong Kong’s economy contracted by 3.5% in 2022, weighed down by various unfavourable local and external factors (Table 1 and Chart 1). Locally, private consumption fell sharply in the first quarter due to the outbreak of the fifth wave of COVID-19 in Hong Kong, but then recorded a quarter-on-quarter increase, benefiting from the gradual relaxation of social distancing measures and the stimulus effect of the government’s consumption voucher scheme. Overall investment expenditure declined significantly compared with 2021, amid weak business sentiment and tightening financial conditions. Externally, Hong Kong’s goods exports slumped as external demand weakened and cross-border land freight between mainland China and Hong Kong was disrupted. Exports of services remained broadly weak, partly reflecting subdued inbound tourism, but the situation improved slightly in the fourth quarter after the government lifted the compulsory quarantine requirement for inbound travellers in late September.\n\nChart 1 Contributions of components to real GDP growth\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\nTable 1 Real GDP growth by expenditure component (compared with previous period)\nNote: The quarter-to-quarter change in seasonally adjusted gross domestic fixed capital formation is not available.\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\n# Inflation\n\nLocal inflationary pressures edged up in 2022 but remained moderate. Specifically, the year-on-year underlying inflation rate rose gradually to a moderate level of 2% in December, with the impact of high external energy and food prices partly offset by moderate local cost pressures, especially soft housing rentals (Chart 2). In addition, subdued economic activity kept nominal wage growth and commercial rentals soft, which also helped to contain inflation. For 2022 as a whole, the underlying and overall inflation rates were 1.7% and 1.9% respectively.\n\n# Labour Market\n\nThe labour market situation deteriorated rapidly in early 2022 amid the pandemic, but then continued to improve. The unemployment rate rose to a high of 5.4% in April, but fell significantly to 3.5% in December (Chart 3), with unemployment rates declining in most industries. Total employment (Chart 3) and private sector vacancies rebounded, reflecting a gradual recovery in overall labour demand, although total employment remained below pre-pandemic levels. The year-on-year growth of nominal wages and labour income also accelerated slightly. On the other hand, the labour force decreased slightly by 1.5% in December compared with the same period last year, partly due to a slight decline in the labour force participation rate.\n\nChart 2 Underlying consumer price inflation\nSource: Census and Statistics Department and estimates by HKMA staff\n\nChart 3 Labour market conditions\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\n# Stock Market\n\nHong Kong’s stock market experienced significant volatility in 2022. Continuing the downward trend of 2021, the Hang Seng Index accelerated its decline, closing at 14,687 on 31 October 2022 – its lowest level since 2009 (Chart 4). The significant market correction was initially triggered by heightened market concerns over the local COVID-19 pandemic, US interest rate hikes and the Russia-Ukraine situation, and was further exacerbated by tightening global financial conditions and a deterioration in the global economic outlook due to the COVID-19 pandemic in mainland China. The stock market regained some upward momentum in the last two months of the year, partly supported by mainland China’s optimisation of its pandemic prevention and control measures. The Hang Seng Index closed at 19,781 at the end of the year, down significantly by 15.5% from the end of 2021, marking the third consecutive year of decline.\n\n# Property Market\n\nThe residential property market also came under pressure amid tightening financial conditions and weak economic activity. Property prices fell by 15% in 2022 (Chart 4), while transaction volume shrank sharply by 39% to 45,050 – a record low. Despite the decline in property prices, housing affordability remained tight. The actual mortgage rate rose from around 1.6% at the beginning of the year to between 3.375% and 3.625%, increasing the mortgage repayment burden for homeowners. The non-residential property market also weakened further. Amid high vacancy rates, prices fell and rents remained soft.\n\nChart 4 Asset prices\nSource: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited\n\n# Economic Outlook\n\n# Economic Environment\n\nThanks to the full resumption of border crossings between mainland China and Hong Kong, the city’s economic growth is expected to recover from a low base in 2023. Although the slowdown in growth in advanced economies will continue to weigh on Hong Kong’s goods exports, mainland China’s economic recovery and the removal of restrictions on cross-border land freight should provide support to the local economy. The full resumption of border crossings between mainland China and Hong Kong is also expected to significantly benefit inbound tourism and other services exports in Hong Kong, and boost local business sentiment and capital expenditure. Private consumption will also improve further as the labour market strengthens. The government forecasts that real GDP will grow significantly, by between 3.5% and 5.5%, for the whole of 2023. However, Hong Kong’s economic growth outlook remains subject to many risks and uncertainties, and depends to a large extent on the interest rate path of the US Federal Reserve, the global growth outlook, continued geopolitical tensions and the pace of recovery in inbound tourism.\n\n# Inflation and Labour Market\n\nLooking ahead, local inflation is expected to rise slightly, but should remain moderate as various factors offset each other. Although external prices should remain high, the upward momentum may weaken further as economic activity softens in some major economies and upward pressure on commodity prices eases. Similarly, as the local economy recovers and the labour market improves, local cost pressures may rise slightly, but soft housing rentals should continue to offset its impact to some extent. The government forecasts that the overall and underlying inflation rates for the whole of 2023 will be 2.9% and 2.5% respectively. On the other hand, labour market conditions are expected to improve further as local economic activity returns to normal.\n\n# Banking Sector Performance\n\nHong Kong’s banking sector faced a challenging macroeconomic environment in 2022, including the outbreak of the fifth wave of COVID-19 at the beginning of the year, heightened geopolitical tensions and significant interest rate hikes by major central banks around the world to combat rising inflation. In the face of these challenges, Hong Kong’s banks coped well, with capital and liquidity conditions remaining robust. The banking sector faced increased credit risks during the year, but overall asset quality remained healthy. Meanwhile, rising interest rates boosted banks’ net interest income, but the positive impact was partly offset by higher provisions for non-performing loans and lower fee and commission income. Overall, retail banking profitability improved compared with 2021.\n\n# Asset Quality\n\nThe banking sector’s specific classified loan ratio rose from 0.89% at the end of 2021 to 1.38% at the end of 2022, while the ratio of overdue and restructured loans rose from 0.56% to 0.85% over the same period (Chart 5). The specific classified loan ratio for mainland China-related loans was 2.21% at the end of 2022, also up from 0.89% at the end of 2021. The rise in the specific classified loan ratio was mainly due to downgrades in the credit ratings of some mainland property developers. Nevertheless, banks had sufficient provisions, with the banking sector’s credit provision coverage ratio (i.e. credit provisions and specific classified loan ratio) remaining at around 80% at the end of 2022. If the realisable value of collateral is deducted from the non-performing loan balance, the banking sector’s credit provision coverage ratio is around 140%. On the other hand, the delinquency ratios for residential mortgage loans and credit card loans remained low at 0.06% and 0.23% respectively at the end of 2022 (Chart 6).\n\nChart 5 Asset quality of the banking sector\nNote: The figures cover Hong Kong offices, overseas branches and overseas major subsidiaries.\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 6 Delinquency ratios for residential mortgage loans and credit card loans\nSource: HKMA\n\n# Profitability Trends\n\nThe banking sector continued to record profits in 2022. Overall pre-tax operating profit of retail banks rose by 19.0% during the year (Chart 7). The improvement in profitability was driven by higher net interest income (+34%) and foreign exchange and derivatives income (+72%), but was partly offset by higher provisions for non-performing loans (+151%) and lower fee and commission income (–19%). In a rising interest rate environment, the net interest margin widened from 0.98% in the previous year to 1.31% in 2022 (Chart 8). Increased market volatility during the year also boosted banks’ income from foreign exchange and derivatives businesses. The increase in provisions for non-performing loans was due to the need to set aside special provisions for new specific classified loans, while fee and commission income declined amid weak financial market performance. The cost-to-income ratio of retail banks fell from 54.7% in 2021 to 48.0% in 2022 (Chart 9).\n\nChart 7 Performance of retail banks\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 8 Net interest margin of retail banks\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 9 Cost-to-income ratio of retail banks\nSource: HKMA\n\n# Balance Sheet Trends\n\nThe banking sector’s balance sheet expanded by 2.5% in 2022. The increase in assets was due to higher mark-to-market valuation of foreign exchange and derivatives positions. Amid external uncertainties and rising interest rates, loan demand weakened during the year. Compared with a 3.8% increase in 2021, total loans decreased by 3.0% in 2022. Of these, loans used outside Hong Kong decreased by 10.2%, trade finance decreased by 13.5% and loans used in Hong Kong increased slightly by 0.9%. Mainland China-related loans, after growing by 3.7% in 2021, decreased by 4.4% in 2022.\n\nOn the liability side of the balance sheet, bank deposits continued to grow moderately. Total deposits increased by 1.7% in 2022, compared with a 4.6% increase in 2021. As total loans decreased while total deposits increased, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio declined slightly from 71.8% at the end of 2021 to 68.5% at the end of 2022 (Chart 10).\n\n# Capital Adequacy\n\nBanks’ capital position remained robust in 2022. The consolidated total capital ratio of locally incorporated authorised institutions was 20.1% at the end of 2022, compared with 20.2% a year earlier; the Tier 1 capital ratio was 18.1% (Chart 11). Both ratios were well above the relevant international minimum requirements. The Basel III leverage ratio was 7.9% at the end of 2022 (Chart 12).\n\nChart 10 Loans and deposits of the banking sector\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 11 Consolidated capital ratios of locally incorporated authorised institutions\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 12 Consolidated leverage ratio of locally incorporated authorised institutions\nSource: HKMA\n\n# Liquidity Position\n\nThe banking sector’s liquidity position remained robust, serving as an important pillar amid heightened uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment. The quarterly average liquidity coverage ratio of Category 1 institutions was 162.3% in the fourth quarter of 2022, and the quarterly average liquidity maintenance ratio of Category 2 institutions was 63.2% (Chart 13). Customer deposits remained the main source of funding for the banking sector. At the end of 2022, the stable funding net amount ratio of Category 1 institutions and the core funding ratio of Category 2A institutions were 137.7% and 155.7% respectively (Chart 14). All four of these ratios were well above the statutory minimum requirements.\n\nChart 13 Liquidity ratios of designated authorised institutions\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 14 Funding ratios of designated authorised institutions\nSource: HKMA"}
{"zh":"# 貨幣穩定\n\n隨着美國收緊貨幣政策，港元在2022年轉弱，弱方兌換保證於5月至11月期間被觸發41次。在本港股市成交轉旺及年底季節性資金需求的帶動下，港元在11月中開始轉強。在聯繫匯率制度下，香港銀行同業拆息大致跟隨美元銀行同業拆息的走勢。由於美國持續加息，香港銀行同業拆息於2022年內逐步上升。整體而言，港元外匯及貨幣市場保持穩定，交易暢順有序。作為香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石，聯繫匯率制度一直展現強大抵禦外來衝擊的能力。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的主要目標是維持貨幣穩定，即確保港元匯價穩定，使港元在外匯市場兌美元的匯率保持在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的區間內。該貨幣體制主要採用貨幣發行局制度，規定由外匯基金所持的美元儲備向貨幣基礎提供最少百分之百的支持；貨幣基礎若有變動，美元儲備亦必須作出相應增減，與貨幣基礎的變動百分之百配合。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n- 負債證明書（為3間發鈔銀行發行的銀行紙幣提供十足支持）；\n- 政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣；\n- 設於金管局的結算戶口結餘總額（即總結餘）；及\n- 金管局代表政府發行的外匯基金票據及債券。\n\n金管局透過自動利率調節機制及履行兌換保證的堅決承諾來維持港元匯率的穩定。當強方（或弱方）兌換保證被觸發，金管局會應銀行要求，按每美元兌7.75港元向銀行沽出港元、買入美元（或按7.85港元買入港元、沽出美元），使總結餘增加（或減少），令港元利率下跌（或上升），從而促使港元匯率回復到7.75至7.85的兌換範圍。\n\n# 2022 年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n受到本港股市調整、市場預期美國進一步加息，以及在香港銀行同業拆息與倫敦銀行同業拆息的負息差下的套息交易帶動，港元在2022年初轉弱，並在其後的月份一直貼近弱方兌換保證水平。弱方兌換保證於5月至11月期間被觸發41次。在本港股市成交轉旺及年底季節性資金需求的帶動下，港元在11月中開始轉強（圖1）。整體而言，港元外匯市場在2022年全年繼續運作正常。\n\n為應付銀行對外匯基金票據的持續需求，金管局於2022年初增發總值400億港元的外匯基金票據。此外，金管局在2022年5月至11月間按照聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）的設計，應銀行要求於弱方兌換保證匯率水平共買入2,421億港元。總結餘由2021年底的3,775億港元，減少至2022年底的963億港元，反映增發外匯基金票據，以及弱方兌換保證被觸發的影響。與此同時，未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額在年內由11,488億港元，稍增至12,004億港元。因此，總結餘與未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額由2021年底的15,263 億港元，減少至 2022 年底的 12,967 億港元（圖2）。整體貨幣基礎仍然由外匯儲備提供十足支持。\n\n圖1 2022年市場匯率\n\n圖2 2022年總結餘（進行貼現窗活動前）及未償還外匯基金票據及債券\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n在聯匯制度下，香港銀行同業拆息大致跟隨美元銀行同業拆息的走勢。由於美國在2022年持續加息，香港銀行同業拆息逐步上升（圖3）。全年計，隔夜、1個月及3個月香港銀行同業拆息分別上升318、419及473基點至年底時的3.23厘、4.35厘及4.99厘。\n\n因應美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍上調，基本利率上調7次，合共4.25個百分點（即425基點），由0.5厘上升至4.75厘（圖3）。在零售層面，隨着美國上調政策利率，多間銀行在9月下旬調高最優惠貸款利率12.5基點，在11月初再調高25基點，以及在12月中再調高25基點。部分銀行亦於年內提高以香港銀行同業拆息為基礎的新批按揭利率上限。整體而言，香港貨幣市場繼續正常運作。貼現窗借貸由2021年的68億港元增至2022年的84億港元。\n\n圖3 2022 年香港銀行同業拆息\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n接近40年來，聯匯制度一直是香港金融體系的重要支柱，展現強大的應對挑戰的能力。儘管2022年全球金融狀況反覆，港元外匯及貨幣市場維持有序運作，反映聯匯制度穩健有效。政府亦堅決維持聯匯制度。國際貨幣基金組織在《2022年對外部門報告》一再重申香港擁有具透明度的規則、龐大的財政及外匯儲備、穩健的金融規管與監管、靈活的經濟，以及審慎的財政架構，確保聯匯制度具公信力。\n\n穩健的銀行體系對聯匯制度的正常運作具關鍵作用。香港銀行體系繼續運作暢順，流動性及資本狀況以國際標準而言均非常充裕。為確保銀行體系具備抵禦衝擊的能力，金管局一直密切監察銀行的信用、流動性及利率風險管理，以及壓力測試結果，並維持對銀行貸款的監管。\n\n為提高貨幣發行局帳目的透明度，自1998年10月起，外匯基金已有部分資產被指定用作支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（即支持資產相對貨幣基礎的比率）於2022年在109.3%至111.0%之間上落，並無觸及上限或下限。該比率於12月31日收報110.1%（圖4）。在聯匯制度下，雖然已指定某些外匯基金資產作為支持組合，但外匯基金的全部資產均可用作支持港元匯率。外匯基金的龐大財政資源，加上香港穩健的銀行體系，為保障香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供強而有力的後盾。\n\n圖4 2022年支持比率每日變動\n\n# 貨幣發行委員會\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的貨幣發行委員會負責監察及探討與香港貨幣及金融穩定有關的課題。在2022年，貨幣發行委員會探討的課題包括中國內地物業市況、非銀行機構在住宅按揭市場的角色、深度學習在信用風險評估上的應用，以及一個用作評估港元流動性的監察框架。貨幣發行委員會會議紀錄及金管局向其呈交的貨幣發行局制度運作報告，均載於金管局網站。\n\n# 紙幣及硬幣\n\n# 香港鈔票\n\n金管局繼續舉辦講座，為銀行櫃位職員、零售店舖的收銀員及學生講解香港鈔票設計及防偽特徵，提高他們鑑別鈔票的知識及技巧。在2022年，金管局共舉辦15場講座，吸引4,200多名參加者。\n\n# 硬幣收集計劃\n\n硬幣收集計劃繼續受到市民歡迎。有關計劃詳情載於《二零二二年可持續發展報告》之「可持續發展的金管局」一章。\n\n# 外匯基金票據及債券\n\n外匯基金票據及債券計劃繼續暢順運作。為應對銀行對外匯基金票據的持續需求及考慮到市場情況，金管局在2022年首兩個月增發總計400億港元外匯基金票據，而總結餘亦因此相應減少。截至2022年底，未償還外匯基金票據及債券名義總值約為12,075億港元（表2）。\n\n表2 未償還外匯基金票據及債券\n\n# 貨幣研究\n\n香港貨幣及金融研究中心（研究中心 完成3份政策研究報告、發表24份研究論文及舉辦16場研討會╱網上研討會，內容涵蓋對香港以至區內具戰略重要性的貨幣與金融研究議題。研究中心亦作出進一步安排，透過全新的開放取用電子期刊發布研究結果，令更廣泛的讀者接收到相關資訊。此外，研究中心在其網站推出全新系列刊物《Insights from Monetary Research Digest》，

Monetary stability\n\nAs the US tightened its monetary policy, the Hong Kong dollar weakened in 2022, with the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking triggered 41 times between May and November. However, the Hong Kong dollar began to strengthen in mid-November, driven by increased trading activity in the local stock market and seasonal funding demand at year-end. Under the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong interbank offered rates generally follow the trend of US dollar interbank offered rates. As the US continued to raise interest rates, Hong Kong interbank offered rates rose gradually in 2022. Overall, Hong Kong’s foreign exchange and monetary markets remained stable, with smooth and orderly transactions. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, the Linked Exchange Rate System has consistently demonstrated a strong ability to resist external shocks.\n\n# Objectives\n\nThe primary objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is to maintain monetary stability, i.e. to ensure the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, so that the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate against the US dollar in the foreign exchange market remains within the range of 7.75 to 7.85 Hong Kong dollars per US dollar. The monetary system primarily adopts a Currency Board System, which stipulates that the US dollar reserves held by the Exchange Fund must provide at least 100% backing to the monetary base; if the monetary base changes, the US dollar reserves must also be adjusted accordingly, matching the change in the monetary base by 100%.\n\nThe monetary base (Table 1) includes:\n- Liability Certificates (which provide full backing for banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks);\n- Banknotes and coins in circulation issued by the government;\n- The aggregate balance of settlement accounts at the HKMA (i.e. the Aggregate Balance); and\n- Exchange Fund Bills and Notes issued by the HKMA on behalf of the government.\n\nThe HKMA maintains the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and a firm commitment to honour the exchange guarantee. When the strong-side (or weak-side) Convertibility Undertaking is triggered, the HKMA will, at the request of banks, sell Hong Kong dollars to banks and buy US dollars at the rate of 7.75 Hong Kong dollars per US dollar (or buy Hong Kong dollars and sell US dollars at 7.85 Hong Kong dollars), causing the Aggregate Balance to increase (or decrease), leading to a fall (or rise) in Hong Kong dollar interest rates, thereby prompting the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate to return to the range of 7.75 to 7.85.\n\n# Review of 2022\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nDriven by adjustments in the local stock market, expectations of further interest rate hikes by the US, and carry trades amid the negative interest rate differential between Hong Kong interbank offered rates and London interbank offered rates, the Hong Kong dollar weakened at the beginning of 2022 and remained close to the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking level in subsequent months. The weak-side Convertibility Undertaking was triggered 41 times between May and November. However, the Hong Kong dollar began to strengthen in mid-November, driven by increased trading activity in the local stock market and seasonal funding demand at year-end (Chart 1). Overall, the Hong Kong dollar foreign exchange market continued to operate normally throughout 2022.\n\nTo meet banks’ continued demand for Exchange Fund Bills, the HKMA issued an additional HK$40 billion of Exchange Fund Bills at the beginning of 2022. In addition, between May and November 2022, in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System, the HKMA bought a total of HK$242.1 billion at the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking exchange rate level at the request of banks. The Aggregate Balance decreased from HK$377.5 billion at the end of 2021 to HK$96.3 billion at the end of 2022, reflecting the impact of the additional issuance of Exchange Fund Bills and the triggering of the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking. Meanwhile, the total amount of outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and Notes increased slightly from HK$1,148.8 billion to HK$1,200.4 billion during the year. As a result, the Aggregate Balance and the total amount of outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and Notes decreased from HK$1,526.3 billion at the end of 2021 to HK$1,296.7 billion at the end of 2022 (Chart 2). The overall monetary base continued to be fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\nChart 1: Market exchange rates in 2022\n\nChart 2: Aggregate balance (before discount window activities) and outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and Notes in 2022\n\n# Monetary market\n\nUnder the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong interbank offered rates generally follow the trend of US dollar interbank offered rates. As the US continued to raise interest rates in 2022, Hong Kong interbank offered rates rose gradually (Chart 3). For the year as a whole, overnight, one-month and three-month Hong Kong interbank offered rates rose by 318, 419 and 473 basis points respectively to 3.23%, 4.35% and 4.99% at year-end.\n\nIn response to the upward adjustment of the target range for the US federal funds rate, the Base Rate was raised seven times by a total of 4.25 percentage points (i.e. 425 basis points), from 0.5% to 4.75% (Chart 3). At the retail level, as the US raised its policy rate, several banks raised their best lending rates by 12.5 basis points in late September, by a further 25 basis points in early November, and by another 25 basis points in mid-December. Some banks also raised the cap on new mortgage rates based on the Hong Kong interbank offered rate during the year. Overall, the Hong Kong monetary market continued to operate normally, with discount window lending increasing from HK$6.8 billion in 2021 to HK$8.4 billion in 2022.\n\nChart 3: Hong Kong interbank offered rates in 2022\n\n# Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nFor nearly 40 years, the Linked Exchange Rate System has been an important pillar of Hong Kong’s financial system, demonstrating a strong ability to cope with challenges. Despite volatile global financial conditions in 2022, Hong Kong’s foreign exchange and monetary markets maintained orderly operations, reflecting the robustness and effectiveness of the Linked Exchange Rate System. The government is also firmly committed to maintaining the system. In its 2022 External Sector Report, the International Monetary Fund reiterated that Hong Kong has transparent rules, substantial fiscal and foreign exchange reserves, sound financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy, and a prudent fiscal framework, which ensure the credibility of the Linked Exchange Rate System.\n\nA sound banking system is crucial to the normal operation of the Linked Exchange Rate System. Hong Kong’s banking system continued to operate smoothly, with ample liquidity and capital by international standards. To ensure that the banking system is capable of withstanding shocks, the HKMA has closely monitored banks’ credit, liquidity and interest rate risk management, as well as stress test results, and maintained supervision of bank lending.\n\nTo enhance the transparency of the Currency Board’s accounts, some of the Exchange Fund’s assets have been designated to back the monetary base since October 1998. The backing ratio (i.e. the ratio of backing assets to the monetary base) fluctuated between 109.3% and 111.0% in 2022, without reaching the upper or lower limits. The ratio closed at 110.1% on 31 December (Chart 4). Under the Linked Exchange Rate System, although certain Exchange Fund assets have been designated as the backing portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets can be used to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. The substantial financial resources of the Exchange Fund, together with Hong Kong’s sound banking system, provide a strong safeguard for Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nChart 4: Daily movements of the backing ratio in 2022\n\n# Currency Board Committee\n\nThe Currency Board Committee, under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, is responsible for monitoring and discussing issues related to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. In 2022, the Committee discussed issues including mainland China’s property market conditions, the role of non-bank institutions in the residential mortgage market, the application of deep learning in credit risk assessment, and a monitoring framework for assessing Hong Kong dollar liquidity. The minutes of the Committee’s meetings and the reports on the operation of the Currency Board System submitted by the HKMA to the Committee are available on the HKMA website.\n\n# Banknotes and coins\n\n# Hong Kong banknotes\n\nThe HKMA continued to organise seminars for bank counter staff, retail shop cashiers and students to explain the design and anti-counterfeiting features of Hong Kong banknotes, enhancing their knowledge and skills in identifying banknotes. In 2022, the HKMA organised 15 seminars, attracting over 4,200 participants.\n\n# Coin collection programme\n\nThe coin collection programme continued to be popular with the public. Details of the programme are set out in the chapter ‘A Sustainable HKMA’ of the 2022 Sustainability Report.\n\n# Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\n\nThe Exchange Fund Bills and Notes programme continued to operate smoothly. To meet banks’ continued demand for Exchange Fund Bills and in view of market conditions, the HKMA issued an additional HK$40 billion of Exchange Fund Bills in the first two months of 2022, resulting in a corresponding decrease in the Aggregate Balance. As at the end of 2022, the total nominal value of outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and Notes was about HK$1,207.5 billion (Table 2).\n\nTable 2: Outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\n\n# Monetary research\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (the Research Institute) completed three policy research reports, published 24 research papers, and held 16 seminars\/webinars, covering topics of strategic importance to Hong Kong and the region in the areas of monetary and financial research. The Research Institute has also made further arrangements to disseminate research findings through a new open-access electronic journal, enabling a wider audience to receive relevant information. In addition, the Research Institute launched a new publication series on its website, Insights from Monetary Research Digest, which provides a high-level, non-technical summary of the Research Institute’s recent research findings for the public.\n\nIn addition to research outputs, the Research Institute organised two international seminars and three online expert webinars to promote dialogue and exchange on economic and financial affairs:\n\n- On 12 April, the Institute co-organised a webinar with the Academy of Finance on the latest macroeconomic developments, the US Federal Reserve’s monetary tightening and the development of the offshore renminbi market. The webinar featured Mr Joseph Yam, former Chief Executive of the HKMA, and Professor Huang Yiping, Deputy Dean and Professor of Economics at the National School of Development, Peking University, as guest speakers. It was live-streamed on multiple platforms, attracting a total of 840,000 online viewers.\n\n- On 24 June, the Institute organised a webinar on the transformation and policy options of China’s real estate industry, featuring Ms Qin Hong, Senior Researcher at the People’s University of China and former Director of the Policy Research Centre of the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, as the keynote speaker. The webinar was moderated by Dr Wang Tao, Head of Asia Economic Research and Chief China Economist at UBS, and attracted nearly 1.13 million online viewers from mainland China, Hong Kong and other parts of the world.\n\n- On 25 August, the Institute co-organised an online workshop on ‘Monetary Policy Spillover Effects’ with the Asian Development Bank and the Bank for International Settlements. The workshop was attended by over 200 experts and scholars from central banks, international financial organisations and academia around the world.\n\n- As a side event of the International Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit, the Institute co-organised a webinar with the Academy of Finance on 2 November, titled ‘Inflation after COVID-19: Inevitable or Avoidable?’. The webinar featured Dr Kieran Walsh, Founder and Chief Economist of International Monetary Watch and former Chief Economist of Invesco, as a speaker, and was attended by nearly 200 economists online.\n\n- On 23 November, the Institute held its 12th Annual International Conference on China’s Economy, with the theme ‘New Stage of China’s Economic Development’. The conference featured a keynote speech by Dr Wang Yiming, Vice Chairman and Director of the Academic Committee of the China Centre for International Economic Exchanges, on the short-term and long-term prospects of China’s economy. In addition, four Chief Economists for Greater China from different investment banks shared their views on China’s pandemic prevention policy, real estate market development, supply chain restructuring and long-term growth prospects in a panel discussion. The conference attracted a total of over 1.18 million online viewers."}

銀行體系穩定\n\n儘管宏觀環境充滿不確定性及挑戰，加上金融市場異常波動，香港銀行體系於2022年維持穩健。年內金管局亦加強對認可機構信用及市場風險管理的監管。此外，鑑於網絡威脅持續增加及銀行業數碼轉型步伐加快，金管局與認可機構緊密合作，提升認可機構的運作穩健性及網絡防衛能力。\n\n操守監管方面，金管局加強有關「先買後付」產品的消費者保障，並就物業轉按交易提供多一種支付安排。金管局又與其他監管機構合作，就虛擬資產的可持續發展制定監管架構，精簡投資產品銷售程序，以及推出全新的信託業務監管制度。年內有關個人信貸資料的「多間信貸資料服務機構」模式下的「信貸資料平台」啟用，並推出新的強制性背景查核計劃，以應對「滾動的壞蘋果」現象。此外，面對因疫情而實施的旅遊限制，金管局協助推出便利措施讓客戶重新啟動銀行戶口。\n\n因應最新的香港洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險評估，金管局與銀行透過公私營夥伴合作（包括反訛騙及洗黑錢情報工作組），鞏固香港的打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集生態圈，以及加強應對騙案。此外，金管局亦與策略夥伴合作，以能更充分了解及有效管理日益複雜的地緣政治環境所帶來的風險及不穩定因素。金管局又透過「反洗錢合規科技實驗室」系列進一步推動業界運用數據及科技，並同時加快金管局在反洗錢工作中採用監管科技的步伐。在國際事務方面，金管局積極參與財務行動特別組織的工作。\n\n在2022年，本地就有關資本充足標準及披露標準等國際監管標準的實施上取得良好進展。此外，金管局亦大力提升業界的軟實力，包括與銀行業合作建立可持續的人才儲備，以及提升現有從業員的技能。年內金管局一直與銀行業緊密合作，改進及精簡監管政策與程序。\n\n金管局亦繼續致力推進在本地及國際層面的工作，以確保香港備有具公信力的處置機制。具體工作包括制定新處置標準；進行地區危機模擬演習，以及在所有具本地系統重要性銀行建立一層新的吸收虧損能力資源，標誌着金管局在提升處置可行性上立下里程碑。\n\n# 目標\n\n金管局的整體目標之一是促進銀行體系的安全及穩定。要達致這個目標，實有賴建立及維持具高度應對能力且能為香港經濟提供所需關鍵金融服務的金融體系。\n\n銀行可能因營運方式，甚或在極端情況下因失序地倒閉而影響銀行體系的穩定。作為監管當局，金融管理專員在保障金融穩定方面擔當重要角色，確保銀行有能力抵禦衝擊及應對危機恢復常態，以最終有助防止出現倒閉。金融管理專員負責對銀行進行審慎監管，以及認可香港的持牌銀行、有限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司（統稱「認可機構」）。\n\n香港的審慎監管制度並非為確保「零風險」而設。作為其中一個處置機制當局，金融管理專員力求確保一旦有認可機構不再可持續經營，能有秩序地處理其倒閉。為此，香港已設立金融機構處置機制，金融管理專員在該機制下為認可機構（以及其他類型機構）的處置機制當局。為落實香港的處置機制，有必要制定處置規則及政策標準、進行處置規劃以排除認可機構處置可行性的障礙，以及建立金管局處置瀕臨倒閉認可機構的運作能力。為有效執行上述工作，金管局採納與國際一致及協調的方法。\n\n金融管理專員亦負責指定及監察某些金融市場基建。金管局監察金融市場基建的目的，是促進有關基建的整體安全及效率、控制系統性風險，以及提高透明度。提升金融市場基建的抗震能力，能保障香港的貨幣與金融體系，避免因金融市場基建運作中斷而可能影響其穩定。\n\n# 2022年回顧\n\n# 牌照事宜\n\n年內金管局核准6個境外交易平台成為貨幣經紀，另有5間持牌銀行及1間有限制牌照銀行被撤銷認可資格。\n\n有關香港的認可機構及本地代表辦事處的更多資訊，請參閱分別載於第283至286頁及第292至295頁的附錄及表D至F。\n\n# 監管工作概覽\n\n在2022年金管局共進行183次非現場審查，涵蓋範圍甚廣，包括認可機構的CAMEL評估、企業管治、風險管理及採用金融科技的情況。為繼續加強認可機構的風險管治水平，金管局與認可機構董事局、獨立非執行董事或董事局轄下委員會共舉行36次會議，並與認可機構及其外聘核數師共舉行38次三方聯席會議。\n\n除了非現場審查工作外，金管局亦對認可機構的各項業務進行定期現場審查。從審慎監管角度而言，信用風險管理為主要監管重點之一。同時，由於銀行運用科技的情況日趨普及，業務操作風險及科技風險管理是另一個監管重點。隨着綠色及可持續銀行業在香港急速發展，金管局亦已進行一輪以氣候風險管理為重點的專題審查。在操守監管方面，金管局對認可機構的證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（強積金）相關業務進行現場審查，並以專題評估作為配合，以審視被評估為屬較高風險的範疇。\n\n表1載有金管局於2022年的監管工作概要。\n\n表1 監管工作概要\n\n# 信用風險\n\n# 信貸增長及資產質素\n\n2022年貸款總額減少3.0%，2021年則增加3.8%。表2列載各類貸款及墊款的增長情況。2022年內地相關貸款總額亦減少4.4%至45,220億港元（表3）。\n\n年內銀行體系受到來自各方面的挑戰和衝擊，包括第五波新冠疫情、地緣政治局勢升溫、主要央行進取的加息步伐及部分內地房地產發展商的財務狀況惡化等。儘管面對上述各種挑戰，銀行體系依然保持穩定及健全。\n\n銀行體系的資產質素在年內惡化，但仍然維持在健康水平。銀行業的特定分類貸款比率於2022年底為1.38%，高於2021年底的0.89%。內地相關貸款的特定分類貸款比率由一年前的0.89%上升至2.21%。\n\n年內金管局提升其風險監察的廣度與深度，並與認可機構緊密聯繫，以便對經濟及市場形勢，以至認可機構的風險管理措施及時作出評估。銀行體系面對的整體信用風險仍屬可控。金管局的償債壓力測試結果顯示，銀行體系繼續維持充足資本緩衝，能承受極端壓力。\n\n金管局在年內進行專題評估，檢視認可機構的信用風險管理，重點放在資產質素、對較易受影響行業的風險承擔、香港以外分行的信用風險，以及提供予私人銀行及財富管理客戶的有抵押貸款。\n\n另一方面，在充滿挑戰的宏觀經濟環境下，越來越多企業面對財政困難，金管局鼓勵認可機構按照《香港企業財務困難處理守則》所載的原則處理企業出現還款困難的情況，從而使個別認可機構能夠從有關貸款機構的共同利益角度出發協調合作。\n\n表3 內地相關貸款增長\n\n# 紓緩客戶的資金周轉壓力\n\n考慮到第五波新冠病毒疫情的打擊，加上外圍與本港經濟的前景仍然複雜多變，金管局聯同「銀行業中小企貸款協調機制」延長「預先批核還息不還本」計劃至2023年7月底。此外，該計劃亦推出及其後優化部分本金還款選項，協助客戶就最終回復正常還款作好準備。\n\n截至2022年底，銀行共批出108,000多宗企業客戶貸款展期及其他支援措施的個案，涉及金額超過1.1萬億港元。個人客戶方面，銀行亦批出81,000多宗住宅按揭還息不還本及其他個人應急貸款的個案，涉及金額超過650億港元。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n金管局自2009年起先後推出多輪逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施，已經加強銀行的風險管理及香港銀行體系抵禦本港樓市一旦逆轉的能力。新批出住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數於2022年12月為57%，而有關按揭成數於2009年9月推出首輪逆周期措施前為64%。新批出按揭的平均供款與入息比率維持在低水平，於2022年12月為39%，而在2010年8月首度推出有關比率上限時為41%（圖1）。\n\n金管局在9月將物業按揭貸款壓力測試的假設按揭利率上升幅度由300基點下調至200基點。金管局作出此決定時已考慮目前的利率環境，以及按揭息率走勢與其過往的長期平均水平。金管局認為此水平已經足夠確保銀行按揭業務風險得到妥善管理。\n\n圖1 新批出住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數及供款與入息比率\n\n# 業務操作及科技風險\n\n過去一年金管局推出多項措施加強銀行體系的運作穩健性。有關措施包括在5月發出《監管政策手冊》新單元「運作穩健性」，載明金管局預期認可機構為確保運作穩健而應維持的管治及管控架構，並舉辦兩場業界對話，增進業界對新標準的了解，以及促進業內的經驗交流（圖示1）。\n\n金管局又就銀行營運的具體範疇提供詳細監管指引，包括客戶資料保障、支付系統運作、雲端運算、支付卡保安及分散式阻斷服務攻擊防禦機制等。\n\n因應不斷轉變的網絡威脅，金管局透過推動銀行採納穩固三重數據備份安排、監察認可機構實施「網絡防衛評估框架」2.0的進度，以及評估銀行應對供應鏈攻擊的能力，力求提升銀行體系的網絡防衛能力。\n\n因應「網絡釣魚」騙案及其他網上詐騙的風險明顯增加，金管局與香港銀行公會（銀行公會）於9月聯合推出以「數碼KEY睇緊啲，撳LINK前要三思！」為主題的新一輪大型推廣活動，提高公眾的防範意識，又在7月與香港警務處合辦工作坊，向銀行講解騙徒的最新犯案手法。\n\n以「數碼KEY睇緊啲，撳LINK前要三思！」為主題的宣傳活動的海報\n\n圖示1 業界對話「邁向運作穩健之旅」\n\n# 流動性及市場風險\n\n面對主要經濟體進一步收緊貨幣政策導致市場波動加劇，金管局加強監察銀行的市場及流動性風險承擔。金管局進行審查，以檢視認可機構的流動性風險管理是否足夠，並聚焦於分散資金來源及集團內部流動性風險管理的制度及管控措施。此外，金管局亦進行審查，以評估認可機構的市場風險管理架構及財資業務管控措施的成效。\n","terms":{"銀行":["bank","banking

Stability of the banking system\n\nDespite macroeconomic uncertainties and challenges, coupled with abnormal volatility in financial markets, Hong Kong’s banking system remained robust in 2022. During the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) also strengthened its supervision of credit and market risk management in authorised institutions. In addition, given the continued increase in cyber threats and the accelerated pace of digital transformation in the banking sector, the HKMA worked closely with authorised institutions to enhance their operational resilience and cyber defence capabilities.\n\nIn terms of conduct supervision, the HKMA strengthened consumer protection for ‘buy now, pay later’ products and introduced an additional payment arrangement for property mortgage refinancing transactions. The HKMA also collaborated with other regulators to develop a regulatory framework for the sustainable development of virtual assets, streamline the sales process for investment products, and introduce a new regulatory regime for trust business. During the year, a credit information platform under the ‘multi-credit information service providers’ model for personal credit information was launched, and a new mandatory background check programme was introduced to address the ‘rolling bad apples’ phenomenon. Furthermore, in response to travel restrictions imposed due to the pandemic, the HKMA facilitated the introduction of measures to enable customers to reactivate their bank accounts.\n\nIn response to Hong Kong’s latest risk assessment on money laundering and terrorist financing, the HKMA and banks strengthened Hong Kong’s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing ecosystem and enhanced their response to fraud cases through public-private partnerships, including the Anti-Deception and Anti-Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce. In addition, the HKMA collaborated with strategic partners to better understand and effectively manage the risks and instability arising from an increasingly complex geopolitical environment. The HKMA also further promoted the use of data and technology in the industry through the ‘Anti-Money Laundering Compliance Technology Lab’ series, while accelerating its adoption of regulatory technology in anti-money laundering work. Internationally, the HKMA actively participated in the work of the Financial Action Task Force.\n\nIn 2022, good progress was made locally in implementing international regulatory standards related to capital adequacy and disclosure requirements. In addition, the HKMA made significant efforts to enhance the industry’s soft power, including collaborating with the banking sector to build a sustainable talent pool and improve the skills of existing employees. During the year, the HKMA worked closely with the banking sector to improve and streamline regulatory policies and procedures.\n\nThe HKMA also continued to advance its work at both the local and international levels to ensure that Hong Kong has a credible resolution mechanism in place. Specific initiatives included developing new resolution standards, conducting regional crisis simulation exercises, and establishing a new layer of loss-absorbing capacity resources in all locally systemically important banks, marking a milestone for the HKMA in enhancing resolution feasibility.\n\n# Objectives\n\nOne of the HKMA’s overall objectives is to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this goal relies on establishing and maintaining a financial system with a high level of resilience that can provide the critical financial services needed by Hong Kong’s economy.\n\nBanks may affect the stability of the banking system due to their operating methods, or even in extreme cases, due to disorderly failures. As a regulatory authority, the Commissioner of Financial Management plays a crucial role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring that banks have the ability to withstand shocks and recover from crises, ultimately helping to prevent failures. The Commissioner of Financial Management is responsible for prudential supervision of banks and for authorising Hong Kong’s licensed banks, restricted licence banks, and deposit-taking companies (collectively referred to as ‘authorised institutions’).\n\nHong Kong’s prudential regulatory regime is not designed to ensure ‘zero risk’. As one of the resolution authorities, the Commissioner of Financial Management strives to ensure that if an authorised institution can no longer operate sustainably, its failure can be handled in an orderly manner. To this end, Hong Kong has established a financial institution resolution mechanism, under which the Commissioner of Financial Management serves as the resolution authority for authorised institutions (and other types of institutions). To implement Hong Kong’s resolution mechanism, it is necessary to develop resolution rules and policy standards, conduct resolution planning to eliminate obstacles to the feasibility of authorised institution resolutions, and establish the HKMA’s operational capability to resolve authorised institutions on the verge of failure. To effectively carry out these tasks, the HKMA adopts an internationally consistent and coordinated approach.\n\nThe Commissioner of Financial Management is also responsible for designating and supervising certain financial market infrastructures. The HKMA’s supervision of financial market infrastructures aims to promote their overall safety and efficiency, control systemic risks, and enhance transparency. Strengthening the resilience of financial market infrastructures safeguards Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems by preventing potential disruptions to their stability caused by operational failures in financial market infrastructures.\n\n# Review of 2022\n\n# Licensing matters\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA approved six overseas trading platforms to become money brokers, while five licensed banks and one restricted licence bank had their authorisation revoked.\n\nFor more information on Hong Kong’s authorised institutions and local representative offices, please refer to the appendices and Tables D to F on pages 283 to 286 and 292 to 295, respectively.\n\n# Overview of supervisory work\n\nIn 2022, the HKMA conducted 183 off-site inspections covering a wide range of areas, including CAMEL assessments, corporate governance, risk management, and the adoption of financial technology by authorised institutions. To further enhance the risk governance level of authorised institutions, the HKMA held 36 meetings with the boards of authorised institutions, independent non-executive directors, or board committees, and 38 tripartite meetings with authorised institutions and their external auditors.\n\nIn addition to off-site inspections, the HKMA conducted regular on-site inspections of various businesses of authorised institutions. From a prudential supervision perspective, credit risk management was one of the main supervisory priorities. At the same time, as banks increasingly use technology, operational risk and technology risk management became another supervisory focus. With the rapid development of green and sustainable banking in Hong Kong, the HKMA also conducted a round of thematic inspections focused on climate risk management. In terms of conduct supervision, the HKMA conducted on-site inspections of authorised institutions’ securities, investment products, insurance, and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) related businesses, complemented by thematic assessments to review areas deemed to be of higher risk.\n\nTable 1 provides an overview of the HKMA’s supervisory work in 2022.\n\nTable 1: Overview of supervisory work\n\n# Credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nTotal loans decreased by 3.0% in 2022, compared with an increase of 3.8% in 2021. Table 2 shows the growth of various types of loans and advances. Total mainland-related loans also decreased by 4.4% to HK$45,220 billion in 2022 (Table 3).\n\nThe banking system faced challenges and shocks from various sources over the year, including the fifth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, heightened geopolitical tensions, interest rate hikes by major central banks, and the deteriorating financial conditions of some mainland property developers. Despite these challenges, the banking system remained stable and sound.\n\nThe asset quality of the banking system deteriorated over the year but remained at a healthy level. The specific classified loan ratio for the banking sector was 1.38% at the end of 2022, higher than 0.89% at the end of 2021. The specific classified loan ratio for mainland-related loans rose to 2.21% from 0.89% a year earlier.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA enhanced the breadth and depth of its risk monitoring and maintained close contact with authorised institutions to assess economic and market conditions, as well as the risk management measures of authorised institutions, in a timely manner. The overall credit risk faced by the banking system remained manageable. The HKMA’s debt repayment stress test results showed that the banking system continued to maintain sufficient capital buffers to withstand extreme stress.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA conducted a thematic assessment to review authorised institutions’ credit risk management, focusing on asset quality, risk exposure to more vulnerable sectors, credit risk of branches outside Hong Kong, and collateralised loans provided to private banking and wealth management customers.\n\nMeanwhile, in a challenging macroeconomic environment, more businesses faced financial difficulties. The HKMA encouraged authorised institutions to handle cases of corporate repayment difficulties in accordance with the principles set out in the “Code of Practice for Handling Corporate Financial Difficulties in Hong Kong”, so that individual authorised institutions could coordinate and cooperate from the perspective of the common interests of the lending institutions concerned.\n\nTable 3 Growth in mainland-related loans\n\n# Relieving customers’ liquidity pressures\n\nGiven the impact of the fifth wave of COVID-19, coupled with the still complex and volatile outlook for the external and local economies, the HKMA, together with the “Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism”, extended the “Pre-approved Principal Repayment Holiday Scheme” until the end of July 2023. In addition, the scheme introduced and subsequently optimised partial principal repayment options to help customers prepare for the eventual resumption of normal repayments.\n\nAs at the end of 2022, banks had approved more than 108,000 cases of loan extensions and other support measures for corporate customers, involving an amount of over HK$1.1 trillion. For individual customers, banks also approved more than 81,000 cases of principal repayment holidays for residential mortgages and other personal emergency loans, involving an amount of over HK$65 billion.\n\n# Property mortgage loans\n\nSince 2009, the HKMA has introduced a number of rounds of countercyclical macroprudential regulatory measures, which have strengthened banks’ risk management and the Hong Kong banking system’s ability to withstand a potential reversal in the local property market. The average loan-to-value ratio of new residential mortgage loans was 57% in December 2022, compared with 64% before the introduction of the first round of countercyclical measures in September 2009. The average debt-to-income ratio of new mortgages remained at a low level of 39% in December 2022, compared with 41% when the cap on this ratio was first introduced in August 2010 (Chart 1).\n\nIn September, the HKMA lowered the assumed mortgage rate increase for property mortgage loan stress tests from 300 basis points to 200 basis points. In making this decision, the HKMA took into account the current interest rate environment and the trend of mortgage rates relative to their historical long-term average. The HKMA considered this level sufficient to ensure that banks’ mortgage business risks were properly managed.\n\nChart 1 Average loan-to-value ratio and debt-to-income ratio of new residential mortgage loans\n\n# Operational and technology risks\n\nOver the past year, the HKMA has introduced a number of measures to strengthen the operational resilience of the banking system. These measures included issuing a new module of the “Regulatory Policy Handbook” on “Operational Resilience” in May, which sets out the governance and control framework that the HKMA expects authorised institutions to maintain to ensure operational resilience, and holding two industry dialogues to enhance industry understanding of the new standards and promote experience sharing within the industry (Chart 1).\n\nThe HKMA also provided detailed regulatory guidance on specific areas of bank operations, including customer data protection, payment system operations, cloud computing, payment card security, and distributed denial-of-service attack defence mechanisms.\n\nIn response to evolving cyber threats, the HKMA sought to enhance the banking system’s cyber defence capabilities by encouraging banks to adopt robust triple data backup arrangements, monitoring authorised institutions’ implementation of the “Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework” 2.0, and assessing banks’ ability to respond to supply chain attacks.\n\nIn response to a marked increase in “phishing” scams and other online fraud risks, the HKMA and the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB) jointly launched a new large-scale promotional campaign in September under the theme “Be more cautious with digital keys, think twice before clicking LINK!” to raise public awareness of preventive measures. In addition, the HKMA co-organised a workshop with the Hong Kong Police Force in July to explain the latest criminal methods used by fraudsters to banks.\n\nPoster for the promotional campaign “Be more cautious with digital keys, think twice before clicking LINK!”\n\nChart 1 Industry dialogue “Journey towards operational resilience”\n\n# Liquidity and market risks\n\nIn the face of further monetary policy tightening by major economies, which led to increased market volatility, the HKMA strengthened its monitoring of banks’ market and liquidity risk exposures. The HKMA conducted reviews to assess whether authorised institutions’ liquidity risk management was adequate, focusing on the diversification of funding sources and the systems and controls for intra-group liquidity risk management.

香港的國際金融中心地位\n\n金管局在2022年多管齊下，在提升香港作為具全球競爭力的國際金融中心的地位方面取得重要進展。\n\n「國際金融領袖投資峰會」舉辦成功，吸引來自約120間環球金融機構超過200位國際及區內領袖參加，不僅鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位，更製造正面的漣漪效應。\n\n在鞏固香港作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐方面，多個範疇均取得理想進展，包括優化金管局與中國人民銀行之間現有的貨幣互換協議，以及金管局的人民幣流動資金安排，確保有足夠人民幣流動性，協助進一步推進離岸人民幣產品及市場發展；與中國人民銀行和證券及期貨事務監察委員會聯合宣布開展「互換通」；與證券及期貨事務監察委員會和香港交易及結算所有限公司合作推出雙櫃台莊家機制，推動人民幣計價股票在香港交易；以及金管局推出多年期計劃，進一步優化金融市場基建及發展債務工具中央結算系統成為亞洲區主要的國際中央證券託管平台。受惠於充足的人民幣流動性，並憑藉世界級的市場基建及內地與香港之間各個互聯互通機制，香港已成為內地資金進入國際市場及國際投資者投資於快速增長的內地市場的首選平台。\n\n金管局在加強香港金融平台的競爭力方面亦取得良好進展，涵蓋債券發行、資產及財富管理、企業財資中心，以及綠色和可持續金融等範疇。為宣傳香港的金融服務，金管局加強向海外及內地持份者的市場推廣工作，讓大家認識香港穩健的金融體系及其帶來的前景。\n\n與此同時，金管局繼續推行「金融科技2025」策略，促進金融業界更廣泛採用金融科技全面鞏固香港的金融科技樞紐地位。快速支付系統「轉數快」繼續穩步增長，登記數目在3月份突破1,000萬個，每日平均交易量亦在9月份超越100萬宗。\n\n金管局繼續積極參與國際及區內的央行及監管組織，對維持金融穩定及促進市場發展的全球工作作出貢獻。\n\n# 概覽\n\n金管局繼續主動提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。於11月，金管局舉辦「國際金融領袖投資峰會」，落實財政司司長在《2022至23年度財政預算案》宣布的計劃。峰會為期3日，雲集國際金融業界翹楚，就如何在各項不確定因素下把握機遇分享各自獨到的觀點。是項活動獲得極大迴響，吸引超過200位來自約120個國際金融機構的重量級嘉賓參加，充分體現全球金融界對香港的支持。\n\n香港進一步鞏固其作為離岸人民幣樞紐的地位，年內離岸人民幣業務穩健增長。香港在促進內地與國際金融市場之間的資金流方面發揮關鍵作用，香港與內地間的互聯互通機制被公認為國際投資者進入在岸資本市場及內地投資者配置離岸資產的首選渠道。在2022年，債券通「北向通」成交額佔境外投資者在中國銀行間債券市場整體成交額的61%。債券通「南向通」及「跨境理財通」自2021年開通以來一直運作暢順。金管局與中國人民銀行（人民銀行）和證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）聯合宣布開展「互換通」，把香港與內地的金融合作進一步擴展至衍生品市場，並強化了香港作為主要離岸人民幣業務樞紐及風險管理中心的地位。金管局與人民銀行之間現有的貨幣互換協議於7月優化，是加強香港作為離岸人民幣業務樞紐的另一重要里程碑。\n\n為在香港提供更多元的人民幣計價產品，由金管局、證監會與香港交易及結算所有限公司（港交所）組成的工作小組完成擴大人民幣在港股市場交易中的使用的可行性研究。工作小組已展開籌備工作，包括推出雙櫃台莊家機制，以優化港幣及人民幣雙櫃台股票的交易機制。\n\n金管局繼續致力提升香港金融平台的競爭力。具體而言，為增加香港作為首選基金管理中心的吸引力，金管局與政府及金融業緊密合作，締造更便利的稅務及監管環境。在推動香港債券市場創新，以及鞏固香港作為區內綠色和可持續金融樞紐的地位方面，亦取得重大進展。與此同時，金管局加強市場推廣，向海外及內地持份者介紹香港的金融服務。\n\n金管局金融科技促進辦公室繼續與各銀行部門聯手實施「金融科技2025」策略，促進業界廣泛採用金融科技，並提升香港作為亞洲金融科技樞紐的地位。年內推行的主要措施包括：\n- 促進合規科技應用及進行金融科技應用評估；\n- 推動批發層面央行數碼貨幣的工作，致力改善跨境支付；\n- 加深在香港發行零售層面央行數碼貨幣（即「數碼港元」或e-HKD）的研究；\n- 推出「商業數據通」；\n- 加強人才培育；\n- 善用資源政策支持金融科技生態圈；\n- 加強跨境金融科技合作；及\n- 推動更廣泛使用快速支付系統「轉數快」。\n\n金融基建的可靠及有效運作，是鞏固香港作為主要國際金融中心地位的關鍵。在2022年，處理銀行同業交易的4個即時支付結算系統（RTGS系統）、債務工具中央結算系統(CMU)及香港交易資料儲存庫均達到100%2的系統可供使用率，高於99.95%的目標水平。債券通「北向通」及「南向通」的交收服務維持暢順。年底時存放在CMU系統的債券中，未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額為12,075億港元，其他債券的未償還總額增至相當於15,733億港元，是2013年以來最高水平。\n\n「轉數快」使用量在2022年繼續增長。截至2022年底共有1,148萬個登記，每日平均交易量較2021年上升40%。除個人對個人支付及商業支付穩步增長外，透過「轉數快」繳付政府帳單、支付予商戶及為儲值支付工具電子錢包或銀行帳戶增值持續增加，是帶動「轉數快」交易量顯著增長的主要原因。\n\n為促進本地零售支付業的安全及效率，金管局根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（《支付條例》）監察6個指定零售支付系統，並監管17個持牌儲值支付工具（其中4個由持牌銀行發行）。年內為繼續協助政府順利實施消費券計劃，金管局協調及促進相關政府部門與就計劃獲委任的儲值支付工具持牌人之間的溝通及合作。\n\n金管局在2023年1月發布加密資產和穩定幣討論文件的總結，歸納就討論文件收集到的意見和金管局的回應。總結文件確認金管局將會以風險為本和靈活的方式監管穩定幣，並闡述預期的監管範圍、主要的監管要求及下一步的工作。\n\n在國際層面，金管局積極參與中央銀行領域的事務，在多個區內及國際委員會擔當領導角色。自2018年起，金管局在東亞及太平洋地區中央銀行會議(EMEAP)3轄下金融市場工作小組連任三屆主席。此外，金管局擔任巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（巴塞爾委員會）轄下政策及標準小組，以及金融穩定理事會轄下非銀行監察專家小組與金融創新網絡的聯席主席，另又領導金融穩定理事會轄下監察金融基準過渡相關監管事項的進度及作出跟進的小組。\n\n# 2022年回顧\n\n# 國際金融領袖投資峰會\n\n「國際金融領袖投資峰會」於11月1日至3日舉行\n\n繼財政司司長在《2022至23年度財政預算案》宣布，金管局於11月舉辦「國際金融領袖投資峰會」。峰會為期3日，反響熱烈，匯聚26位金融業界翹楚就應對經濟、金融、科技及地緣政治不穩定因素，以及如何把握當中的機遇分享獨到觀點和想法。峰會共有超過200位來自約120間全球金融機構的參加者，當中超過40間機構均由集團董事長或行政總裁親自出席。參與峰會的機構不乏位列全球最大的銀行、證券、資產管理、主權財富基金、私募股權與風險投資、對冲基金及保險公司等金融界別。\n\n峰會向全球發出明確訊息，表明香港已經一切復常；全球金融領袖可以親身感受香港獨有的韌性和活力並了解發展亞洲業務的過程中香港可以提供的機遇。\n\n# 香港作為進入內地的主要門戶及全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐\n\n香港致力鞏固其作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位，包括增強離岸流動性、進一步加強與內地金融市場的聯通，以及提升金融市場基建。年內人民幣業務，包括銀行存款、貿易結算、支付及離岸債券發行，繼續錄得穩健增長。在增強流動性、產品開發及擴大互聯互通機制方面，取得令人鼓舞的進展及成績。2022年國際結算銀行三年一度的外匯及衍生工具市場成交額調查結果，再次確認香港作為人民幣外匯中心的領先地位。\n\n債券通「北向通」繼續是國際投資者透過香港的市場基建及金融服務投資內地債券市場的主要渠道。債券通「北向通」於2022年的平均每日成交額達322億元人民幣（較2021年增加25%），佔境外投資者於中國銀行間債券市場整體成交額的61%。\n\n債券通「北向通」於7月份推出技術優化措施，包括將投資者參與境內債券一級市場發行的流程電子化及降低服務費。這些市場為本的優化措施提高債券通「北向通」的運作效率，亦降低投資者的交易成本。\n\n為完善債券通「北向通」的配套，並便利國際投資者管理內地債券投資相關的利率風險，香港與內地於7月宣布開展兩地利率互換市場互聯互通合作（「互換通」）。「互換通」初期會先開通北向交易，讓國際投資者透過香港與內地基礎設施機構之間的連接交易內地的利率互換產品，從而強化香港作為風險管理中心的地位。「互換通」籌備工作正在有序推進，以期盡快開通北向交易。金管局會繼續聯同有關當局及機構探索提供更多元化的風險管理工具，包括推出離岸國債期貨，進一步支持國際投資者投資內地債券市場。\n\n債券通「南向通」於2021年開通以來市場反應正面，運作暢順，交易涵蓋可在香港市場買賣並以多種貨幣計價的主要債券產品。「南向通」促進了離岸人民幣市場的發展，尤其人民幣計價債務工具發行的顯著增長。金管局正與內地有關當局緊密合作，研究優化債券通「南向通」，促進香港債券市場的多元發展。\n","terms":{"銀行":["bank","banking

Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre\n\nIn 2022, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) adopted a multi-pronged approach and made significant progress in enhancing Hong Kong’s status as a globally competitive international financial centre.\n\nThe successful hosting of the International Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit attracted over 200 international and regional leaders from around 120 global financial institutions. This not only consolidated Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre but also generated a positive ripple effect.\n\nHong Kong has made good progress in consolidating its position as a global offshore renminbi (RMB) business hub across several areas. These include optimising the existing currency swap agreement between the HKMA and the People’s Bank of China, as well as the HKMA’s RMB liquidity facility, to ensure sufficient RMB liquidity and help further promote the development of offshore RMB products and markets; jointly announcing the launch of “Swap Connect” with the People’s Bank of China and the Securities and Futures Commission; launching a dual counter market maker mechanism in collaboration with the Securities and Futures Commission and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited to promote the trading of RMB-denominated stocks in Hong Kong; and launching a multi-year HKMA programme to further optimise financial market infrastructure and develop the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) debt instrument central clearing system into a major international central securities depository platform in Asia. Thanks to ample RMB liquidity, world-class market infrastructure and various interconnectivity mechanisms between the mainland and Hong Kong, Hong Kong has become the preferred platform for mainland funds to enter international markets and for international investors to invest in the rapidly growing mainland market.\n\nThe HKMA has also made good progress in enhancing the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform in areas such as bond issuance, asset and wealth management, corporate treasury centres, and green and sustainable finance. To promote Hong Kong’s financial services, the HKMA has stepped up its marketing efforts to overseas and mainland stakeholders to raise awareness of Hong Kong’s robust financial system and its prospects.\n\nMeanwhile, the HKMA continued to implement the “Fintech 2025” strategy to promote wider adoption of fintech in the financial industry and to fully consolidate Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub. The Faster Payment System (FPS) continued to grow steadily, with the number of registrations exceeding 10 million in March and the average daily transaction volume surpassing 1 million in September.\n\nThe HKMA continued to actively participate in international and regional central banks and regulatory organisations to contribute to global efforts to maintain financial stability and promote market development.\n\n# Overview\n\nThe HKMA continued to proactively enhance Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre. In November, the HKMA hosted the International Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit, implementing the plan announced by the Financial Secretary in the 2022–23 Budget. The three-day summit brought together leading figures from the international financial industry to share their unique insights on how to seize opportunities amid various uncertainties. The event received a great response, attracting over 200 heavyweight guests from around 120 international financial institutions, which fully demonstrated the global financial community’s support for Hong Kong.\n\nHong Kong further consolidated its position as an offshore RMB hub, with offshore RMB business growing steadily during the year. Hong Kong plays a key role in facilitating capital flows between the mainland and international financial markets, and the interconnectivity mechanisms between Hong Kong and the mainland are recognised as the preferred channels for international investors to access onshore capital markets and for mainland investors to allocate offshore assets. In 2022, Bond Connect Northbound trading volume accounted for 61% of total trading volume by foreign investors in China’s interbank bond market. Bond Connect Southbound and Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect have been operating smoothly since their launch in 2021. The HKMA, together with the People’s Bank of China and the Securities and Futures Commission, jointly announced the launch of “Swap Connect”, which further expanded financial cooperation between Hong Kong and the mainland to the derivatives market and strengthened Hong Kong’s position as a major offshore RMB business hub and risk management centre. The optimisation of the existing currency swap agreement between the HKMA and the People’s Bank of China in July was another important milestone in strengthening Hong Kong’s position as an offshore RMB business hub.\n\nTo provide more diversified RMB-denominated products in Hong Kong, a working group comprising the HKMA, the Securities and Futures Commission and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited completed a feasibility study on expanding the use of RMB in Hong Kong’s stock market. The working group has started preparatory work, including launching a dual counter market maker mechanism to optimise the trading mechanism for dual counter stocks denominated in HKD and RMB.\n\nThe HKMA continued to work to enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. Specifically, to increase Hong Kong’s attractiveness as a preferred fund management centre, the HKMA worked closely with the government and the financial industry to create a more favourable tax and regulatory environment. Significant progress was also made in promoting innovation in Hong Kong’s bond market and consolidating Hong Kong’s position as a regional hub for green and sustainable finance. At the same time, the HKMA stepped up its marketing efforts to introduce Hong Kong’s financial services to overseas and mainland stakeholders.\n\nThe HKMA’s Fintech Facilitation Office continued to work with various banking sectors to implement the “Fintech 2025” strategy, promote wider adoption of fintech in the industry, and enhance Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia. The key measures implemented during the year included:\n- Promoting the application of Regtech and conducting fintech application assessments;\n- Advancing work on wholesale central bank digital currency to improve cross-border payments;\n- Deepening research on the issuance of retail central bank digital currency (i.e. “e-HKD”) in Hong Kong;\n- Launching the Commercial Data Pipeline;\n- Strengthening talent development;\n- Leveraging resources to support the fintech ecosystem through policy measures;\n- Strengthening cross-border fintech cooperation; and\n- Promoting wider use of the Faster Payment System (FPS).\n\nThe reliable and efficient operation of financial infrastructure is key to consolidating Hong Kong’s position as a major international financial centre. In 2022, the four real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems for processing interbank transactions, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) debt instrument central clearing system, and the Hong Kong Trade Repository all achieved a system availability rate of 100%*, exceeding the target level of 99.95%. The settlement services of Bond Connect Northbound and Southbound remained smooth. At the end of the year, the outstanding amount of Exchange Fund bills and notes held in the CMU system was HK$1,207.5 billion, and the outstanding amount of other bonds increased to the equivalent of HK$1,573.3 billion, the highest level since 2013.\n\nThe usage of FPS continued to grow in 2022. As of the end of 2022, there were 11.48 million registrations, and the average daily transaction volume increased by 40% compared with 2021. In addition to steady growth in person-to-person payments and commercial payments, the significant increase in FPS transaction volume was mainly driven by the continued increase in the use of FPS for paying government bills, making payments to merchants, and topping up stored value payment instruments, electronic wallets or bank accounts.\n\nTo promote the safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA monitored six designated retail payment systems and supervised 17 licensed stored value payment instruments (four of which were issued by licensed banks) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (the Payment Ordinance). During the year, to continue to assist the government in the smooth implementation of the consumption voucher scheme, the HKMA coordinated and facilitated communication and cooperation between relevant government departments and the appointed licensees of stored value payment instruments for the scheme.\n\nIn January 2023, the HKMA published a summary of the discussion paper on crypto-assets and stablecoins, summarising the views collected on the discussion paper and the HKMA’s responses. The summary confirmed that the HKMA would adopt a risk-based and flexible approach to regulate stablecoins and set out the expected regulatory scope, key regulatory requirements and next steps.\n\nAt the international level, the HKMA actively participated in central banking affairs and played a leadership role in various regional and international committees. Since 2018, the HKMA has served three consecutive terms as chair of the Financial Markets Working Group under the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia and Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP)*. In addition, the HKMA served as co-chair of the Policy and Standards Group under the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) and the Non-Bank Monitoring Expert Group and Financial Innovation Network under the Financial Stability Board, and led a group under the Financial Stability Board to monitor progress and follow up on regulatory matters related to the transition of financial benchmarks.\n\n# Review of 2022\n\n# International Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit\n\nThe International Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit was held from 1 to 3 November.\n\nFollowing the announcement by the Financial Secretary in the 2022–23 Budget, the HKMA hosted the International Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit in November. The three-day summit was well received, bringing together 26 leading figures from the financial industry to share their insights on addressing economic, financial, technological and geopolitical instability, as well as seizing opportunities. The summit attracted over 200 participants from around 120 global financial institutions, with more than 40 institutions represented by their group chairmen or CEOs in person. Participating institutions included some of the world’s largest banks, securities firms, asset managers, sovereign wealth funds, private equity and venture capital firms, hedge funds and insurance companies.\n\nThe summit sent a clear message to the world that Hong Kong had returned to normalcy; global financial leaders could experience Hong Kong’s unique resilience and vitality for themselves and understand the opportunities Hong Kong could offer in developing business in Asia.\n\n# Hong Kong as a key gateway to the mainland and a global offshore RMB business hub\n\nHong Kong is committed to consolidating its position as a global offshore RMB business hub by enhancing offshore liquidity, further strengthening connectivity with the mainland’s financial markets, and improving financial market infrastructure. During the year, RMB business, including bank deposits, trade settlement, payments and offshore bond issuance, continued to grow steadily. Encouraging progress and achievements were made in enhancing liquidity, product development and expanding interconnectivity mechanisms. The results of the Bank for International Settlements’ triennial survey of foreign exchange and derivatives market turnover in 2022 once again confirmed Hong Kong’s leading position as an RMB foreign exchange centre.\n\nBond Connect Northbound remained the main channel for international investors to invest in the mainland’s bond market through Hong Kong’s market infrastructure and financial services. In 2022, the average daily trading volume of Bond Connect Northbound was RMB 32.2 billion (up 25% from 2021), accounting for 61% of total trading volume by foreign investors in China’s interbank bond market.\n\nIn July, Bond Connect Northbound introduced technical optimisation measures, including digitalising the process for investors to participate in onshore bond primary market issuance and reducing service fees. These market-based optimisation measures improved the operational efficiency of Bond Connect Northbound and reduced transaction costs for investors.\n\nTo improve the supporting facilities of Bond Connect Northbound and facilitate international investors in managing interest rate risks associated with mainland bond investments, Hong Kong and the mainland announced in July the launch of a mutual access scheme between the two places’ interest rate swap markets (“Swap Connect”). In the initial stage, Swap Connect will first open northbound trading, allowing international investors to trade mainland interest rate swap products through the connection between Hong Kong and mainland infrastructure institutions, thereby strengthening Hong Kong’s position as a risk management centre. The preparatory work for Swap Connect is progressing in an orderly manner with a view to launching northbound trading as soon as possible. The HKMA will continue to work with relevant authorities and institutions to explore the provision of more diversified risk management tools, including the launch of offshore Treasury futures, to further support international investors in investing in the mainland’s bond market.\n\nSince its launch in 2021, Bond Connect Southbound has received positive market feedback and operated smoothly, with transactions covering major bond products tradable in the Hong Kong market and denominated in multiple currencies. Southbound Connect has promoted the development of the offshore RMB market, particularly the significant growth in the issuance of RMB-denominated debt instruments. The HKMA is working closely with relevant mainland authorities to study the optimisation of Bond Connect Southbound to promote the diversified development of Hong Kong’s bond market."}
{"zh":"# 儲備管理\n\n2022年的投資環境異常動盪，多種資產類別的價格同時下挫，不僅打破同時持有股票與債券可產生緩減風險作用的傳統投資智慧，更成為近半世紀以來唯一一次股票、債券及主要非美元貨幣匯兌同時錄得負回報的一年。在如此惡劣的投資環境下，外匯基金在2022年錄得投資回報率負4.5%。與年內大部分多元資產基金蒙受重大虧損的情況相比，外匯基金的表現反映金管局的多元化長期資產配置，以及因應外圍最新局勢變化而作出的防禦性部署及戰略性調整，有效減低市場風暴帶來的衝擊。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》，外匯基金的首要目的是直接或間接影響港元匯價，亦可運用於保持香港貨幣及金融體系穩定健全，藉此保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。金管局根據財政司司長轉授的權力及轉授權力的條款，就外匯基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標及組合架構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會為外匯基金制定下列投資目標：\n(i) 保障資本；\n(ii) 確保整體貨幣基礎在任何時候都由流通性極高的美元資產提供十足支持；\n(iii) 確保流動資金足以維持貨幣及金融穩定；以及\n(iv) 在符合上述(i)至(iii)項的前提下盡量爭取投資回報，以保障外匯基金的長期購買力。\n\n以上目標全面顧及外匯基金的法定目的，並已於外匯基金的組合架構及目標資產配置中反映（圖示1）。\n\n圖示1 外匯基金的投資組合類別\n\n外匯基金大致上分成兩個主要組合：支持組合及投資組合。支持組合持有流通性極高的美元資產，按照貨幣發行局制度的規定為貨幣基礎提供十足支持。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員經濟體的債市及股市，以保障資產的價值及長期購買力。\n\n為能更妥善管理風險及提高中長期回報，金管局以審慎及循序漸進方式將外匯基金的部分資產配置於較多元化的資產類別，包括新興巿場及內地債券與股票、私募股權（包括基建）及房地產。新興巿場及內地債券與股票由投資組合持有，私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合持有。長期增長組合的目標資產配置與其他資產類別的配置，按審慎的風險管理原則及資產組合多元化策略一起制定。\n\n策略性資產組合於2007年設立，一直持有政府基於策略性目的而為外匯基金帳目購入的香港交易及結算所有限公司股份。由於這個組合性質獨特，因此外匯基金的投資表現評估並無將其包括在內。\n\n# 於外匯基金的存款\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定組織的存款，利率一般與投資組合的表現掛鈎，但未來基金屬主要個別例子。未來基金存款的利率與投資組合及長期增長組合的回報掛鈎，實際利率視乎組合比重而定。未來基金在投資組合與長期增長組合的比重於2022年約為35：65。\n\n# 投資程序\n\n外匯基金的投資程序分別以策略性資產配置及戰略性資產配置作基礎。策略性資產配置以投資基準方式反映，亦即外匯基金為達到投資目標而可作出的長線資產配置。外匯基金以策略性配置作為指引，透過戰略性的資產配置，以爭取超越基準的回報。因此，實際配置往往會與基準配置（亦即策略性配置）有所偏離，而實際與基準配置之間的差距稱為「戰略性偏離」。財政司司長經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後制定投資基準及循跡誤差限額，金管局獲授權決定戰略性資產配置及定出戰略性偏離的容許範圍。投資組合經理可在戰略性偏離的容許範圍內管理倉盤，從短期市場變化中獲利。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局的外匯基金投資辦公室專責外匯基金的投資及相關風險管理職能。該辦公室職員負責直接管理外匯基金約70%的投資，包括整個支持組合及部分投資組合。該部分內部管理的投資組合包括不同的環球定息市場投資，並透過衍生工具執行外匯基金的宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 外聘投資經理\n\n除透過內部職員管理資產外，金管局亦僱用外聘投資經理負責管理外匯基金約30%的資產，包括所有上市股票組合及其他特別資產類別。僱用外聘投資經理的目的是要運用市場上最佳的專業投資專才為外匯基金投資，獲取可持續回報，並讓外匯基金受惠於多元化及互補的投資方式，以及汲取市場心得與專門的投資知識。\n\n僱用外聘投資經理的相關支出包括基金管理與託管費、交易費、預扣稅及其他稅項。這些支出主要受市場因素影響而每年不同。\n\n# 風險管理及監察\n\n投資環境越趨複雜，風險管理的重要性不言而喻。金管局為內部及外聘投資經理所管理的投資組合均訂下嚴格管控措施及投資指引，並設立嚴謹的風險監察及合規制度。金管局為投資相關活動設有三重防線，以實施有效的風險管理及管治。金管局定期監察主要投資風險類別（包括信用、市場、流動性及業務操作風險），而風險管理程序的設置為外匯基金的策略性規劃及多元化投資提供穩健的框架。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n金管局相信透過適度強調負責任投資及考慮各項投資的可持續長期表現，可更有效達致外匯基金的投資目標，並且減低投資活動涉及的環境、社會及管治(ESG)相關風險。當ESG投資與其他投資項目的經風險調整長期收益相若時，金管局一般會按既定指導性原則優先考慮ESG投資，並已將ESG因素併入外匯基金的公開市場及私募市場的投資管理過程中。有關金管局的負責任投資框架及落實情況，詳見《二零二二年可持續發展報告》之「負責任投資」一章。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2022 年的金融市場\n\n2022年環球金融市場異常波動，債市及股市分別累計下跌16.2%及19.8%，跌幅顯著。\n\n受累於全球通脹飆升、緊縮貨幣政策及經濟增長放緩，年內主要股市指數大幅下挫。儘管環球股市因市場出現通脹及利率見頂的憧憬而於年末稍作反彈，年內美國標準普爾500指數仍下跌19.4%，香港恒生指數則下跌15.5%。\n\n由於各國央行進取加息以對抗通脹，觸發主要市場國債收益率持續飆升。美國10年期國債收益率從2022年初的1.63%一直攀升，至第4季升穿4%，達2008年以來最高水平。美國國債收益率曲線自年中開始已出現倒掛，幅度不斷擴大，加深市場對經濟衰退的憂慮。\n\n貨幣市場方面，在美國聯邦儲備局連續加息帶動下，美元在2022年大幅走強。其他主要貨幣，包括歐元、英鎊、日圓及人民幣兌美元匯率大幅貶值，其中英鎊及日圓兌美元分別貶值10.7%及12.2%。\n\n表1列載主要貨幣、債巿及股市在2022年的表現。\n\n表1 2022年市場回報\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n外匯基金在2022年錄得2,054億港元的投資虧損，其中包括債券投資虧損532億港元、股票投資虧損805億港元（其中包括境外股票投資虧損610億港元及香港股票投資虧損195億港元）、非港元資產外匯估值下調400億港元，以及外匯基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資虧損317億港元。另一方面，策略性資產組合錄得87億港元估值虧損。\n\n於2022年年底，外匯基金的資產總值達40,080億港元。長期增長組合投資的總市值為4,847億港元，其中私募股權為3,700億港元，房地產為1,147億港元。長期增長組合中已承擔但尚未提取作投資的總額為2,708億港元。\n\n外匯基金（不包括策略性資產組合）在2022年的投資回報率為負4.5%，其中投資組合的回報率為負8.6%，支持組合為負0.4%。長期增長組合自2009年開展投資以來的內部回報率年率為12.6%。\n\n圖1列明外匯基金由1994至2022年的年度回報率。表2顯示外匯基金在2022年的投資回報率及不同年期的平均投資回報率。外匯基金在2020至2022年的平均回報率為1.5%、2018至2022年為2.3%、2013至2022年為2.4%，以及自1994年起計為4.5%。表3列載外匯基金資產於2022年12月31日的貨幣比重。\n\n有關外匯基金的經審計2022年度財務報表，見第173至281頁。\n\n圖1

Reserve Management\n\nThe investment environment in 2022 was exceptionally turbulent, with prices falling simultaneously across multiple asset classes. This not only undermined the traditional investment principle that holding both stocks and bonds can mitigate risk, but also marked the only year in nearly half a century in which stocks, bonds and major non-US dollar currencies all recorded negative returns. In such an adverse investment environment, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment return of negative 4.5% in 2022. Compared with the significant losses incurred by most multi-asset funds during the year, the performance of the Exchange Fund reflects the HKMA’s diversified long-term asset allocation, as well as its defensive deployment and strategic adjustments in response to the latest external developments, which effectively mitigated the impact of market turmoil.\n\n# Exchange Fund\n\nAccording to the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the primary purpose of the Exchange Fund is to influence the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar directly or indirectly. It can also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems, thereby preserving Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre. The HKMA is accountable to the Financial Secretary for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund, based on the powers delegated and sub-delegated by the Financial Secretary.\n\n# Management of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n(i) to preserve capital;\n(ii) to ensure that the overall monetary base is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar assets at all times;\n(iii) to ensure that liquidity is sufficient to maintain monetary and financial stability; and\n(iv) to achieve investment returns, within the constraints of (i) to (iii) above, to preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Exchange Fund.\n\nThese objectives fully take into account the statutory purpose of the Exchange Fund and are reflected in the Fund’s portfolio structure and target asset allocation (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 Categories of the Exchange Fund’s investment portfolio\n\nThe Exchange Fund is broadly divided into two main portfolios: the Backing Portfolio and the Investment Portfolio. The Backing Portfolio holds highly liquid US dollar assets to provide full backing to the monetary base in accordance with the requirements of the Currency Board System. The Investment Portfolio primarily invests in bond and equity markets of economies that are members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance medium- to long-term returns, the HKMA has prudently and progressively allocated part of the Exchange Fund’s assets to more diversified asset classes, including emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure) and real estate. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held by the Investment Portfolio, while private equity and real estate investments are held by the Long-term Growth Portfolio. The target asset allocation of the Long-term Growth Portfolio and other asset classes is formulated together in accordance with prudent risk management principles and asset portfolio diversification strategies.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio was established in 2007 and has been holding shares of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited purchased by the Government for strategic purposes on behalf of the Exchange Fund’s accounts. Due to its unique nature, this portfolio is not included in the assessment of the Exchange Fund’s investment performance.\n\n# Deposits in the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund accepts deposits from fiscal reserves, government funds and statutory bodies from time to time. The interest rates are generally linked to the performance of the investment portfolio, with the exception of the Future Fund, which is a major individual case. The interest rate of the Future Fund’s deposits is linked to the returns of the Investment Portfolio and the Long-term Growth Portfolio, with the actual interest rate depending on the portfolio weighting. The weighting of the Future Fund in the Investment Portfolio and the Long-term Growth Portfolio was approximately 35:65 in 2022.\n\n# Investment process\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s investment process is based on both strategic and tactical asset allocation. Strategic asset allocation is reflected in the form of an investment benchmark, which represents the long-term asset allocation that the Exchange Fund can make to achieve its investment objectives. The Exchange Fund uses strategic allocation as a guide and seeks to achieve returns above the benchmark through tactical asset allocation. Therefore, actual allocation often deviates from the benchmark allocation (i.e. the strategic allocation), and the difference between the actual and benchmark allocations is called a “tactical deviation”. The Financial Secretary, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, sets the investment benchmark and tracking error limits, and the HKMA is authorised to determine the tactical asset allocation and set the permissible range of tactical deviations. Portfolio managers can manage positions within the permissible range of tactical deviations to profit from short-term market changes.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nThe Exchange Fund Investment Office of the HKMA is responsible for the investment and related risk management functions of the Exchange Fund. The Office’s staff are responsible for directly managing about 70% of the Exchange Fund’s investments, including the entire Backing Portfolio and part of the Investment Portfolio. This internally managed portion of the portfolio includes various global fixed-income market investments and executes the Exchange Fund’s macro risk management strategy through derivatives.\n\n# External investment managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets through internal staff, the HKMA also employs external investment managers to manage about 30% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all listed equity portfolios and other special asset classes. The purpose of employing external investment managers is to utilise the best professional investment expertise available in the market to invest the Exchange Fund’s assets to achieve sustainable returns, and to enable the Exchange Fund to benefit from diversified and complementary investment approaches, as well as to gain market insights and specialised investment knowledge.\n\nThe expenses associated with employing external investment managers include fund management and custody fees, transaction fees, withholding tax and other taxes. These expenses vary from year to year and are mainly affected by market factors.\n\n# Risk management and monitoring\n\nAs the investment environment becomes increasingly complex, the importance of risk management cannot be overstated. The HKMA has established strict control measures and investment guidelines for portfolios managed by both internal and external investment managers, and has put in place a rigorous risk monitoring and compliance system. The HKMA has established three lines of defence for investment-related activities to implement effective risk management and governance. The HKMA regularly monitors major investment risk categories (including credit, market, liquidity and operational risks), and the risk management process provides a robust framework for the strategic planning and diversified investment of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nThe HKMA believes that by appropriately emphasising responsible investment and considering the sustainable long-term performance of investments, the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund can be achieved more effectively, and the environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks associated with investment activities can be reduced. When ESG investments have long-term risk-adjusted returns comparable to those of other investment projects, the HKMA generally gives priority to ESG investments in accordance with established guiding principles, and has integrated ESG factors into the investment management process of the Exchange Fund in both public and private markets. For details on the HKMA’s responsible investment framework and implementation, please refer to the “Responsible Investment” chapter of the 2022 Sustainability Report.\n\n# Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Financial markets in 2022\n\nGlobal financial markets were exceptionally volatile in 2022, with bond and equity markets falling by 16.2% and 19.8% cumulatively, respectively, representing a significant decline.\n\nMajor equity indices fell sharply during the year, weighed down by soaring global inflation, tightening monetary policy and slowing economic growth. Despite a slight rebound in global equities towards the end of the year on expectations that inflation and interest rates had peaked, the US S&P 500 index still fell by 19.4% during the year, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index fell by 15.5%.\n\nAs central banks around the world raised interest rates to combat inflation, yields on government bonds in major markets continued to soar. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury bond rose from 1.63% at the beginning of 2022 to above 4% in the fourth quarter, the highest level since 2008. The US Treasury yield curve has been inverted since mid-year, with the extent of the inversion widening, deepening market concerns about an economic recession.\n\nIn the currency market, the US dollar strengthened significantly in 2022, driven by successive interest rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve. Other major currencies, including the euro, the pound sterling, the yen and the renminbi, depreciated significantly against the US dollar, with the pound sterling and the yen depreciating by 10.7% and 12.2% against the US dollar, respectively.\n\nTable 1 shows the performance of major currencies, bond markets and equity markets in 2022.\n\nTable 1 Market returns in 2022\n\n# Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment loss of HK$205.4 billion in 2022, comprising a loss of HK$53.2 billion from bond investments, a loss of HK$80.5 billion from equity investments (including a loss of HK$61 billion from foreign equity investments and a loss of HK$19.5 billion from Hong Kong equity investments), a negative foreign exchange valuation adjustment of HK$40 billion for non-Hong Kong dollar assets, and a loss of HK$31.7 billion from other investments held by the Exchange Fund’s investment holding subsidiaries. On the other hand, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation loss of HK$8.7 billion.\n\nAt the end of 2022, the total assets of the Exchange Fund amounted to HK$4,008 billion. The total market value of the Long-term Growth Portfolio’s investments was HK$484.7 billion, of which private equity accounted for HK$370 billion and real estate accounted for HK$114.7 billion. The total amount committed but not yet drawn down for investment in the Long-term Growth Portfolio was HK$270.8 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund (excluding the Strategic Portfolio) was negative 4.5% in 2022, with the Investment Portfolio returning negative 8.6% and the Backing Portfolio returning negative 0.4%. The annualised internal rate of return of the Long-term Growth Portfolio since the commencement of investment in 2009 was 12.6%.\n\nFigure 1 shows the annual returns of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2022. Table 2 shows the investment returns of the Exchange Fund in 2022 and the average investment returns over different periods. The average return of the Exchange Fund was 1.5% from 2020 to 2022, 2.3% from 2018 to 2022, 2.4% from 2013 to 2022, and 4.5% since 1994. Table 3 shows the currency weighting of the Exchange Fund’s assets as at 31 December 2022.\n\nThe audited financial statements of the Exchange Fund for the year 2022 can be found on pages 173 to 281.\n\nFigure 1 Investment returns of the Exchange Fund (1994–2022)"}

名。\n\n金管局教育及聯繫公眾，提醒他們如何做個精明及負責任的金融服務消費者。鑑於「網絡釣魚」騙案增加，金管局推出跨媒體宣傳活動，進一步提醒市民防範聲稱來自銀行的手機短訊和電郵所載的偽冒超連結，並慎防涉及存款與信用卡等其他類型的行騙手法。金管局亦舉辦電台及社交媒體宣傳活動，發放信用卡、個人貸款、網上購物及其他支付方式（包括「先買後付」產品）的精明使用貼士。\n\n以「數碼KEY睇緊啲，撳LINK前要三思！」為題的全新短片\n\n為協助市民與時並進，緊貼金融科技服務的發展，金管局透過社交媒體及電台宣傳鼓勵公眾於農曆新年期間派發電子利是。金管局製作動畫短片，講解開放API，並介紹利用第三方服務供應商（例如網上購物平台及按揭服務公司）的手機應用程式使用銀行服務需注意的事項。動畫短片亦介紹「轉數快」的App-to-App及Web-to-App支付功能及優點。\n\n動畫短片有助增進公眾的數碼金融知識\n\n金管局亦致力加深公眾對金融業的認識，並提高年輕一代投身金管局及業界的興趣。在新製作的訪問短片中，金管局見習經理計劃的畢業生現身說法，不但向有意投考的人士介紹計劃內容，亦增進他們對金管局工作的認識。\n\n見習經理計劃畢業生分享如何準備面試\n\n為提高中學生的理財知識，金管局聯同多個相關機構合辦連續第8屆的「全港理財爭霸戰」。今屆主題是綠色及可持續金融，學生透過網上問答比賽（參賽人次為歷年之冠）、網絡研討會及設計思維比賽吸收新知識。\n\n學生在設計思維比賽中講解具綠色及可持續元素的創意方案，以滿足管理個人財務需要\n\n金管局在2021至22學年內分別在3月特別假期及8月暑假期間推出「小小理財師」網上親子理財教育活動，透過動畫短片、講故事、製作簡單玩具以及金融與幼兒教育專家的分享環節，讓幼稚園及初小學生學習紙幣與硬幣、銀行與支付服務基本概念，以及理財知識。\n\n兒童透過網上學習理財概念及技巧\n\n# 財務披露\n\n為維持高透明度，金管局採納適用於中央銀行運作的國際財務披露標準，包括香港財務報告準則及其他適用的匯報要求（例如國際貨幣基金組織的數據公布特殊標準）。財務處在獨立審計師及其他會計專業人員協助下，按照香港財務報告準則編製外匯基金財務報表。此外，金管局在《年報》詳細披露及深入分析各支出項目及預算資料。\n\n# 問責性及監控\n\n# 風險管理\n\n管理貨幣及銀行體系的風險是金管局最重要的工作之一。風險管理除了體現於策略制定外，亦應用於日常運作層面。金管局的風險管理框架設有兩個高層次委員會，即宏觀監察委員會及風險委員會；兩者均由金管局總裁擔任主席。\n\n宏觀監察委員會的職權範圍如下：\n- 識別香港貨幣及金融體系所面對的潛在風險與威脅，並商討可行對策；\n- 檢討現行貨幣及金融體系的風險管理措施，識別可能存在的漏洞，並確保措施完善；及\n- 鼓勵跨部門分享宏觀監察資訊，從而提高金管局的宏觀監察能力。\n\n風險委員會的職權範圍如下：\n- 識別金管局面對的潛在風險及威脅，並制定策略以減輕有關影響；\n- 檢討各部門現行的風險管理制度，識別可能存在的漏洞及重大風險，並確保備有適當措施應付有關情況；\n- 統一風險評估準則及方法，並就所識別的風險釐定資源管理的優先次序；及\n- 鼓勵及加強金管局內部的風險管理文化，推動適當的授權及監控。\n\n金管局設有一套穩健的營運風險管理框架，涵蓋機構層面及部門層面的組織架構風險。機構層面的風險泛指涉及整體機構所面對的中期風險，或需要跨部門共同應對的風險。在執行過程中，各部門需按季檢討及匯報其潛在和新興風險，以及所提出之監控措施和緩解策略，再輔以由上而下的機構風險管理模式，由各部門的管理高層識別影響較廣泛的主要風險及建議緩解措施。有關評估會經由風險委員會定期審議和決定適當的跟進行動。\n\n# 內部審核\n\n內部審核處獨立及客觀評估金管局的管治、風險管理及監控程序是否足夠及具成效。該處職能上向外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會匯報，行政上向金管局總裁匯報。內部審核處採用風險為本的方法進行業務運作及資訊系統審核，涵蓋各重大風險範疇。在2022年，該處就金管局的儲備管理、銀行監管工作、貨幣與金融發展、資訊科技及其他機構職能共進行28項審核。審核結果顯示金管局備有足夠及有效的監控措施，以管理金管局運作所產生的風險。\n","terms":{"銀行":["bank","banking

Institutional Functions\n\nThe Institutional Functions Department supports the operations of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), maintains high levels of transparency and accountability, and upholds excellent efficiency and professionalism. To enhance public understanding of the HKMA’s policies and work, the Authority maintains effective communication with society and the market through traditional and social media, its website, information centres, and other channels.\n\nInternally, the HKMA has carefully built a workforce that emphasises flexibility, adaptability, and sustainable development. It adheres to strict fiscal discipline and enhances its information technology capabilities to respond to changes and ensure the effective implementation of policies and measures.\n\n# Maintaining Transparency\n\n# Media Relations and Social Media\n\nThe HKMA maintains close contact with the media to enhance transparency and improve public understanding of its policies and operations. In 2022, the Authority organised or participated in 112 physical and online events, including eight press conferences, 11 on-site interviews, and 93 other public events. It also arranged 46 media interviews. During the year, 492 bilingual press releases were issued, and a large number of media enquiries were handled daily.\n\nTo enhance public understanding of the HKMA’s key functions, the Authority organised press conferences and media briefings for local, mainland, and overseas media. These covered topics such as the operation of the Currency Board, green and sustainable finance, and central bank digital currencies.\n\nVarious media outlets actively participated in events organised by the HKMA in 2022, including the International Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit. This three-day summit attracted significant media attention, with over 200 journalists from 87 media outlets attending. Approximately 1,000 news articles were published in local, regional, and international media, and live streaming services were provided for 30 media outlets.\n\nTo effectively engage with the public, the HKMA operates six social media pages (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, WeChat, and YouTube), with over 100,000 followers. In 2022, it added a WeChat page to reach a broader audience. The Authority uses social media to promote major events and projects, such as the International Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit and the Government Green Bond Programme. It also raises public awareness of topics including the Linked Exchange Rate System, fintech, and fraud prevention.\n\nMr Eddie Yue, Chief Executive of the HKMA, gave an on-site interview to the media at the International Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit.\n\nMr Yue delivered the opening keynote speech at Hong Kong FinTech Week 2022.\n\nMr Ruan Guoheng, Deputy Chief Executive of the HKMA, spoke at the Fintech Elite Forum 2022, co-organised by Cyberport and Accenture.\n\nMr Darryl Chan, Deputy Chief Executive of the HKMA, chaired a press conference to outline the Authority’s policy stance on e-HKD.\n\nMr Chan Wai Man, Deputy Chief Executive of the HKMA, delivered a video speech at the 2022 Financial Street Forum Annual Meeting.\n\n# Public Enquiries\n\nThe public enquiry service is an effective way to enhance citizens’ understanding of the HKMA’s key functions and operations. In 2022, 9,952 enquiries were handled. About half of these related to banking consumer matters, banking policies and regulations, banknotes and coins, financial infrastructure, and bond market development. The most common enquiries concerned coin collection programmes, banking products and services, banking-related guidelines and notices, and retail bond issuance programmes.\n\nChart 1 shows the total number of public enquiries received each year since 2019. Chart 2 shows the proportion of different types of enquiries received in 2022.\n\nChart 1: Total Number of Public Enquiries\n\nChart 2: Breakdown of Enquiries Received in 2022 by Nature\n\n# Publications\n\nIn addition to its Annual Report, the HKMA published two issues of the Semi-annual Report on Monetary and Financial Stability and four issues of the Quarterly Bulletin. It also regularly updated the Monthly Statistical Bulletin to provide the latest data and analysis on Hong Kong’s currency, banking, and economic affairs. Furthermore, the HKMA published 17 Hui Si articles to introduce its key measures and policies and discuss issues of public concern.\n\nThe HKMA’s 2021 Annual Report won the Silver Award in the “Non-profit and Charitable Organisations” category and the Merit Award in the “Environmental, Social and Governance Reporting” category at the Best Annual Reports Awards 2022 organised by the Hong Kong Management Association.\n\n# Corporate Website\n\nThe HKMA’s website (www.hkma.gov.hk) provides over 46,000 pages of information in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, making it easy for the public to access the latest information about the Authority. The website also contains the “Register of Authorised Institutions and Local Representative Offices” and the “Register of Employees Engaged in Securities Business of Authorised Institutions”, maintained under Section 20 of the Banking Ordinance. It also includes the “Register of Licensees of Stored Value Facilities”, maintained under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance.\n\nSince 2018, the HKMA has been releasing financial data and key information on its website through open application programming interfaces (APIs) in phases. By the end of 2022, it had launched a total of 148 open APIs as planned.\n\n# Information Centre\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre, located on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre, is a key facility for introducing the Authority’s work to the public and enhancing their understanding of monetary and banking matters. The Centre consists of an exhibition hall and a library. The exhibition hall uses interactive methods to introduce the HKMA’s work and the development of Hong Kong’s currency and banking system. It also provides materials and exhibits for research on Hong Kong’s currency, banking, and finance. The library, adjacent to the exhibition hall, houses over 26,000 books, journals, and other publications covering Hong Kong’s currency, banking, finance, and central banking. It also maintains the “Register of Authorised Institutions and Local Representative Offices” and the “Register of Employees Engaged in Securities Business of Authorised Institutions” under Section 20 of the Banking Ordinance for public inspection.\n\nAs the pandemic situation stabilised, the Information Centre gradually resumed its guided tours for the public in the second half of 2022.\n\nAfter renovation, the new library reopened to the public in March 2023.\n\n# Community Engagement and Public Education\n\nTo maintain contact with the community and enhance public understanding of its work, the HKMA has been organising public education seminars since 1998. In 2022, it held online seminars that attracted over 2,200 participants from 82 secondary schools. The seminars covered topics such as an introduction to the HKMA’s work, the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, protection of personal digital keys, the Deposit Protection Scheme, and banking career opportunities. To date, these seminars have recorded over 65,000 participants.\n\nThe HKMA educates and engages with the public to help them become smart and responsible financial services consumers. In response to the increase in phishing scams, it launched a cross-media publicity campaign to remind the public to beware of fraudulent hyperlinks in mobile messages and emails claiming to be from banks. It also warned against other types of scams involving deposits and credit cards. Additionally, the HKMA organised radio and social media campaigns to provide smart usage tips for credit cards, personal loans, online shopping, and other payment methods, including “buy now, pay later” products.\n\nA new video clip was released with the theme “Be cautious with digital keys, think twice before clicking links!”\n\nTo help citizens keep up with fintech developments, the HKMA promoted the use of e-red packets during the Lunar New Year through social media and radio campaigns. It produced an animated video explaining open APIs and the precautions to take when using banking services through mobile applications provided by third-party service providers, such as online shopping platforms and mortgage service companies. The video also introduced the App-to-App and Web-to-App payment functions and advantages of the Faster Payment System.\n\nThis animated video helped enhance public knowledge of digital finance.\n\nThe HKMA also strives to enhance public understanding of the financial industry and increase young people’s interest in joining the Authority and the sector. In a newly produced interview video, graduates of the HKMA’s Management Trainee Programme shared their experiences. They introduced the programme to prospective applicants and enhanced their understanding of the HKMA’s work.\n\nGraduates of the Management Trainee Programme shared tips on how to prepare for interviews.\n\nTo enhance secondary school students’ financial literacy, the HKMA co-organised the 8th edition of the “Territory-wide Financial Literacy Competition” with several related organisations. The theme was green and sustainable finance, and students acquired new knowledge through online quizzes, webinars, and design thinking competitions. The online quizzes recorded the highest number of participants ever.\n\nIn the design thinking competition, students explained creative solutions with green and sustainable elements to meet personal financial management needs.\n\nDuring the 2021\/22 school year, the HKMA launched the “Little Financial Planner” online parent-child financial education programme during the special holiday in March and the summer holiday in August. Through animated videos, storytelling, simple toy-making, and sharing sessions by financial and early childhood education experts, kindergarten and primary school students learned about banknotes and coins, banking and payment services, and financial knowledge.\n\nChildren learned financial concepts and skills online.\n\n# Financial Disclosure\n\nTo maintain high transparency, the HKMA adopts international financial disclosure standards applicable to central bank operations, including Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and other relevant reporting requirements (such as the Special Data Dissemination Standard of the International Monetary Fund). The Finance Department prepares the financial statements of the Exchange Fund in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, with assistance from independent auditors and accounting professionals. The HKMA also provides detailed disclosure and in-depth analysis of expenditure items and budget information in its Annual Report.\n\n# Accountability and Monitoring\n\n# Risk Management\n\nManaging risks in the monetary and banking system is one of the HKMA’s most important tasks. Risk management is reflected in both strategy formulation and day-to-day operations. The Authority’s risk management framework includes two high-level committees: the Macro Surveillance Committee and the Risk Committee, both chaired by the Chief Executive of the HKMA.\n\nThe Macro Surveillance Committee’s responsibilities are:\n- To identify potential risks and threats to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial system and discuss feasible countermeasures.\n- To review existing risk management measures in the monetary and financial system, identify potential loopholes, and ensure that measures are adequate.\n- To encourage cross-departmental sharing of macro surveillance information, thereby enhancing the HKMA’s macro surveillance capabilities.\n\nThe Risk Committee’s responsibilities are:\n- To identify potential risks and threats faced by the HKMA and formulate strategies to mitigate their impact.\n- To review existing risk management systems in each department, identify potential loopholes and major risks, and ensure appropriate measures are in place to address such situations.\n- To standardise risk assessment criteria and methods, and determine the priority of resource management for identified risks.\n- To encourage and strengthen the risk management culture within the HKMA, promoting appropriate authorisation and monitoring.\n\nThe HKMA has a robust operational risk management framework covering organisational risks at both corporate and departmental levels. Corporate-level risks generally refer to medium-term risks faced by the organisation as a whole or risks requiring cross-departmental cooperation. Departments are required to review and report on potential and emerging risks quarterly, proposing monitoring measures and mitigation strategies. This is complemented by a top-down corporate risk management model, where senior management identifies major risks with broader impact and suggests mitigation measures. These assessments are regularly reviewed by the Risk Committee, which decides on appropriate follow-up actions.\n\n# Internal Audit\n\nThe Internal Audit Department independently and objectively assesses whether the HKMA’s governance, risk management, and monitoring processes are adequate and effective. It reports functionally to the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee and administratively to the Chief Executive of the HKMA. The Department adopts a risk-based approach to audit business operations and information systems, covering all major risk areas. In 2022, it conducted 28 audits on the HKMA’s reserve management, banking supervision, monetary and financial development, information technology, and other institutional functions. The audit results confirmed that the HKMA has adequate and effective monitoring measures to manage risks arising from its operations."}
{"zh":"# 外匯基金\n\n- 審計署署長報告\n- 外匯基金財務報表\n\n# 審計署署長報告\n\n# 獨立審計師報告致財政司司長\n\n# 意見\n\n茲證明我已審計列載於第179頁至281頁外匯基金及其附屬公司（「集團」）的財務報表，該等財務報表包括外匯基金及集團於2022年12月31日的資產負債表與截至該日止年度的收支帳目、全面收益表、權益變動表和現金流量表，以及財務報表的附註，包括主要會計政策概要。\n\n我認為，該等財務報表已按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》真實而中肯地反映外匯基金及集團於2022年12月31日的財務狀況及截至該日止年度的財務表現和現金流量，並已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》（第66章）第7條下所發出的指示妥為擬備。\n\n# 意見的基礎\n\n我已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示及審計署的審計準則進行審計。我根據該等準則而須承擔的責任，詳載於本報告「審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任」部分。根據該等準則，我獨立於集團，並已按該等準則履行其他道德責任。我相信，我所獲得的審計憑證是充足和適當地為我的審計意見提供基礎。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項是根據我的專業判斷，對截至2022年12月31日止年度財務報表的審計最為重要的事項。我對整體財務報表進行審計及形成意見時處理了這些事項，而我不會對這些事項提供單獨的意見。\n\n# 按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.5、2.6及38.1。\n\n於2022年12月31日，集團按公平值列帳的金融資產共38,361.82億港元，金融負債共12,074.98億港元。\n\n87%的該等金融資產及所有該等金融負債的公平值為相同資產或負債於活躍市場的報價（第1級參數），或是以估值方法估計，而所用的參數是以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第2級參數）。\n\n其餘13%的該等金融資產的公平值，是以估值方法估計，而所用的參數並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第3級參數）。有關金融資產共4,876.94億港元，主要包括非上市投資基金。\n\n鑑於所涉數額龐大及涉及估計，按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值屬關鍵審計事項。\n\n就按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值，審計程序包括：\n- 了解不同類別金融資產及金融負債的估值程序，包括相關監控措施；\n- 評價及測試監控措施，包括電腦系統的相關應用程式監控措施；\n- 就金融資產及金融負債的估值、存在、權利與責任及完整性取得函證；\n- 若使用市場報價，根據獨立來源核實價格；\n- 若所用估值方法的參數是以可觀察市場數據為基礎，評價估值方法是否適合及有關假設是否合理，以及根據獨立來源核實參數；及\n- 若所用估值方法的參數並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎，評價估值方法是否適合，以及有關假設與參數是否合理。\n\n# 按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.11、18及19。\n\n集團的投資物業按公平值列帳，於2022年12月31日共值233.94億港元。集團亦於4間聯營公司及22間合營公司擁有權益，該等公司主要業務為持有海外投資物業，有關權益共值396.31億港元。不論是由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有，該等投資物業的公平值均主要根據獨立專業估值師的估值釐定。該等估值涉及重大判斷及估計，包括所用的估值方法及假設。\n\n就按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值，審計程序包括：\n- 獲取及審視由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有的投資物業的估值報告，並核實公平值是根據有關估值報告所列的估值釐定；\n- 評估估值師的獨立性及資歷；及\n- 評價估值方法是否適合，以及有關假設與參數是否合理。\n\n# 其他資料\n\n金融管理專員須對其他資料負責。其他資料包括金融管理局2022年年報內的所有資料，但不包括財務報表及我的審計師報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見並不涵蓋其他資料，我亦不對其他資料發表任何形式的鑒證結論。\n\n就財務報表審計而言，我有責任閱讀其他資料，從而考慮其他資料是否與財務報表或我在審計過程中得悉的情況有重大矛盾，或者似乎存有重大錯誤陳述。基於我已執行的工作，如果我認為其他資料存有重大錯誤陳述，我需要報告該事實。在這方面，我沒有任何報告。\n\n# 金融管理專員及外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會就財務報表而須承擔的責任\n\n金融管理專員須負責按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》及行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示擬備真實而中肯的財務報表，及落實其認為必要的內部控制， 使財務報表不存有因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在擬備財務報表時，金融管理專員須負責評估集團持續經營的能力，以及在適用情況下披露與持續經營有關的事項，並以持續經營作為會計基礎。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會負責監督集團的財務報告過程。\n\n# 審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任\n\n我的目標是就整體財務報表是否不存有任何因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述取得合理保證，並發出包括我意見的審計師報告。合理保證是高水平的保證，但不能確保按審計署審計準則進行的審計定能發現所存有的任何重大錯誤陳述。錯誤陳述可以由欺詐或錯誤引起，如果合理預期它們個別或滙總起來可能影響財務報表使用者所作出的經濟決定，則會被視作重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在根據審計署審計準則進行審計的過程中，我會運用專業判斷並秉持專業懷疑態度。我亦會：\n- 識別和評估因欺詐或錯誤而導致財務報表存有重大錯誤陳述的風險；設計及執行審計程序以應對這些風險；以及取得充足和適當的審計憑證，作為我意見的基礎。由於欺詐可能涉及串謀、偽造、蓄意遺漏、虛假陳述，或凌駕內部控制的情況，因此未能發現因欺詐而導致重大錯誤陳述的風險，較未能發現因錯誤而導致者為高；\n- 了解與審計相關的內部控制，以設計適當的審計程序。然而，此舉並非旨在對集團內部控制的有效性發表意見；\n- 評價金融管理專員所採用的會計政策是否恰當，以及其作出的會計估計和相關資料披露是否合理；\n- 判定金融管理專員以持續經營作為會計基礎的做法是否恰當，並根據所得的審計憑證，判定是否存在與事件或情況有關，而且可能對集團持續經營的能力構成重大疑慮的重大不確定性。如果我認為存在重大不確定性，則有必要在審計師報告中請使用者留意財務報表中的相關資料披露。假若所披露的相關資料不足，我便須發出非無保留意見的審計師報告。我的結論是基於截至審計師報告日止所取得的審計憑證。然而，未來事件或情況可能導致集團不能繼續持續經營；\n- 評價財務報表的整體列報方式、結構和內容，包括披露資料，以及財務報表是否中肯反映交易和事項；及\n- 就集團中實體或業務活動的財務資料獲取充足和適當的審計憑證，以對財務報表發表意見。我負責指導、監督和執行集團審計。我對我的審計意見承擔全部責任。\n\n我會與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通計劃的審計範圍和時間以及重大審計發現等事項，包括我在審計期間識別出內部控制的任何重大缺陷。\n\n我亦會向外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會提交聲明，說明我已符合有關獨立性的相關道德要求，並與他們溝通所有被合理認為可能會影響我獨立性的關係和其他事項，以及在適用的情況下，相關的防範措施。\n\n從與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通的事項中，我會決定哪些事項對本期財務報表的審計最為重要，因而構成關鍵審計事項。我會在審計師報告中描述這些事項，除非法律法規不允許對某件事項作出公開披露，或在極端罕見的情況下，因為有合理預期在我報告中溝通某事項而造成的負面後果將會超過其產生的公眾利益而我決定不應在報告中溝通該事項。\n\n審計署署長\n林智遠教授\n\n審計署\n香港\n金鐘道66號\n\n2023

Exchange Fund\n\n- Report of the Director of Audit\n- Financial Statements of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report to the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) set out on pages 179 to 281, which comprise the Group’s balance sheet as at 31 December 2022, and the statement of income and expenditure, the statement of comprehensive income, the statement of changes in equity and the statement of cash flows for the year then ended, together with the notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Exchange Fund and the Group as at 31 December 2022, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants. They have also been properly prepared in accordance with the directions given by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Chapter 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directions given by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the auditing standards of the Audit Commission. My responsibilities under those standards are described in the “Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements” section of my report. I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards and have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities under those standards. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2022. These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.5, 2.6 and 38.1 to the financial statements.\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, the Group’s financial assets measured at fair value totalled HK$383,618.2 million and its financial liabilities totalled HK$120,749.8 million.\n\nThe fair values of 87% of these financial assets and all of these financial liabilities were based on quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets (Level 1 inputs), or were estimated using valuation techniques where the inputs were based on observable market data (Level 2 inputs).\n\nThe fair values of the remaining 13% of these financial assets were estimated using valuation techniques where the inputs were not based on observable market data (Level 3 inputs). These financial assets totalled HK$48,769.4 million and mainly comprised unlisted investment funds.\n\nThe valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value was a key audit matter given the significant amounts involved and the estimation required.\n\nThe audit procedures performed in relation to the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value included:\n- Understanding the valuation processes for different categories of financial assets and financial liabilities, including related monitoring controls;\n- Evaluating and testing monitoring controls, including relevant application controls in computer systems;\n- Obtaining confirmations on the valuation, existence, rights and obligations, and completeness of financial assets and financial liabilities;\n- Verifying prices against independent sources if market quotations were used;\n- If the valuation technique used inputs based on observable market data, evaluating whether the valuation technique was appropriate and whether the assumptions used were reasonable, and verifying the inputs against independent sources; and\n- If the valuation technique used inputs not based on observable market data, evaluating whether the valuation technique was appropriate and whether the assumptions and inputs used were reasonable.\n\n# Valuation of investment properties measured at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.11, 18 and 19 to the financial statements.\n\nThe Group’s investment properties were measured at fair value and totalled HK$23,394 million as at 31 December 2022. The Group also held interests in four associates and 22 joint ventures whose principal activities were holding overseas investment properties, with a total value of HK$39,631 million. Regardless of whether they were held directly by the Group or by associates or joint ventures, the fair values of these investment properties were primarily determined based on valuations by independent professional valuers. These valuations involved significant judgement and estimation, including the valuation techniques and assumptions used.\n\nThe audit procedures performed in relation to the valuation of investment properties measured at fair value included:\n- Obtaining and reviewing valuation reports for investment properties held directly by the Group or by associates or joint ventures, and verifying that the fair values were determined based on the valuations stated in those reports;\n- Assessing the independence and qualifications of the valuers; and\n- Evaluating whether the valuation techniques were appropriate and whether the assumptions and inputs used were reasonable.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Financial Commissioner is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises all the information in the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s 2022 Annual Report, but does not include the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Financial Commissioner and the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee in relation to the financial statements\n\nThe Financial Commissioner is responsible for preparing financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants and with the directions given by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for implementing such internal control as is considered necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Financial Commissioner is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the auditing standards of the Audit Commission will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in conformity with the auditing standards of the Audit Commission, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. I also:\n- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. However, this is not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.\n- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the Financial Commissioner and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Financial Commissioner.\n- Conclude on the appropriateness of the Financial Commissioner’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- Obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. I bear full responsibility for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide a statement to the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and the related safeguards, if applicable.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements for the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nDirector of Audit\nProfessor Lam Chi-yuen\n\nAudit Commission\nHong Kong\n66 Connaught Road, Central\n\n11 April 2023"}

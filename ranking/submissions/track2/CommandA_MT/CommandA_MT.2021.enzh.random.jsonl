{"en":"# Chief Executive’s Statement\n\nThe year 2021 was a year of concurrent consolidation and development.\n\nIn 2021, the pandemic entered its second year unabated: global supply chains were disrupted, inflation pressures were on the rise, risk of premature tightening of global financial conditions increased.  Adding to the unpredictability were the emergence of mutant variants of COVID-19 and the intensification of geopolitical tensions.  Despite such a macro environment filled with uncertainties, we continued to safeguard monetary and financial stability and maintain operational resilience.\n\n2021 also brought hope for recovery with the successful rollout of COVID-19 vaccines together with the accommodative monetary and fiscal policies introduced in multiple economies.  The global economy began to recover from the severe contraction in 2020.  Locally, after having endured economic contraction in 2019 and 2020, the Hong Kong economy grew by 6.3% in 2021, thanks to the rollout of the vaccination programme and the Government’s pandemic relief measures which have lent crucial support to our economic recovery.\n\nWith financial and monetary stability maintained, as well as a steadying macro environment, 2021 gave us some room to pursue more development work.  We seized the opportunity and pressed ahead with developmental initiatives that will help our financial sector remain highly competitive. Significant progress has been made across our three strategic priorities, namely fintech, green finance and Mainland market opportunities arising from Hong Kong’s gateway role.\n\nAs we entered 2022, the global environment took a turn for the worse.  But as the saying goes, when the going gets tough, the tough get going.  We will continue to be proactive and pursue our developmental goals and priorities to be better prepared for the next challenge and to cement our status as an international financial centre.  We will also remain steadfast in our commitment to ensure the soundness of Hong Kong monetary and financial systems, as we have risen to the many challenges time and again as in the past.\n\n# Monetary and financial stability: foundation of an international financial centre\n\nSince its establishment in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has been a strong anchor of Hong Kong’s financial system and has helped Hong Kong withstand numerous shocks and challenges.  Despite the lingering uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and market concerns about the pace of US monetary tightening, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to function in an orderly manner throughout the year, reflecting the robustness of the LERS.\n\nThis confidence in our systems did not happen overnight, but is based on the solid foundation which has been built up over the years.  In its 2021 External Sector Report, the International Monetary Fund once again reiterated that the credibility of the LERS has been assured by a transparent set of rules, ample fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy, and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nThe confidence is also a result of our efforts in public and market engagement, as well as effective surveillance.  On the latter, we have leveraged technology and data analytics to strengthen our capability for more timely and comprehensive analysis on financial stability and macroprudential surveillance.\n\nThe robustness of the banking system is of paramount importance to financial stability in Hong Kong.  Two years into the COVID-19 pandemic, our banks remained resilient with liquidity positions and capitalisation faring very well by international standards.  As at end-2021, the capital adequacy ratio of local banks stood at 20.2%, well above the minimum requirement of 8%, while the average Liquidity Coverage Ratio of large banks was 151.9% in the fourth quarter of 2021, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 100%.  Despite a challenging credit landscape amid the pandemic, the asset quality of the banking sector remained largely stable during the year. The classified loan ratio of the industry was 0.88% at the end of 2021, down from 0.90% at the end of 2020, well below the long-run historical average of 1.8% since 2000.\n\n# Banking sector: a pillar of support to the economy\n\nAs always, the banking sector is an important pillar of support to economic activity.  This is ever more crucial in the face of economic fallout from the COVID-19 outbreak.  In the past year, a main challenge was to strike a balance between managing credit risk in the banking sector and maintaining the sector’s support for the real economy.  With our supervisory work over the years, banks continued to manage credit risks effectively.  At the same time, we worked closely with banks to provide the much needed relief to corporate and personal customers through the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme (PPPHS) and other relief measures.  The PPPHS, launched together with the Banking Sector Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) Lending Coordination Mechanism in 2020 allowing eligible corporate customers to defer loan principal payments by six months on a pre-approval basis, was again further extended twice during 2021 until April 2022 recognising that some economic sectors were still hard-pressed by the lingering pandemic and were in need of continued credit relief.  Subsequently, in light of a resurgence of local coronavirus infections, in February 2022, the PPPHS was further extended until the end of October 2022.  It is encouraging to see that the banking sector has joined forces with the HKMA to help relieve cash-flow pressures on corporate and individual borrowers, even whilst the sector itself is experiencing its own difficult operating conditions due to the outbreak of the pandemic.\n\nApart from the challenging credit landscape, the pandemic also brought about a more difficult operating environment and a digital landscape with escalating cyber threat. We have stepped up our efforts to enhance operational and cyber resilience of the banking sector, as well as consumer and investor protection amid increasing digitalisation and a surge in phishing scams.  In particular, the Code of Banking Practice was revised to enhance consumer protection in digital financial services.\n\nBesides supervisory work, we are dedicated to promoting financial inclusion and customer-centric culture in the banking sector.  Enhancing accessibility to banking services by customers in need has been one of our priority areas and we have been working closely with the industry to develop industry guidelines.  Further to the guidance on barrier-free banking services and provision of banking services for persons with intellectual disabilities, the industry, with the support of the HKMA, published in December 2021 a guideline to set out the principles and good practices for the banking industry in providing banking services to persons with dementia and customers in need.\n\nTo support the continued development of the banking sector in the future where the new growth opportunities and challenges require a new set of skills from the workforce, the HKMA has formulated a holistic talent development strategy — “Connecting Talent to the Future” — to groom future talent and upskill existing practitioners in a more systematic and targeted manner.  Our new strategy is built on three “connect” directions: connecting students to the banking industry, connecting practitioners to the future of banking, and connecting the key stakeholders together to enhance collaboration in implementing the strategy.  We have launched a series of outreach and promotional campaigns to attract more students to enter the banking industry. To better prepare university students to be “future ready”, we have launched the Future Banking Bridging Programme jointly with the Hong Kong Institute of Bankers, which comprises a series of courses that cover practical banking knowledge and useful soft skills that are highly in demand in the banking industry.  For the existing banking practitioners, we have been working closely with the industry on developing opportunities for upskilling through providing more in-demand training programmes.  In December 2021, the new Fintech module under the Enhanced Competency Framework for banking practitioners was launched.\n\nFinancial talent is crucial to the future development of Hong Kong as an international financial centre.  We will work hand in hand with all stakeholders with a view to strengthening the talent pool for the further development of the industry.\n\n# International financial centre: strong position underpinned by an unparalleled access to opportunities\n\nThe competitiveness of Hong Kong as an international financial centre is underpinned by the unparalleled access to opportunities it offers.  There is general consensus that global fintech adoption, opening-up of Mainland’s financial markets, and the mainstreaming of green and sustainable finance present huge opportunities for the future development of Hong Kong’s financial sector.  At the HKMA, we have dedicated substantial efforts in leveraging Hong Kong’s unique edge to capture these opportunities.  Let me talk about the fintech and Mainland opportunities first.\n\n# Comprehensive adoption of fintech\n\nThe pandemic has clearly demonstrated the power of fintech and permanently changed customers’ behaviour towards financial services.  To make sure we continue to stay at the forefront of the global fintech scene and are ready to tap all of the potential of fintech, we must build an ecosystem where the value of fintech is experienced across all levels and by all groups of people.\n\nThis vision has driven us to formulate a new strategy, “Fintech 2025”, which was unveiled in June 2021.  As its name suggests, it aspires to help the financial sector adopt technology comprehensively by 2025.  The strategy comprises five focus areas which cover the required elements to achieve a successful ecosystem, and also the right factors for the ecosystem to grow further in a virtuous cycle. The first two parts of the strategy, namely “all banks go fintech” and “future-proofing Hong Kong for Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)” mainly sought to create more demand for fintech adoption.  The other parts of the strategy relate to data, infrastructure, talent and funding, which are vital to the growth of the ecosystem.\n\nUnder this strategy, a number of new initiatives were introduced, such as the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) fintech pilot trial facility which allows financial institutions and technology firms to conduct pilot trials and obtain early feedback from regulators and users on their cross-boundary fintech initiatives, and the pilot launch of the Commercial Data Interchange which leverages the use of alternative data to facilitate SME financing.  We have also stepped up research on the application of wholesale CBDC to cross-border payments, and explored the prospect of e-HKD, which will increase Hong Kong’s readiness in terms of adopting CBDCs and in turn future-proof our city’s financial infrastructure in the decades ahead.\n\nWhile we capitalise on the new opportunities presented by technological advancement, we also continue to build on our existing achievements as well as watch out for new risks that may arise.  For example, the Faster Payment System (FPS) introduced in 2018 has grown rapidly over the years, with the number of registrations reaching 9.6 million at the end of 2021, up 40% year on year.  The average daily turnover also increased 90% from 2020, reaching about 673,000 real-time transactions in 2021.  Meanwhile, in view of the rapid development of crypto-assets particularly payment-related stablecoins, we have issued a discussion paper earlier this year to invite market feedback on the development of an appropriate regulatory framework.\n\nOur new, forward-thinking strategy will set the scene for a healthy growth of the fintech ecosystem.  As the banking sector increasingly adopts fintech to capture the opportunities it offers, this will ultimately benefit both financial institutions and Hong Kong people, while strengthening Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre.\n\n# Hong Kong as the dominant gateway to the Mainland\n\nHong Kong has always played a strategic role in linking the Mainland market with international financial markets, providing international investors with a familiar regime and platform to conduct various kinds of financial, investment and wealth management activities.  The National 14th Five-Year Plan strengthens Hong Kong’s position as an international financial centre, a global offshore renminbi business hub, as well as asset management and risk management centres. This together with global economic trends has reinforced our conviction that Hong Kong should continue to enhance its unique value as a bridge connecting the Mainland and international markets.\n\nIn 2021, we reached a milestone in enhancing connectivity, adding two new members to our family of Connect schemes, namely the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) Scheme in the GBA, and Southbound Trading under Bond Connect, essentially completing the two-way loop of mutual access in a wide spectrum of financial markets including equities, debts and wealth management.  The launch of the two schemes will bring new opportunities for Hong Kong in various aspects. By meeting the increasing diversification needs of Mainland investors, the two schemes will enlarge the customer base of our bond market and wealth management industry.  I am pleased to see that these two schemes have been operating smoothly.  The HKMA will continue to engage the Mainland authorities to further enhance these schemes over

行政總裁發言\n\n二○二一年是整固與發展並行的一年。\n\n在二○二一年，疫情持續蔓延至第二年，仍未見緩和跡象：全球供應鏈受阻，通膨壓力上升，全球金融狀況過早收緊的風險增加。此外，新冠病毒變種的出現和地緣政治緊張局勢的升溫，更增加了局勢的不確定性。儘管宏觀環境充滿不確定性，我們仍繼續保障貨幣及金融穩定，並維持營運韌性。\n\n二○二一年亦為復甦帶來希望，因為多國成功推出新冠疫苗接種計畫，並實施寬鬆的貨幣及財政政策。全球經濟開始從二○二○年的嚴重衰退中復甦。本地方面，香港經濟在經歷了二○一九及二○二○年的衰退後，於二○二一年錄得6.3%的增長，這有賴於疫苗接種計畫的推行和政府推出的抗疫紓困措施，為我們的經濟復甦提供了重要支持。\n\n在金融及貨幣穩定得到維持，以及宏觀環境穩定的情況下，二○二一年為我們提供了一些空間，以進行更多發展工作。我們把握了這個機會，推進了多項發展計畫，以協助金融業保持高度競爭力。我們在三個策略優先領域（即金融科技、綠色金融及香港作為門戶所帶來的內地市場機遇）均取得了重大進展。\n\n踏入二○二二年，全球環境進一步惡化。但正如俗語所說，越是艱難，越要迎難而上。我們將繼續積極進取，追求我們的發展目標和優先事項，以更好地應對下一個挑戰，並鞏固我們作為國際金融中心的地位。我們亦會堅定不移地確保香港貨幣及金融體系的穩健性，正如我們在過去多次成功應對各種挑戰一樣。\n\n# 貨幣及金融穩定：國際金融中心的基石\n\n聯繫匯率制度自一九八三年建立以來，一直是維繫香港金融體系穩健的強大支柱，並協助香港抵禦了無數衝擊和挑戰。儘管新冠疫情持續存在不確定性，市場亦對美國收緊貨幣政策的步伐感到憂慮，但港元匯率及貨幣市場在過去一年仍能有序運作，反映了聯繫匯率制度的穩健性。\n\n我們對自身體系的信心並非一朝一夕建立，而是基於多年來建立的穩健基礎。國際貨幣基金組織在二○二一年的《對外部門報告》中再次重申，聯繫匯率制度的可信度得到透明的規則、充裕的財政及外匯儲備、強而有力的金融監管及監督、靈活的經濟和審慎的財政框架所保障。\n\n這份信心亦源於我們在公眾及市場參與方面的努力，以及有效的監管。在後者方面，我們運用科技及數據分析，以加強我們的能力，更及時及全面地分析金融穩定及宏觀審慎監管的情況。\n\n銀行體系的穩健性對香港的金融穩定至為重要。在經歷了兩年新冠疫情後，本港銀行的流動性及資本狀況仍保持穩健，表現符合國際標準。截至二○二一年年底，本地銀行的資本充足比率為20.2%，遠高於8%的最低要求，而大型銀行的二○二一年第四季平均流動性覆蓋比率則為151.9%，亦遠高於100%的法規最低要求。儘管疫情期間信貸環境充滿挑戰，但銀行業的資產品質在過去一年大致保持穩定。行業的分類貸款比率於二○二一年年底為0.88%，較二○二○年底的0.90%有所下降，遠低於自二○○○年以來的長期歷史平均水平1.8%。\n\n# 銀行業：支持經濟的重要支柱\n\n銀行業一如既往地是支持經濟活動的重要支柱，在面對新冠疫情爆發所造成的經濟影響時，這點更為重要。在過去一年，主要挑戰是如何在管理銀行業信貸風險與維持銀行業對實體經濟的支持之間取得平衡。憑藉我們多年來的監管工作，銀行繼續有效地管理信貸風險。同時，我們與銀行緊密合作，透過預先批核還本金假期計畫（PPPHS）及其他紓緩措施，為企業及個人客戶提供所需的紓困支援。PPPHS於二○二○年與銀行業中小企貸款協調機制一同推出，讓合資格企業客戶可預先獲批延後六個月償還貸款本金，並於二○二一年再兩度延長至二○二二年四月，因為我們意識到部分經濟行業仍受持續疫情所困，需要繼續獲得信貸紓緩。其後，鑑於本地新冠病毒感染個案再度上升，PPPHS於二○二二年二月進一步延長至二○二二年十月底。令人鼓舞的是，銀行業與金管局攜手合作，即使在疫情爆發期間自身營運環境困難的情況下，仍協助紓緩企業及個人借款人的資金周轉壓力。\n\n除了信貸環境充滿挑戰外，疫情亦帶來了更艱難的營運環境和不斷增加的網路威脅的數位環境。我們已加大力度，在數位化日益普及和網路釣魚騙案激增的情況下，提升銀行業的營運及網路韌性，以及加強消費者及投資者保障。尤其是，《銀行業務操守守則》已作出修訂，以加強數位金融服務中的消費者保障。\n\n除了監管工作外，我們亦致力於在銀行業推廣金融普惠和以客戶為中心的文化。提升有需要客戶使用銀行服務的便利性一直是我們的工作重點，我們亦與業界緊密合作，制定業界指引。在無障礙銀行服務指引及為智障人士提供銀行服務指引的基礎上，業界在金管局的支持下，於二○二一年十二月發出指引，訂明銀行業為認知障礙人士及有需要客戶提供銀行服務的原則及良好做法。\n\n為支持銀行業在未來持續發展，因應新的成長機遇和挑戰，從業人員需要掌握新技能，金管局制定了一項全面的「人才與未來接軌」人才發展策略，以更有系統和針對性的方式，培育未來人才和提升現有從業人員的技能。我們的新策略建基於三個「聯繫」方向：聯繫學生與銀行業、聯繫從業人員與銀行業的未來，以及聯繫主要利害關係人以加強策略落實的協作。我們已推出一系列外展和宣傳活動，以吸引更多學生加入銀行業。為讓大學生更好地為未來做好準備，我們與香港銀行學會聯合推出了「未來銀行人才培育計畫」，其中包括一系列涵蓋實用銀行知識和銀行業急需的軟技能的課程。對於現有銀行從業人員，我們與業界緊密合作，透過提供更多熱門培訓課程，為他們創造提升技能的機會。二○二一年十二月，我們在銀行從業人員強化能力框架下推出了新的金融科技模組。\n\n金融人才對香港未來發展成為國際金融中心至為重要。我們將與所有利害關係人攜手合作，以期強化人才庫，推動行業的進一步發展。\n\n# 國際金融中心：強大的地位由無可比擬的機會優勢所支撐\n\n香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力，由它所提供的無可比擬的機會優勢所支撐。普遍認為，全球金融科技的應用、內地金融市場的開放，以及綠色和永續金融的主流化，為香港金融業的未來發展帶來巨大的機會。在金管局，我們投入了大量精力，利用香港的獨特優勢來把握這些機會。讓我先談談金融科技和內地機會。\n\n# 全面應用金融科技\n\n疫情清楚地顯示了金融科技的力量，並永久改變了客戶對金融服務的行為。為確保我們繼續在全球金融科技領域中保持領先地位，並準備好挖掘金融科技的所有潛力，我們必須建立一個生態系統，讓金融科技的價值能在所有層面和所有人群中得到體驗。\n\n這個願景促使我們制定了一項新策略「金融科技二○二五」，並於二○二一年六月公布。正如其名稱所示，該策略旨在協助金融業在二○二五年前全面應用科技。該策略包括五個重點領域，涵蓋了建立成功生態系統所需的要素，以及生態系統在良性循環中進一步成長的適切因素。策略的前兩部分，即「所有銀行應用金融科技」和「為中央銀行數位貨幣（CBDC）作好準備，以確保香港未來金融穩健」，主要旨在創造更多對金融科技應用的需求。策略的其他部分則與數據、基礎建設、人才和資金有關，這些都是生態系統成長的關鍵因素。\n\n在這個策略下，我們推出了一系列新措施，例如粵港澳大灣區金融科技試驗平台，讓金融機構和科技公司進行試驗，並從監管機構和用戶獲得早期回饋，以瞭解其跨境金融科技計畫；以及試行商業數據通，利用替代數據促進中小企融資。我們亦加緊研究批發型CBDC在跨境支付中的應用，並探討電子港元的前景，這將提高香港在採用CBDC方面的準備就緒程度，並反過來確保本市金融基礎建設在未來數十年內保持穩健。\n\n在把握科技進步所帶來的機會的同時，我們亦繼續鞏固現有的成就，並留意可能出現的新風險。例如，二○一八年推出的快速支付系統（FPS）在過去幾年迅速發展，截至二○二一年年底，註冊人數達960萬，按年上升40%。平均每日交易量亦較二○二○年增加九成，於二○二一年達約673,000宗即時交易。同時，鑑於加密資產（尤其是用作支付用途的穩定幣）的快速發展，我們在今年初發表了一份討論文件，邀請市場就制定適當監管框架提供意見。\n\n我們的新策略具有前瞻性，將為金融科技生態系統的健康成長奠定基礎。隨著銀行業日益採用金融科技以把握其所帶來的機會，這最終將惠及金融機構和香港市民，並強化香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。\n\n# 香港作為通往內地的主要門戶\n\n香港一直扮演著策略性角色，將內地市場與國際金融市場聯繫起來，為國際投資者提供一個熟悉的制度和平台，以進行各種金融、投資和財富管理活動。國家「十四五」規劃強化了香港作為國際金融中心、全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐，以及資產管理及風險管理中心的地位。這與全球經濟趨勢一同強化了我們的信念，即香港應繼續提升其作為連接內地與國際市場的橋樑的獨特價值。\n\n在二○二一年，我們在提升連通性方面達到了里程碑，為「互聯互通」計畫家族增添了兩名新成員，即大灣區跨境理財通（跨境理財通）和債券通下的「南向通」，基本上完成了涵蓋股票、債券及財富管理的廣泛金融市場的雙向互聯互通循環。推出這兩個計畫將為香港在各個方面帶來新機會。透過滿足內地投資者日益增長的多元化需求，這兩個計畫將擴大我們債券市場和財富管理業的客戶基礎。我很高興看到這兩個計畫運作順暢。金管局將繼續與內地當局保持聯繫，以進一步完善這些計畫。"}
{"en":"# Highlights of 2021\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nIn 2021, the Hong Kong economy resumes positive growth on the back of strong merchandise exports, reviving domestic demand and a boost from the Government’s supportive policy measures.

2021 年重點回顧\n\n# 經濟及金融環境\n\n2021 年，香港經濟在強勁的商品出口、國內需求回升及政府支持性政策措施的帶動下，回復正增長。勞動市場亦有所改善，而通膨則保持溫和，但已有所上升。\n\n香港銀行業保持穩健，資本及流動性狀況良好。資產品質按歷史及國際標準均維持在健康水平。\n\n# 貨幣穩定\n\n儘管 2019 冠狀病毒病疫情持續存在不確定性，市場亦關注美國收緊貨幣政策的步伐，但港元市場繼續有序及順暢運作。聯繫匯率制度繼續運作良好。\n\n# 儲備管理\n\n2021 年，全球金融市場踏上復甦之路，外匯基金錄得投資收入 1,919 億港元，相當於投資回報率 4.1%。\n\n金管局繼續致力支持負責任的投資及資產多元化。自 2009 年成立以來，長期增長組合的年化內部回報率為 15.4%。\n\n# 銀行業穩定性\n\n金管局繼續著重監管銀行的風險管理。鑑於網路威脅持續增加及數位化加速，金管局已加強監管銀行的營運及網路韌性。此外，亦已修訂《銀行業守則》，以加強對數位金融服務的消費者保障。\n\n經廣泛諮詢後，「粵港澳大灣區跨境理財通」試點計畫順利推出。金管局為銀行提供指引，說明如何以非面對面方式分銷投資及保險產品，既提供良好的客戶體驗，又能保障客戶。\n\n在反洗錢及反恐怖分子資金籌集（AML\/CFT）方面，金管局的工作重點是進一步加強銀行的能力，以預防及偵測與疫情期間線上金融犯罪上升相關的非法資金流動。金管局亦透過公私合作夥伴關係深化資訊共享，同時支持遠端客戶開戶，並透過推出首個反洗錢監管科技實驗室，鼓勵應用其他科技（包括網路分析）。\n\n在軟性基礎建設方面，亦作出了進一步努力，包括在銀行文化及人才發展範疇。\n\n在本地實施國際監管標準（包括資本充足及資訊披露標準）方面，取得了良好進展。金管局亦推進制定處置標準、進行處置規劃及發展處置執行能力的工作，以確保銀行有具公信力的處置機制。\n\n# 國際金融中心\n\n金管局公布「金融科技 2025」策略，以推動金融業廣泛應用金融科技，並鞏固香港作為亞洲金融科技樞紐的地位。快速支付系統的註冊及交易量均錄得顯著增長，應用層面亦繼續擴大。\n\n在提升互聯互通方面，跨境理財通及債券通下的「南向通」已推出，進一步鞏固香港作為離岸人民幣業務樞紐的角色。\n\n此外，亦致力創造新的商機，以提升香港金融平台的競爭力，包括在債券發行、資產及財富管理、企業財資中心，以及綠色和永續金融等領域。\n\n為推廣香港的金融服務，金管局加強與各利益關係者的市場聯繫，讓他們認識香港金融體系的韌性及其所呈現的機會。香港金融學院亦推出新的金融領袖計畫，旨在培育香港的未來金融領袖。\n\n# 企業職能\n\n金管局透過不同管道與社會及市場保持有效聯繫，以提升公眾對其政策及運作的認識。對內方面，金管局致力建立一支靈活應變及可持續的人才隊伍，建立嚴格的財務紀律，並提升資訊科技能力，以應對變化及確保有效落實其政策及措施。\n\n# 永續發展\n\n金管局致力強化香港的金融體系，以支持更綠色及永續的未來，推動行動以支持政府的氣候目標，並為全球議程作出貢獻。今年，金管局發表首份永續發展報告，作為《2021

{"en":"# Priorities for 2022 and Beyond\n\nGlobal and local conditions deteriorated notably entering 2022. On the one hand, the escalation of the Ukraine situation and expectations of rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve triggered market volatility. On the other hand, the local economy took a hit from the new wave of COVID-19 pandemic. That said, Hong Kong’s financial system remains well-positioned to withstand adverse shocks given its resilience and buffers built up over the years. Looking ahead, the HKMA will continue to attach high importance to safeguarding monetary and financial stability. In doing so, we will endeavour to stay ahead of the curve by identifying emerging risks and responding to them in an agile manner. At the same time, the HKMA will seek opportunities that would help bolster Hong Kong’s status as a leading international financial centre. In managing the Exchange Fund in this complicated investment environment, the HKMA will continue to invest prudently, while remaining flexible, implementing defensive measures as appropriate, and maintaining a high degree of liquidity.\n\n# STABILITY AND INTEGRITY OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM\n\nThe global economic outlook remains subject to significant uncertainties.  The HKMA will keep abreast of latest developments and stay vigilant against potential risks, with the aim of upholding the resilience and stability of the financial system, which are essential for the ongoing provision of critical financial services that support the functioning of the Hong Kong economy.\n\n# Staying vigilant against potential risks\n\nLooking ahead, markets may be subject to heightened volatilities amid increased uncertainties on various fronts. On the one hand, the US Federal Reserve’s monetary policy normalisation, if continuing at a fast pace, may tighten global financial conditions visibly ahead and increase the global debt-servicing burden.  On the other hand, following the escalation of the Ukraine situation in early 2022, geopolitical uncertainties including the China–US tension may continue to stay high and trigger bouts of financial market volatility again.  Last but not least, with the evolving pandemic developments, there might be a potential downside scenario where lockdowns were to be re-imposed at a large scale, leading to persistent global supply bottlenecks and adversely affecting global growth and inflation.  Having said that, Hong Kong’s financial system is well-positioned to withstand adverse shocks given the resilience and buffers built up over the years.  The HKMA also has the capability, resources and commitment to safeguard Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nThe HKMA will continue to closely monitor risks and vulnerabilities in the domestic and external environments and stand ready to deploy appropriate measures where necessary to maintain Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. Research programmes in 2022 will study issues affecting the Hong Kong economy and assess their potential risks. Meanwhile, the HKMA’s ongoing Digitalisation Programme will help enhance its surveillance capabilities to support more holistic surveillance and comprehensive analysis of the financial system.\n\n# Maintaining banking stability\n\nAs developed markets tighten monetary policies and the impact of the pandemic lingers, the credit landscape facing the banking sector is expected to remain challenging. At the same time, rapid technological advancement and digitalisation present both opportunities and challenges to the banking sector.  Facing an ever-changing financial landscape, the HKMA strives to ensure banks’ ability to withstand shocks through its ongoing supervisory efforts. At the same time, the HKMA will also continue to enhance and refine its banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account international standards and best practices.\n\n# A risk-based supervisory focus\n\n# Credit risk\n\nIn 2022, the HKMA will step up the surveillance of banks’ credit risk exposures and take proactive steps to ensure that overall risk levels remain well contained.\n\nThe HKMA will also continue to monitor the development of the pandemic and its effect on the operating conditions of corporates, as well as maintain close dialogue with the banking and commercial sectors while keeping the various relief measures under review.\n\n# Operational and technology risks\n\nWith the issuance of the new Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module on “Operational Resilience” in May 2022, the HKMA will continue to engage the industry and understand authorized institutions’ (AIs’) progress in developing their operational resilience frameworks.  In parallel, the HKMA will seek to raise the banking sector’s cyber resilience by following up with AIs on issues revealed by the assessments under the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 and monitoring AIs’ implementation of secure tertiary data backup.  Another key supervisory focus will be evaluating and addressing the risks from AIs’ growing dependency on technology service providers.\n\nWith enhanced digital capabilities and extensive remote working experience accumulated during the pandemic, some AIs are planning to transition to a hybrid working model on a business-as-usual basis.  The HKMA will keep track of this development and assess whether the associated risks are adequately addressed by the industry.\n\n# Liquidity and market risks\n\nThe HKMA will focus on the supervision of AIs’ liquidity and market risk management in 2022.  In particular, the HKMA will continue to monitor AIs’ progress in transitioning away from the remaining London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) settings before these settings cease to be published by 30 June 2023.\n\n# Combating money laundering and terrorist financing\n\nIn 2022, the HKMA’s work on anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT) will continue to focus on strengthening response to fraud and financial crime through collaboration and information sharing, pursuing closer co-operation with various stakeholders in the AML\/CFT ecosystem.  Other priorities are to implement a wider range of risk-sensitive supervisory techniques, by leveraging enhanced data and supervisory technology (Suptech) capabilities, and promote the use of Regtech by banks, including transaction monitoring systems.\n\nThe HKMA will also keep working closely with the Government, the banking and stored value facility (SVF) sectors to publish an updated Hong Kong money laundering and terrorist financing risk assessment, and assist the industry in combatting new and emerging risks.  Work will also continue on understanding evolving money laundering and terrorist financing risks, implementing changes to AML law and related guidance to align with international standards, and maintaining proactive engagement with other regulators and international standard setters.\n\n# Wealth management and mandatory provident fund-related businesses\n\nIn 2022, the HKMA will carry out on-site examinations and off-site surveillance of AIs’ conduct in relation to wealth management and the selling of securities, mandatory provident fund (MPF) and other investment and insurance products, with a focus on the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) Scheme in the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area, digital advisory platforms, complex products, virtual assets and non-investment-linked long term insurance products.\n\nWhile maintaining close communication with other regulators and the banking industry, the HKMA will provide further guidance on regulatory standards in relation to the sale of investment, insurance and MPF products.  This will cover, among other things, investment services related to virtual assets and the selling of Protection Linked Plans, a new subset of investment-linked assurance scheme products with high level of insurance protection.  The HKMA, the Insurance Authority and the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority will jointly launch a mystery shopping programme on the selling practices of intermediaries in respect of Qualifying Deferred Annuity Policies and Tax-deductible Voluntary Contributions.\n\nFollowing the smooth launch of the Cross-boundary WMC, the HKMA will continue engaging the industry and relevant regulatory authorities to enhance the scheme.\n\nMoreover, the HKMA will embark on preparation work for supervising AIs’ trust business under a new SPM module and a new Code of Practice.\n\n# Oversight of financial market infrastructures\n\nThe HKMA will continue to promote the safety and efficiency of the financial market infrastructures (FMIs) under its oversight, in accordance with the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO), the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMI)1, and the various guidances issued by the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI).  It will fine-tune the FMI oversight framework taking into account the latest technological and market developments.\n\nThe HKMA will work with the FMIs on their observance of the PFMI, conducting and updating assessments as appropriate. In addition, the HKMA will continue to participate in the CPMI-IOSCO PFMI implementation monitoring and assessment exercise.  The HKMA will also participate in the work of international standard setting bodies and strengthen its oversight requirements in response to market and technology developments and in line with international practices.  The HKMA will work with relevant authorities to further strengthen co-operative oversight arrangements where appropriate.\n\n# Policy development\n\nThe HKMA will continue to enhance and refine its banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account international standards and best practices.\n\n# Implementation of Basel standards in Hong Kong\n\n# Capital standards\n\nThe HKMA will continue to enhance the capital framework with the implementation of the standards published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) in recent years, which include the following:\n\nThe Capital Requirements for Banks’ Equity Investments in Funds of December 2013 (EIF standard), which will come into effect on 1 July 2022 with the Banking (Capital) (Amendment) Rules 2022 commencing operation after negative vetting by the Legislative Council.\n\nThe revised capital standards set out in the Basel III Finalising Post-crisis Reforms of December 2017, the Minimum Capital Requirements for Market Risk of January 2019 (revised in February 2019), and the Targeted Revisions to the Credit Valuation Adjustment Risk Framework of July 2020, which are collectively referred to as the “Basel III final reform package”.  These revised capital standards set out the revised capital treatment of credit risk, market risk, credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk and operational risk, introduce an output floor requirement, and enhance the leverage ratio framework.  Amendments to the Banking (Capital) Rules (BCR) are being prepared in consultation with the industry with a view to them taking effect from 1 July 2023 as minimum requirements (except for those on market risk and CVA risk2).\n\nGiven that the capital treatment for sovereign concentration risk under the BCR was designed to complement the Basel Committee’s large exposure framework as implemented by the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules, the HKMA will propose amendments to the capital rules in parallel with relevant changes to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules.\n\n# Exposure limits\n\nThe HKMA will continue its work on the proposed amendments to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules in consultation with the industry and the Department of Justice with a target implementation date aligned with the one for the Basel III final reform package, i.e. 1 July 2023.\n\n# Disclosure standards\n\nNew or revised disclosure requirements associated with the revised capital standards in the Basel III final reform package are mainly set out in the Pillar 33 Disclosure Requirements – Updated Framework and the Revisions to Market Risk Disclosure Requirements, published by the Basel Committee in December 2018 and November 2021 respectively.  The Basel Committee also published the Revisions to Leverage Ratio Disclosure Requirements in June 2019 amending the disclosure requirements for leverage ratio to address concerns regarding potential “window-dressing” (i.e. banks reducing the volumes of certain transactions around reporting dates to artificially inflate their leverage ratios for reporting and public disclosure).  Corresponding amendments to the Banking (Disclosure) Rules to implement these new or revised disclosure requirements are also being prepared, with a view to having them take effect in Hong Kong along the same timelines as their associated revised capital standards.\n\n# Other supervisory policies and risk management guidelines\n\nTo reflect developments in regulatory requirements and international standards, the HKMA plans to update certain SPM modules, including those relevant to the implementation of the revised capital and disclosure standards in the Basel III final reform package, “Countercyclical Capital Buffer – Approach to its Implementation”, “Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book”, “New Share Subscription and Share Margin Financing” and “Stress Testing”.  The HKMA will also continue to work on the revised SPM modules on “Code of Conduct” and “Reporting Requirements Relating to Authorized Institutions’ External Auditors under the Banking Ordinance”, with an aim to finalising the revisions within 2022. Consequential to the proposed amendments to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules, the related Code of Practice and SPM modules, e.g. CR-G-8 on “Large Exposures and Risk Concentrations” and CR-G-9 on “Exposures to Connected Parties”, will be updated

2022 年及以後的優先事項\n\n2022 年伊始，全球及本地情況顯著惡化。一方面，烏克蘭局勢升級，加上市場預期美國聯邦儲備局升息，觸發市場波動；另一方面，本地經濟亦受到新一波新冠疫情的衝擊。儘管如此，香港金融系統多年來建立起來的韌性及緩衝空間，使其仍然能夠抵禦不利衝擊。展望未來，金管局將繼續高度重視維護貨幣及金融穩定。在此過程中，我們將努力保持領先，及早識別新風險並靈活應對。同時，金管局亦會尋找機會，以鞏固香港作為國際領先金融中心的地位。在管理外匯基金時，面對複雜的投資環境，金管局將繼續審慎投資，保持靈活，適時採取防禦措施，並維持高流動性。\n\n# 金融系統的穩定性與健全性\n\n全球經濟前景仍然面臨重大不確定性。金管局將緊貼最新發展，保持警惕，防範潛在風險，以維持金融系統的韌性及穩定性，這對於持續提供支持香港經濟運作的重要金融服務至為關鍵。\n\n# 保持警惕，防範潛在風險\n\n展望未來，市場可能在多方面的不確定性增加下，面臨更大的波動性。一方面，若美國聯邦儲備局繼續快速推進貨幣政策正常化，全球金融狀況可能提前顯著收緊，並增加全球債務償還負擔。另一方面，在 2022 年初烏克蘭局勢升級後，地緣政治不確定性（包括中美緊張局勢）可能繼續維持在高水平，並再次觸發金融市場波動。最後但同樣重要的是，隨著疫情發展的變化，可能出現一個負面的下行情境，即大規模重新實施封鎖，導致全球供應持續瓶頸，並對全球成長及通膨造成不利影響。然而，香港金融系統多年來建立起來的韌性及緩衝空間，使其能夠抵禦不利衝擊。金管局亦具備能力、資源及決心，以保障香港的貨幣及金融穩定。\n\n金管局將繼續密切監察國內外環境的風險及脆弱性，並準備在必要時採取適當措施，以維持香港的貨幣及金融穩定。2022 年的研究計畫將探討影響香港經濟的問題，並評估其潛在風險。同時，金管局正在進行的數位化計畫將有助提升其監控能力，以支持對金融系統進行更全面的監控及綜合分析。\n\n# 維持銀行業穩定\n\n隨著已開發市場收緊貨幣政策，以及疫情的影響持續，銀行業面臨的信貸環境預期將保持充滿挑戰。同時，快速的科技發展及數位化為銀行業帶來機會及挑戰。面對不斷變化的金融環境，金管局致力透過持續的監管工作，確保銀行能夠抵禦衝擊。同時，金管局亦將繼續強化及完善銀行業的監管框架及政策，並參考國際標準及最佳實務。\n\n# 以風險為本的監管重點\n\n# 信貸風險\n\n2022 年，金管局將加強監控銀行的信貸風險敞口，並採取主動措施，確保整體風險水準保持在可控範圍內。\n\n金管局亦將繼續監控疫情的發展及其對企業營運環境的影響，並與銀行業及商界保持密切對話，同時檢討各項紓困措施。\n\n# 營運風險及科技風險\n\n2022 年 5 月，金管局發出新的《監管政策手冊》模組，主題為「營運韌性」，金管局將繼續與業界保持聯繫，瞭解獲授權機構在建立營運韌性框架方面的進展。同時，金管局將透過追蹤獲授權機構在「網路韌性評估框架 2.0」下的評估結果所揭示的問題，以及監控獲授權機構實施安全的第三層數據備份的情況，以提升銀行業的網路韌性。另一個監管重點是評估及應對獲授權機構日益依賴科技服務供應商所帶來的風險。\n\n部分獲授權機構在疫情期間累積了強大的數位能力及廣泛的遠端工作經驗，正計畫在日常業務中過渡至混合工作模式。金管局將密切關注此發展，並評估業界是否已充分應對相關風險。\n\n# 流動性風險及市場風險\n\n2022 年，金管局將重點監控獲授權機構的流動性及市場風險管理。具體而言，金管局將繼續監控獲授權機構在 2023 年 6 月 30 日倫敦銀行同業拆息（LIBOR）剩餘設定停止發布前，過渡至其他設定的進展。\n\n# 打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌措活動\n\n2022 年，金管局在反洗錢及反恐融資（AML\/CFT）方面的工作將繼續聚焦於透過協作及資訊共享，強化對詐騙及金融犯罪的應對措施，並致力與反洗錢及反恐融資生態系統中的各利益相關者更緊密合作。其他優先事項包括運用強化後的數據及監管科技（Suptech）能力，實施更廣泛的風險敏感監管技術，並推動銀行使用監管科技（Regtech），包括交易監控系統。\n\n金管局亦將繼續與政府、銀行業及儲值支付工具（SVF）業界緊密合作，發布經更新的香港洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌措風險評估報告，並協助業界應對新風險及新興風險。此外，金管局將繼續努力瞭解洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌措風險的演變情況，實施反洗錢法例及相關指引的修訂以符合國際標準，並保持與其它監管機構及國際標準制定機構的積極聯繫。\n\n# 財富管理及強積金相關業務\n\n2022 年，金管局將就獲授權機構在財富管理、證券銷售、強積金及其他投資和保險產品方面的行為，進行現場檢查及非現場監控，重點關注粵港澳大灣區「跨境理財通」計畫、數位顧問平台、複雜產品、虛擬資產及非與投資掛鉤的長期保險產品。\n\n金管局將與其它監管機構及銀行業保持緊密溝通，並就投資、保險及強積金產品的銷售提供進一步的監管標準指引。這將涵蓋與虛擬資產相關的投資服務，以及銷售「保障連結計畫」（一類具有高水準保險保障的新投資連結保單產品）。金管局、保險業監管局及強積金計劃管理局將聯合推出神秘顧客計畫，以監控中介人在「合格延期年金計畫」及「可扣稅自願性供款」方面的銷售手法。\n\n在「跨境理財通」順利推出後，金管局將繼續與業界及相關監管機構保持聯繫，以完善該計畫。\n\n此外，金管局將根據新的《監管政策手冊》模組及新的《操守守則》，展開監督獲授權機構信託業務的準備工作。\n\n# 監管金融市場基礎設施\n\n金管局將繼續根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（PSSVFO）、《金融市場基礎設施原則》（PFMI）1，以及支付與市場基礎設施委員會（CPMI）發出的各項指引，促進其監管下的金融市場基礎設施（FMIs）的安全性及效率。金管局將根據最新的科技及市場發展，優化金融市場基礎設施的監管框架。\n\n金管局將與金融市場基礎設施合作，監控其遵守《金融市場基礎設施原則》的情況，並適時進行評估及更新。此外，金管局將繼續參與 CPMI-IOSCO 的《金融市場基礎設施原則》實施監控及評估工作。金管局亦將參與國際標準制定機構的工作，並根據市場及科技發展，以及國際慣例，強化其監管要求。金管局將與相關部門合作，在適當時進一步強化合作監管安排。\n\n# 政策制定\n\n金管局將繼續強化及完善銀行業的監管框架及政策，並參考國際標準及最佳實務。\n\n# 在香港實施巴塞爾標準\n\n# 資本標準\n\n金管局將繼續強化資本框架，落實巴塞爾銀行監理委員會（巴塞爾委員會）近年發出的標準，包括下列各項：\n\n2013 年 12 月的《銀行對基金股本投資的資本要求》（EIF 標準）將於 2022 年 7 月 1 日生效，而《2022 年銀行（資本）（修訂）規則》亦將在立法會否決後開始實施。\n\n2017 年 12 月的《巴塞爾協議 III 最終後危機改革》、2019 年 1 月的《市場風險最低資本要求》（2019 年 2 月修訂）及 2020 年 7 月的《信貸估值調整風險框架專項修訂》，統稱為「巴塞爾協議 III 最終改革方案」，訂明了經修訂的信貸風險、市場風險、信貸估值調整（CVA）風險及操作風險的資本處理方法，引入產出下限要求，並強化槓桿比率框架。目前正與業界諮詢，修訂《銀行（資本）規則》（BCR），以期於 2023 年 7 月 1 日生效，作為最低要求（市場風險及 CVA 風險的相關規定除外 2）。\n\n鑑於《銀行（資本）規則》下對主權集中風險的資本處理旨在補充巴塞爾委員會的大型風險敞口框架（由《銀行（風險敞口限額）規則》實施），金管局將建議修訂資本規則，並同時對《銀行（風險敞口限額）規則》作出相關修訂。\n\n# 風險敞口限額\n\n金管局將繼續與業界及司法部磋商，推進《銀行（風險敞口限額）規則》的建議修訂工作，目標實施日期與《巴塞爾協議 III 最終改革方案》的實施日期一致，即 2023 年 7 月 1 日。\n\n# 披露標準\n\n與《巴塞爾協議 III 最終改革方案》中經修訂的資本標準相關的新披露要求或經修訂的披露要求，主要載於巴塞爾委員會分別於 2018 年 12 月及 2021 年 11 月發出的《第三支柱披露要求——更新框架》及《市場風險披露要求修訂》。巴塞爾委員會亦於 2019 年 6 月發出《槓桿比率披露要求修訂》，修訂槓桿比率的披露要求，以解決對潛在「報表粉飾」（即銀行在報告日期前後減少某些交易量，以人為地抬高其槓桿比率，供報告及公開披露）的關注。為落實這些新披露要求或經修訂的披露要求，正準備對《銀行（披露）規則》作出相應修訂，以期與相關經修訂的資本標準同時在香港生效。\n\n# 其他監管政策及風險管理指引\n\n為反映監管要求及國際標準的最新發展，金管局計畫更新部分《監管政策手冊》模組，包括與《巴塞爾協議 III

{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nWith strong merchandise exports, reviving domestic demand and a boost from the Government’s supportive policy measures, the Hong Kong economy resumed positive growth in 2021, reversing the contraction experienced during 2019 and 2020. The labour market also improved, and inflation remained moderate albeit having edged up. While economic recovery is expected to continue after the fifth wave of COVID-19 subsides, its strength and speed are subject to uncertainties and risks, especially those surrounding the pandemic and the path of US monetary policy normalisation.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Real activities\n\nDriven by strong merchandise exports and improving domestic demand, the Hong Kong economy grew by 6.3% in 2021, ending the economic contraction in 2019 and 2020 (Table 1 and Chart 1).  Private consumption recovered, thanks to improved labour market conditions and a boost from the Government’s Consumption Voucher Scheme1. Overall investment spending also rebounded as the business environment and outlook improved2.  Externally, HongKong’s exports of goods saw strong growth for the whole year, in part supported by the continued global economic recovery.  Export of services recorded modest growth, reflecting active regional trade and cargo flows as well as stronger cross-border business and financial activities. Total imports rose appreciably, mainly because of greater domestic and re-export-induced demand.  On a net basis, external trade contributed positively to real gross domestic product (GDP) growth in 2021 (Chart 1) as total exports grew faster than imports.\n\nTable 1 Real GDP growth by expenditure component (period-over-period)\n\nNote: The seasonally-adjusted quarter-on-quarter rates of change in the gross domestic fixed capital formation are not available. Source: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Inflation\n\nInflationary pressures edged up but remained moderate during the year.  Netting out the effects of the Government’s one-off relief measures, the year-on-year underlying inflation rate3 picked up gradually to a mild 1.4% in December (Chart 2)4.  Prices of consumer items such as dining out, transport, clothing and footwear regained upward momentum as local consumption demand improved. Import prices also increased notably alongside bottlenecks in global supply chains and the surge in international energy and commodity prices.  By contrast, the housing component was a drag on overall inflation, reflecting the feed-through of the earlier decline in fresh-letting private residential rentals (Chart 2).  More broadly, slow growth in nominal wage and commercial rentals helped keep domestic business cost pressures in check.  For 2021 as a whole, the underlying and headline inflation rates5 stayed mild at 0.6% and 1.6% respectively.\n\nChart 2 Underlying consumer price inflation\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Labour market\n\nAlongside the domestic economic recovery, the labour market improved in 2021.  After reaching a 17-year high of 7.2% in February, the unemployment rate declined visibly to 4.0% in December6 (Chart 3) and the decline was broad based across most economic sectors.  Overall labour demand strengthened gradually as reflected by a pick-up in total employment (Chart 3) and private sector vacancies, though they were still below their pre-pandemic peaks.  On the other hand, the labour force shrank slightly by 1.3% in December compared with a year earlier, partly due to a modest decline in the labour force participation rate. The year-on-year growth in nominal wage and labour earnings, while moderate, showed signs of acceleration in the first three quarters of 2021, reversing the trend of deceleration during 2019–2020.\n\nChart 3 Labour market conditions\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe local stock market was broadly sluggish during the year, despite a continued rally in some major overseas equity markets (Chart 4).  Extending its rebound in late 2020, the Hang Seng Index rose to a high of 31,085 on 17 February 2021, but market sentiment had turned sharply negative since then owing to a host of factors, including concerns about the new COVID-19 virus variants, potential monetary policy tightening by major central banks and reduced inflows from southbound trading under Stock Connect7.  The Hang Seng Index closed the year at 23,398, down markedly by 14.1% from a year ago.\n\nChart 4 Asset prices\nSources: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market regained some upward momentum in the first half of 2021 alongside better economic prospects, but saw some consolidation in the second half amid weakened asset market sentiments (Chart 4).  Overall, housing prices and transaction volume still recorded an increase of 3.7% and 24.1% respectively in 2021. Household affordability also became even more stretched, partly reflecting reduced household income.  On the other hand, after going through sharp corrections in 2019 and 2020, the non-residential property markets generally improved, with prices and rentals of industrial properties generally rising to their pre-pandemic peaks, whereas those of retail and office spaces remained below their respective peaks.\n\nSee Table B: Major Economic Indicators on pages 326 to 327 for more details, including their trends during 2017–2021.\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nIn early 2022, the fifth wave of local COVID-19 infections has exerted pressures on domestic economic activities. In response, the Government introduced the fifth and the sixth rounds of the Anti-epidemic Fund and additional countercyclical measures under the 2022–23 Budget to help support the economy.  The HKMA, together with the banking sector, also extended the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme to the end of October 2022.\n\nFor 2022 as a whole, economic recovery is expected to continue, albeit at a more moderate pace compared to 2021, partly reflecting the impact of the fifth wave of COVID-19, slower global economic growth, a less favourable base effect and US monetary policy normalisation.  The Government forecasts real GDP growth for 2022 to be in the range of 1–2% and the latest growth estimates by international organisations and private sector analysts averaged 1.1%.  That said, the strength and pace of the recovery are subject to a host of uncertainties and risks, especially those surrounding the pandemic, the Ukraine situation, and the path of US monetary policy normalisation.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nAlongside rising import prices and pandemic-induced logistics disruptions, inflationary pressures are expected to edge up in the near term, but should stay broadly in check owing to soft rentals and mild local labour cost pressures. Market consensus forecasts a headline inflation rate of 2.4% in 2022, while the Government projects the headline and underlying inflation rates to be 2.1% and 2.0% respectively. The fifth wave of local COVID-19 infections has exerted pressures on the labour market in early 2022, especially for contact-intensive sectors.  Further out, labour market conditions will depend on the pandemic developments and the pace of the domestic economic recovery.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector continued to be stable in 2021.  Total banking assets expanded moderately as both loans and deposits increased.  The capital and liquidity positions of the banking sector remained robust. Asset quality stayed at a healthy level by both historical and international standards.\n\n# Balance sheet trends\n\nThe banking sector’s balance sheet grew by 1.9% in 2021. Driven by the economic recovery, total loans recorded a growth of 3.8% during the year, compared with 1.2% in 2020.  Among the total, loans for use in Hong Kong grew by 4.4%, loans for use outside Hong Kong grew by 1.1% and trade finance increased by 14.2%.  Mainland-related lending expanded by 3.6% in 2021, after remaining largely stable in 2020.\n\nOn the liability side, total deposits rose by 4.6% in 2021, compared with 5.4% in 2020.  As total deposits increased at a faster pace than total loans, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio edged down to 71.8% at the end of 2021 from 72.3% a year ago (Chart 5).\n\nChart 5 Loans and deposits of the banking sector\nSource: HKMA.\n\n# Capital adequacy\n\nThe banking sector remained well capitalised. The consolidated total capital ratio of locally incorporated authorized institutions (AIs) stood at 20.2% at the end of 2021.  The Tier 1 capital ratio was 18.2% (Chart 6). Both ratios were well above their respective international minimum requirements of 8% and 6%.\n\nThe Basel III leverage ratio was 7.9% at the end of 2021, well above the statutory minimum requirement of 3% (Chart 7).\n\n# Liquidity\n\nThe liquidity position of the banking sector was sound.  The quarterly average Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) of category 1 institutions8 was 151.9% in the fourth quarter of 2021, well\n\nabove the statutory minimum requirement of 100%. The quarterly average Liquidity Maintenance Ratio (LMR) of category 2 institutions was 59.1%, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 25% (Chart 8).\n\nChart 8 Liquidity ratios of designated AIs\nSource: HKMA.\n\nThe sources of funding of the banking sector remained stable.  The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) of category 1 institutions was 135.3% at the end of 2021, well above the statutory minimum requirement of 100%.  The Core Funding\n\nRatio (CFR) of category 2A institutions9 was 150.3% at the end of 2021, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 75% (Chart 9).\n\nChart 9 Funding ratios of designated AIs\nSource: HKMA.\n\n# Asset quality\n\nAsset quality remained stable during the year and stayed at a healthy level by both historical and international standards. The classified loan ratio was 0.88% at the end of 2021 as compared to 0.90% at the end of 2020, with the overdue and rescheduled loan ratio edging down to 0.56% from 0.57% during the period (Chart 10).  The classified loan ratio for Mainland-related lending was 0.86% at the end of 2021 as compared to 0.96% at the end of 2020.  The delinquency ratios of residential mortgage lending and credit card lending remained low at 0.04% and 0.20% respectively (Chart 11). The HKMA will continue to closely monitor the change in the asset quality of the banking sector.\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe low interest rate environment continued to weigh on the profitability of the banking sector.  The aggregate pre-tax operating profit of retail banks declined by 19.8% in 2021 (Chart 12), mainly attributable to a decrease in net interest income (-13.6%) and an increase in total operating expenses (+7.1%).  These were partly offset by an increase in income from fees and commissions (+9.6%) and a drop in loan impairment charges (-25.1%).  The net interest margin further narrowed to 0.98% in 2021 from 1.18% in 2020 (Chart 13).\n\nRetail banks’ cost-to-income ratio rose to 54.7% in 2021 from 47.0% in 2020 (Chart

經濟及金融環境\n\n受惠於強勁的商品出口、內需復甦，以及政府支持性政策措施的推動，香港經濟於2021年回復正增長，扭轉了2019年及2020年的收縮局面。勞動市場亦有所改善，通膨雖然有所上升，但仍然溫和。雖然預期經濟復甦會在第五波新冠疫情減退後持續，但其力度和速度仍存在不確定性和風險，尤其是與疫情及美國貨幣政策正常化路徑相關的風險。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 實質活動\n\n受強勁商品出口及內需改善所帶動，香港經濟於2021年增長6.3%，結束了2019年及2020年的經濟收縮（表1及圖1）。私人消費復甦，主要受惠於勞動市場情況改善及政府消費券計畫的推動。整體投資開支亦隨着營商環境及前景改善而反彈。對外方面，香港全年商品出口錄得強勁增長，部分原因是全球經濟持續復甦。服務輸出錄得溫和增長，反映區域貿易及貨運活動活躍，以及跨境商業及金融活動增強。總進口顯著上升，主要是由於內需及轉口帶動的需求增加。在淨額基礎上，由於總出口增速高於進口，對外貿易於2021年對實質國內生產毛額（國內生產毛額）增長帶來支持（圖1）。\n\n表1 按開支項目劃分的實質國內生產毛額增長（按年比較）\n\n附註：經季節性調整的國內固定資本形成總額按季變動率並無備妥。資料來源：人口普查及統計署。\n\n# 通膨\n\n通膨壓力於該年微升，但仍然溫和。若撇除政府一次性紓困措施的影響，基本通膨率按年於12月逐步回升至輕微的1.4%（圖2）3,4。由於本地消費需求改善，外出用膳、交通、服裝及鞋類等消費項目的價格重拾上升動力。進口價格亦因全球供應鏈瓶頸及國際能源和商品價格急升而顯著上升。相反，房屋項目拖低整體通膨，反映早前私人住宅新租約租金下跌的影響（圖2）。更廣泛而言，名義薪資及商用租金增幅放緩，有助紓緩本地企業的成本壓力。整體而言，2021年基本通膨率及整體通膨率5均維持在溫和的0.6%及1.6%的水平。\n\n圖2 基本消費物價通膨\n資料來源：人口普查及統計署。\n\n# 勞動市場\n\n隨着國內經濟復甦，勞動市場於2021年有所改善。失業率於2月升至7.2%的17年高位後，顯著回落至12月的4.0%6（圖3），且跌幅遍及大部分行業。整體勞動需求逐步轉強，反映於總就業人數（圖3）及民間機構空缺職位有所增加，但兩者仍低於疫情前的最高水平。另一方面，勞動人口於12月按年輕微下跌1.3%，部分原因是勞動人口參與率略為下降。名義薪資及工資按年增幅雖然溫和，但在2021年首三季卻有加快跡象，扭轉了2019年至2020年的減速趨勢。\n\n圖3 勞動市場情況\n資料來源：人口普查及統計署。\n\n# 股市\n\n儘管部分主要海外股市持續上漲，本地股市在該年大致疲軟（圖4）。恆生指數延續2020年年底的反彈勢頭，於2021年2月17日升至31,085的高位，但其後市場氣氛因多項因素急轉負面，包括對新冠病毒新變種的憂慮、主要央行可能收緊貨幣政策，以及「股聯通」下的南向交易資金流入減少7。恆生指數於年底收報23,398，按年顯著下跌14.1%。\n\n圖4 資產價格\n資料來源：差餉物業估價署及香港交易及結算所有限公司。\n\n# 房地產市場\n\n隨着經濟前景改善，住宅房地產市場於2021年上半年重拾上升動力，但於下半年隨着資產市場氣氛轉弱而有所整固（圖4）。整體而言，住宅房價及成交量於2021年仍分別錄得3.7%及24.1%的升幅。家庭負擔能力亦變得更為緊張，部分原因是家庭收入減少。另一方面，非住宅房地產市場在經歷了2019年及2020年的顯著調整後，整體有所改善，工業物業的價格及租金普遍升至疫情前的最高水平，而零售及辦公空間的價格及租金則仍低於各自的最高水平。\n\n更多詳情請參閱第326至327頁表B：主要經濟指標，包括其在2017年至2021年的走勢。\n\n# 經濟展望\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n2022年初，第五波本地新冠疫情對經濟活動造成壓力。為此，政府推出第五及第六輪「防疫抗疫基金」，並在《2022-23年度財政預算案》下推出額外逆週期措施，以支持經濟。金管局亦與銀行業一同把「預先批核還款假期計畫」延長至2022年10月底。\n\n整體而言，預期經濟復甦在2022年會持續，但步伐會較2021年溫和，部分原因是受第五波新冠疫情、全球經濟增長放緩、基數效應較不利，以及美國貨幣政策正常化的影響。政府預測2022年實質國內生產毛額增長介乎1%至2%之間，而國際組織及民間機構分析師的最新增長預測平均為1.1%。然而，復甦的力度和步伐仍受多項不確定因素和風險所影響，尤其是與疫情、烏克蘭局勢及美國貨幣政策正常化路徑相關的風險。\n\n# 通膨及勞動市場\n\n隨著進口價格上升及疫情引致的物流中斷，預期通膨壓力在短期內會有所上升，但由於租金疲弱及本地勞工成本壓力溫和，通膨應大致受控。市場共識預測2022年整體通膨率為2.4%，而政府則預測整體通膨率及基本通膨率分別為2.1%及2.0%。第五波本地新冠疫情在2022年初對勞動市場造成壓力，尤其是對接觸較頻密的行業。長遠而言，勞動市場情況將取決於疫情發展及本地經濟復甦的步伐。\n\n# 銀行業表現\n\n香港銀行業於2021年繼續保持穩健。銀行業總資產溫和增長，貸款及存款均有所增加。銀行業的資本及流動性狀況保持良好。資產品質按歷史及國際標準均維持在健康水平。\n\n# 資產負債表趨勢\n\n銀行業資產負債表於2021年增長1.9%。受經濟復甦帶動，全年貸款總額錄得3.8%的增長，較2020年的1.2%為高。在總額中，用於香港的貸款增長4.4%，用於香港以外的貸款增長1.1%，而貿易融資則增長14.2%。與內地相關的貸款於2021年增長3.6%，而2020年則大致保持穩定。\n\n在負債方面，存款總額於2021年上升4.6%，較2020年的5.4%為低。由於存款總額增速高於貸款總額，整體貸存比率由上年年底的72.3%微跌至2021年年底的71.8%（圖5）。\n\n圖5 銀行業貸款及存款\n資料來源：金管局。\n\n# 資本充足性\n\n銀行業的資本狀況維持穩健。本地註冊認可機構的綜合資本比率於2021年年底為20.2%。一級資本比率為18.2%（圖6）。這兩個比率均遠高於國際最低要求的8%及6%。\n\n巴塞爾III槓桿比率於2021年年底為7.9%，遠高於法定最低要求的3%（圖7）。\n\n# 流動性\n\n銀行業的流動性狀況良好。第1類機構的流動性覆蓋比率（LCR）於2021年第四季的季度平均值為151.9%，遠高於\n\n法定最低要求的100%。第2類機構的流動性維持比率（LMR）季度平均值為59.1%，亦遠高於法定最低要求的25%（圖8）。\n\n圖8

{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nDespite the lingering uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and increased concerns about the pace of US monetary tightening, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to trade in a smooth and orderly manner.  As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability since it was implemented in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System has shown its strength and resilience to external shocks.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability.  This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\n# The Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n\nCertificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks; Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation; the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of clearing account balances kept with the HKMA; and Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs).  With the HKMA standing ready to sell (or buy) Hong Kong dollars to (or from) banks in exchange for US dollars upon request at 7.75 (or 7.85) per US dollar, when the strong-side (or weak-side) CU is triggered, the Aggregate Balance will expand (or contract) to push down (or up) Hong Kong dollar interest rates that would help move the Hong Kong dollar back to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2021\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nDriven by equity-related demand arising from fundraising activities and the southbound Stock Connects1, the Hong Kong dollar traded close to the strong-side CU at the beginning of the year.  Thereafter, the Hong Kong dollar weakened amid stock market correction and repatriation of initial public offering (IPO) proceeds by some newly listed firms before rebounding slightly in the second quarter due to corporates’ dividend payment needs and net inflows from the southbound Stock Connects.  Stepping into the second half of the year, while the Hong Kong dollar drifted lower amid softened equity market sentiment, it stayed mostly at the strong side of the Convertibility Zone and continued to trade in a smooth and orderly manner (Chart 1).  Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market functioned normally throughout 2021.\n\nChart 1 Market exchange rate in 2021\n\nAs the CUs were not triggered, the total of the Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs remained virtually unchanged at around HK$1,526.3 billion in 2021 (Chart 2). During the year, the HKMA issued a total of HK$80 billion additional Exchange Fund Bills to meet the ongoing demand for Exchange Fund paper by banks amid the abundance of liquidity in the banking system, which led to a contraction of the Aggregate Balance from HK$457.5 billion at the end of 2020 to HK$377.5 billion at the end of 2021.\n\nReflecting the additional issuance of Exchange Fund Bills and the issuance of EFBNs to absorb EFBNs’ interest payments according to the established practice, the outstanding EFBNs increased from HK$1,069.2 billion to HK$1,148.8 billion during the year.  The Monetary Base as a whole remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\n# HK$1,526.3 billion\n\nTotal Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs\n\nChart 2 Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding Exchange Fund papers in 2021\n\n# Money market\n\nWith the sizeable Aggregate Balance, the Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained largely stable at low levels throughout the year (Chart 3).  While the demand for the Hong Kong dollar increased along with the IPO activities during the first quarter, Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs) of various tenors saw little fluctuations.  Thereafter, HIBORs remained largely stable despite concerns about the pace of US monetary tightening.  Towards the end of 2021, HIBORs witnessed mild pick-ups, partly reflecting anticipated funding needs towards the year end.  On the retail front, banks kept their Best Lending Rates unchanged.  Overall, Hong Kong’s money markets continued to function normally.  Discount Window borrowing decreased to HK$6.8 billion in 2021 from HK$9.1 billion in 2020.\n\nChart 3 Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates in 2021\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nThe Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has been a strong anchor of Hong Kong’s financial system for more than three decades and has shown its strength and resilience to challenges.  Despite lingering uncertainties surrounding global economic recovery, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to function in an orderly manner, reflecting the robustness of the LERS.  The Government is firmly committed to the LERS.  In its 2021 External Sector Report, the International Monetary Fund once again reiterated that the credibility of the LERS has been assured by a transparent set of rules, ample fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nA robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS.  Hong Kong’s banking sector continued to operate smoothly with liquidity positions and capitalisation faring very well by international standards.  To ensure resilience of the banking sector, the HKMA has been closely monitoring banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and has maintained its supervisory efforts on bank lending.\n\nTo improve transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998.  The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) moved within a range of 109.8–110.5% during 2021, without touching the Upper or the Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 110.2% on 31 December (Chart 4). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate.  The ample financial resources of the Exchange Fund, together with the sound banking system, provide a powerful backstop to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nChart 4 Daily movement of the Backing Ratio in 2021\n\n# Currency Board Sub-Committee\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong.  In 2021, the CBC considered issues, including an assessment of inflation in the US, implications of the US dollar depreciation on Hong Kong, assessment of the taper tantrum risk and its impact on Hong Kong, and understanding the influence of Mainland-related fund flows on monetary conditions in Hong Kong.  Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and reports on the Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Notes and coins\n\nAt the end of 2021, the total value of banknotes issued by note-issuing banks in circulation was HK$592.6 billion, an increase of 5.9% from a year earlier (Charts 5, 6 and 7). The total value of Government-issued notes and coins in circulation amounted to HK$12.9 billion at the end of 2021, up 1.7% year on year (Charts 8 and 9).\n\n# HK$592.6 billion, +5.9%\n\nTotal value of banknotes issued by note-issuing banks\n\n# HK$12.9 billion, +1.7%\n\nTotal value of notes and coins issued by Government\n\n# Chart 5\n\nBanknotes in circulation by note-issuing banks at the end of 2021\n\n# Chart 6 \n\nDistribution of banknotes in circulation at the end of 2021\n\n# Hong Kong banknotes\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA arranged 14 seminars for more than 4,000 participants, including professionals in the banking and retail industries as well as students, to help enhance their knowledge and skills in differentiating between authentic and counterfeit banknotes.  These public education programmes on the design and security features of Hong Kong banknotes are well received.\n\n# Coin Collection Programme\n\nThe Coin Collection Programme continued to be well received by the public.  More information about the Programme can be found in the Sustainability chapter on page 198.\n\n# Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\n\nThe EFBN Programme continued to operate smoothly. To meet the ongoing demand for Exchange Fund paper by banks amid the abundance of liquidity in the banking system, the HKMA issued a total of HK$80 billion additional Exchange Fund Bills in the second half of 2021.  The additional issuance resulted in a corresponding reduction of the Aggregate Balance.  At the end of 2021, the nominal amount of outstanding Exchange Fund papers stood at HK$1,148.6 billion (Table 2).\n\nTable 2 Outstanding issues of Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\n\n# Monetary research\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMR)  maintained a steady research output in 2021 despite the ongoing pandemic.  During the year, the HKIMR released 30 working papers and held nine webinars, which encompassed a wide range of topics including monetary policy, banking stability, market microstructure and financial technology (fintech) development.  The HKIMR also organised an international conference and a webinar in hybrid format.\n\nThe webinar, titled RMB Exchange Rate Formation Mechanism and Exchange Rate Outlook, was co-organised with the Hong Kong Academy of Finance on 17 August.  It was live-streamed on a number of online platforms and attracted a total of over 1.16 million real-time views.\n\nThe 11th Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy, titled On the Path to Common Prosperity: China’s Economic Development in Dual Circulation, was held on 11 November.  The conference discussed recent policy developments related to common prosperity, dual circulation, anti-monopoly regulations, property market, Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect and financial developments in the Greater Bay Area5.  Expert speakers also presented in-depth analyses on the impact of population ageing and the sustainability of social security funds, as well as China’s contribution to global financial stability and world economy.  The six different sessions of the conference attracted over 3,200 online and on-site viewers, totaling 5,900

貨幣穩定\n\n儘管 COVID-19 疫情持續存在不確定性，且對美國貨幣緊縮步伐的憂慮增加，港元匯率及貨幣市場仍繼續平穩有序地運作。自 1983 年實施以來，聯繫匯率制度一直是香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石，展現了面對外部衝擊的實力和韌性。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的首要目標是維持貨幣穩定。這被定義為香港貨幣在對外匯市中相對美元的匯率，保持在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的區間內，使其對外匯兌換價值保持穩定。貨幣制度的結構主要採用貨幣委員會制度，要求貨幣基礎至少百分之百地由外匯基金持有的美元儲備支持，且貨幣基礎的變動必須百分之百地與美元儲備的相應變動相匹配。\n\n# 貨幣基礎（表1）包括以下項目：\n\n負債證書為三家發鈔銀行發行的紙幣提供全額擔保；政府發行的流通紙幣和硬幣；存放於金管局的清算賬戶餘額總和，即總結餘；以及由金管局代表政府發行的外匯基金票據及債券（EFBNs）。\n\n香港元匯率的穩定，是透過自動利率調整機制，以及香港金融管理局堅決履行兌換保證（Convertibility Undertakings, CUs）來維持的。當強方（或弱方）兌換保證被觸發時，香港金融管理局隨時準備應銀行要求，以7.75（或7.85）港元兌1美元的匯率，出售（或購買）港元給（或向）銀行；此時，結餘總額將會擴大（或收縮），以促使港元利率下降（或上升），從而協助港元匯率回復至7.75至7.85的兌換區間內。\n\n# 2021 年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定性\n\n由於與股票相關的需求受到籌資活動及南向港股通1的帶動，港元在今年初曾觸及強方兌換保證水平附近。其後，港元隨着股市調整及部分新上市公司把首次公開招股（IPO）所得資金調回而轉弱，及後在第二季因企業派發股息的需要及南向港股通錄得淨流入而略為反彈。踏入下半年，雖然港元在股市氣氛轉弱下有所回軟，但大致維持在可兌換區間的強方水平，並繼續平穩及有序地運作（圖1）。整體而言，港元兌換市場在2021年全年運作正常。\n\n圖表 1：2021年市場匯率\n\n由於貨幣單位（CUs）並未被觸發，2021年總結餘及未償還外匯基金票據（EFBNs）的總額大致維持不變，約為15,263億港元（圖2）。在銀行體系流動性充裕的情況下，為滿足銀行對外匯基金票據的持續需求，金管局在當年合共發行了800億港元額外的外匯基金票據，導致總結餘由2020年底的4,575億港元收縮至2021年底的3,775億港元。\n\n反映外匯基金票據的額外發行，以及根據既定慣例發行外匯基金票據以吸納其利息支付，未償還的外匯基金票據在本年度內由10,692億港元增至11,488億港元。整體貨幣基礎仍然獲得外匯儲備的充分支持。\n\n# 港元15,263億元\n\n總餘額及未償付的 EFBNs\n\n圖 2 2021 年貼現窗口前之總餘額及未償還外匯基金票據\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n由於總結餘維持在可觀的水平，港元銀行同業拆息在全年大部分時間內保持低位穩定（圖3）。儘管首季港元需求隨着首次公開招股活動增加，但不同期限的香港銀行同業拆息（HIBOR）波動不大。此後，儘管市場對美國收緊貨幣政策的步伐存在憂慮，HIBOR 仍大致保持穩定。踏入2021年底，HIBOR 出現輕微上升，部分反映了預期年底資金需求增加。在零售方面，銀行維持最優惠利率不變。總體而言，香港貨幣市場繼續正常運作。2021年，貼現窗借貸額由2020年的91億港元降至68億港元。\n\n圖表 3：2021 年港元銀行同業拆息\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n聯繫匯率制度（LERS）三十多年來一直是香港金融體系的堅實支柱，並展現出其應對挑戰的實力與韌性。儘管全球經濟復甦仍存在持續的不確定性，港元匯率及貨幣市場仍能有序運作，反映了聯繫匯率制度的穩健性。政府堅定地致力於維持聯繫匯率制度。國際貨幣基金組織在2021年對外部門報告中再次重申，聯繫匯率制度的可信度得到了透明的規則體系、充裕的財政及外匯儲備、強有力的金融監管與監督、靈活的經濟體以及審慎的財政框架的保障。\n\n穩健的銀行體系對於LERS的正常運作至關重要。香港銀行業繼續平穩運作，其流動性及資本充足率表現均符合國際標準。為確保銀行業的韌性，香港金管局一直密切監控銀行的信貸、流動性及利率風險管理，並持續監察壓力測試結果及銀行貸款情況。\n\n為提升貨幣管理局賬戶的透明度，自1998年10月起，外匯基金資產中特定部分已被配置用以支持貨幣基礎。2021年間，支持比率（定義為支持資產除以貨幣基礎）在109.8%至110.5%的範圍內波動，並未觸及上限或下限觸發水平。該比率於12月31日收報110.2%（圖4）。在聯繫匯率制度下，雖然外匯基金的特定資產已被指定為支持資產組合，但所有外匯基金資產均可用於支持港元匯率。外匯基金充裕的財務資源，加上健全的銀行體系，為香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供了強大的後盾。\n\n圖表 4：2021 年支持比率的每日變動情形\n\n# 貨幣管理局小組委員會\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的貨幣委員會小組（CBC）負責監察及檢討與香港貨幣及金融穩定相關的事宜。2021年，CBC探討了多項議題，包括評估美國的通膨情況、美元貶值對香港的影響、評估縮減恐慌風險及其對香港的影響，以及了解與內地相關的資金流動對香港貨幣狀況的影響。CBC就這些議題進行討論的紀錄，以及提交給CBC的貨幣委員會運作報告，均已刊登於香港金管局的網站上。\n\n# 紙幣與硬幣\n\n截至2021年底，發鈔銀行發行的紙幣在市面流通總值為5,926億港元，較前一年上升5.9%（圖5、6及7）。截至2021年底，政府發行的紙幣及硬幣在市面流通總值達129億港元，較前一年上升1.7%（圖8及9）。\n\n# 港幣5,926億元，上升5.9%\n\n發鈔銀行發行紙幣的總金額\n\n# 港幣129億元，上升1.7%\n\n政府發行紙幣及硬幣之總值\n\n# 圖表 5\n\n2021年底發鈔銀行發行的流通紙幣數量\n\n圖表 6\n\n2021 年底流通中紙幣的分佈情況\n\n# 香港紙幣\n\n今年，香港金融管理局舉辦了14場研討會，吸引超過4,000名參加者，包括銀行業和零售業的專業人士，以及學生，以協助他們提升辨別真假紙幣的知識和技能。這些有關香港紙幣設計和防偽特徵的公眾教育活動，深獲好評。\n\n# 錢幣收藏計畫\n\n硬幣收集計畫持續受到大眾歡迎。更多有關此計畫的資訊，請參閱第 198 頁的永續發展章節。\n\n# 外匯基金票據及債券\n\nEFBN 計畫繼續順利運作。為滿足銀行在銀行體系流動性充裕的情況下對外匯基金票據的持續需求，金管局在 2021 年下半年合共發行了額外 800 億港元的外匯基金票據。額外發行票據導致總結餘相應減少。截至 2021 年底，未償還外匯基金票據的面值金額為 11,486 億港元（見表 2）。\n\n表二 外匯基金票據及債券的未到期發行量\n\n# 貨幣研究\n\n儘管疫情持續，香港金融與貨幣研究學院（HKIMR）在2021年仍維持穩定的研究產出。在該年度，HKIMR發布了30份工作論文，並舉辦了九場網路研討會，涵蓋了貨幣政策、銀行穩定性、市場微觀結構及金融科技發展等廣泛主題。此外，HKIMR亦以混合形式舉辦了一場國際會議及一場網路研討會。\n\n8

{"en":"# Banking Stability\n\nThe banking sector in Hong Kong remained sound and stable in 2021, despite the emergence of more contagious COVID-19 variants, causing uncertainty to global economic recovery.  During the year, the HKMA remained focused on the supervision of authorized institutions’ risk management.  Supervision of authorized institutions’ operational and cyber resilience was also stepped up in light of escalating cyber threats and accelerating digitalisation in the banking sector.\n\nOn conduct supervision, the HKMA provided guidance to banks to facilitate the use of non-face-to-face channels for distributing investment and insurance products, and worked with fellow regulators to formulate supervisory requirements on new products in the market such as insurance-linked securities and virtual assets.  The Code of Banking Practice was also revised to enhance consumer protection in digital financial services.\n\nIn the area of anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT), the HKMA’s priority has been to further strengthen banks’ gatekeeper role in the ecosystem and their ability to prevent and detect illicit fund flows associated with increases in online fraud, mule account networks and other financial crimes during the pandemic.  To increase protection for customer accounts against fraud and financial crimes, the HKMA scaled up collaboration and information sharing with other stakeholders via public-private partnerships.  While supporting remote customer on-boarding, the HKMA also encouraged adoption of other technologies including network analytics through the launch of the first AML Regtech Lab in November.  Internationally, proactive engagement has kept the HKMA at the forefront of global AML\/CFT efforts in the Financial Action Task Force.\n\nOn the development front, the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Pilot Scheme in the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area was launched smoothly in September.  During the year, the HKMA continued to execute its two-year roadmap for promoting Regtech adoption in Hong Kong.  Several initiatives were rolled out to lay the foundation for banks’ climate risk management and promote green and sustainable banking more broadly, as discussed in the Sustainability chapter. Further efforts were also made in the area of soft infrastructure, including promoting a customercentric corporate culture, as well as working with the banking industry to roll out capacity-building initiatives to facilitate talent development.\n\nMeanwhile, the HKMA has worked closely with the banking industry in optimising supervisory policies and processes. Good progress was made on implementing international supervisory standards locally, including those on capital adequacy and disclosure.  The HKMA continued to advance its work to ensure a credible resolution regime for authorized institutions, including developing new resolution standards and implementing rules on loss-absorbing capacity requirements to enhance authorized institutions’ resolvability.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system.  Achieving this objective is contingent upon a highly resilient financial system that is capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their businesses and, in extreme cases, by failing in a disorderly manner.  The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring that banks are resilient to shocks and able to recover their positions in crises, ultimately helping to prevent failures.  The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks and is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs).\n\nHowever, the Monetary Authority cannot ensure, nor is the Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework designed to ensure, a zero-risk financial system.  Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that, in the event of an AI becoming non-viable, its failure can be managed in an orderly manner.  To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong has been established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs, among other types of institutions.  To operationalise the resolution regime in Hong Kong, it is important to lay down resolution rules and policy standards, undertake resolution planning to remove impediments to AIs’ resolvability and develop the HKMA’s operational capability to resolve a failing AI.  In order to carry out these tasks effectively, the HKMA adopts an internationally harmonised and co-ordinated approach.\n\nThe Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs). In overseeing FMIs, the HKMA aims to promote their general safety and efficiency, limit systemic risk and foster transparency.  Making FMIs more resilient to financial crises protects the monetary and financial systems in Hong Kong from possible destabilising effects arising from disruption to the FMIs.  Information regarding the HKMA’s oversight approach is available on the HKMA website.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2021\n\n# Licensing\n\nAt the end of 2021, Hong Kong had:\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA granted two banking licences and one restricted bank licence to three non-local banks. The HKMA also granted a money broker approval to a foreign trading platform operator.  The authorizations of three licensed banks and two restricted licence banks were revoked during the year.\n\nMore information about the AIs and local representative offices in Hong Kong can be found in the Annex and Tables D to F on pages 321 to 324, and 330 to 333 respectively.\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nThe HKMA conducted 189 off-site reviews covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL rating assessment1, corporate governance, risk management and financial technology (fintech) strategies.  As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance, 40 meetings were held with the AIs’ boards of directors, independent non-executive directors or board-level committees.  A further 38 tripartite meetings were held among the HKMA, AIs and their external auditors.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA conducted regular on-site examinations supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk.  A total of 679 on-site examinations and thematic reviews were carried out during the year with credit risk management as a key focus. Amid growing adoption of technology by banks, management of operational risk and technology risk was another major area of attention.  The HKMA also increased the number of on-site examinations and thematic reviews targeting liquidity and market risk management.  In addition, specialist teams performed on-site examinations and thematic reviews of AIs’ activities in securities, investment products, insurance and mandatory provident fund (MPF)- related businesses, as well as their anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT) controls. Table 1 contains a summary of the HKMA’s supervisory activities in 2021.\n\n# Credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nTotal loans increased by 3.8% in 2021, compared with a growth of 1.2% in 2020.  Table 2 shows the breakdown of growth in loans and advances.\n\nMainland-related lending increased by 3.6% to HK$4,725 billion in 2021 (Table 3).\n\nThe asset quality of the banking sector remained largely stable during the year and stayed at a healthy level by both historical and international standards.  The classified loan ratio of the industry was 0.88% at the end of 2021, down from 0.90% at the end of 2020, well below the long-run historical average of 1.8% since 2000.  The ratio for Mainland-related lending also decreased to 0.86% from 0.96% a year ago.\n\nDuring the year, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to weigh on some sectors of the economy, while credit events in the Mainland property sector caught the attention of the market.  The HKMA enhanced the breadth and depth of its surveillance, with deep-dive reviews focused on banks’ exposures to highly leveraged borrowers. Close communication with banks has been maintained to facilitate up-to-date assessment of the impact of economic and market developments as well as the adequacy of banks’ risk management measures.  The overall credit risk facing the banking sector is assessed to be manageable.  The latest results of the HKMA’s solvency stress tests confirm that the banking sector continues to maintain sufficient capital buffers to withstand extreme stress.\n\nTargeted and thematic examinations were conducted during the year to evaluate AIs’ systems and controls over loan classification and loan loss provisioning, overseas lending operations, and collateralised lending to private banking and wealth management customers.\n\n# Alleviating cash-flow pressure faced by customers\n\nIn September, the HKMA and the Banking Sector Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) Lending Coordination Mechanism announced a six-month extension of the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme until the end of April 2022.  This scheme was first launched in May 2020 to defer loan principal payments of eligible corporate customers by six months.  In light of a resurgence of local coronavirus infections, in February 2022, the scheme was further extended until the end of October 2022.  In addition, the scheme was enhanced to offer a one-year partial principal repayment option to those customers who are financially capable and willing to resume principal repayment gradually.\n\nBy the end of December 2021, banks had approved loan tenor extensions and other forms of relief in over 83,000 cases, involving an aggregate amount of over HK$920 billion. For personal customers, banks had approved more than 52,000 cases of principal payment holidays for residential mortgages and other personal relief loans, amounting to over HK$53 billion.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nThe successive rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures introduced by the HKMA since 2009 have strengthened banks’ risk management and the banking sector’s resilience to a possible abrupt downturn in the local property market.  The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of new residential mortgage loans (RMLs) approved in December 2021 was 53%, compared with 64% in September 2009 before the countercyclical measures were first introduced.  The average debt servicing ratio (DSR) of new mortgages remained low at 36% in December 2021, compared with 41% in August 2010, when a cap on DSR was first applied (Chart 1).\n\n# Operational and technology risks\n\nIn light of banks’ increasing reliance on technology to support their operations, the HKMA stepped up supervision of operational and technology risks.  Key supervisory focuses during the year included controls over cloud outsourcing and remote working arrangements.  The HKMA launched an industry consultation in December on a draft new Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module on “Operational Resilience”. The new SPM module seeks to provide guidance to banks on developing a holistic and integrated operational resilience framework.\n\nThe HKMA introduced the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 in January to reflect the latest sound practices on cyber security risk management.  During the year, the HKMA monitored AIs’ implementation of the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 and reviewed their cyber resilience capabilities.  In view of the growing risk of destructive cyber-attacks, in May, the HKMA requested all AIs to critically assess the need for a secure tertiary data backup, taking reference from the Secure Tertiary Data Backup Guideline issued by the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB).\n\nIn response to heightened risks and rising numbers of phishing attacks, the HKMA worked closely with the industry to strengthen the security of internet and mobile banking services.  A large-scale joint HKMA-HKAB public awareness campaign, themed “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!” began in July (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 Raising public awareness of phishing attacks\n\nSlogan icon for the public awareness campaign themed “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!”\n\n# Liquidity and market risks\n\nTo enhance monitoring of AIs’ liquidity risk exposures, the HKMA introduced additional scenarios into its liquidity stress testing framework to evaluate AIs’ ability to cope with liquidity shocks over a prolonged period.\n\nDuring the year, thematic reviews were conducted to assess the adequacy of AIs’ liquidity stress testing programmes and evaluate the sufficiency of their monitoring metrics and control limits for managing liquidity risk.  The HKMA also carried out reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of AIs’ market risk management frameworks for debt securities investments and operational controls over treasury activities.\n\nThe HKMA closely monitored AIs’ progress in preparing for the transition away from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR).  It collaborated with industry associations and developed tools to assist AIs in supporting their customers’ migration to alternative reference rates, including a leaflet to raise corporates’ awareness of the transition and an information note on options available in the loan markets to replace US dollar LIBOR.  AIs have substantially remediated contracts referencing LIBOR settings which ceased to be published after the end of 2021.  They were reminded not to enter into new LIBOR contracts from 1 January 2022

銀行穩定性\n\n2021 年，儘管出現了更具傳染性的 COVID-19 變種病毒，導致全球經濟復甦的不確定性增加，但香港銀行業仍然保持穩健和穩定。在該年度，香港金管局繼續專注於監督授權機構的風險管理。鑑於網路威脅不斷增加，以及銀行業數位化進程加速，金管局亦加強了對授權機構營運及網路韌性的監督。\n\n在行為監管方面，金管局向銀行提供指引，以促進使用非面對面管道分銷投資和保險產品，並與其他監管機構合作，制定市場上新產品（如與保險掛鉤的證券和虛擬資產）的監管要求。此外，亦修訂了《銀行業務操守守則》，以強化數位金融服務中的消費者保護。\n\n在反洗錢及反恐怖分子資金籌集（AML\/CFT）方面，金管局的工作重點是進一步強化銀行在生態系統中的把關角色，以及提升其能力，以預防和偵測與疫情期間網路詐騙、騾子帳戶網路和其他金融犯罪增加相關的非法資金流動。為加強保護客戶帳戶免受詐騙和金融犯罪的侵害，金管局透過公私合作夥伴關係，深化了與其他利害關係人的合作和資訊共享。在支持遠端客戶開戶的同時，金管局亦鼓勵採用其他技術（包括網路分析技術），並於 11 月推出了首個反洗錢監管科技實驗室。在國際層面，金管局透過積極參與，在金融行動特別工作組中保持了全球反洗錢及反恐怖分子資金籌集工作的領先地位。\n\n在發展方面，粵港澳大灣區跨境理財通試點計畫於 9 月順利推出。在該年度，金管局繼續執行其為期兩年的促進香港監管科技採用的路線圖。如「永續發展」一章所述，推出多項措施為銀行的氣候風險管理奠定基礎，並更廣泛地推動綠色和永續銀行業務。此外，亦在軟性基礎建設方面作出了進一步努力，包括推廣以客戶為中心的企業文化，以及與銀行業合作推出能力建構措施，以促進人才發展。\n\n同時，金管局與銀行業緊密合作，優化監管政策和程序。在本地實施國際監管標準（包括資本充足率和資訊披露標準）方面取得了良好進展。金管局繼續推進其工作，以確保為授權機構建立一個可信的處置機制，包括制定新的處置標準和實施虧損吸收能力要求的規則，以提高授權機構的可處置性。\n\n# 目標\n\n金管局的總體目標是促進銀行體系的安全和穩定。實現這一目標取決於建立一個高度具韌性的金融體系，該體系能夠提供香港經濟所需的關鍵金融服務。\n\n銀行的經營方式會影響體系的穩定性，而在極端情況下，銀行的無序倒閉亦會影響體系的穩定性。作為監管機構，金融管理局在保障金融穩定方面發揮著關鍵作用，確保銀行具備抵禦衝擊的能力，並在危機中恢復其地位，最終有助於防止倒閉。金融管理局負責對銀行進行審慎監管，並負責在香港授權持照銀行、有限制牌照銀行和接受存款公司（統稱授權機構）的牌照發出事宜。\n\n然而，金融管理局無法確保（亦非香港審慎監管框架旨在確保）零風險的金融體系。相反，作為處置機構，金融管理局致力於確保在授權機構變得不可行的情況下，其倒閉能以有序的方式進行管理。為此，香港已建立了一個金融機構處置機制，其中金融管理局是授權機構（及其他類型的機構）的處置機構。為在香港落實處置機制，有必要制定處置規則和政策標準，進行處置規劃以消除影響授權機構可處置性的障礙，並發展金管局的營運能力以處置倒閉的授權機構。為有效執行這些任務，金管局採用了國際協調一致的方法。\n\n金融管理局亦負責指定和監督某些金融市場基礎設施（FMIs）。在監督 FMIs 時，金管局的目標是促進其整體安全性和效率，限制系統性風險並促進透明度。提高 FMIs 抵禦金融危機的能力，可保護香港貨幣和金融體系免受 FMIs 中斷可能造成的潛在破壞性影響。有關金管局監督方法的資訊可在金管局網站上查閱。\n\n# 2021 年回顧\n\n# 發照\n\n截至 2021 年底，香港有：\n\n在該年度，金管局向三家非本地銀行發出了兩張銀行牌照和一張有限制銀行牌照。金管局亦向一家外國交易平台營運商發出了一項貨幣經紀批准。在該年度，三家持照銀行和兩家有限制牌照銀行的授權被撤銷。\n\n有關香港授權機構和本地代表處的更多資訊，可參閱附件及表 D 至 F（第 321 至 324 頁）和表 330 至 333 頁。\n\n# 監管活動概述\n\n金管局進行了 189 次非現場審查，涵蓋廣泛議題，包括 CAMEL 評級評估、公司治理、風險管理和金融科技策略。作為金管局持續努力促進更強風險治理的一部分，與授權機構的董事會、獨立非執行董事或董事會層級委員會舉行了 40 次會議。此外，金管局、授權機構及其外部審計師亦舉行了 38 次三方會議。\n\n除了非現場活動外，金管局亦進行定期的現場檢查，並輔以對評估為高風險領域的專題審查。在該年度，共進行了 679 次現場檢查和專題審查，其中信用風險管理是主要焦點。隨著銀行越來越多地採用科技，營運風險和科技風險的管理亦成為另一個主要關注領域。金管局亦增加了針對流動性和市場風險管理的現場檢查和專題審查的次數。此外，專業團隊亦對授權機構在證券、投資產品、保險和強積金相關業務方面的活動，以及其反洗錢及反恐怖分子資金籌集（AML\/CFT）控制措施，進行了現場檢查和專題審查。表 1 概述了金管局 2021 年的監管活動。\n\n# 信用風險\n\n# 信用增長和資產品質\n\n與 2020 年的 1.2% 增長相比，2021 年的總貸款增長了 3.8%。表 2 顯示了貸款和墊款增長的細節。\n\n2021 年，與內地相關的貸款增長了 3.6%，達到 4 兆 7,250 億港元（表 3）。\n\n在該年度，銀行業的資產品質大致保持穩定，並按歷史和國際標準維持在健康水平。截至 2021 年底，行業的分類貸款比率為 0.88%，低於 2020 年底的 0.90%，遠低於自 2000 年以來 1.8% 的長期歷史平均水平。與內地相關的貸款比率亦由去年的 0.96% 下降至 0.86%。\n\n在該年度，COVID-19 疫情繼續對某些經濟領域造成壓力，而內地房地產領域的信用事件亦引起了市場的關注。金管局加強了監管的廣度和深度，進行深入審查，重點關注銀行對高槓桿借款人的風險敞口。與銀行保持密切溝通，以促進對經濟和市場發展影響的最新評估，以及銀行風險管理措施的充分性。銀行業面臨的整體信用風險被評估為可控。金管局最新的償付能力壓力測試結果確認，銀行業繼續維持足夠的資本緩衝，以抵禦極端壓力。\n\n在該年度，進行了專項和專題檢查，以評估授權機構在貸款分類和貸款虧損準備、海外貸款業務及向私人銀行和財富管理客戶提供抵押貸款方面的系統和控制措施。\n\n# 紓緩客戶面臨的資金週轉壓力\n\n九月，金管局和銀行業中小企貸款協調機制宣布，將預先批核還本「還息假期」計畫延長六個月，直至 2022 年 4 月底。該計畫於 2020 年 5 月首次推出，旨在將合資格企業客戶的貸款本金償還延期六個月。鑑於本地冠狀病毒感染個案再度上升，該計畫於 2022 年 2 月進一步延長至 2022 年 10 月底。此外，該計畫亦得到強化，為有財務能力及有意逐步恢復償還本金的客戶提供一年的部分還本選擇。\n\n截至 2021 年 12 月底，銀行已核准超過 83,000 宗貸款還款期延長及其他形式的紓緩措施，涉及總金額超過 9,200 億港元。對於個人客戶，銀行已核准超過 52,000 宗住宅按揭及個人紓緩貸款的本金還款假期，涉及金額超過 530 億港元。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n自 2009 年以來，金管局先後推出多輪逆週期宏觀審慎措施，強化了銀行的風險管理，並提升了銀行業抵禦本地物業市場可能出現的急劇下跌的能力。2021 年 12 月新批出住宅按揭貸款的平均貸款與估值比率（LTV）為 53%，而 2009 年 9 月（即首次推出逆週期措施前）則為 64%。2021 年 12 月新按揭的平均還款比率（DSR）維持在 36% 的低水平，而 2010 年 8 月（即首次實施 DSR

{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nDuring 2021, the HKMA achieved good progress in strengthening Hong Kong’s status as a globally competitive international financial centre through a multi-pronged approach.\n\nThe HKMA unveiled “Fintech 2025” strategy to promote the wide adoption of fintech by the financial sector and bolster Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub more broadly.  On the Faster Payment System, it has seen a surge in turnover during the year amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOn enhancing connectivity, significant progress was made during the year with the addition of the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect and Southbound Trading under Bond Connect to the suite of Connect schemes.  Thanks to its world-class market infrastructure and the Connect schemes, Hong Kong is the favoured platform for Mainland funds to tap into global markets and for international investors to access the fast-growing Mainland markets.\n\nAlso during 2021, the HKMA devoted significant efforts in creating new business opportunities to strengthen the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, in areas including bond issuance, asset and wealth management, corporate treasury centres, and green and sustainable finance.  To promote Hong Kong’s financial services, the HKMA stepped up market outreach to overseas and Mainland stakeholders to keep them informed about the resilience of Hong Kong’s financial system and the prospects it presents.\n\nMeanwhile, the HKMA is active in international and regional central banking and regulatory forums, contributing to global efforts in maintaining financial stability and promoting financial market developments.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nThe HKMA announced its “Fintech 2025” strategy, covering a series of initiatives to promote wide adoption of financial technology (fintech) and strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia.  The HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO), together with the banking departments, played a pivotal role in driving various key initiatives during the year including the following:\n\n- Promoting regulatory technology (Regtech) adoption\n- Rolling out the Tech Baseline Assessment to understand banks' adoption of fintech\n\nHong Kong’s position as an offshore renminbi hub remained firm, with offshore renminbi businesses registering robust growth during the year.  Inflows into renminbi assets continued to gather pace as the inclusion of onshore securities in major financial market indices continued. Hong Kong plays an indispensable role in facilitating international investors’ increased allocation to renminbi assets, with the Mainland–Hong Kong Connect schemes being widely accepted as the channels of choice for international investors to access onshore capital markets. In 2021, daily turnover under Northbound Bond Connect increased 34% to around RMB25.8 billion.\n\nFollowing the success of Northbound Bond Connect, Southbound Bond Connect was launched in September, completing the two-way connection between the Mainland and international bond markets.  In the same month, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), the HKMA and the Monetary Authority of Macao promulgated the implementation details for the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Crossboundary WMC) Scheme in the Guangdong–Hong Kong– Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA).  In October, eligible banks in Hong Kong started providing Cross-boundary WMC services together with their Mainland partner banks.\n\n\n\nTo enhance Hong Kong’s role as a key offshore renminbi centre, a working group comprising the HKMA, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) was formed to conduct a feasibility study on promoting trading of renminbi-denominated equity securities in Hong Kong.  A joint seminar was also co-organised by the PBoC and the HKMA in December, showcasing Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre and a leading renminbi business hub.\n\nThe HKMA continues to make progress towards strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform.  In particular, to increase Hong Kong’s appeal as a preferred fund domicile, the HKMA worked closely with the Government and the financial industry to provide a more facilitating tax and regulatory environment for fund formation.  Significant strides were also made in further elevating Hong Kong’s position as a regional green and sustainable finance hub, and as a bond issuance centre. At the same time, the HKMA stepped up market outreach to promote Hong Kong’s financial services to overseas and Mainland stakeholders.\n\nSafe and efficient operation of financial infrastructure is fundamental for reinforcing Hong Kong’s position as a leading international financial centre.  In 2021, the four interbank Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) and the Hong Kong Trade Repository achieved 100%1 system availability, outperforming the target of 99.95%.  Following the launch of Southbound Bond Connect in September, the CMU became the settlement and custodian service provider for transactions conducted under both Northbound and Southbound Bond Connect.\n\nAdoption of the FPS continued to expand in 2021. The number of registrations grew to 9.6 million at the end of 2021 and the average daily turnover for the year rose by 90% from 2020.  Increased use of the FPS for settling Government bills, making merchant payments and topping up stored value facility (SVF) e-wallets or bank accounts were the key drivers for the continued rise in transaction volume, on top of a steady growth in person-to-person and business payments.\n\nTo promote the safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA oversees six designated retail payment systems (RPSs) and supervises 15 licensed SVFs under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO).  During the year, the HKMA facilitated the smooth implementation of the Government’s Consumption Voucher Scheme by co-ordinating and promoting dialogues and co-operation between the relevant Government parties and the SVF licensees appointed for the scheme.\n\nIn January 2022, the HKMA issued a discussion paper on crypto-assets and stablecoins, setting out the HKMA’s thinking on the relevant regulatory approach and inviting views from stakeholders.  Relevant factors, including feedback to this discussion paper and recommendations of relevant international bodies, will be taken into account when drawing up the appropriate regulatory regime.\n\nInternationally, the HKMA is an active member of the central banking community and plays a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees.  For example, the HKMA chairs the Working Group on Financial Markets (WGFM) established under the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP)2.  The HKMA also co-chairs the Policy and Standards Group of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), the Non-Bank Monitoring Experts Group and the Financial Innovation Network of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), and leads a team that looks into supervisory issues associated with financial benchmark transition.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2021\n\n# Hong Kong as a fintech hub in Asia\n\n# Fintech 2025\n\nIn June, the HKMA unveiled its “Fintech 2025” strategy to drive fintech development in Hong Kong.  The strategy aims to encourage the financial sector to adopt technology comprehensively by 2025, as well as to promote the provision of fair and efficient financial services for the benefit of Hong Kong citizens and the economy.  The five focus areas of the strategy are:\n\n- All banks go fintech\n- Future-proofing Hong Kong for CBDCs\n- Creating the next-generation data infrastructure\n- Expanding the fintech-savvy workforce\n- Nurturing the ecosystem with funding and policies\n\nThe HKMA’s “Fintech 2025” strategy drives fintech development in Hong Kong\n\n# Fintech Adoption in the Banking Sector\n\nTo support the “All banks go fintech” initiative of the “Fintech 2025” strategy, the HKMA rolled out the Tech Baseline Assessment in June 2021.  The assessment aims to help the HKMA develop a better understanding of the current fintech landscape in the banking sector, and identify which fintech areas may warrant the HKMA’s support.  All licensed banks with significant operations in Hong Kong were requested to develop a three-year plan for fintech adoption by the end of 2021.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA also continued to implement its two-year roadmap to promote Regtech adoption by banks in Hong Kong, and incorporate technology in its own supervisory processes to improve efficiency and effectiveness.  See page 98 of the Banking Stability chapter for more details.\n\n# Wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency\n\nThe HKMA and the Bank of Thailand expanded the scope of their joint research project with the joining of the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates and the Digital Currency Institute of the PBoC in February 2021.  Renamed as “Multiple Central Bank Digital Currency Bridge (mBridge)” and strongly supported by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Innovation Hub Centre in Hong Kong, the project further explores the capabilities of distributed ledger technology to facilitate real-time cross-border foreign exchange payment-versus-payment (PvP) transactions in a multi-jurisdictional context and on a 24\/7 basis.  A joint report was published in September to deliver the interim findings, followed by the publication of potential use cases and a future roadmap in November.\n\n# Retail Central Bank Digital Currency\n\nTo future-proof Hong Kong in terms of CBDC readiness, the HKMA started a study on the prospect of issuing retail CBDC in Hong Kong, i.e. e-HKD, covering both technical and policy considerations.  In collaboration with the BIS Innovation Hub Centre in Hong Kong, the HKMA embarked on a study called Project Aurum to explore the technical aspect of issuing retail CBDC.  Separately, an internal cross-departmental working group was set up to study the relevant technical, policy and legal issues.  In October, the HKMA released a technical white paper titled e-HKD: A technical perspective to explore and invite comments on potential technical design options for issuing and distributing retail CBDC.\n\nFurthermore, the HKMA supports the Digital Currency Institute of the PBoC on the technical pilot testing of using e-CNY for cross-boundary payments.  This will help promote interconnection in the GBA and bring greater convenience to Hong Kong and Mainland tourists by enhancing the efficiency and user experience of cross-boundary payments.\n\n# Commercial Data Interchange\n\nIn July, the HKMA hosted a virtual symposium to encourage banks and SVF operators to join the CDI, a next-generation financial data infrastructure that aims to enable more efficient financial intermediation in the banking system.  To further facilitate development and adoption, the launch of the CDI Innovation Hub was announced during the symposium. To facilitate small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) financing, the HKMA completed two phases of proof-of-concept study examining the technical feasibility of the CDI.  Applying alternative data to facilitate credit assessment and the underwriting of loans, more than 550 SME loans exceeding HK$900 million in total were approved by the participating banks during the study.  Based on the encouraging results, the HKMA announced the pilot launch of the CDI in November.\n\nSME owners commend the CDI for streamlining their loan applications\n\n# Talent development\n\nTo expand the fintech talent pool, the HKMA continued to run the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme 2.0 in collaboration with its strategic partners3 to nurture young talent at various stages of their career development. More than 180 students benefitted from the scheme in 2021. Separately, the Industry Project Masters Network scheme was piloted in September to provide opportunities for master’s degree students majoring in fintech to work on real-life fintech projects.  To form strategic partnerships and foster collaboration in areas including fintech talent development, the HKMA entered into memorandums of understanding (MoUs) with four local universities in October.\n\nMr Colin Pou (middle), Executive Director (Financial Infrastructure) of HKMA, at the MoU signing ceremony with four local universities\n\n# Fintech Supervisory Sandbox\n\nThe use of Fintech Supervisory Sandbox (FSS) continued to rise during the year.  As of end-December 2021, a total of 234 pilot trials of fintech initiatives had been allowed in the FSS since its launch in 2016, compared with 193 as of end-2020.  As of end-December 2021, the HKMA had also received in total 666 requests to access the FSS Chatroom for supervisory feedback at the early stage of fintech projects since the introduction of the Chatroom in 2017.  Over 63% of the Chatroom requests were made by technology firms (tech firms)

國際金融中心\n\n2021年期間，金管局透過多管齊下的方式，在鞏固香港作為具全球競爭力的國際金融中心地位方面，取得了良好進展。\n\n金管局公布了「金融科技2025」策略，旨在推動金融業界廣泛採用金融科技，並進一步鞏固香港作為金融科技中心的地位。在快速支付系統方面，該系統在COVID-19疫情期間的年內交易額錄得顯著增長。\n\n在提升互聯互通方面，本年度取得了重大進展，跨境理財通及債券通下的南向交易加入了現有的互聯互通機制中。憑藉其世界級的市場基礎設施及互聯互通機制，香港已成為內地資金進入全球市場，以及國際投資者進入快速增長的內地市場的首選平台。\n\n2021年期間，金管局亦在締造新業務機遇方面投入大量努力，以強化香港金融平台的競爭力，相關範疇包括債券發行、資產及財富管理、企業財資中心，以及綠色和可持續金融。為推廣香港的金融服務，金管局加強了與海外及內地持份者的市場聯繫，讓他們了解香港金融體系的韌性及其所帶來的機遇。\n\n另一方面，香港金融管理局積極參與國際及區域性的央行及監管論壇，為全球維持金融穩定及促進金融市場發展的努力作出貢獻。\n\n# 總覽\n\n金管局宣布了「金融科技2025」策略，該策略涵蓋了一系列措施，旨在推動金融科技的廣泛應用，並強化香港作為亞洲金融科技中心的地位。金管局金融科技促進辦公室（FFO）與銀行部門在過去一年中攜手合作，在推動多項關鍵措施方面發揮了重要作用，其中包括以下幾點：\n\n- 推動監管科技（Regtech）的應用\n- 推出技術基準評估，以了解銀行對金融科技的採用情況\n\n香港作為離岸人民幣中心的地位依然穩固，其離岸人民幣業務在過去一年中錄得強勁增長。隨著境內證券持續被納入主要金融市場指數，人民幣資產的資金流入繼續加速。香港在促進國際投資者增加人民幣資產配置方面發揮著不可或缺的作用，而內地與香港互聯互通機制已成為國際投資者進入內地資本市場的首選渠道，廣為接受。2021年，北向債券通的日均交易量增長34%，增至約人民幣258億元。\n\n在北向債券通成功推出後，南向債券通於九月推出，從而完善了內地與國際債券市場之間的雙向連結。同月，中國人民銀行、香港金管局及澳門金融管理局公佈了《粵港澳大灣區跨境理財通》的實施細則。十月，香港符合資格的銀行開始與內地合作銀行共同提供跨境理財通服務。\n\n讓我們從第一階段開始：草稿前研究。在這個階段，我們需要進行徹底的研究，以識別和解決源文本中可能在翻譯過程中造成困難的元素。如果源文本包含錯誤或不完整的片段（例如與自動語音識別相關的問題），請提供您對預期意義的最佳解釋。此外，請標註任何無法直接翻譯成繁體中文的表達方式或短語，並解釋原因。在這個階段，我們不提供完整的翻譯，只專注於分析和研究。\n\n為提升香港作為主要離岸人民幣中心的地位，香港金融管理局（金管局）、證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）及香港交易及結算所有限公司（港交所）組成了一個工作小組，就推動人民幣計價股權證券在香港的交易進行可行性研究。此外，中國人民銀行與金管局於12月合辦了一場聯合研討會，展示香港作為國際金融中心及領先人民幣業務樞紐的地位。\n\n金管局在強化香港金融平台的競爭力方面持續取得進展。特別地，為了提升香港作為首選基金註冊地的吸引力，金管局與政府及金融業界緊密合作，為基金成立提供更便利的稅務及監管環境。此外，香港在進一步鞏固其作為區域綠色及可持續金融中心，以及債券發行中心的地位方面，也取得了重大進展。同時，金管局加強了市場推廣工作，向海外及內地持份者推廣香港的金融服務。\n\n金融基礎設施的安全和高效運作，對於鞏固香港作為領先國際金融中心的地位至關重要。2021年，四家銀行間即時總額結算（RTGS）系統、中央貨幣市場單位（CMU）及香港交易資料庫的系統可用性均達100%1，超出99.95%的目標。「南向債券通」於九月推出後，中央貨幣市場單位成為「北向通」及「南向債券通」下交易的結算及託管服務提供者。\n\n快速支付系統（FPS）的採用在2021年持續擴大。截至2021年底，註冊數量增至960萬，而該年的日均交易額較2020年上升了九成。除了個人間及企業間支付穩步增長外，使用快速支付系統結算政府帳單、商戶付款及為儲值設施電子錢包或銀行帳戶增值的情況增加，是交易量持續上升的主要推動力。\n\n為提升本地零售支付行業的安全性和效率，金管局根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（PSSVFO）負責監察六個指定的零售支付系統（RPSs），並監管15個持牌儲值支付工具（SVFs）。在過去一年，金管局透過協調及促進相關政府部門與獲委任參與消費券計畫的儲值支付工具持牌人之間的對話與合作，確保了政府消費券計畫的順利實施。\n\n2022年1月，香港金管局發表了一份關於加密資產及穩定幣的討論文件，闡述了金管局對相關監管方法的看法，並邀請持份者提供意見。在制訂合適的監管制度時，將考慮相關因素，包括對該討論文件的回饋意見，以及相關國際機構的建議。\n\n在國際上，金管局是中央銀行界的活躍成員，並在多個區域及國際委員會中擔當領導角色。例如，金管局擔任東亞及太平洋中央銀行總裁會議2 下設立的金融市場工作小組主席。此外，金管局亦擔任巴塞爾銀行監理委員會的政策及標準小組、非銀行監管專家小組，以及金融穩定委員會的金融創新網絡之聯席主席，並帶領一個團隊研究與金融基準轉移相關的監管議題。\n\n# 2021 年回顧\n\n# 香港：亞洲金融科技樞紐\n\n# 金融科技 2025\n\n金管局於六月公布了「金融科技2025」策略，以推動香港金融科技的發展。該策略旨在鼓勵金融業界在2025年前全面應用科技，並促進提供公平及高效的金融服務，以惠及香港市民和經濟。策略的五大重點範疇如下：\n\n- 所有銀行均投身金融科技\n- 為香港未來的中央銀行數位貨幣（CBDC）做好準備\n- 建立新一代數據基礎設施\n- 擴大精通金融科技的人才隊伍\n- 透過資金及政策培育生態系統\n\n香港金管局的「金融科技 2025」策略，推動了香港金融科技的發展。\n\n# 銀行業對金融科技的採用\n\n為支持「金融科技2025」策略中「所有銀行邁向金融科技化」的倡議，金管局於2021年6月推出科技基準評估。該評估旨在協助金管局更深入了解銀行業當前的金融科技發展情況，並識別哪些金融科技領域可能需要金管局的支持。所有在香港有重大業務運作的持牌銀行，均被要求在2021年底前制訂金融科技採用三年計劃。\n\n在今年，金管局亦繼續推行其為期兩年的路線圖，以推動香港銀行採用監管科技，並將科技應用於自身的監管流程，以提升效率和效能。更多詳情請參見銀行穩定性章節第98頁。\n\n# 中央銀行批發型數位貨幣\n\n香港金融管理局及泰國央行於2021年2月與阿拉伯聯合大公國中央銀行及中國人民銀行數位貨幣研究所合作，擴大了聯合研究項目的範圍。該項目更名為「多邊央行數位貨幣橋（mBridge）」，並獲得國際清算銀行（BIS）香港創新中心的大力支持，旨在進一步探索分布式帳本技術的能力，以促進多司法管轄區環境下全天候的即時跨境外匯支付對支付（PvP）交易。中期研究結果於9月發表於聯合報告中，隨後於11月公布了潛在應用案例及未來發展藍圖。\n\n# 中央銀行零售數位貨幣\n\n為了在中央銀行數位貨幣（CBDC）的準備方面為香港做好未來的防護，金管局展開了一項研究，探討在香港發行零售 CBDC（即電子港元）的前景，涵蓋技術及政策考量。金管局與香港國際清算銀行創新中心合作，開展了一項名為「Project Aurum」的研究，以探討發行零售 CBDC 的技術層面。此外，還成立了一個內部跨部門工作小組，以研究相關的技術、政策及法律議題。十月，金管局發布了一項技術白皮書，題為《電子港元：技術視角》，以探討發行及分銷零售 CBDC 的潛在技術設計選項，並徵求意見。\n\n此外，金管局支持中國人民銀行數字貨幣研究所進行技術試點測試，以使用數字人民幣進行跨境支付。這將有助於促進大灣區的互聯互通，並透過提升跨境支付的效率及用戶體驗，為香港及內地旅客帶來更大便利。\n\n# 商業數據交換\n\n七月，香港金管局舉辦了一場虛擬研討會，以鼓勵銀行及儲值支付設施營運商加入新一代金融數據基礎設施（CDI）。該設施旨在提升銀行體系的金融中介服務效率。為進一步推動其發展及應用，金管局在研討會上宣布成立CDI創新中心。為了促進中小企業融資，金管局完成了兩階段的概念驗證研究，以檢視CDI的技術可行性。在研究期間，參與銀行運用替代數據以促進信貸評估及貸款承保，共批出超過550宗中小企業貸款，總金額逾9億港元。基於這些令人鼓舞的結果，金管局於十一月宣布試行推出CDI。\n\n中小企業主讚揚CDI簡化貸款申請流程。\n\n# 人才發展\n\n為了擴大金融科技人才庫，金管局與策略合作夥伴3

{"en":"# Reserves Management\n\nThe global financial markets embarked on a recovery path in 2021.  Although the global economy continued to be affected by the evolving COVID-19 pandemic situation, a number of factors, including an increasing vaccination rate as well as accommodative monetary policies and fiscal measures around the world, have contributed to notable recovery in the global economy and financial markets.  Against this background, a number of overseas equity markets achieved record highs during the year, and the Exchange Fund’s overall equity holdings were able to achieve a decent return despite the sluggish performance in Hong Kong equities. During 2021, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$191.9 billion, representing an investment return of 4.1%.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong.  The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre.  The HKMA, under the delegated authority of the Financial Secretary and within the terms of the delegation, is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(i) to preserve capital;\n(ii) to ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(iii) to ensure that sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(iv) subject to (i)–(iii), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Exchange Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 Portfolio Segregation of the Exchange Fund\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP).  The BP holds highly liquid US dollardenominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The IP invests primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member economies of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of its assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA diversifies part of the Exchange Fund’s investments in a prudent and incremental manner into a wider variety of asset classes.  This includes emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate.  Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP).  The HKMA has put in place a cap1 to guide the pace of diversification into the LTGP since its inception.  As the LTGP has become increasingly mature in investment scale and asset diversity, the EFAC decided in January 2022 to replace the cap by a target asset allocation that is determined concurrently with that of other asset classes, subject to prudent risk management principles.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007, holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that have been acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes.  The Strategic Portfolio is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of its unique nature.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by Fiscal Reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP2, with the major exception of the Future Fund3, which links its interest rate to the return of both the IP and the LTGP in accordance with the portfolio mix.  The portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 40:60 in 2021.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation.  The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents long-term asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund.  Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark.  This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark (or strategic) allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”.  While the benchmark and tracking error4 limit are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with the EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority.  Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may assume positions to take advantage of short-term market movements (Figure 2).\n\nFigure 2 Asset allocation of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nThe HKMA’s Exchange Fund Investment Office houses its investment and related risk management functions. Exchange Fund Investment Office staff members directly manage about 71% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, comprising the entire BP and part of the IP.  This part of the IP includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 29% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes.  The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to realise sustainable returns, draw on diverse and complementary investment styles, and gain market insights and technical expertise in investment.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes.  The expenditure is determined primarily by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe growing complexity of the investment environment underlines the importance of risk management.  The HKMA sets stringent controls and investment guidelines for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and ensures a proper risk monitoring and compliance system is in place. Three lines of defence are in place to implement effective risk management and governance of investment-related activities.  Key risk categories (including credit, market, liquidity and operational risks) are regularly monitored, and the risk management process provides a robust framework to support strategic planning and investment diversification.\n\n# RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT\n\nThe HKMA believes that, by putting an appropriate emphasis on responsible investment and sustainable long-term economic performance, it can better achieve the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund and reduce risks associated with environmental, social and governance (ESG)- related matters of its underlying investments.  The HKMA supports responsible investment by integrating ESG factors into the investment processes for both public and private market investments of the Exchange Fund, underpinned by the guiding principle that priority will generally be given to ESG investments if the long-term risk-adjusted return is comparable with other investments.  For more details about the HKMA’s responsible investment framework and implementation, see the Sustainability chapter on pages 184 to 191.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2021\n\nGlobal equity markets rose sharply and hit new record highs on the back of ultra-loose monetary policies and fiscal measures, driving an accelerated recovery of the global economy and financial markets.  However, Hong Kong and Mainland equity markets underperformed amid market reforms.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index in the US rose by 27%, while the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong dropped by 14%.\n\nFor the bond markets, rising inflation expectations and tapering of asset purchases by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) led to a rise in US Treasury yields and falling bond prices during 2021.  Ten-year US Treasury yields increased by about 60 basis points from 0.9% at the beginning of the year to 1.5% at the end of the year.\n\nIn the currency markets, the US dollar strengthened against other major currencies, particularly towards the end of 2021, on the back of expectations about the Fed’s tapering pace. In particular, the euro and the yen depreciated by 7.1% and 10.3% against the US dollar respectively.\n\nThe performance of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2021 is shown in Table 1.\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$191.9 billion in 2021.  This comprised gains on bonds of HK$12.6 billion, net gains on equities of HK$47.8 billion (with gains of HK$68.8 billion from foreign equities, and losses of HK$21.0 billion from Hong Kong equities), a positive currency translation effect of HK$16.8 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets and gains of HK$114.7 billion on other investments held by the investment-holding subsidiaries of the Fund. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$3.1 billion.\n\nTotal assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,570.2 billion at the end of the year.  The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$515.3 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$392.5 billion and real estate HK$122.8 billion.  Outstanding investment commitments of the LTGP amounted to HK$225.7 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund in 2021, excluding the Strategic Portfolio, was 4.1%.  Specifically, the IP achieved a rate of return of 3.7%, while the BP gained 0.4%.  The LTGP has recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 15.4% since its inception in 2009.\n\nThe annual returns of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2021 are set out in Chart 1.  Table 2 shows the 2021 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over several different time horizons.  The average return was 5.3% during 2019–2021, 4.7% during 2017–2021, 3.3% during 2012–2021 and 4.8% since 1994.  Table 3 shows the currency mix of the Fund’s assets on 31 December 2021.\n\nSee pages 211 to 319 for the audited 2021 financial statements of the Exchange

儲備管理\n\n2021 年，全球金融市場開始復甦。儘管全球經濟持續受到 COVID-19 疫情變化的影響，但多項因素，包括疫苗接種率上升，以及全球各地採取的寬鬆貨幣政策和財政措施，均促使全球經濟和金融市場顯著復甦。在此背景下，多個海外股市在當年創下歷史新高，而外匯基金的整體股票投資亦錄得不俗回報，儘管香港股票表現疲弱。2021 年，外匯基金錄得投資收入 1,919 億港元，投資回報率為 4.1%。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n《外匯基金條例》訂明，外匯基金的主要目標是直接或間接影響香港貨幣的匯率。基金亦可用於維持香港貨幣及金融制度的穩定和完整，以協助維持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。金管局在財政司司長授權下，根據授權的條款，就外匯基金的運用和投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標及投資組合結構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會為外匯基金訂立了以下投資目標：\n\n（一）保障本金；\n（二）確保貨幣基礎在任何時候均獲高度流通的美元資產全面支持；\n（三）確保有足夠流動資金以維持貨幣及金融穩定；及\n（四）在符合（一）至（三）項的前提下，爭取投資回報，以助維持外匯基金的長期購買力。\n\n這些目標充分考慮了外匯基金的法定目的，並已納入基金的投資組合結構和目標資產配置中（圖 1）。\n\n圖 1 外匯基金的投資組合劃分\n\n概括而言，外匯基金有兩大投資組合：支持投資組合（BP）及投資組合（IP）。BP 持有高度流通的美元資產，以根據聯繫匯率制度的要求，為貨幣基礎提供全面支持。IP 主要投資於經濟合作暨發展組織成員國的債券及股票市場，以保障其資產的價值和長期購買力。\n\n為更好地管理風險及提升中長期回報，金管局以審慎和循序漸進的方式，將外匯基金部分投資分散至更多元化的資產類別，包括新興市場及內地債券和股票、私募股權（包括基建）及房地產。新興市場及內地債券和股票歸入 IP 持有，而私募股權及房地產投資則歸入長期增長組合（LTGP）。自 LTGP 成立以來，金管局已訂立上限，以指導其分散投資的步伐。隨著 LTGP 在投資規模和資產多元化方面日趨成熟，外匯基金諮詢委員會於 2022 年 1 月決定，以目標資產配置取代上限，該目標資產配置是與其他資產類別的目標資產配置同時制定的，並受審慎的風險管理原則約束。\n\n策略投資組合成立於 2007 年，持有政府為外匯基金的策略目的而購入的香港交易所股份有限公司的股份。由於策略投資組合的性質獨特，故不包括在基金的投資表現評估中。\n\n# 外匯基金的存款\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定機構的存款。利率一般與 IP 的表現掛鉤，但未來基金則屬個別例子，其利率按投資組合的比例，與 IP 及 LTGP 的回報掛鉤。2021 年，未來基金在 IP 及 LTGP 之間的投資組合比例約為 40:60。\n\n# 投資流程\n\n外匯基金的投資流程以兩類資產配置的決定為基礎：策略性資產配置及戰術性資產配置。策略性資產配置反映在投資基準中，代表了根據外匯基金的投資目標而作出的長期資產配置。在策略性配置的指引下，資產會以戰術性方式配置，以爭取超越基準的回報。這意味著實際配置往往與基準（或策略性）配置有所不同。實際配置與基準配置之間的差異稱為「戰術性偏差」。基準及循跡誤差限額由財政司司長與外匯基金諮詢委員會磋商後釐定，而戰術性決定及戰術性偏差的容許範圍則由金管局在授權下制定及設定。在戰術性偏差的容許範圍內，投資組合經理可採取倉位，以把握短期市場走勢（圖 2）。\n\n圖 2 外匯基金的資產配置\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局外匯基金投資辦公室負責投資及相關的風險管理職能。外匯基金投資辦公室的工作人員直接管理約 71% 的外匯基金投資，包括整個 BP 及部分 IP。這部分 IP 包括一組投資於全球固定收益市場的投資組合，以及多項採用宏觀風險管理策略的衍生工具疊加投資組合，為基金提供保障。\n\n# 聘用外部經理\n\n除了內部管理資產外，金管局亦聘用外部基金經理管理約 29% 的外匯基金資產，包括所有上市股票投資組合及其他特殊資產類別。聘用外部經理的目的，是利用市場上最佳的投資專才以實現可持續回報，汲取多元化及互補的投資方式，並獲取市場見解及投資方面的技術專長。\n\n與聘用外部經理相關的開支包括基金管理費、托管費、交易成本、預扣稅及其他稅項。該開支主要由市場因素決定，並可能每年有所波動。\n\n# 風險管理及合規\n\n投資環境日益複雜，突顯了風險管理的重要性。金管局為內部及外部管理的投資組合制定嚴格的控制措施及投資指引，並確保建立適當的風險監察及合規制度。已設立三道防線，以落實有效的風險管理及管治投資相關活動。主要風險類別（包括信貸、市場、流動性及操作風險）受到定期監察，而風險管理流程則為策略規劃及投資多元化提供穩健的框架。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n金管局相信，適當地重視負責任投資及可持續的長期經濟表現，有助更好地實現外匯基金的投資目標，並減低與基礎投資的環境、社會及管治（ESG）相關事項有關的風險。金管局支持負責任投資，將 ESG 因素納入外匯基金的公共和私人市場投資流程，其指導原則是，若 ESG 投資的長期風險調整後回報與其它投資相若，一般而言會優先考慮 ESG 投資。有關金管局負責任投資框架及實施情況的更多詳情，請參閱第 184 至 191 頁的「可持續發展」一章。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2021 年的金融市場\n\n在全球極度寬鬆的貨幣政策及財政措施支持下，全球股市急升並創下新高，推動全球經濟及金融市場加速復甦。然而，香港及內地股市在市場改革下表現遜色。美國標準普爾 500 指數上升 27%，而香港恒生指數則下跌 14%。\n\n在債券市場方面，2021 年通脹預期上升，加上美國聯邦儲備局（聯儲局）縮減資產購買規模，導致美國國庫券孳息率上升，債券價格下跌。十年期美國國庫券孳息率由年初的 0.9% 上升至年底的約 1.5%，升幅約為 60 個基點。\n\n在貨幣市場方面，受市場對聯儲局縮減購債步伐的預期所帶動，美元於 2021 年年底尤其顯著地對其他主要貨幣轉強。其中，歐元及日圓分別貶值 7.1% 及 10.3% 兌美元。\n\n2021 年主要貨幣、債券及股市的表現載於表 1。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n2021 年，外匯基金錄得投資收入 1,919 億港元。當中包括債券收益 126 億港元、股票淨收益 478 億港元（當中外國股票收益 688 億港元，香港股票虧損 210 億港元）、非港元資產的貨幣兌換產生正收益 168 億港元，以及基金投資控股附屬公司所持其他投資的收益 1,147 億港元。此外，策略投資組合錄得估值收益 31 億港元。\n\n外匯基金的資產總額於年底達 45,702 億港元。LTGP 下的投資市場價值總額為 5,153 億港元，當中私募股權為 3,925 億港元，房地產為 1,228 億港元。LTGP 未動用的投資承擔額為 2,257 億港元。\n\n2021 年，外匯基金的投資回報（不包括策略投資組合）為 4.1%。具體而言，IP 的回報率為 3.7%，而 BP 的收益則為 0.4%。自 2009 年成立以來，LTGP 的年化內部回報率為 15.4%。\n\n外匯基金由 1994 年至 2021 年的年度回報載於圖 1。表 2 顯示基金在 2021 年的投資回報，以及在不同時間範圍內的平均投資回報。2019 年至 2021 年的平均回報為 5.3%，2017 年至 2021 年的平均回報為 4.7%，2012 年至 2021 年的平均回報為 3.3%，而自 1994 年以來的平均回報則為 4.8%。表 3 顯示基金於 2021 年 12 月 31 日的資產貨幣組合。\n\n外匯基金 2021 年的經審計財務報表，請參閱第 211 至 319 頁。"}

A total of 632 bilingual press releases were issued over the course of the year and a large number of media enquiries were handled on a daily basis.\n\nTo raise awareness of the HKMA’s key functions, press conferences and media briefings were organised for local, Mainland and foreign media.  Topics included the Connect schemes, financial technology (fintech) and the reform of interest rate benchmarks.\n\nTo engage and interact with the public in a timely manner, the HKMA maintains five social media channels (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter and YouTube) with over 80,000 followers.  The HKMA utilises its social media channels to raise public awareness on a wide range of topics notably phishing scams, which increased significantly during the pandemic.  In addition, extensive promotion campaigns on green finance, fintech and the Connect schemes were conducted via social media to keep the public abreast of the latest development trends.\n\nMr Eddie Yue, Chief Executive of HKMA, moderates a virtual panel discussion at the Hong Kong FinTech Week 2021\n\nMr Howard Lee, Deputy Chief Executive of HKMA, hosts a media briefing on the HKMA’s “Fintech 2025” strategy\n\nMr Arthur Yuen, Deputy Chief Executive of HKMA, hosts a media briefing on the Hong Kong banking sector’s preparation for London Interbank Offered Rate transition\n\nMr Edmond Lau, Deputy Chief Executive of HKMA, conducts an interview with an international news channel\n\n# Public enquiries\n\nThe Public Enquiry Service provides an effective means for the public to better understand key HKMA functions and operations.  During 2021, it handled 9,781 enquiries. About half of them were related to banking policies and regulations, consumer banking issues, notes and coins, as well as financial infrastructure and debt market development. Some of the notable enquiries were about the Coin Collection Programme, banking products and services, banking-related guidelines and circulars and the Retail Bond Issuance Programme.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received since 2018 and Chart 2 provides a breakdown by enquiry nature in 2021.\n\nChart 1 Total number of public enquiries\n\nChart 2 Nature of enquiries received in 2021\n\n# Publications\n\nApart from the HKMA Annual Report, the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report, and four issues of the Quarterly Bulletin, and it regularly updated the Monthly Statistical Bulletin to provide up-to-date and thematic information and analyses on monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. The HKMA also published 11 inSight1 articles to introduce its major new initiatives and policies and discuss topical issues of interest.\n\nThe HKMA Annual Report 2020 received a Silver Award in the “Non-profit Making and Charitable Organisations” category, and an Excellence Award in Environmental, Social and Governance Reporting at the Hong Kong Management Association’s 2021 Best Annual Reports Awards.\n\n# Corporate website\n\nThe corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk) presents more than 44,000 pages of content in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, and is the public gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It contains the register of authorized institutions (AIs) and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the register of stored value facility licensees under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance.\n\nThe HKMA has been releasing financial data and important information on its website via Open Application Programming Interface (API) in phases since 2018. By end-2021, the HKMA had opened up 148 sets of Open APIs on its website, in line with the targeted schedule.\n\n# Information Centre\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre, located on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre, is an important facility introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters.  It consists of an exhibition area and a library. The exhibition area presents an overview of the HKMA’s work and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong in an interactive manner.  It also contains information and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.  The library, situated next to the exhibition area, houses more than 26,000 books, journals and other publications on Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs as well as central banking topics.  It also maintains the register of AIs and local representative offices, as well as the register of securities staff of AIs, for public access as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nTo safeguard public health and safety during the COVID-19 pandemic, special operational arrangements were put in place at the Information Centre.  Cleansing and disinfection were stepped up, and facilities and exhibits were sanitised regularly with anti-microbial coating.\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre’s exhibition area comprises the Policy Section, the Currency Section and the Historical Timeline\n\n# Community engagement and public education\n\nTo reach out to the community and raise public awareness of the HKMA’s work, a public education programme has been running since 1998.  In 2021, a webinar was organised for over 2,300 students and teachers from 84 secondary schools.  The webinar covered an overview of the HKMA’s work, the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, protection of personal digital keys, the Deposit Protection Scheme and career opportunities in the banking industry.  To date, more than 63,000 people have participated in the public education programme.\n\nThe HKMA educates and engages the public on how to be smart and responsible financial consumers.  In view of the increase in phishing scams, the HKMA conducted a public awareness campaign themed “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!” with cross-media promotion to urge the public to stay vigilant against fraudulent hyperlinks embedded in SMS messages and emails purportedly from banks.\n\nCross-media promotion reminding the public to beware of fraudulent hyperlinks\n\nThe HKMA also seeks to enhance the public’s understanding of the financial industry and raise the young generation’s interest in pursuing a career in the industry.  Following positive feedback to the online drama series “STEPS” in 2020, the HKMA launched a new series titled “Four Faces of Talents in Central” featuring four growing areas of the financial industry: data science, fintech, green and sustainable finance, and wealth management.  In the video series, the characters of the market practitioners were portrayed in a humorous manner, and seasoned industry players and young talents shared first-hand information on the nature and requirements of jobs, career opportunities and prospects across the above four growing areas.\n\n“Four Faces of Talents in Central” series keeps the young generation abreast of career opportunities in the financial market\n\nThe “Online Parenting and Educational Campaign” launched in 2020 was recognised with a Silver Award in the “Best Event — Corporate Social Responsibility” category of the MarketingInteractive’s Marketing Events Awards 2021.  Building on the campaign’s success and to sustain momentum, the HKMA rolled out additional initiatives, including a parenting financial education workshop where child education experts shared tips on how to teach kids good money sense and demonstrated a DIY (do-it-yourself) financial educational toy, as well as an animated virtual tour of the HKMA Information Centre.\n\nThe “Online Parenting and Educational Campaign” wins an award at the Marketing Events Awards 2021.  The campaign promotes money management concept and skills to let parents and kids learn in an amusing and entertaining way.\n\nTo enhance financial literacy among secondary school students, the HKMA and various stakeholders co-organised the “Hong Kong Financial Literacy Championship”, which featured a fintech theme.  Apart from an online quiz, a new financial design thinking workshop on personal financial management was added to train the participating students to develop innovative proposals on money management tools.  This initiative won the “Highest Student Participation Award” offered by the Business-School Partnership Programme under the Education Bureau, and the “Investor and Financial Education Award (Corporate) — Gold Award” offered by the Investor and Financial Education Council2 (IFEC).\n\nThe “Hong Kong Financial Literacy Championship” educates students on fintech and design thinking concepts and achieves record-high participation\n\nOther community engagement initiatives included talks or webinars for students and retirees.  The HKMA also participated in a teacher training webinar on economic security organised by the Education Bureau.  Online educational materials offering smart tips on using automated teller machines (ATMs) are available in eight languages3 to cater for people of different backgrounds living in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA supports the IFEC in promoting financial literacy and capacity in Hong Kong, and will explore further collaboration with stakeholders to maximise the impact of community engagement.\n\n# Financial disclosure\n\nTo maintain a high level of transparency, the HKMA adopts international standards in financial disclosure insofar as these are applicable to central banking operations.  These include the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and other applicable reporting requirements, for example, the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard.  The Finance Division works with external auditors and other accounting professionals to prepare and present the Exchange Fund’s financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards.  The HKMA also provides detailed disclosures and thorough analyses of a wide range of expense items and budgetary information in its Annual Report.\n\n# ACCOUNTABILITY AND CONTROLS\n\n# Risk management\n\nOne of the HKMA’s most important tasks is to manage risks to the monetary and banking systems.  Risk management is undertaken both at a working level in the day-to-day operations and at a higher level through strategic planning. Under the HKMA’s risk management framework, there are two high-level committees — the Macro Surveillance Committee and the Risk Committee — both of which are chaired by the Chief Executive of the HKMA.\n\nThe terms of reference of the Macro Surveillance Committee are:\n\n- to identify potential risks and threats to the monetary and financial system in Hong Kong and discuss possible measures to address such risks;\n- to review existing measures for managing risks in the monetary and financial system to identify possible gaps and ensure the adequacy of these measures; and\n- to encourage cross-departmental sharing of relevant information on macro surveillance with a view to enhancing the macro surveillance capability of the HKMA.\n\nThe terms of reference of the Risk Committee are:\n\n- to identify potential risks and threats to the organisation and devise strategies to reduce the impact of such events;\n- to review the existing system for managing risks across different departments to identify possible gaps and significant risks and ensure the adequacy of measures to address them;\n- to harmonise the criteria and methods of risk measurement and prioritise the resources management of risks identified; and\n- to encourage a stronger risk management culture institutionally which promotes the proper levels of authorisation and controls.\n\nA robust operational risk management framework is in place covering organisational risks at two levels: the entity level and the department level.  Entity-level risks refer mainly to those which concern the entire organisation in the medium term, or which might call for a cross-departmental response. Potential and emerging risks identified by business units, and the adequacy of the control measures and mitigating strategies they devise, are reviewed and reported every quarter.  This is supplemented by a top-down approach to manage entity-level risks, in which senior colleagues heading different business units actively identify risks of wider impact and propose mitigating measures.  The Risk Committee discusses these assessments and decides on appropriate follow-up actions.\n","terms":{"developing":["發展"],"function":["職能"],"particular":["特別"],"9.6":["960"],"strong":["強"],"27":["27"],"highly":["高度"],"students":["學生"],"seize":["把握"],"use":["使用"],"co-ordinates":["統籌"],"safeguard":["保障"],"second":["第二"],"launch":["推出"],"’":[""],"maintain":["維持"],"relate":["有關"],"dedicated":["致力於"],"face":["面對"],"talk":["介紹"],"enhance":["提升"],"lingering":["持續的"],"recommendations":["建議"],"built":["建立"],"42":["42"],"maintaining":["維持"],"areas":["範疇"],"flexible":["靈活"],"serving":["服務"],"comprises":["包括"],"grow":["增長"],"began":["開始"],"sharp":["顯著"],"turn":["轉變"],"allowing":["讓"],"2017":["2017"],"participating":["參與"],"well":["良好"],"strengthening":["加強"],"aspects":["方面"],"outbreak":["爆發"],"adhere":["恪守"],"knowledge":["知識"],"based":["以⋯⋯為基礎"],"billion":["十億"],"track":["軌道"],"end":["年底"],"rougher":["崎嶇"],"get":["變得"],"lent":["提供"],"substantial":["大量"],"payment-related":["用作支付用途的"],"Looking":["展望"],"191.9":["1,919"],"December":["12月"],"mean":["意思是"],"mobilising":["引導"],"base":["基礎"],"brought":["帶來"],"need":["需要"],"Subsequently":["其後"],"Finally":["最後"],"seeking":["尋求"],"rollout":["推出"],"governments":["政府"],"mainly":["主要"],"double-digit":["雙位數"],"reduction":["減少"],"continue":["繼續"],"cement":["鞏固"],"entered":["踏入"],"demonstrated":["顯示"],"volatile":["波動"],"challenging":["充滿挑戰"],"challenges":["挑戰"],"providing":["提供"],"benefitting":["受惠"],"also":["亦"],"capture":["把握"],"premature":["過早"],"adding":["加上"],"tough":["艱難"],"committed":["致力"],"faring":["表現"],"aspires":["旨在"],"status":["地位"],"managing":["管理"],"parts":["部分"],"better":["更好"],"first":["首個"],"recovery":["復甦"],"equivalent":["等值"],"namely":["即"],"deteriorated":["惡化"],"paramount":["至關重要"],"4.1":["4.1"],"invite":["邀請"],"Despite":["儘管"],"severe":["嚴重"],"discussion":["討論"],"must":["必須"],"relevant":["相關"],"Meanwhile":["另一方面"],"successful":["成功"],"goes":["有云"],"marks":["標誌"],"increased":["上升"],"see":["見到"],"2050":["2050"],"solid":["穩健"],"past":["過去"],"together":["一同"],"real-time":["即時"],"formulated":["制定"],"pleased":["高興"],"competitiveness":["競爭力"],"Although":["儘管"],"90":["九成"],"effectively":["有效"],"maintained":["維持"],"ready":["準備就緒"],"vibrancy":["活力"],"years":["年"],"contraction":["收縮"],"point":["指出"],"may":["可能"],"changed":["改變"],"intensification":["升溫"],"prudently":["審慎"],"RMB26":["260億元人民幣"],"traded":["成交"],"increase":["上升"],"tap":["挖掘"],"two":["兩"],"year":["年"],"introduced":["推出"],"recover":["恢復"],"aligning":["呼應"],"groom":["培育"],"151.9":["151.9"],"journey":["旅程"],"future":["未來"],"adopting":["採納"],"set":["建立"],"continued":["繼續"],"increasingly":["日益"],"practical":["實用"],"go":["進行"],"pace":["步伐"],"launched":["推出"],"activity":["活動"],"emergence":["出現"],"extended":["延長"],"published":["發出"],"months":["個月"],"dominant":["主導"],"meeting":["滿足"],"established":["設立"],"throughout":["全"],"enhancing":["增強"],"Tackling":["處理"],"tCO2e\/US":["tCO2e"],"formulate":["制定"],"watch":["留意"],"series":["連串"],"strengthen":["加強"],"achieved":["達致"],"grew":["增長"],"promote":["推動"],"always":["一如既往"],"establishment":["設立"],"hard-pressed":["經營環境艱難"],"pressure":["壓力"],"five":["五"],"require":["需要"],"manage":["管理"],"87":["87%"],"enter":["進入"],"recorded":["錄得"],"revised":["修訂"],"power":["力量"],"cover":["涵蓋"],"trials":["測試"],"facilitate":["促進"],"closely":["緊密"],"concurrent":["同時"],"challenge":["挑戰"],"share":["分享"],"time":["時"],"tackle":["應對"],"guidance":["指引"],"degree":["程度"],"colleagues":["同事"],"reaching":["達到"],"quote":["舉例"],"diversifying":["多元化"],"50":["50"],"across":["橫跨"],"number":["數目"],"15.4":["15.4"],"covering":["涵蓋"],"cash-flow":["資金周轉"],"path":["路徑"],"resources":["資源"],"invest":["投資"],"organisation":["機構"],"outside":["境外"],"leveraging":["利用"],"twice":["兩度"],"six":["6"],"Besides":["此外"],"million":["百萬"],"numerous":["無數"],"completing":["完善"],"timely":["及時"],"capitalise":["把握"],"reaffirming":["重申"],"supporting":["支持"],"taking":["採取"],"feedback":["回饋"],"latter":["後者"],"ever":["曾"],"appropriate":["合適"],"fourfold":["四倍"],"facing":["面對"],"ultimately":["最終"],"comprehensively":["全面"],"kinds":["類"],"us":["我們"],"overnight":["一朝一夕"],"reflecting":["反映"],"reached":["達到"],"principle":["原則"],"testament":["見證"],"essentially":["本質上"],"including":["包括"],"developmental":["發展的"],"develop":["制訂"],"joined":["攜手"],"achievements":["成果"],"room":["空間"],"levels":["層面"],"help":["協助"],"vision":["願景"],"robustness":["穩健"],"recognising":["鑑於"],"quarter":["季度"],"proactive":["主動"],"city":["城市"],"helping":["幫助"],"assured":["保障"],"cycle":["循環"],"1983":["1983"],"128":["128"],"arising":["產生"],"adopt":["應用"],"huge":["巨大"],"milestone":["里程碑"],"worse":["惡化"],"prospect":["前景"],"spectrum":["範疇"],"disclose":["披露"],"grown":["發展"],"resurgence":["反彈"],"purchasing":["購買力"],"virtuous":["生生不息"],"footing":["基礎"],"start":["開始"],"still":["仍"],"connect":["聯繫"],"offers":["提供"],"ensure":["確保"],"fact":["事實"],"conviction":["信心"],"forefront":["領先"],"leveraged":["借助"],"attract":["吸引"],"jurisdiction":["地區"],"Enhancing":["提升"],"position":["地位"],"rise":["上升"],"totalling":["總額達"],"underpinned":["支撐"],"crucial":["至關重要"],"jointly":["聯同"],"generated

企業職能\n\n企業職能以高度的透明度、問責性、效率和專業性，支持香港金管局的運作。為了促進公眾對金管局政策和運作的了解，金管局透過傳統媒體、社交媒體、網站、資訊中心及其他渠道，與社會各界及市場保持有效溝通。在機構內部，金管局致力建立一支靈活應變及可持續發展的員工隊伍，實行嚴格的財務紀律，並提升資訊科技能力，以應對變化及確保有效落實其政策和措施。\n\n# 透明度\n\n# 媒體關係及社交媒體\n\n金管局與媒體緊密合作，以提升透明度及促進公眾對金管局政策和運作的了解。2021年，金管局舉辦或參與了169場實體及虛擬活動，包括八場記者會、八場站立式訪問及153場其他公開活動，另安排了27場媒體訪問。全年共發出632份雙語新聞稿，並每日處理大量媒體查詢。\n\n為提升公眾對金管局主要職能的認識，金管局為本地、內地及海外媒體舉辦了記者會及簡報會。主題包括「互聯互通」計畫、金融科技及利率基準改革。\n\n為及時與公眾保持聯繫及互動，金管局設有五個社交媒體頻道（Facebook、Instagram、LinkedIn、Twitter及YouTube），擁有超過80,000名追蹤者。金管局利用社交媒體頻道，就一系列議題提升公眾意識，尤其是釣魚式詐騙，此類詐騙在疫情期間大幅增加。此外，金管局透過社交媒體進行廣泛的宣傳活動，推廣綠色金融、金融科技及「互聯互通」計畫，讓公眾掌握最新的發展趨勢。\n\n金管局行政總裁余偉文先生在2021年香港金融科技週主持了一場虛擬小組討論會。\n\n金管局副行政總裁李達志先生就金管局的「金融科技2025」策略主持了一場媒體簡報會。\n\n金管局副行政總裁阮國恒先生就香港銀行業為過渡至倫敦銀行同業拆息利率作準備一事主持了一場媒體簡報會。\n\n金管局副行政總裁劉應彬先生接受了一家國際新聞頻道的訪問。\n\n# 公眾查詢\n\n公眾查詢服務為公眾提供有效途徑，以更好地了解金管局的主要職能和運作。2021年，該服務處理了9,781宗查詢。當中約一半查詢與銀行政策及規例、消費者銀行服務、紙幣及硬幣，以及金融基建及債務市場發展有關。部分顯著的查詢涉及硬幣收集計畫、銀行產品及服務、與銀行相關的指引及通告，以及零售債券發行計畫。\n\n圖表1顯示自2018年以來收到的公眾查詢宗數，而圖表2則按2021年查詢性質提供分類數據。\n\n圖表1：公眾查詢總宗數\n\n圖表2：2021年收到的查詢性質\n\n# 出版物\n\n除《金管局年報》外，金管局亦發表了兩期《半年度貨幣及金融穩定報告》及四期《季刊》，並定期更新《每月統計報告》，提供有關香港貨幣、銀行及經濟議題的最新主題資訊及分析。《金管局年報》亦發表了11篇inSight文章，介紹其主要新措施及政策，並討論備受關注的議題。\n\n《金管局2020年年報》在香港管理協會「2021年度最佳年報獎」中，獲頒「非牟利及慈善團體」組別銀獎，以及環境、社會及管治報告卓越獎。\n\n# 企業網站\n\n企業網站（www.hkma.gov.hk）提供超過44,000頁的內容，包括英文、繁體中文及簡體中文，是公眾獲取金管局最新資訊的門戶。網站載有根據《銀行業條例》第20條存置的認可機構及本地代表處名冊，以及認可機構證券從業員名冊，還有根據《支付系統及貯值設施條例》存置的貯值支付工具發牌人名冊。\n\n自2018年起，金管局分階段透過開放應用程式介面（Open API）在其網站上發佈財務數據及重要資訊。截至2021年底，金管局已按計畫目標在其網站上開放了148套開放應用程式介面。\n\n# 資訊中心\n\n金管局資訊中心位於國際金融中心二期55樓，是向社會介紹金管局工作及提升公眾對貨幣及銀行事務認識的重要設施。中心設有展覽區及圖書館。展覽區以互動方式概述金管局的工作及香港貨幣及銀行業的發展，並提供資訊及展品，供人士研究香港貨幣、銀行及金融事務。圖書館設於展覽區旁，藏有超過26,000本有關香港貨幣、銀行及金融事務，以及中央銀行議題的書籍、期刊及其他出版物。中心亦存置認可機構及本地代表處名冊，以及認可機構證券從業員名冊，供公眾根據《銀行業條例》第20條的規定查閱。\n\n為保障公眾在COVID-19疫情期間的健康及安全，資訊中心實施了特別運作安排。清潔及消毒工作已加強，設施及展品亦定期以抗菌塗層進行消毒。\n\n金管局資訊中心的展覽區包括政策展區、貨幣展區及歷史時間軸。\n\n# 社區聯繫及公眾教育\n\n為與社會聯繫及提升公眾對金管局工作的認識，自1998年起已推行公眾教育計畫。2021年，金管局為來自84所中學的超過2,300名學生及教師舉辦了一場網上研討會。研討會涵蓋金管局工作簡介、聯繫匯率制度、香港紙幣、保障個人數碼密鑰、存款保障計畫及銀行業的就業機遇等議題。至今，超過63,000人已參與公眾教育計畫。\n\n金管局教育及引導公眾如何成為精明及負責任的金融消費者。鑑於釣魚式詐騙有所增加，金管局舉辦了一項以「保護個人數碼密鑰，小心詐騙連結！」為主題的公眾教育活動，透過跨媒體宣傳，呼籲公眾提高警惕，提防不法份子在聲稱來自銀行的手機短訊及電郵中植入詐騙超連結。\n\n跨媒體宣傳提醒公眾提防詐騙超連結。\n\n金管局亦致力提升公眾對金融業的認識，並提高年輕一代對投身金融業的興趣。在2020年網上劇集《STEPS》獲得正面評價後，金管局推出了一套新劇集，名為《中環人才四面觀》，介紹金融業四個增長範疇：數據科學、金融科技、綠色及可持續金融，以及財富管理。在劇集裡，市場從業人員的角色以幽默方式呈現，資深業界人士及年輕人才亦分享了關於上述四個增長範疇的職務性質及要求、就業機遇及前景的第一手資訊。\n\n《中環人才四面觀》系列讓年輕一代掌握金融市場的就業機遇。\n\n在2020年推出的「網上家長教育活動」獲《MarketingInteractive》「2021年市場營銷活動大獎」的「最佳活動 — 企業社會責任」組別銀獎。為延續活動的成功及保持動力，金管局推出更多措施，包括舉辦家長金融教育工作坊，由兒童教育專家分享如何教導孩子正確的金錢觀念，並示範一個DIY（自行製作）金融教育玩具，以及推出金管局資訊中心的動畫虛擬導覽。\n\n「網上家長教育活動」在2021年市場營銷活動大獎中獲獎。該活動推廣理財概念及技巧，讓家長及孩子以輕鬆有趣的方式學習。\n\n為提升中學學生的金融理財知識，金管局與不同持份者合辦了以金融科技為主題的「香港金融理財知識大賽」。除了網上問答比賽外，新增一個以個人財務管理為主題的金融設計思維工作坊，訓練參賽學生就理財工具制訂創新方案。這項活動獲教育局「商校合作計劃」頒發「最高學生參與獎」，以及投資者及理財教育委員會（投教局）頒發「投資者及理財教育獎（企業）— 金獎」。\n\n「香港金融理財知識大賽」向學生教授金融科技及設計思維概念，並創下最高參與人數紀錄。\n\n其他社區聯繫活動包括為學生及退休人士舉辦講座或網上研討會。金管局亦參與了由教育局舉辦的經濟安全教師培訓網上研討會。網上教育材料提供使用自動櫃員機的智能貼士，以八種語言提供，以照顧在香港生活的不同背景人士。\n\n金管局支持投教局在香港推廣金融理財知識及能力，並將與持份者探討進一步合作，以最大化社區聯繫的影響力。\n\n# 財務披露\n\n為保持高度透明度，金管局在財務披露方面採用適用於中央銀行運作的國際標準，包括香港財務報告準則及其他適用報告要求，例如國際貨幣基金組織的特別數據發佈標準。財務部與外部審計師及其他會計專業人士合作，按照香港財務報告準則編製及呈交外匯基金的財務報表。金管局亦在年報中就一系列開支項目及預算資訊提供詳細披露及深入分析。\n\n# 問責及監控\n\n# 風險管理\n\n金管局最重要的任務之一是管理貨幣及銀行體系的風險。風險管理在日常運作中於工作層面進行，亦在策略規劃層面於更高層次進行。在金管局的風險管理框架下，設有兩個高層委員會 — 宏觀監察委員會及風險委員會，兩者均由金管局行政總裁擔任主席。\n\n宏觀監察委員會的職權範圍如下：\n\n- 識別香港貨幣及金融體系潛在的風險及威脅，並討論應對這些風險的可能措施；\n-

{"en":"# Sustainability\n\nThe HKMA is publishing its first sustainability report, as an integral part of its Annual Report 2021, to set out its strategy on sustainability and document its own efforts, as well as its joint efforts with the financial industry, to support the Government’s climate strategies and contribute to a more climate resilient and sustainable world.\n\nThe HKMA embeds sustainability considerations across its main roles and functions, whether as a banking supervisor, a market facilitator, a responsible investor, or in maintaining financial and monetary stability.  Moreover, the HKMA collaborates with local and overseas counterparts in strengthening the management and disclosures of climate risks, as well as the development of the green and sustainable finance market.\n\nIn addition, the HKMA is committed to fulfilling its corporate social responsibility, and aims to be a responsible and sustainable organisation. This commitment is manifested in various areas, including promoting a sustainable, financially inclusive and environmentally friendly marketplace, supporting the wider community, protecting the environment and nurturing a caring workplace.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nClimate change is one of the most pressing challenges facing the world today.  To combat climate change, countries agreed, under the Paris Agreement1, to take actions to cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and eventually achieve carbon neutrality within this century.  Meeting the Paris Agreement climate change target will require investments of an estimated US$1–2 trillion a year globally2, making sustainability one of the biggest drivers of capital flows in the decades ahead.\n\nHong Kong is determined to be at the forefront of this transition.  The Government announced that it will strive to achieve carbon neutrality before 2050, in line with developed economies globally.  Hong Kong is also the first Asian jurisdiction that has committed to specifically aligning disclosure requirements with recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) by 2025 across relevant sectors.\n\nTo the financial sector, climate change is both a source of risk and opportunity.  While the financial sector cannot be spared from the threats posed by climate change, it has a key role to play in the transition by channelling more financing to activities that are consistent with a pathway towards lower GHG emissions and climate-resilient developments.\n\nThe HKMA is committed to strengthening Hong Kong’s financial system to support a greener and more sustainable future, driving actions to support the Government’s climate goal and contributing to the global agenda.  In doing so, the HKMA incorporates sustainability considerations in carrying out its main functions and in running its operations.\n\nFirst, as a banking supervisor, the HKMA aims to strengthen resilience of the banking system against climate risks and to accelerate banks’ efforts in supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy.  To accomplish this, the HKMA has formulated a regulatory framework setting out supervisory requirements for banks to manage and disclose climate risks.  A pilot exercise on climate risk stress test to assess the resilience of the banking sector was also concluded successfully in 2021.  Meanwhile, on an ongoing basis, the HKMA takes into account climate change in monitoring financial stability risks.\n\nSecondly, in its market development role, the HKMA is focusing its efforts in enhancing Hong Kong’s role as a green and sustainable finance hub in the region, including the Greater Bay Area (GBA).  Hong Kong, being Mainland’s offshore financial centre, is well-positioned to channel global investments into Mainland’s plans to achieve peak carbon emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060.  The HKMA is also working through the Green and Sustainable Finance Cross-Agency Steering Group (CASG)3, which the HKMA co-chairs, to build industry capacity, address data gaps and explore the development of a local green classification framework.\n\nIn fact, Hong Kong is a leader in green finance solutions, having established the world’s first government Global Medium Term Note Programme dedicated to green bond issuances under the Government Green Bond Programme, and increased gradually the diversity of its issuances since 2019, both in terms of currencies and tenors.  To support the issuance of green and sustainable bonds and loans in the private sector, the Government set up the Green and Sustainable Finance Grant Scheme in May 2021. Administered by the HKMA, this scheme has incentivised more corporates to seek green and sustainable financing in Hong Kong, and encouraged more green advisers and external reviewers to establish or expand their presence here.\n\nThirdly, as the manager of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA has ensured that environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations are an integral part of its investment process and asset allocation decisions.  In the latter part of this report, the HKMA makes its inaugural disclosures on its climate scenario analysis and carbon footprint metrics of the Exchange Fund’s portfolios.\n\nFourthly, the HKMA is stepping up its own green office initiatives to ensure its own operations conform to best practices in the management and mitigation of climate risks.  As a start, the HKMA has established its carbon profile across Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions4, and made corresponding disclosures.  At the same time, the HKMA has implemented measures to enhance industry-wide operational efficiency and minimise resource consumption.  In addition, the HKMA holds itself to high standards of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and works with its stakeholders to promote financial inclusion and financial literacy.\n\nGreening the financial system requires close collaboration amongst central banks and supervisors.  The HKMA is an active member of the international community in global policymaking and alignment of sustainability standards. The HKMA has also issued a statement to support the Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) Glasgow Declaration5, reaffirming its commitment to delivering on the NGFS recommendations in taking the necessary measures to foster a greener financial system.\n\nIn driving these sustainability initiatives and assessing climaterelated opportunities and risks, sustainability and green considerations are embedded in the HKMA’s governance and risk management frameworks, in which the leadership is actively involved in setting the overarching objectives and guiding principles, in consultation with the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) and its sub-committees. The HKMA’s CSR and Sustainability Committee (CSC) also assesses the potential impacts of sustainability and climate-related issues on the organisation, and devises strategies to reduce the impacts.  Execution of the relevant strategies and initiatives is closely monitored and reported to the top management regularly.  In addition, external consultants have been engaged to advise the HKMA in selected areas of work.\n\nThe subsequent sections of this chapter will delve into the HKMA’s governance, strategies and risk management measures in undertaking green finance and sustainability work in each of its roles.\n\nThis report is prepared with reference to the disclosure elements recommended in the NGFS’s Guide on Climaterelated Disclosure for Central Banks, published in December 2021.  In addition, information in relation to the HKMA’s office operations makes broad reference to the reporting principles under the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards6 and the ESG Reporting Guide promulgated by the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited.\n\n# Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System\n\nThe NGFS provides a platform for central banks and prudential supervisory authorities to exchange experiences, share best practices, contribute to the development of environmental and climate risk management in the financial sector, and mobilise mainstream finance to support the transition towards a sustainable economy.  Its purpose is to define and promote best practices to be implemented within and outside of the membership of the NGFS, and to conduct or commission analytical work on green finance.\n\n# Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures\n\nIn December 2015, the Financial Stability Board created the TCFD to develop recommendations for more effective climate-related disclosures by companies to investors, lenders and insurance underwriters that could promote more informed decisions.  The TCFD’s recommendations are structured around four thematic areas that represent the core elements of how organisations operate: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets.\n\n# BANKING SUPERVISOR\n\nAs the core part of the financial system, banks should be proactive in managing climate risks, and support channelling more capital to green and sustainable activities.  As a banking supervisor, the HKMA focuses on building banks’ resilience against climate risks and accelerating banks’ efforts in supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\n# Overview of the HKMA’s three-phased approach\n\nSince May 2019, the HKMA has been promoting green and sustainable banking in three phases:\n\n# Phase I\n\nDeveloping a common framework to assess the “greenness baseline” of individual banks, and collaborating with international bodies to provide technical support to banks in Hong Kong.\n\n# Phase II\n\nConsulting the industry and other stakeholders on the supervisory expectations and requirements of green and sustainable banking.\n\n# Phase III\n\nFocusing on the implementation of supervisory requirements, monitoring and evaluation of banks’ progress in green and sustainable banking.\n\n# Guidance\n\n# Supervisory requirements on climate risk management\n\nIn 2020, the HKMA developed a common framework for assessing the “greenness baseline” of individual banks in collaboration with the industry.  The HKMA also conducted the first greenness assessment of banks, which marked the completion of Phase I.  To help banks prepare for the new supervisory requirements, a white paper was published in June 2020, which outlined the HKMA’s initial thinking on supervisory expectations for climate risk management.\n\nIn December 2021, following an industry consultation, the HKMA issued the supervisory requirements for banks to incorporate climate considerations into governance, strategy, risk management and disclosure.  In particular, specific requirements and concrete timeline were set out in mandating climate-related disclosures based on the recommendations of the TCFD before 2025. The requirements will set a benchmark to help banks upgrade their risk management capability.\n\nThe next step is for the HKMA to monitor banks’ implementation of the relevant requirements.  In this regard, the HKMA has stepped up its supervisory capacity by setting up a new dedicated team within its Banking Supervision Department to carry out climate risk supervision.\n\nThis three-phased approach is an iterative and evolving process.  Further to the first round of greenness assessment conducted in 2020, the HKMA is reviewing the framework to encompass the new supervisory requirements on climate risk management and potentially cover a wider scope, such as other environmental risks and measures for supporting the net zero transition.   The HKMA intends to launch an updated framework in the second half of 2022.\n\n# Sound practices supporting the transition to carbon neutrality\n\nApart from incorporating climate risk considerations into the risk management framework, some banks have devoted resources and taken measures to support the goals of the Paris Agreement and contribute to achieving global net zero emissions.  The HKMA issued a circular in December 2021 to share with the industry the sound practices of these banks which would be of reference value to other banks in the industry in formulating their climate strategies.  These sound practices are grouped into four areas: reducing GHG emissions of the banks’ own operations, reducing financed emissions through portfolio alignment, assisting clients to transition, and promoting collective efforts to assist the economy to achieve a net-zero transition.\n\n# Green classification framework to facilitate green finance flows\n\nTo increase transparency across the financial markets and enable consistent policy making on green finance, the HKMA has been working with other financial regulators to explore a local green classification framework, which will facilitate navigation among the Common Ground Taxonomy (CGT) developed by the International Platform on Sustainable Finance (IPSF)8 and the green definitions adopted by China and European Union, for adoption across different financial sectors.  The work will be guided by the principles of interoperability, comparability and inclusiveness, taking into account other definitions of green, transitional activities and local considerations.  This initiative will reduce the risk of green washing, improve product comparability and ultimately enhance investor protection.\n\n# Assessment: climate risk stress test\n\nTo assess the banking sector’s ability to cope with potential shocks brought about by climate change, the HKMA undertook a pilot exercise on climate risk stress test (CRST), which included the participation of 20 major retail banks and seven branches of international banking groups.  A report summarising the results of the pilot CRST exercise was published in December 2021.  The results showed that the banking sector remained resilient even in the face of extreme climate-related shocks, although these shocks could potentially give rise to significant adverse impacts on banks’ financials.  The CRST exercise helped to enhance banks’ capabilities for measuring and assessing climate risks. In light of the CRST results, the participating banks have devised plans to strengthen their climate strategies and risk governance frameworks.  The HKMA will continue to engage the industry to strengthen banks’ capability and enhance the CRST framework, taking into account the lessons learnt from the pilot

永續性\n\n香港金管局正發表其首份永續性報告，作為《2021年年報》的重要部分，以闡述其永續性策略，並記錄其自身努力，以及與金融業界共同努力，支持政府的氣候策略，並為建立一個更具氣候韌性及永續性的世界作出貢獻。\n\n香港金管局將永續性考量融入其主要職能與角色之中，無論是擔任銀行監管機構、市場促進者、負責任的投資者，或是維持金融及貨幣穩定，皆不例外。此外，香港金管局與本地及海外同行合作，以強化氣候風險的管理和披露，並推動綠色和永續金融市場的發展。\n\n此外，香港金管局致力履行企業社會責任，並期許自身成為一個負責任且永續的組織。這項承諾體現在多個領域，包括推動永續、金融包容及環保的市場，支持更廣泛的社區，保護環境，以及建立一個關懷的工作環境。\n\n# 概述\n\n氣候變遷是當今世界面臨的最緊迫挑戰之一。為應對氣候變遷，各國依據《巴黎協定》1 同意採取行動，削減溫室氣體（GHG）排放量，並最終在本世紀內達成碳中和。要實現《巴黎協定》的氣候變遷目標，全球每年估計需要投資1至2兆美元2，這使得永續性成為未來數十年資本流動的最大驅動力之一。\n\n香港決心在這一轉型中領銜。政府宣布，將與全球發達經濟體保持一致，致力在2050年前達成碳中和。香港亦為首個亞洲地區，承諾在2025年前於相關產業中，具體地將披露要求與「氣候相關財務揭露工作小組」（TCFD）的建議保持一致。\n\n對於金融業而言，氣候變遷既是風險的來源，也是機會。儘管金融業無法避免氣候變遷帶來的威脅，但在轉型過程中，它可以發揮關鍵作用，將更多資金引導至與降低溫室氣體排放和具氣候韌性發展的路徑一致的活動。\n\n香港金管局致力強化香港的金融體系，以支持更綠色及永續的未來，推動行動以支持政府的氣候目標，並為全球議程作出貢獻。在這樣做的時候，香港金管局在履行其主要職能和運作時，均納入永續性考量。\n\n首先，作為銀行監管機構，香港金管局的目標是強化銀行體系抵禦氣候風險的能力，並加速銀行支持向低碳經濟轉型的努力。為達成此目標，香港金管局制定了監管框架，訂明銀行管理及披露氣候風險的監管要求。此外，於2021年成功完成了一項氣候風險壓力測試的試點工作，以評估銀行業的韌性。同時，香港金管局在持續監控金融穩定風險時，亦會考慮氣候變遷因素。\n\n其次，在市場發展方面，香港金管局集中努力強化香港作為區域內綠色及永續金融樞紐的角色，包括大灣區。香港作為內地離岸金融中心，具有良好條件將全球投資引導至內地於2030年前實現碳排放達峰及於2060年前實現碳中和的計畫。香港金管局亦透過由該局擔任聯席主席的「綠色及可持續金融跨機構督導小組」3，建立業界能力、應對數據缺口，以及探討制訂本地綠色分類框架。\n\n事實上，香港在綠色金融解決方案方面處於領先地位，設立了全球首個由政府發行的專為綠色債券而設的「政府綠色債券計畫」下的「全球中期票據計畫」，並自2019年起逐步增加其發行的多樣性，包括貨幣及年期方面。為支持私人市場發行綠色及永續債券和貸款，政府於2021年5月設立了「綠色和可持續金融資助計畫」。該計畫由香港金管局管理，鼓勵更多企業在香港尋求綠色及永續融資，並吸引更多綠色顧問及外部評審機構在此設立或擴展業務。\n\n第三，作為外匯基金的經理，香港金管局確保環境、社會及治理（ESG）因素成為其投資流程及資產配置決策的重要部分。在本報告的後半部分，香港金管局首次披露其對外匯基金投資組合的氣候情境分析及碳足跡指標。\n\n第四，香港金管局正加強其綠色辦公室措施，以確保其運作符合管理及減緩氣候風險的最佳實務。作為起點，香港金管局已制定其涵蓋範圍一及範圍二排放量的碳排放數據4，並作出相應披露。同時，香港金管局已實施措施，以提升業界整體營運效率及減少資源消耗。此外，香港金管局對自身訂立高標準的企業社會責任（CSR），並與利害關係人合作，以推動金融普及及金融理財知識。\n\n要實現金融體系的綠色化，需要中央銀行及監管機構之間的緊密合作。香港金管局是國際社會在全球政策制定及永續性標準協調方面的活躍成員。香港金管局亦發表聲明，支持「促進金融體系綠色化的中央銀行及監管機構網絡」（NGFS）的《格拉斯哥宣言》5，重申其承諾落實NGFS的建議，採取必要措施以促進更綠色的金融體系。\n\n在推動這些永續性措施及評估與氣候相關的機遇和風險時，永續性和綠色考量已被融入香港金管局的治理及風險管理框架中，其中領導層與外匯基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）及其轄下小組委員會諮詢後，積極參與制定總體目標和指導原則。香港金管局的企業社會責任及永續發展委員會（CSC）亦評估永續性及與氣候相關議題對機構的潛在影響，並制定策略以減低影響。相關策略及措施的執行情況受到密切監控，並定期向高層管理人員匯報。此外，已聘請外部顧問就香港金管局的特定工作領域提供建議。\n\n本章節的後續部分將深入探討香港金管局在履行其各項職能時，在綠色金融及永續性工作方面的治理、策略及風險管理措施。\n\n本報告的編製參考了2021年12月發表的NGFS《中央銀行與氣候相關披露指引》中建議的披露要素。此外，有關香港金管局辦公室運作的資訊，廣泛參考了《全球匯報計畫》（GRI）標準6下的匯報原則，以及香港交易所發表的《環境、社會及治理報告指引》。\n\n# 促進金融體系綠色化的中央銀行及監管機構網絡\n\nNGFS為中央銀行及審慎監管機構提供一個平台，以交流經驗、分享最佳實務、促進金融業環境及氣候風險管理的發展，以及動員主流金融業支持向永續經濟轉型。其目的是界定及推廣最佳實務，供NGFS成員內外實施，並就綠色金融進行或委託分析工作。\n\n# 氣候相關財務揭露工作小組\n\n金融穩定委員會於2015年12月成立TCFD，以制訂建議，讓公司向投資者、貸款機構及保險承保人作出更有效的與氣候相關的揭露，以促進更知情的決策。TCFD的建議圍繞四個主題領域而構建，這四個領域代表了組織運作的核心要素：治理、策略、風險管理，以及指標和目標。\n\n# 銀行監管機構\n\n作為金融體系的核心部分，銀行應主動管理氣候風險，並支持將更多資本引導至綠色及永續活動。作為銀行監管機構，香港金管局集中強化銀行抵禦氣候風險的能力，並加速銀行支持向低碳經濟轉型的努力。\n\n# 香港金管局三階段措施的概述\n\n自2019年5月以來，香港金管局分三個階段推動綠色及永續銀行業務：\n\n# 第一階段\n\n制訂一個共同框架，以評估個別銀行的「綠色基準」，並與國際機構合作，為香港銀行提供技術支援。\n\n# 第二階段\n\n就綠色及永續銀行業務的監管期望及要求，與業界及其他利害關係人進行諮詢。\n\n# 第三階段\n\n集中落實監管要求，監控及評估銀行在綠色及永續銀行業務方面的進展。\n\n# 指引\n\n# 氣候風險管理的監管要求\n\n2020年，香港金管局與業界合作，制訂了一個共同框架，以評估個別銀行的「綠色基準」。香港金管局亦進行了首次銀行綠色評估，標誌著第一階段的完成。為協助銀行為新監管要求作好準備，香港金管局於2020年6月發表了一份白皮書，概述了該局對氣候風險管理監管期望的初步想法。\n\n2021年12月，經與業界諮詢後，香港金管局向銀行發出監管要求，將氣候考量納入治理、策略、風險管理及披露之中。當中特別訂明，須根據TCFD的建議，在2025年前強制進行與氣候相關的披露，並訂立具體的要求及時間表。有關要求將設立基準，協助銀行提升其風險管理能力。\n\n下一步是香港金管局監控銀行落實有關要求的情況。在此方面，香港金管局已強化其監管能力，在銀行監管部門內成立了一個新的專責團隊，以進行氣候風險監管。\n\n這個三階段措施是一個反覆及不斷演進的過程。在2020年進行首輪綠色評估後，香港金管局正檢視該框架，以涵蓋新的氣候風險管理監管要求，並有可能覆蓋更廣泛的範圍，例如其他環境風險及支持淨零轉型的措施。香港金管局擬於2022年下半年推出經更新的框架。\n\n# 支持轉型至碳中和的良好實務\n\n除了將氣候風險考量納入風險管理框架外，部分銀行亦投入資源及採取措施，以支持《巴黎協定》的目標，並為實現全球淨零排放作出貢獻。香港金管局於2021年12月發出通告，與業界分享這些銀行的良好實務，供業界其他銀行在制訂其氣候策略時作參考。這些良好實務分為四個領域：減低銀行自身營運的溫室氣體排放量、透過投資組合調整以減低融資排放量、協助客戶轉型，以及推動集體努力以協助經濟體實現淨零轉型。\n\n# 綠色分類框架以促進綠色金融流動\n\n為提升金融市場的透明度，並促進綠色金融政策的連貫性，香港金管局一直與其他金融監管機構合作，探討制訂一個本地的綠色分類框架，以促進在國際可持續金融平台（IPSF）8制訂的「共同分類標準」（CGT）及中國和歐盟採納的綠色定義之間的導航，供不同金融產業採用。有關工作將以互操作性、可比性及包容性原則為指引，並考慮其他綠色定義、過渡性活動及本地因素。這項措施將減低綠色偽裝的風險，提升產品的可比性，並最終強化投資者保護。\n\n# 評估：氣候風險壓力測試\n\n為評估銀行業應對氣候變遷帶來的潛在衝擊的能力，香港金管局進行了一項氣候風險壓力測試（CRST）試點工作，共有20家主要零售銀行及7家國際銀行集團的分行參與。一份總結試點CRST工作結果的報告於2021年12月發表。結果顯示，即使面對與氣候相關的極端衝擊，銀行業仍保持韌性，儘管這些衝擊可能對銀行的財務造成重大不利影響。CRST工作有助提升銀行衡量及評估氣候風險的能力。鑑於CRST的結果，參與銀行已制訂計畫，以強化其氣候策略及風險治理框架。香港金管局將繼續與業界保持聯繫，以強化銀行的能力及提升CRST框架，並考慮從試點工作中汲取的經驗教訓。"}
{"en":"# The Exchange Fund\n\nReport of the Director of Audit Exchange Fund Financial Statements\n\n# Audit Commission The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 217 to 319, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2021, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2021, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards.  My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report.  I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards.  I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021.  These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.5, 2.6 and 38.1 to the financial statements.\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, the Group had financial assets totalling HK$4,502,475 million and financial liabilities totalling HK$1,150,861 million valued at fair value.\n\nFor 89% of these financial assets and all these financial liabilities, their fair values were quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 inputs) or were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data (Level 2 inputs).\n\nFor the remaining 11% of these financial assets, their fair values were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data (Level 3 inputs).  Such financial assets totalled HK$517,316 million, including mainly unlisted investment funds.\n\nGiven the substantial amount and the estimations involved, valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value was a key audit matter.\n\nThe audit procedures on valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value included:\n\n- obtaining an understanding of the procedures, including relevant controls, for valuing different categories of financial assets and financial liabilities;\n- evaluating and testing the controls, including relevant application controls of the computer systems;\n- obtaining external confirmations on the valuation, existence, rights and obligations and completeness of the financial assets and financial liabilities;\n- where quoted market prices were used, verifying the prices to independent sources;\n- where valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions, and verifying the inputs to independent sources; and\n- where valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Valuation of investment properties at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.11, 18 and 19 to the financial statements.\n\nThe Group’s investment properties were stated at their fair values, totalling HK$27,089 million as at 31 December 2021. The Group also had interests in one associate and twenty one joint ventures totalling HK$45,172 million, whose principal activities were holding overseas investment properties.  The fair values of these investment properties, whether held by the Group directly or by associate or joint ventures, were mainly determined based on valuations by independent professional valuers.  Such valuations involved significant judgments and estimates, including the valuation methodologies and the assumptions used.\n\nThe audit procedures on valuation of investment properties at fair value included:\n\n- obtaining and reviewing the valuation reports of investment properties held by the Group directly or by associate or joint ventures, and verifying that the fair values were based on the valuations stated in the valuation reports;\n- assessing the independence and qualifications of the valuers; and\n- evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information.  The other information comprises all the information included in the 2021 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.  If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact.  I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.  I also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.  The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.  If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion.  My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report.  However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and\n- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements.  I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit.  I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.  I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nJohn Chu Director of

外匯基金\n\n審計署署長關於外匯基金財務報表的報告\n\n# 審計委員會　香港特別行政區政府\n\n# 獨立核數師致財政司司長的報告\n\n# 意見\n\n我已審核外匯基金及其附屬公司（簡稱「該集團」）的財務報表，該報表載於第217至319頁，包括外匯基金及該集團截至2021年12月31日的資產負債表，以及截至該日止年度的收支帳目、全面收益表、權益變動表及現金流量表，還有財務報表附註，包括重要會計政策概要。\n\n我認為，該財務報表按照香港會計師公會頒佈的《香港財務報告準則》，真實及公允地反映了該基金及該集團截至2021年12月31日的財務狀況，以及截至該日止年度的財務表現及現金流量，並已按照行政長官根據《外匯基金條例》（第66章）第7條發出的指示妥為編製。\n\n# 意見依據\n\n我按照行政長官根據《外匯基金條例》第7條發出的指示及審計委員會的審計準則進行審核。我根據這些準則所承擔的責任，在我報告中的「核數師審核財務報表的責任」一節中作了進一步說明。我根據這些準則，獨立於該集團之外，並已履行其他道德責任。我相信我所獲取的審計證據，足以作為我發表意見的基礎。\n\n# 主要審計事項\n\n主要審計事項是指我在專業判斷中，認為在審核截至2021年12月31日止年度的財務報表時最具重要性的事項。這些事項是在審核財務報表的整體範圍內進行處理的，我在形成審核意見時亦考慮了這些事項，但我不會就這些事項單獨發表意見。\n\n# 金融資產及金融負債以公允價值計量的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.5、2.6及38.1。\n\n截至2021年12月31日，該集團以公允價值計量的金融資產總額為4,502,475百萬港元，金融負債總額為1,150,861百萬港元。\n\n其中，89%的金融資產及所有金融負債的公允價值，為相同資產或負債在活躍市場上的報價（第一層級輸入值），或以可觀察的市場數據為基礎，運用估值技術估算而得（第二層級輸入值）。\n\n餘下11%的金融資產的公允價值，是以非以可觀察的市場數據為基礎的估值技術估算而得（第三層級輸入值）。這些金融資產總額為517,316百萬港元，主要包括未上市投資基金。\n\n鑑於所涉及的金額龐大及估算因素，以公允價值計量金融資產及金融負債的估值成為一項主要審計事項。\n\n以公允價值計量金融資產及金融負債的估值的審計程序包括：\n\n- 了解估值不同類別金融資產及金融負債的程序，包括相關的控制措施；\n- 評估及測試控制措施，包括電腦系統的相關應用控制措施；\n- 取得外部確認，以確認金融資產及金融負債的估值、存在、權利及義務和完整性；\n- 若使用市場報價，則向獨立來源核實該價格；\n- 若使用以可觀察的市場數據為基礎的估值技術，則評估估值方法的適當性及假設的合理性，並向獨立來源核實輸入值；及\n- 若使用非以可觀察的市場數據為基礎的估值技術，則評估估值方法的適當性及假設和輸入值的合理性。\n\n# 投資物業以公允價值計量的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.11、18及19。\n\n該集團的投資物業以公允價值列帳，截至2021年12月31日總額為27,089百萬港元。該集團亦在一間聯營公司及二十一間合營公司持有權益，總額為45,172百萬港元，其主要業務為持有海外投資物業。這些投資物業的公允價值，不論是由該集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有，主要根據獨立專業估值師的估值而釐定。該等估值涉及重大的判斷及估計，包括所用的估值方法及假設。\n\n以公允價值計量投資物業的估值的審計程序包括：\n\n- 取得及審閱該集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有的投資物業的估值報告，並核實公允價值是否以估值報告所列的估值為依據；\n- 評估估值師的獨立性及資格；及\n- 評估估值方法的適當性及假設和輸入值的合理性。\n\n# 其他資訊\n\n其他資訊由金融管理局負責。其他資訊包括香港金融管理局2021年年報中所有資訊，但不包括財務報表及我就該等報表所發表的核數師報告。\n\n我對財務報表發表的意見並不涵蓋其他資訊，我亦不就該等資訊發表任何形式的保證結論。\n\n在審核財務報表時，我的責任是閱讀其他資訊，並考慮其他資訊是否與財務報表或我在審核中獲得的知識有重大不一致，或是否似乎有重大錯報。如我根據已進行的工作得出結論，認為其他資訊有重大錯報，我有責任報告該事實。我在此方面沒有任何事項需要報告。\n\n# 金融管理局及外匯基金諮詢委員會審計小組委員會對財務報表的責任\n\n金融管理局負責按照香港會計師公會頒佈的《香港財務報告準則》及行政長官根據《外匯基金條例》第7條發出的指示，編製真實及公允的財務報表，並負責制定金融管理局認為必要的內部控制，以使編製的財務報表不存在因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯報。\n\n在編製財務報表時，金融管理局負責評估該集團作為持續經營的能力，披露與持續經營相關的適用事項，並採用持續經營的會計基礎。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會審計小組委員會負責監督該集團的財務報告程序。\n\n# 核數師審核財務報表的責任\n\n我的目標是取得合理保證，以確定財務報表整體是否不存在因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯報，並就財務報表發表核數師報告，包括我的意見。合理保證是高水平的保證，但並不能保證按照審計委員會的審計準則進行的審計在任何時候都能發現財務報表中存在的重大錯報。錯報可能因欺詐或錯誤而產生，如果錯報個別或總計起來可能影響用戶依據這些財務報表作出的經濟決策，則認為錯報具有重要性。\n\n在按照審計委員會的審計準則進行審計時，我運用專業判斷，並保持職業懷疑態度。我亦：\n\n- 識別及評估財務報表因欺詐或錯誤而出現重大錯報的風險，設計及執行審計程序以應對這些風險，並取得充分及適當的審計證據，作為我發表意見的基礎。由於欺詐可能涉及串通、偽造、故意遺漏、虛假陳述或凌駕於內部控制之上，未發現因欺詐而導致的重大錯報的風險高於未發現因錯誤而導致的重大錯報的風險；\n- 了解與審計相關的內部控制，以設計適當的審計程序，但目的並非對該集團的內部控制有效性發表意見；\n- 評估金融管理局所採用的會計政策是否適當，其會計估計及相關披露是否合理；\n- 就金融管理局採用持續經營的會計基礎是否適當作出結論，並根據所獲取的審計證據，確定是否存在與可能對該集團持續經營能力造成重大疑慮的事件或情況有關的重大不確定性。如我得出結論認為存在重大不確定性，我有責任在核數師報告中提請注意財務報表中的相關披露，或如該等披露不足，則修改我的意見。我的結論是根據截至我發表核數師報告之日所獲取的審計證據而作出的。然而，未來事件或情況可能導致該集團不再持續經營；\n- 評估財務報表的整體呈現、結構及內容，包括披露，以及財務報表是否以達成公允呈現的方式反映基礎交易及事件；及\n- 取得關於該集團內實體或業務活動的財務資訊的充分及適當審計證據，以對財務報表發表意見。我負責指導、監督及執行集團審計工作。我對我的審計意見負全部責任。\n\n我就審計的計劃範圍和時間安排及重大審計發現等事項，與外匯基金諮詢委員會審計小組委員會進行溝通，包括我在審計期間查明的內部控制任何重大缺陷。\n\n我亦向外匯基金諮詢委員會審計小組委員會提供一份聲明，說明我已遵守有關獨立性的相關道德要求，並與他們溝通所有可能合理地被視為影響我獨立性的關係及其他事項，以及相關保障措施（如適用）。\n\n從與外匯基金諮詢委員會審計小組委員會溝通的事項中，我確定了在本期財務報表審計中最為重要的事項，因此這些事項是主要審計事項。我在核數師報告中描述這些事項，除非法律或法規禁止公開披露該事項，或在極罕見的情況下，我確定不應在報告中溝通該事項，因為這樣做所造成的負面後果可能合理地預期會超過此類溝通的公共利益。\n\n審計署署長　朱乃璋"}

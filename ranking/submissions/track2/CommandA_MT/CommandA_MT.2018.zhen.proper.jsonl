{"zh":"# 總裁報告\n\n2018年是全球金融危機發生十周年，十年間國際政經形勢經歷巨大轉變，當中不乏一幕幕超乎最佳編劇所能想像的場景。我在去年的年報指出，2017年金融市場表現是「喜出望外」，同時提到前景「潛藏隱憂」。回顧2018年，或許可形容為「先喜後悲」。環球多個股票指數在1月創出歷史新高後不久，熾熱的投資情緒旋即遇上中美貿易摩擦的冷鋒，加上英國脫歐談判一直拉鋸、地緣政治惡化、美聯儲四次加息等因素，市場樂觀氣氛急劇逆轉，資產價格在年內大幅下跌。MSCI全球指數從高點至低點曾下跌20.3%，全年累跌約一成，是2008年環球金融危機以來表現最差的一年。恒生指數從高點最多曾下跌26.7%，全年下挫13.6%，錄得七年來最大年度跌幅。\n\n# 聯匯穩健 信心所繫\n\n儘管外圍形勢波動難測，香港金融體系仍然保持穩健，貨幣市場運作暢順無阻。實施三十五年的聯繫匯率制度成功應對了資金流出港元的考驗。自環球金融危機爆發以來，累積約10,000億港元等值的資金流入港元。去年，隨着美國息率上升，港美息差持續擴闊，「沽港元、買美元」套息活動增加，港元兌美元匯率在年初轉弱，2005年制訂的「弱方兌換保證」，自4月首度觸發後，年內再觸發26次。金管局按照既定機制，履行「買港元、沽美元」的弱方兌換保證，有序、透明地在市場承接1,035億港元的港元沽盤。隨着資金流走，一個月香港銀行同業拆息在2018年內累升了105基點，而銀行亦在去年9月美國加息後，上調了最優惠利率。金管局多次和適時通過不同渠道向公眾闡釋「弱方兌換保證」的運作機制，令公眾了解資金流出港元是香港利率正常化的必經過程，也是聯匯制度的正常運作。國際貨幣基金組織在去年年底重申支持香港聯匯制度的立場，特區政府也強調聯匯是香港貨幣穩定的基石。這都有助於穩定香港市民對聯繫匯率的信心。\n\n# 銀行體系 穩中有進\n\n2008年環球金融危機暴露了全球金融系統潛藏的種種弊端及隱患，促使國際間在過去十年協調推出一系列針對金融市場、金融機構的改革，包括在銀行業監管方面，提升企業管治和風險管理。金管局的銀行監管工作重點針對兩方面：一是着眼於銀行資產負債風險的審慎監管，二是銀行的行為操守，二者不可偏廢。資產負債風險監管方面，金管局作為巴塞爾銀行監管委員會(Basel Committee on Banking Supervision)及二十國集團轄下金融穩定理事會(FinancialStability Board)成員，有責任全面落實國際監管標準，確保香港銀行業穩健審慎地經營業務。去年底香港銀行資本充足率達20.3%，不但遠高於國際最低標準要求的8%，也較環球金融危機時的14.7%水平顯著提升。大型銀行去年第四季平均流動覆蓋比率達167.6%，同樣遠高於法定最低要求的90%。與此同時，為避免重蹈環球金融危機時需動用公帑拯救「大得不能倒」金融機構的覆轍，金融穩定理事會制訂了關於金融機構處置機制的國際標準。香港是亞洲區內少數已經全面落實符合機制要求的地區之一，金管局下設的處置機制辦公室正落實該機制的操作細則，要求銀行推行結構性變動令處置預案在需要時能有效實施，去年亦推出了《吸收虧損能力規則》，未來還會陸續推出更多相關規則。\n\n鑑於樓價持續上升，金管局未雨綢繆，在2009至2017年間共推出八輪逆周期措施，確保一旦地產市況逆轉，本港銀行體系有足夠的抗震能力應對衝擊。這些措施成效顯著：新造住宅平均按揭成數由2009年的64%降至2018年底的46%；平均供款與入息比率亦由2010年的41%下調至2018年底的34%。年內銀行信貸錄得4.4%的溫和增長，整體資產質素維持良好，零售銀行不良貸款比率進一步降至0.5%，遠低於國際及本港歷史平均水平。去年銀行業盈利持續增長，整體股東權益回報率連升兩年至13%；多家國際性銀行集團在本港的業務交出了不俗的成績表，成為集團盈利的重要支柱。\n\n# 穩善文化 上行下效\n\n在監管銀行的行為操守方面，金管局在2010年增設銀行操守部，促進銀行公平待客，並加強保障消費者權益。要做到標本兼治，除了訂出各種針對銀行營運基本操守的監管要求外，我們近年來大力推動改革銀行文化，鼓勵銀行循管治、獎勵制度、評估與回饋機制三方面推動穩善文化，務求銀行內部做到上行下效，在根本上恢復、提升客戶對銀行的信任和尊重。繼2017年金管局向全港銀行提供具體的指引，金管局在2018年底進一步推出銀行文化的監管措施，包括要求銀行就企業文化和落實有關措施作出自我評估等，令穩善銀行文化的三大支柱能有效執行。\n\n雖然互聯網和移動金融是全球趨勢，金管局去年仍繼續促進普及金融，照顧未能應用新科技的社群。例如我們連同香港銀行公會推動便利店推出長者透過「易辦事」免購物提款服務，有關便利店網絡已增至逾300家；我們並聯絡香港郵政在7家主要位於離島和新界的郵政局推出長者提款易服務。銀行業界響應金管局的建議，年內積極增加無障礙設施，提供傷健共融的銀行服務，例子之一是設有聲音導航的自動櫃員機數目一年內增加逾十倍至超過700部。另外，在金管局積極推動下，我們預期將會陸續有銀行在偏遠地區開設更多實體分行和增設流動銀行服務，便利市民。\n\n# 智慧銀行 嶄新體驗\n\n金管局與銀行和科技業界緊密合作，在2017年9月啟動「智慧銀行新紀元」，推動香港金融科技發展和創新，為市民帶來嶄新的支付和銀行服務體驗。2018年的亮點，無疑是在9月正式開通的「轉數快」。它是全球獨一無二的零售快速支付系統，打破香港各種電子支付工具和銀行帳戶之間的屏障，讓市民享受全年無休的港元和人民幣即時轉帳服務。金管局還同步推出全球首個「共用二維碼」標準和應用程式，商戶可憑單個二維碼接通多個電子支付系統。「轉數快」推出以來深受市民歡迎，短短半年，登記紀錄已逾258萬個，日均交易量達6萬宗，平均每宗金額分別20,700港元和38,000元人民幣。\n\n去年5月，金管局發出虛擬銀行的認可指引，隨即有33家機構提交虛擬銀行牌照的申請。截至今年四月中，四個牌照已經發出，預期它們將於年內正式投入營運。虛擬銀行有助推動香港金融科技發展和創新，為個人和中小企提供嶄新服務和體驗，並促進普及金融。\n\n此外，金管局在7月發布開放應用程式介面(OpenAPI)框架，銀行將分四階段開放產品和服務的對外接口，開創更靈活、更開放的金融科技環境，讓銀行客戶更便捷地整合帳戶資料、獲取資訊，選取貼合自己需要的服務。年內，共有42項新科技產品使用金管局的金融科技監管沙盒進行測試，當中28項完成試行，有關產品和服務已順利推出市場。\n\n金管局聯同多家銀行研發的「貿易聯動」去年10月正式啟用，這個採用「分布式分類帳技術」的貿易融資平台，將提升銀行審批貿易融資的效率。「貿易聯動」目前正在測試連接其他地區相關平台，以促進跨境貿易融資活動。\n\n金融科技不但廣泛應用於日常生活，近年更走進合規和監管領域。金管局鼓勵銀行運用合規科技(Regtech)協助處理日常營運如監察涉嫌洗錢和恐怖分子資金籌集的可疑活動。與此同時金管局正研究使用監管科技(Suptech)，進一步提升監管工作的效率和成效。\n\n# 金融實力 鞏固提升\n\n國際金融中心之間是軟實力的較量，我們要不斷順應經濟社會和科技發展的變化，把握機遇，不斷為香港金融業開拓新的發展空間。綠色金融就是香港開拓債券和項目融資市場的一個重大機遇。金管局支持和配合特區政府發展綠色金融，除了配合特區政府籌備1,000億港元的政府綠色債券發行計劃，我們去年還舉辦多場綠色金融研討會，包括兩場國際大型會議，以提升市場對綠色金融的認識、了解和參與，並鼓勵發行機構參與政府去年推出的綠色債券資助計劃和香港的綠色金融認證服務。去年在港發行綠色債券規模逾110億美元，相等於2017年的三倍多。\n\n近年來投資界對基建和相關項目興趣日濃。金管局於2016年成立基建融資促進辦公室(IFFO)，合作夥伴至今已倍增至95家機構，成為區內基建融資的重要交流平台。去年金管局與國務院國有資產監督管理委員會（國資委）首次合辦高層圓桌會議，討論香港為中央國有企業「走出去」的獨特優勢和作用，為央企與香港金融、專業服務界日後共拓發展機遇奠下良好基礎。\n","terms":{"10年期美國國庫券收益率":["10-year

Over the past decade, the international political and economic landscape has undergone significant changes, with many events that were beyond the imagination of even the best screenwriters. In last year’s annual report, I described the performance of the financial markets in 2017 as \"pleasantly surprising\", while noting that the outlook was \"fraught with hidden risks\". Looking back at 2018, it could be described as a year that \"started well but ended badly\". Shortly after several global stock indices reached record highs in January, the bullish market sentiment was quickly met with a cold front in the form of US-China trade tensions. Coupled with the protracted Brexit impasse, a deteriorating geopolitical environment and four interest rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve, market optimism reversed sharply and asset prices fell significantly during the year. The MSCI World Index fell by 20.3% from its peak to its trough, with a cumulative decline of about 10% for the year, making it the worst year since the global financial crisis in 2008. The Hang Seng Index fell by as much as 26.7% from its peak, dropping 13.6% for the year and recording its largest annual decline in seven years.\n\n# A robust linked exchange rate system is key to confidence\n\nDespite the unpredictable external environment, Hong Kong’s financial system remains robust and the money market operates smoothly. The Linked Exchange Rate System, which has been in place for 35 years, has successfully withstood the challenge of capital outflows from the Hong Kong dollar. Since the outbreak of the global financial crisis, approximately HK$1 trillion worth of funds have flowed into the Hong Kong dollar. Last year, as US interest rates rose, the interest rate differential between Hong Kong and the US continued to widen, leading to increased interest carry trade activities involving selling Hong Kong dollars and buying US dollars. The Hong Kong dollar weakened against the US dollar at the beginning of the year, and the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking (CU) established in 2005 was triggered for the first time in April, followed by 26 more triggers during the year. The HKMA acted in accordance with established mechanisms, fulfilling the weak-side CU by buying Hong Kong dollars and selling US dollars, and orderly and transparently accepting HK$103.5 billion in Hong Kong dollar sell orders in the market. As funds flowed out, the one-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) rose by 105 basis points in 2018, and banks raised their prime rates after the US interest rate hike in September last year. The HKMA has repeatedly and in a timely manner explained the operation of the weak-side CU to the public through various channels, helping them understand that capital outflows from the Hong Kong dollar are a necessary part of interest rate normalisation in Hong Kong and are a normal function of the linked exchange rate system. The International Monetary Fund reaffirmed its support for Hong Kong’s linked exchange rate system at the end of last year, and the HKSAR government emphasised that the linked exchange rate system is the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary stability. This has helped to stabilise Hong Kong citizens’ confidence in the linked exchange rate system.\n\n# The banking system is stable and making progress\n\nThe global financial crisis in 2008 exposed various flaws and risks in the global financial system, prompting international coordination over the past decade to implement a series of reforms targeting financial markets and institutions, including improvements in corporate governance and risk management in banking supervision. The HKMA’s banking supervision focuses on two aspects: prudential supervision of banks’ asset and liability risks, and banks’ conduct, both of which are equally important. In terms of asset and liability risk supervision, the HKMA, as a member of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the Financial Stability Board under the G20, is responsible for fully implementing international regulatory standards to ensure that Hong Kong’s banking sector operates in a sound and prudent manner. At the end of last year, Hong Kong banks’ capital adequacy ratio reached 20.3%, which is not only significantly higher than the international minimum requirement of 8%, but also a substantial improvement over the 14.7% level during the global financial crisis. The average liquidity coverage ratio of large banks in the fourth quarter of last year was 167.6%, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 90%. Meanwhile, to avoid repeating the mistake of using public money to bail out \"too big to fail\" financial institutions during the global financial crisis, the Financial Stability Board has developed international standards for the resolution of financial institutions. Hong Kong is one of the few regions in Asia that has fully implemented mechanisms that meet these requirements. The HKMA’s Resolution Office is implementing the operational details of this mechanism, requiring banks to make structural changes to ensure that resolution plans can be effectively implemented when needed. Last year, the HKMA also introduced the loss-absorbing capacity (LAC) rules, and more related rules will be introduced in the future.\n\nIn response to rising property prices, the HKMA took proactive measures and introduced eight rounds of countercyclical measures between 2009 and 2017 to ensure that Hong Kong’s banking system has sufficient resilience to withstand shocks if the property market reverses. These measures have been effective: the average loan-to-value ratio for new residential mortgages fell from 64% in 2009 to 46% at the end of 2018; the average debt servicing ratio also fell from 41% in 2010 to 34% at the end of 2018. Bank credit recorded a moderate growth of 4.4% during the year, and overall asset quality remained good, with the classified loan ratio of retail banks falling further to 0.5%, well below international and local historical averages. Last year, the banking sector’s profits continued to grow, with the overall return on equity rising for the second consecutive year to 13%; several international banking groups performed well in Hong Kong, becoming important pillars of their group’s profits.\n\n# A sound culture starts at the top and spreads downwards\n\nIn terms of supervising banks’ conduct, the HKMA established the Banking Conduct Department in 2010 to promote fair treatment of customers by banks and strengthen consumer protection. To address both the symptoms and the root causes, in addition to setting out various regulatory requirements for banks’ basic operational conduct, we have been vigorously promoting bank culture reform in recent years, encouraging banks to promote a sound culture through governance, incentive systems, and assessment and feedback mechanisms, with the aim of restoring and enhancing customers’ trust and respect for banks from the ground up by ensuring that good practices start at the top and spread downwards. Following the HKMA’s provision of specific guidance to all banks in Hong Kong in 2017, the HKMA further introduced supervisory measures for bank culture at the end of 2018, including requiring banks to conduct self-assessments of their corporate culture and the implementation of related measures, to ensure the effective implementation of the three pillars of a sound bank culture.\n\nAlthough internet and mobile financial services are global trends, the HKMA continued to promote financial inclusion last year to serve communities that cannot use new technologies. For example, together with the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB), we promoted a service allowing elderly people to withdraw cash without making a purchase through Electronic Payment Services at convenience stores, and the network of such convenience stores has grown to over 300. We also contacted Hongkong Post to introduce an easy cash withdrawal service for the elderly at seven post offices, mainly located in the Outlying Islands and the New Territories. The banking sector responded to the HKMA’s suggestions by actively increasing barrier-free facilities and providing inclusive banking services during the year. One example is the more than tenfold increase in the number of ATMs with voice navigation to over 700 units within a year. In addition, with the HKMA’s active promotion, we expect more banks to open more physical branches and introduce mobile banking services in remote areas to facilitate citizens.\n\n# Smart banking offers a new experience\n\nThe HKMA worked closely with the banking and technology sectors to launch the \"New Era of Smart Banking\" in September 2017, promoting the development and innovation of fintech in Hong Kong and bringing citizens a new payment and banking experience. The highlight of 2018 was undoubtedly the official launch of the Faster Payment System (FPS) in September. It is a unique global retail payment platform that breaks down barriers between various electronic payment tools and bank accounts in Hong Kong, allowing citizens to enjoy round-the-clock instant transfers of Hong Kong dollars and renminbi. The HKMA also launched the world’s first Common QR Code standard and application, allowing merchants to connect to multiple electronic payment systems with a single QR code. Since its launch, the FPS has been well received by citizens, with over 2.58 million registrations in just six months, an average daily transaction number of 60,000, and an average transaction amount of HK$20,700 and RMB 38,000 respectively.\n\nIn May last year, the HKMA issued the Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks, and 33 institutions immediately applied for virtual bank licences. As of mid-April this year, four licences have been issued, and they are expected to commence operations within the year. Virtual banks will help promote fintech development and innovation in Hong Kong, provide new services and experiences for individuals and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and promote financial inclusion.\n\nIn addition, the HKMA published the Open Application Programming Interface (Open API) framework in July, under which banks will open their product and service endpoints to the outside world in four phases, creating a more flexible and open fintech environment that allows bank customers to integrate account information, obtain information, and select services that suit their needs more conveniently. During the year, a total of 42 new technology products used the HKMA’s Fintech Supervisory Sandbox for testing, of which 28 completed trials, and the related products and services were successfully launched in the market.\n\nThe eTradeConnect, a trade finance platform developed by the HKMA in collaboration with several banks using distributed ledger technology (DLT), was officially launched in October last year. It will improve the efficiency of banks’ trade finance application approval processes. eTradeConnect is currently testing connections with other regional platforms to facilitate cross-border trade finance activities.\n\nFintech is not only widely used in daily life but has also entered the fields of compliance and regulation in recent years. The HKMA encourages banks to use regulatory technology (Regtech) to assist in daily operations, such as monitoring suspicious activities related to money laundering and terrorist financing. At the same time, the HKMA is studying the use of supervisory technology (Suptech) to further improve the efficiency and effectiveness of regulatory work.\n\n# Strengthening and enhancing financial capabilities\n\nThe competition among international financial centres is one of soft power. We need to continuously adapt to changes in the economic, social and technological environment, seize opportunities, and create new development space for Hong Kong’s financial industry. Green finance is a major opportunity for Hong Kong to develop its bond and project finance markets. The HKMA supports and cooperates with the HKSAR government in developing green finance. In addition to assisting the HKSAR government in preparing for the issuance of HK$100 billion in green bonds under the Government Green Bond Programme, we also held several green finance seminars last year, including two large international conferences, to enhance market understanding, awareness and participation in green finance, and to encourage issuing institutions to participate in the Green Bond Grant Scheme and the Green Finance Certification Scheme launched by the government last year. Last year, the scale of green bonds issued in Hong Kong exceeded US$11 billion, more than three times that of 2017.\n\nThe investment community has shown increasing interest in infrastructure projects in recent years. The HKMA established the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO) in 2016, and the number of IFFO partners has doubled to 95 institutions, making it an important platform for infrastructure financing in the region. Last year, the HKMA and the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council (SASAC) co-hosted a high-level roundtable for the first time to discuss Hong Kong’s unique advantages and role in supporting Central State-owned Enterprises (CSoEs) in \"going global\", laying a solid foundation for future cooperation between CSoEs and Hong Kong’s financial and professional services sector."}

{"zh":"# 金管局簡介\n\n香港金融管理局是香港的中央銀行機構，主要職能有4項：在聯繫匯率制度的架構內維持貨幣穩定；促進金融體系（包括銀行體系）的穩定與健全；協助鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位，包括維持與發展香港的金融基建；以及管理外匯基金。\n\n# 金管局的法定授權\n\n立法會（前稱立法局）於1992年通過《外匯基金條例》修訂條文，授權財政司司長（前稱財政司）委任金融管理專員，金管局隨後在1993年4月1日成立。\n\n金融管理專員的權力、職能及責任由《外匯基金條例》、《銀行業條例》、《金融機構（處置機制）條例》、《存款保障計劃條例》、《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》及其他有關條例明文規定。財政司司長與金融管理專員於2003年6月25日的互換函件，列載彼此在貨幣與金融事務方面的職能與責任的分配，亦披露財政司司長將若干權力轉授金融管理專員。有關函件為公開文件，可於金管局網站查閱。\n\n外匯基金根據《外匯基金條例》設立，由財政司司長掌有控制權。該條例規定外匯基金須主要運用於影響港元匯價。財政司司長亦可運用外匯基金以保持香港貨幣金融體系的穩定與健全，藉此保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。\n\n金融管理專員根據《外匯基金條例》委任，以協助財政司司長執行其根據該條例獲授予的職能，以及執行其他條例及財政司司長所指派的職能。金融管理專員的辦公室稱為金管局，金融管理專員即為金管局總裁。\n\n金融管理專員根據《銀行業條例》賦予的職責及權力，規管及監管銀行業務與接受存款業務。根據《銀行業條例》，金融管理專員負責處理香港持牌銀行、有限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司的認可資格事宜。\n\n《金融機構（處置機制）條例》指定金融管理專員為銀行界實體的處置機制當局。該條例賦予金融管理專員一系列權力，對有關實體進行有秩序處置，以減低有關實體不可持續經營對香港金融體系的穩定及有效運作構成的風險。\n\n《證券及期貨條例》及《強制性公積金計劃條例》賦予金融管理專員若干有關銀行證券及強制性公積金業務的權力。\n\n《保險業條例》訂明可就銀行的保險業務向金融管理專員轉授查察及調查權力。\n\n《打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集條例》賦權金融管理專員監管銀行遵守該條例的規定。\n\n《存款保障計劃條例》授予金融管理專員責任，就存款保障計劃的運作提供協助，以及啟動從存款保障計劃基金向無力償付銀行的存款人發放補償。\n\n金融管理專員在《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》的法定架構下，可指定及監察對香港貨幣或金融穩定或對香港發揮作為國際金融中心的功能事關重要的結算及交收系統。該條例亦授權金融管理專員管理儲值支付工具發牌制度，及指定零售支付系統並監察該等系統的運作是否安全及有效率。\n\n# 金管局與香港特別行政區政府\n\n金管局是香港特別行政區政府架構的一部分，但可以按與公務員不同的聘用條款聘請員工，以吸引具適當經驗與專門知識的人才。金管局總裁及其員工均為公職人員。金管局的日常運作，在金融管理專員所獲賦予或轉授的法定權力範圍內高度自主。\n\n財政司司長負責釐定香港的貨幣政策目標及貨幣體制：財政司司長於2003年6月25日致金融管理專員的函件中，訂明應透過貨幣發行局制度維持貨幣穩定，將港元匯率保持在約7.80港元兌1美元的水平。金融管理專員須自行負責達成貨幣政策目標，包括決定有關的策略、工具及執行方式，並負責維持香港貨幣制度的穩定與健全。\n\n財政司司長在財經事務及庫務局局長的協助下，負責維持香港金融體系穩定與健全，以及保持香港的國際金融中心地位的政策。為推行這些政策，金融管理專員的職責包括：\n- 促進銀行體系的整體穩定與有效運作\n- 與其他有關機構與組織合作，發展債務市場\n- 處理與法定紙幣及硬幣的發行及流通有關的事宜\n- 透過發展支付、結算及交收系統，以及在適當情況下負責操作有關系統，促進金融基建的安全與效率\n- 與其他有關機構與組織合作，促進對香港貨幣及金融體系的信心，並推行適當的發展市場措施，以協助加強香港金融服務的國際競爭力。\n\n外匯基金由財政司司長掌有控制權。金融管理專員須根據財政司司長轉授的權力，就外匯基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 問責性與透明度\n\n就日常運作及推行政府政策目標所採用的方法，金管局一直保持高度自主，並同時輔以高問責性及透明度。\n\n金管局致力促進貨幣與銀行體系穩定，有效管理官方儲備，發展與監察穩健及多元化的金融基建，從而鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位，推動香港經濟發展。\n\n金管局要有效履行職責，便必須取得社會人士的信心。因此，金管局以嚴謹的態度，履行向公眾解釋其政策及工作的責任，並盡力處理社會上備受關注而涉及金管局職責範圍的事項。\n\n金融管理專員由財政司司長委任，因此金管局透過財政司司長向公眾負責；而由於金管局的職權由立法會通過的法律制訂，因此金管局亦透過立法會向公眾負責。此外，金管局亦明白本身肩負更廣泛的責任，就是促進公眾對金管局角色及目標的認識，並密切留意社會人士所關注的事項。金管局在執行日常工作及與社會保持廣泛聯繫時，堅守盡力提高透明度及保持開放的政策。這項政策有兩大目標：\n- 在顧及市場敏感性、商業秘密及機密資料披露的法定限制下，盡量使金融界及公眾充分了解金管局的工作；\n- 確保金管局掌握社會脈搏，並對公眾意見作出適當回應。\n\n金管局在透明度方面致力達致國際最高標準，與傳媒保持廣泛聯繫之餘，亦出版各種中英文期刊及專題刊物。金管局的雙語網站(www.hkma.gov.hk)除有專門環節列載經濟研究、統計資料、消費者資訊及其他課題外，還載有金管局出版的刊物、新聞稿、演辭及簡報會資料文件。此外，金管局又利用社交媒體平台，以能在數碼時代中更有效與公眾溝通。金管局辦事處設有資訊中心，分為圖書館及展覽館兩部分，每星期開放6日予公眾參觀及使用。金管局亦舉辦公眾教育活動，透過講座及資訊中心導賞服務，向公眾人士（特別是學生）講解金管局的工作，以及增進市民的金融知識。有關金管局的傳媒聯繫工作、刊物及公眾教育活動的詳細資料，見「機構職能」一章。\n\n金管局公布外匯基金及貨幣發行局帳目資料的次數，一直逐步增加，內容亦越趨詳細。金管局於1999年開始參與國際貨幣基金組織的中央銀行「數據公布特殊標準」計劃。金管局亦公布外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下貨幣發行委員會的會議紀錄，以及貨幣發行局制度運作報告。自1996年起，金管局網站亦載有銀行業監管政策及指引。\n\n金管局與立法會的關係對提高問責性及透明度非常重要。金管局總裁承諾每年3次向立法會財經事務委員會簡報金管局各項工作及政策，並回答有關查詢。此外，金管局代表亦會不時出席立法會財經事務委員會及法案委員會會議，闡釋及商討特別事項，以及協助議員審閱條例草案。\n\n#

外匯基金諮詢委員會\n\n財政司司長行使外匯基金的控制權時，會聽取外匯基金諮詢委員會的意見。外匯基金諮詢委員會根據《外匯基金條例》第3(1)條成立。該項條文訂明財政司司長行使對外匯基金的控制權時，須諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會的意見。財政司司長為外匯基金諮詢委員會的當然主席，其他委員（包括金融管理專員）則以個人身分，由財政司司長根據香港特別行政區行政長官的授權委任。委員因各具專業知識及經驗而獲委任，他們的加入讓外匯基金諮詢委員會廣受裨益。委員的專業知識及經驗涵蓋貨幣、金融、經濟、投資、會計、管理、商業及法律等範疇。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會下設5個專責委員會，負責監察金管局特定環節的工作，並透過外匯基金諮詢委員會向財政司司長報告及提出建議。外匯基金諮詢委員會在2018年共舉行5次會議，討論各項與金管局工作有關的事宜，其中大部分事項均由有關的專責委員會事先進行討論。\n\n管治委員會監察金管局的表現，以及就金管局薪酬與服務條件、人力資源政策、財政預算、行政及管治事務，向外匯基金諮詢委員會提出建議。該委員會在2018年共召開5次會議，內容涵蓋金管局的開支預算、表現評估、年度薪酬檢討及策略性規劃事宜。該委員會亦審議金管局定期提交的工作報告。\n\n審核委員會檢討金管局的財政匯報程序，並評核其內部管控制度是否足夠和有效，以及提交報告。審核委員會負責檢視金管局的財務報表，編製該等報表的組成項目與會計原則，並聯同外部及內部審計師查核其審計範疇與結果。審核委員會各委員在金管局並沒有任何行政職能。該委員會在2018年共召開2次會議，並審議風險委員會及內部審核處的工作報告。\n\n貨幣發行委員會監察貨幣發行局制度的運作，並匯報這個作為香港聯繫匯率制度支柱的情況。該委員會負責確保貨幣發行局制度按照既定政策運作、提出改進該制度的建議，以及確保該制度的運作維持高透明度。金管局定期公布貨幣發行委員會的會議紀錄及提交該委員會的貨幣發行局制度運作報告。該委員會在2018年共召開4次會議。\n","terms":{"10年期美國國庫券收益率":["10-year

core activities: maintaining currency stability within the framework of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS); promoting the stability and integrity of the financial system, including the banking sector; helping to strengthen Hong Kong’s position as an international financial centre (IFC), including maintaining and developing Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure; and managing the Exchange Fund.\n\n# The HKMA’s statutory authority\n\nIn 1992, the Legislative Council (formerly known as the Legislative Bureau) passed amendments to the Exchange Fund Ordinance, authorising the Financial Secretary (formerly known as the Secretary of Finance) to appoint a Chief Executive of the Monetary Authority. The HKMA was subsequently established on 1 April 1993.\n\nThe powers, functions and responsibilities of the Chief Executive of the Monetary Authority are set out in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the Banking Ordinance, the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance, the Deposit Protection Scheme Ordinance, the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, and other relevant ordinances. A letter exchanged between the Financial Secretary and the Chief Executive of the Monetary Authority on 25 June 2003 sets out the allocation of their respective functions and responsibilities in monetary and financial matters. It also discloses that the Financial Secretary has delegated certain powers to the Chief Executive of the Monetary Authority. The letter is a public document and is available on the HKMA website.\n\nThe Exchange Fund was established under the Exchange Fund Ordinance and is controlled by the Financial Secretary. The Ordinance stipulates that the Exchange Fund should be used primarily to influence the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar. The Financial Secretary may also use the Exchange Fund to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial system, thereby preserving Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre.\n\nThe Chief Executive of the Monetary Authority is appointed under the Exchange Fund Ordinance to assist the Financial Secretary in carrying out the functions conferred on him under that Ordinance and to carry out other functions under other ordinances, as well as those assigned by the Financial Secretary. The office of the Chief Executive of the Monetary Authority is known as the HKMA, and the Chief Executive of the Monetary Authority serves as its Chief Executive.\n\nUnder the powers and duties conferred by the Banking Ordinance, the Chief Executive of the Monetary Authority is responsible for regulating and supervising banking business and deposit-taking activities. In accordance with the Banking Ordinance, the Chief Executive of the Monetary Authority is responsible for handling the authorisation of licensed banks, restricted licence banks, and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong.\n\nThe Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance designates the Chief Executive of the Monetary Authority as the resolution authority for banking sector entities. The Ordinance confers a range of powers on the Chief Executive of the Monetary Authority to carry out the orderly resolution of relevant entities, thereby reducing the risk that their unsustainable operation poses to the stability and effective functioning of Hong Kong’s financial system.\n\nThe Securities and Futures Ordinance and the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Ordinance confer certain powers on the Chief Executive of the Monetary Authority in relation to banks’ securities and mandatory provident fund businesses.\n\nThe Insurance Ordinance provides that inspection and investigation powers may be delegated to the Chief Executive of the Monetary Authority in relation to banks’ insurance activities.\n\nThe Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (AML\/CFT) Ordinance empowers the Chief Executive of the Monetary Authority to supervise banks’ compliance with its provisions.\n\nThe Deposit Protection Scheme Ordinance confers on the Chief Executive of the Monetary Authority the responsibility to provide assistance in the operation of the Deposit Protection Scheme and to initiate the payment of compensation from the Deposit Protection Scheme Fund to depositors of insolvent banks.\n\nUnder the statutory framework of the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, the Chief Executive of the Monetary Authority may designate and oversee clearing and settlement systems that are critical to Hong Kong’s currency or financial stability, or to its role as an international financial centre. The Ordinance also empowers the Chief Executive of the Monetary Authority to administer the licensing regime for stored value facilities (SVFs), designate retail payment systems (RPSs), and monitor whether such systems operate safely and efficiently.\n\n# The HKMA and the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region\n\nThe HKMA is part of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region but may employ staff on terms different from those of the civil service to attract individuals with appropriate experience and expertise. The Chief Executive of the HKMA and its staff are public officers. The HKMA’s day-to-day operations are highly autonomous within the scope of the statutory powers conferred on or delegated to the Chief Executive of the Monetary Authority.\n\nThe Financial Secretary is responsible for determining Hong Kong’s monetary policy objectives and monetary regime. In a letter to the Chief Executive of the Monetary Authority dated 25 June 2003, the Financial Secretary stipulated that currency stability should be maintained through the Currency Board system, keeping the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate at around 7.80 to 1 USD. The Chief Executive of the Monetary Authority is responsible for achieving these monetary policy objectives independently, including determining the relevant strategies, tools, and implementation methods, and for maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary system.\n\nThe Financial Secretary, assisted by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, is responsible for policies aimed at maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s financial system and upholding its status as an international financial centre. To implement these policies, the Chief Executive of the Monetary Authority has the following responsibilities:  \n- Promoting the overall stability and effective operation of the banking system;\n- Cooperating with other relevant institutions and organisations to develop the debt market;\n- Handling matters related to the issuance and circulation of legal tender notes and coins;\n- Promoting the safety and efficiency of financial infrastructure by developing payment, clearing, and settlement systems and operating such systems where appropriate;\n- Cooperating with other relevant institutions and organisations to promote confidence in Hong Kong’s currency and financial system and implementing appropriate market development measures to enhance the international competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial services.\n\nThe Exchange Fund is controlled by the Financial Secretary. The Chief Executive of the Monetary Authority is accountable to the Financial Secretary for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund under the powers delegated by the Financial Secretary.\n\n# Accountability and transparency\n\nThe HKMA maintains a high degree of autonomy in its day-to-day operations and in implementing government policy objectives, while upholding strong accountability and transparency.\n\nThe HKMA is committed to promoting the stability of the monetary and banking systems, effectively managing official reserves, and developing and monitoring robust and diversified financial infrastructure. This helps to consolidate Hong Kong’s position as an international financial centre and foster its economic development.\n\nFor the HKMA to perform its duties effectively, it must gain the confidence of the community. Therefore, the HKMA takes a rigorous approach to fulfilling its responsibility to explain its policies and work to the public and strives to address matters of public concern that fall within its remit.\n\nAs the Chief Executive of the Monetary Authority is appointed by the Financial Secretary, the HKMA is accountable to the public through the Financial Secretary. Additionally, since the HKMA’s powers are established by laws passed by the Legislative Council, it is also accountable to the public through this body. Furthermore, the HKMA recognises its broader responsibility to promote public understanding of its role and objectives and to remain attentive to matters of public concern. In conducting its daily operations and maintaining broad contact with the community, the HKMA adheres to a policy aimed at enhancing transparency and maintaining openness. This policy has two main goals:\n- To enable the financial sector and the public to understand the HKMA’s work as fully as possible, subject to market sensitivities, commercial confidentiality, and statutory restrictions on disclosing confidential information;\n- To ensure that the HKMA remains in touch with the community and responds appropriately to public opinion.\n\nThe HKMA strives to meet the highest international standards of transparency. It maintains extensive contact with the media and publishes a variety of journals and special publications in both Chinese and English. The HKMA’s bilingual website (www.hkma.gov.hk) features dedicated sections on economic research, statistics, consumer information, and other topics. It also hosts publications issued by the HKMA, press releases, speeches, and briefing papers. Additionally, the HKMA uses social media platforms to communicate more effectively with the public in the digital age. The HKMA’s office includes an Information Centre with a library and exhibition hall, open to the public six days a week for visits and use. The HKMA also organises public education programmes, using lectures and guided tours of the Information Centre to explain its work to the public—especially students—and to enhance citizens’ financial knowledge. Details of the HKMA’s media liaison work, publications, and public education activities are outlined in the chapter on “Institutional Functions”.\n\nThe HKMA has progressively increased the frequency and detail of its disclosures regarding the Exchange Fund and Currency Board Accounts. In 1999, it began participating in the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard project for central banks. The HKMA also publishes the meeting minutes of the Currency Board Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC), as well as reports on the operation of the Currency Board system. Since 1996, the HKMA website has included supervisory policies and guidelines on banking.\n\nThe relationship between the HKMA and the Legislative Council is crucial for enhancing accountability and transparency. The Chief Executive of the HKMA has committed to briefing the Legislative Council’s Panel on Financial Affairs three times a year on the HKMA’s work and policies and to answering related questions. Additionally, HKMA representatives occasionally attend meetings of the Legislative Council’s Panel on Financial Affairs and Bills Committee to explain and discuss specific matters and assist members in reviewing draft ordinances.\n\n# Advisory committees and other committees\n\n# Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\n\nWhen exercising control over the Exchange Fund, the Financial Secretary consults the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC). EFAC was established under section 3(1) of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, which requires the Financial Secretary to consult it when exercising control over the Exchange Fund. The Financial Secretary serves as EFAC’s ex officio chairman, while other members—including the Chief Executive of the Monetary Authority—are appointed in a personal capacity by the Financial Secretary, with authorisation from the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. Members are selected for their professional knowledge and experience, which greatly benefits EFAC. Their expertise spans currency, finance, economics, investment, accounting, management, business, and law.\n\nEFAC has five sub-committees responsible for monitoring specific aspects of the HKMA’s work and reporting to the Financial Secretary through EFAC, along with making recommendations. In 2018, EFAC held five meetings to discuss matters related to the HKMA’s work, most of which had been discussed in advance by the relevant sub-committees.\n\nThe Governance Sub-Committee (GSC) monitors the HKMA’s performance and advises EFAC on the HKMA’s remuneration, conditions of service, human resources policies, budgetary matters, administration, and governance. In 2018, the GSC held five meetings covering the HKMA’s expenditure budget, performance appraisal, annual pay review, and strategic planning. It also reviewed regular work reports submitted by the HKMA.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee reviews the HKMA’s financial reporting procedures and assesses whether its internal control systems are adequate and effective, submitting reports as necessary. It is responsible for reviewing the HKMA’s financial statements, the components and accounting principles used in preparing them, and auditing their scope and results alongside external and internal auditors. Members of the Audit Sub-Committee have no administrative functions within the HKMA. In 2018, the Committee held two meetings and reviewed work reports from the Risk Committee and the Internal Audit Division.\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee monitors the operation of the Currency Board system and reports on its role as a pillar of Hong Kong’s Linked Exchange Rate System. It ensures that the Currency Board system operates in accordance with established policies, makes recommendations for improving the system, and maintains its operational transparency. The HKMA regularly publishes the Sub-Committee’s meeting minutes and reports on Currency Board operations submitted to it. In 2018, the Sub-Committee held four meetings."}
{"zh":"# 經濟及金融環境\n\n2018年香港經濟持續擴張，不過隨着金融狀況收緊及貿易保護主義升溫令不明朗因素增加，增長動力於年內有所減弱。隨着全球經濟增長轉弱，預期2019年香港經濟增長亦會減慢。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 實體經濟活動\n\n2018年香港經濟進一步擴張，不過按年增長速度由第1季的4.6%，逐步減慢至第4季的1.3%（表1），並拖累全年增長率由2017年的3.8%下降至3.0%。經濟擴張轉弱，反映本地需求增長減慢以及經濟持續受淨出口所拖累（圖1）。本地方面，私人消費在第1季強勁增長，但其後增長動力減弱，部分反映貿易保護主義升溫令不明朗因素增加，以及本地資產價格調整帶來的財富減值效應。由於營商信心脆弱，整體投資支出的增長速度亦放緩。外圍方面，貨品出口於首3季大致保持平穩，但在第4季隨着中美貿易摩擦加劇而顯著轉差。貨品進口亦因為出口帶動的需求轉弱而放緩。相比之下，服務輸出錄得較快的全年增長，部分是受惠於訪港旅遊業表現蓬勃，而服務輸入則由於運輸、商業及其他服務增長而得以大致維持增長動力。按淨額計，貿易差額由2017年的順差轉為2018年的小幅逆差，並拖累本地經濟增長。\n\n表1 按開支項目計的實質本地生產總值增長（比對上期）\n\n註：本地固定資本形成總額經季節因素調整的按季增減幅度不詳。\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n圖1 組成部分對實質本地生產總值增長的貢獻\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 貨幣狀況\n\n主要受到港元與美元負息差下的套息活動所影響，港元兌美元匯率在2018年大致回軟。尤其弱方兌換保證在4月、5月及8月被觸發，促使金管局按照聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）所定，在7.85港元兌1美元的水平，向銀行購入港元及沽出美元。按照聯匯制度的設計，港元貨幣基礎因而收縮，表示銀行同業流動性減少，再加上市場預期美國加息，導致港元銀行同業拆息整體上升。由於銀行體系資金成本上升，銀行於9月下旬在美國聯邦基金利率目標區間上調後，調高最優惠貸款利率12.5至25基點。信貸增長方面，部分由於本地經濟增長放緩以及對外貿易表現轉弱，整體銀行貸款的增幅由2017年的16.1%，顯著減慢至2018年的4.4%。\n\n# 通脹\n\n通脹壓力於2018年略為增加。剔除政府一次性紓緩措施的影響後，基本通脹率由2017年的1.7%低位，升至2018年的2.6%，不過仍屬於溫和水平。當中的住屋租金組成項目增幅較快，反映較早前新簽訂私人住宅租金上升的影響（圖2）。更廣泛的分析顯示，名義勞工成本及商用物業租金增長略為加快，令本地成本壓力更趨明顯。隨着香港部分主要進口來源地通脹上升，進口價格通脹亦因而攀升。\n\n圖2 基本消費物價通脹\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 勞工市場\n\n勞工市場狀況在2018年保持穩健（圖3）。失業率由2017年全年的3.1%下降至2018年的2.8%，是自1997年以來的最低水平。當中大部分主要服務行業的失業率都有所回落，特別是住宿及膳食服務業的跌幅更為顯著。隨着總就業人數及私營機構職位空缺進一步增加，整體勞工需求持續增強，而且勞動人口參與率亦輕微上升。在勞工市場狀況趨緊下，實質工資及收入進一步增加。\n\n圖3 勞工市場狀況\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 股市\n\n香港股市走勢在2018年大幅逆轉。恒生指數在2017年強勁的上升動力帶動下，於2018年1月升上33,484點的歷史高位（圖4）。然而，隨着主要中央銀行收緊貨幣政策、中美貿易摩擦加劇及本地經濟增長放緩引起投資者的憂慮，市場的樂觀情緒急劇逆轉。恒生指數在10月下挫至24,586點的低位，在年底則收報25,846點，較一年前下跌13.6%。然而，平均每日成交額則由2017年的882億港元上升至1,074億港元，本港首次公開招股集資總額亦因數間從事新興及創科產業的企業上市而大幅增加。\n\n圖4 資產價格\n資料來源：差餉物業估價署及香港交易及結算所有限公司。\n\n# 物業市場\n\n住宅物業市場在2018年上半年保持暢旺，不過在下半年隨着中美貿易摩擦加劇、環球股市調整及本港最優惠利率上升而有所降溫。整體樓價在7月至12月期間由高位回落9%，然而全年計仍錄得2%的升幅（圖4）。由於一手及二手市場的買賣活動於下半年顯著減少，所以物業成交量在2018年亦較前一年下跌7%至57,247宗。此外，置業負擔能力仍然偏緊，樓價與收入比率以及收入槓桿比率分別為17.0及75.7，兩者均遠高於長期平均水平。另一方面，非住宅物業價格在2018年整體上升，惟接近年底時稍見回落。全年計，價格及租金均進一步上升，租金回報率則維持在低位。\n\n# 經濟前景\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n由於全球經濟增長放緩，預期2019年香港經濟增長將會減慢。尤其外圍環境充滿挑戰，預期香港出口表現仍會受壓。本地方面，雖然失業率低企及家庭收入增加將繼續支撐私人消費，但部分由於消費信心減弱及較早前的資產價格調整帶來的財富減值效應的影響，預期私人消費增長步伐會放緩。固定資本形成方面，雖然隨着房屋供應增加，樓宇及建造活動應會穩步增長，但面對經濟不明朗因素增加，企業對於資本投資可能會變得更為審慎。政府預測2019年實質本地生產總值增長率介乎2至3%之間，私營機構分析員的最新預測增幅則平均為2.3%。\n\n# 通脹及勞工市場\n\n由於包括香港在內的全球增長放緩，外圍物價及本地成本壓力或會得到紓緩，因此預期通脹壓力在2019年仍保持溫和。近期新簽訂住宅租金回落，亦會對通脹產生壓抑作用。市場共識預測2019年整體通脹率為2.2%，政府預期基本通脹率則為2.5%。預期在經濟持續增長及訪港旅遊業維持暢旺下，勞工市場狀況會繼續偏緊。私營機構分析員預計失業率於2019年會維持於約3%的水平。\n\n# 不明朗因素及風險\n\n2019年經濟前景受貿易摩擦、美國貨幣政策未來方向、內地經濟表現、英國脫歐及其他地緣政治局勢等不明朗因素及風險所影響。另外，一旦上述的不明朗因素加劇並長期持續，金融市場情緒及營商信心或會大受影響，對本地資產市場及實體經濟活動構成下行壓力。\n\n另外，住宅物業市場受眾多外圍及本地因素所影響，其前景並不明朗。外圍方面，中美貿易摩擦的不確定性將有可能影響市場情緒、經濟前景及金融狀況，使香港物業市場前景繼續蒙上陰影。本地方面，雖然經濟增長放緩，但就業情況及收入增長仍大致穩定，或可支持住宅物業需求。本港利率的走勢某程度上視乎美國未來的政策利率變動，惟後者走勢並不明確。長遠而言，由於過去幾年住宅落成量有所增加，加上政府致力增加土地及房屋供應，預期房屋供求缺口或會收窄。\n\n# 銀行體系表現\n\n儘管外圍不利因素增加，例如中美貿易衝突、英國脫歐及利率正常化，令金融市場波動加劇，香港銀行體系在2018年仍然穩健。銀行體系的資本及流動性狀況穩健，資產質素保持良好。利率趨升令息差擴闊，刺激銀行盈利顯著增加。\n\n# 資產負債表走勢\n\n2018年銀行體系繼續穩步增長，資產負債表擴大5.9%。面對經濟不明朗因素持續，例如主要經濟體之間的貿易衝突及加息等，企業在獲取新貸款方面變得較為保守。年內貸款總額增幅放緩至4.4%，而2017年為16.1%。有關增長受在香港使用的貸款（+6.5%）及在香港境外使用的貸款（+2%）同告增加帶動。另一方面，由於環球貿易環境不明朗，貿易融資下跌7.6%。中國內地相關貸款的增長亦由2017年的17.5%放緩至2018年的1.4%。\n\n銀行體系持有的債務證券總額在2018年底繼續佔總資產的22%，與2017年一樣。由於這些債務證券大部分為政府及銀行發行的投資級別債務證券，因此有關信用風險維持在低水平。\n\n就負債方而言，存款總額在2018年增加5%，較2017年（+8.7%）的增幅小。由於預期美國持續加息，部分銀行上調定期存款利率，吸引存戶將往來及儲蓄存款轉為定期存款，從而鎖定資金。往來及儲蓄存款佔存款總額的比例由對上一年的57.4%，降至2018年底的51.4%，導致資金成本上升。由於存款總額的增長較貸款總額快，整體貸存比率由2017年底的73%稍降至2018年底的72.6%（圖5）。\n\n圖5 銀行體系的貸款及存款\n\n# 資本充足水平\n\n銀行體系資本相當充裕，表示其具備強大緩衝以抵禦潛在衝擊。資本比率處於自實施《巴塞爾協定三》以來的歷史高位；本地註冊認可機構的綜合總資本比率由2017年底的19.1%，增加至2018年底的20.3%（圖6）。\n\n圖6 本地註冊認可機構的綜合資本比率\n\n《巴塞爾協定三》槓桿比率於2018年1月1日生效；該比率是一項非風險為本規定，旨在限制銀行體系過度累積槓桿。於2018年底，槓桿比率為8.0%，遠高於3%的法定最低要求（圖7）。\n\n圖7 本地註冊認可機構的綜合槓桿比率\n\n# 流動性狀況\n\n銀行體系的流動性狀況維持穩健，反映其具備強大能力，可有效承受來自潛在金融及經濟壓力的衝擊。短期流動性（涵蓋1個月期資金）方面，第1類機構的平均流動性覆蓋比率在第4季為167.6%，遠高於2018年適用的90%法定最低要求。第2類機構的平均流動性維持比率為54.3%，亦遠高於25%的法定最低要求（圖8）。\n","terms":{"10年期美國國庫券收益率":["10-year

However, growth momentum weakened over the year as tightening financial conditions and rising trade protectionism increased uncertainty. With global economic growth slowing, Hong Kong’s economic growth is expected to weaken in 2019.\n\n# Economic Review\n\n# Real Economic Activity\n\nHong Kong’s economy continued to expand in 2018, but year-on-year growth slowed from 4.6% in the first quarter to 1.3% in the fourth quarter (Table 1), dragging the full-year growth rate down from 3.8% in 2017 to 3.0%. This weakening of economic expansion reflected slower growth in domestic demand and the continued drag on the economy from net exports (Chart 1). Locally, private consumption grew strongly in the first quarter, but growth weakened thereafter, partly reflecting increased uncertainty due to rising trade protectionism and the wealth depreciation effect brought about by local asset price adjustments. Overall investment spending growth also slowed due to fragile business confidence. Externally, goods exports were broadly stable in the first three quarters, but deteriorated significantly in the fourth quarter as US-China trade tensions escalated. Imports of goods also slowed due to weakening export-driven demand. In contrast, exports of services recorded faster growth for the year as a whole, partly benefiting from the robust performance of inbound tourism, while imports of services maintained growth momentum largely due to growth in transport, business and other services. In net terms, the trade balance shifted from a surplus in 2017 to a small deficit in 2018, dragging down local economic growth.\n\nTable 1 Real GDP growth by expenditure component (compared with previous period)\n\nNote: The seasonally adjusted quarter-on-quarter growth rate of total local fixed capital formation is not available.\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\nChart 1 Contribution of components to real GDP growth\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Monetary Conditions\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate against the US dollar weakened broadly in 2018, mainly due to interest arbitrage activities under the negative interest rate differential between the two currencies. In particular, the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking (CU) was triggered in April, May and August, prompting the HKMA to buy Hong Kong dollars and sell US dollars against banks at the level of 7.85 Hong Kong dollars to 1 US dollar, as stipulated under the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS). Under the design of the LERS, the Hong Kong dollar monetary base contracted, indicating a decrease in interbank liquidity. Coupled with market expectations of US interest rate hikes, overall Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates rose. As funding costs in the banking system increased, banks raised their best lending rates by 12.5 to 25 basis points in late September after the target range for the US federal funds rate was raised. In terms of credit growth, partly due to slower local economic growth and weaker external trade performance, overall bank loan growth slowed significantly from 16.1% in 2017 to 4.4% in 2018.\n\n# Inflation\n\nInflationary pressures increased slightly in 2018. Excluding the effect of the government’s one-off relief measures, the underlying inflation rate rose from a low of 1.7% in 2017 to 2.6% in 2018, but remained moderate. Among these, the housing component increased more rapidly, reflecting the impact of earlier rises in fresh-letting private residential rentals (Chart 2). A broader analysis showed that nominal labour costs and commercial rentals grew slightly faster, making local cost pressures more evident. As inflation rose in some of Hong Kong’s major import sources, import price inflation also climbed.\n\nChart 2 Underlying consumer price inflation\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Labour Market\n\nLabour market conditions remained strong in 2018 (Chart 3). The unemployment rate fell from 3.1% for the whole of 2017 to 2.8% in 2018, the lowest level since 1997. Unemployment rates fell in most major service sectors, particularly in the accommodation and food services sector, where the decline was more significant. As total employment and private-sector vacancies continued to increase, overall labour demand remained strong, and the labour force participation rate also rose slightly. With tighter labour market conditions, real wages and income increased further.\n\nChart 3 Labour market conditions\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Stock Market\n\nHong Kong’s stock market saw a significant reversal in 2018. Buoyed by strong upward momentum in 2017, the Hang Seng Index rose to a historical high of 33,484 in January 2018 (Chart 4). However, investor sentiment reversed sharply as major central banks tightened monetary policy, US-China trade tensions escalated and local economic growth slowed. The Hang Seng Index fell to a low of 24,586 in October and closed at 25,846 at the end of the year, down 13.6% from a year earlier. However, average daily turnover increased from HK$88.2 billion in 2017 to HK$107.4 billion, and total funds raised from initial public offerings in Hong Kong increased significantly as a number of companies engaged in emerging and innovative sectors were listed.\n\nChart 4 Asset prices\nSource: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\n\n# Property Market\n\nThe residential property market remained buoyant in the first half of 2018, but cooled in the second half as US-China trade tensions escalated, global stock markets adjusted and Hong Kong’s prime rates rose. Overall property prices fell 9% from their peak between July and December, but still recorded a 2% increase for the year as a whole (Chart 4). As buying and selling activities in both the primary and secondary markets declined significantly in the second half of the year, property transaction volume in 2018 also fell by 7% from the previous year to 57,247. In addition, housing affordability remained tight, with the price-to-income ratio and the income-gearing ratio standing at 17.0 and 75.7 respectively, both well above their long-term averages. On the other hand, non-residential property prices rose overall in 2018, but fell slightly towards the end of the year. For the year as a whole, both prices and rents increased further, while rental yields remained low.\n\n# Economic Prospects\n\n# Economic Environment\n\nHong Kong’s economic growth is expected to slow in 2019 as global economic growth weakens. In particular, the external environment is challenging, and Hong Kong’s export performance is expected to remain under pressure. Locally, although low unemployment and rising household income will continue to support private consumption, growth in private consumption is expected to slow, partly due to weakening consumer confidence and the wealth depreciation effect brought about by earlier asset price adjustments. In terms of fixed capital formation, while building and construction activities should grow steadily with increasing housing supply, businesses may become more cautious about capital investments in the face of increased economic uncertainty. The government forecasts that real GDP growth in 2019 will be in the range of 2% to 3%, while private-sector analysts’ latest forecast for growth is 2.3% on average.\n\n# Inflation and the Labour Market\n\nAs global growth slows, including in Hong Kong, external price pressures and local cost pressures may ease, and inflationary pressures are expected to remain moderate in 2019. The recent decline in fresh-letting residential rentals will also have a suppressing effect on inflation. Market consensus predicts that the headline inflation rate in 2019 will be 2.2%, while the government expects the underlying inflation rate to be 2.5%. With continued economic growth and a buoyant inbound tourism sector, labour market conditions are expected to remain tight. Private-sector analysts expect the unemployment rate to remain at around 3% in 2019.\n\n# Uncertainties and Risks\n\nThe economic outlook for 2019 is subject to uncertainties and risks related to trade frictions, the future direction of US monetary policy, mainland economic performance, Brexit and other geopolitical situations. Furthermore, if these uncertainties intensify and persist for a long time, financial market sentiment and business confidence could be severely affected, putting downward pressure on local asset markets and real economic activity.\n\nIn addition, the outlook for the residential property market is uncertain, as it is affected by numerous external and local factors. Externally, the uncertainty of US-China trade tensions could affect market sentiment, economic prospects and financial conditions, continuing to cast a shadow over Hong Kong’s property market outlook. Locally, although economic growth is slowing, employment and income growth remain broadly stable, which could support residential property demand. Hong Kong’s interest rate trend depends to some extent on future changes in US policy rates, but the latter’s trend is unclear. In the long run, as flat completions have increased over the past few years and the government is committed to increasing land and housing supply, the supply-demand gap for housing is expected to narrow.\n\n# Performance of the Banking Sector\n\nDespite increased external headwinds, such as the US-China trade conflict, Brexit and interest rate normalisation, which have intensified financial market volatility, Hong Kong’s banking sector remained robust in 2018. The banking sector’s capital and liquidity positions were solid, and asset quality remained sound. Rising interest rates widened interest rate spreads, stimulating a significant increase in bank profits.\n\n# Balance Sheet Trends\n\nThe banking sector continued to grow steadily in 2018, with a 5.9% expansion in the balance sheet. Faced with continued economic uncertainty, such as trade conflicts and interest rate hikes among major economies, businesses became more conservative in obtaining new loans. Total loan growth slowed to 4.4% during the year, compared with 16.1% in 2017. The growth was driven by increases in both loans for use in Hong Kong (+6.5%) and loans for use outside Hong Kong (+2%). On the other hand, trade finance fell by 7.6% due to uncertain global trade conditions. Growth in mainland-related lending also slowed from 17.5% in 2017 to 1.4% in 2018.\n\nThe total amount of debt securities held by the banking sector continued to account for 22% of total assets at the end of 2018, the same as in 2017. As most of these debt securities are investment-grade debt securities issued by governments and banks, the associated credit risk remains low.\n\nOn the liabilities side, total deposits increased by 5% in 2018, a smaller increase than in 2017 (+8.7%). In anticipation of continued US interest rate hikes, some banks raised time deposit rates to attract depositors to convert current and savings account deposits into time deposits to lock in funds. The proportion of current and savings account deposits to total deposits fell from 57.4% in the previous year to 51.4% at the end of 2018, leading to higher funding costs. As deposit growth outpaced loan growth, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio fell slightly from 73% at the end of 2017 to 72.6% at the end of 2018 (Chart 5).\n\nChart 5 Loans and deposits of the banking sector\n\n# Capital Adequacy\n\nThe banking sector’s capital is highly adequate, indicating that it has a strong buffer to withstand potential shocks. Capital ratios are at a historical high since the implementation of Basel III; the consolidated total capital ratio of locally incorporated authorised institutions increased from 19.1% at the end of 2017 to 20.3% at the end of 2018 (Chart 6).\n\nChart 6 Consolidated capital ratio of locally incorporated authorised institutions\n\nThe Basel III leverage ratio took effect on 1 January 2018; it is a non-risk-based requirement aimed at limiting excessive leverage accumulation in the banking sector. At the end of 2018, the leverage ratio was 8.0%, well above the statutory minimum requirement of 3% (Chart 7).\n\nChart 7 Consolidated leverage ratio of locally incorporated authorised institutions\n\n# Liquidity\n\nThe banking sector’s liquidity position remained strong, reflecting its ability to withstand shocks from potential financial and economic pressures. In terms of short-term liquidity (covering funds for one month), the average liquidity coverage ratio of category 1 institutions was 167.6% in the fourth quarter, well above the statutory minimum requirement of 90% applicable in 2018. The average liquidity maintenance ratio of category 2 institutions was 54.3%, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 25% (Chart 8)."}
{"zh":"# 貨幣穩定\n\n2018年港元利率普遍上升，而港元現貨匯率則回軟，並貼近弱方兌換保證匯率的水平。儘管如此，港元外匯及貨幣市場運作仍然暢順有序。聯繫匯率制度是香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石，並繼續展現其承受強大衝擊的能力。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的主要目標是維持貨幣穩定，即確保港元匯價穩定，使港元在外匯市場兌美元的匯率保持在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的區間內。該貨幣體制主要採用貨幣發行局制度，規定由外匯基金所持的美元儲備向貨幣基礎提供最少百分之百的支持；貨幣基礎若有變動，美元儲備亦必須作出相應增減，與貨幣基礎的變動百分之百配合。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n- 負債證明書（為3間發鈔銀行發行的銀行紙幣提供十足支持）\n- 政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣\n- 銀行在金管局所持結算戶口的結餘總額（即總結餘）\n- 金管局代表政府發行的外匯基金票據及債券。\n\n金管局透過自動利率調節機制及履行兌換保證的堅決承諾來維持港元匯率的穩定。若市場對港元的需求大過供應，令市場匯率轉強至7.75港元兌1美元的強方兌換保證匯率，金管局會向銀行沽出港元、買入美元，使總結餘增加及港元利率下跌，從而令港元匯率從強方兌換保證匯率水平回復至7.75到7.85的兌換範圍內。相反，若港元供過於求，令市場匯率轉弱至7.85港元兌1美元的弱方兌換保證匯率，金管局會向銀行買入港元，使總結餘減少及推高港元利率，港元匯率隨之由弱方兌換保證匯率水平回復至兌換範圍內。\n\n# 2018年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n在港元與美元負息差擴闊帶動套息活動的背景下，港元匯率自年初以來逐步轉弱。於4月12日，弱方兌換保證在2005年訂於7.85水平以來首度被觸發。全年計，弱方兌換保證在2018年合共被觸發27次，分別在4月被觸發13次，5月6次，以及8月8次。儘管如此，港元交易仍然暢順有序，港元匯率於4月中至9月中在弱方兌換保證匯率7.85附近徘徊（圖1）。其後港元匯率略為轉強，部分反映假期、季結及年結臨近，銀行同業流動性收緊，帶動部分套息交易平倉。同時，某程度上港元亦受到11月初股市氣氛好轉支持。整體而言，港元外匯市場在2018年全年正常運作。\n\n圖1 2018年市場匯率\n\n由於弱方兌換保證被觸發，總結餘與未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額由2017年底的12,268億港元，下降至2018年底的11,362億港元（圖2）。年內，金管局按照聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）的設計，應銀行要求於弱方兌換保證匯率7.85的水平，購入合共1,035億港元，總結餘因而由2017年底的1,798億港元下降至2018年底的764億港元。年內未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額沒有明顯變動。貨幣基礎仍然由外匯儲備提供十足支持。\n\n於2018年底，總結餘與未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額為11,362億港元。\n\n圖2 2018年總結餘及未償還外匯基金票據及債券\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n由於觸發弱方兌換保證後銀行同業流動性減少，以及市場預期美國加息，香港銀行同業拆息在2018年內普遍上升。受新股集資活動相關的資金需求增加及季節性流動資金需求帶動，短期銀行同業拆息更出現較大波幅（圖3）。整體而言，短期銀行同業拆息在2018年大致維持在低於基本利率的水平。鑑於銀行體系資金成本上升，在9月下旬美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍上調後，銀行調高最優惠貸款利率12.5至25基點。\n\n因應年內美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍4次合共上調100基點，由1.25至1.50厘上調至2.25至2.50厘，基本利率於3月22日、6月14日、9月27日及12月20日合共上調100基點，由1.75厘上調至2.75厘。基本利率的調整是按照2009年3月26日宣布的經修訂計算公式作出。按照該公式，基本利率定於美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍下限加50基點的水平，或隔夜與1個月香港銀行同業拆息的5天移動平均數的平均值水平，以兩者中較高者為準。\n\n圖3 2018年香港銀行同業拆息\n\n港元遠期匯率折讓在首4個月擴大，大致跟隨港元與美元息差的走勢，其中12個月港元遠期匯率點子在4月中達到負620點子（圖4）。其後隨着港元與美元的負息差收窄，港元遠期匯率折讓略為縮小，然後在第4季再度擴大。整體而言，香港貨幣市場繼續正常運作。貼現窗借貸由2017年的103億港元增至2018年的402億港元。\n\n圖4 2018年美元兌港元遠期匯率點子\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n聯匯制度自1983年實施以來，直是維持香港貨幣及金融穩定的重要基石；並在多次區內以至全球金融危機考驗下，展現其承受強大衝擊的能力。由於港元轉弱，作為聯匯制度設計一部分的弱方兌換保證於4月、5月及8月被多次觸發。資金流出港元，是香港利率正常化的必經過程，亦是聯匯制度下的正常運作。為增進各界對有關操作及聯匯制度機制的了解，金管局致力向公眾闡釋聯匯制度的技術細節，並展示香港金融體系應對衝擊的能力。政府亦堅決維持聯匯制度。外匯及貨幣市場保持穩定，進一步鞏固公眾對政府的承擔，以及港元作為支付及保值貨幣的信心。國際貨幣基金組織在與香港進行2018年第四條磋商時，重申對聯匯制度的支持，並指出聯匯制度仍然是最適合香港的貨幣制度，是維持穩定的支柱，有助確保經濟持續增長、維持競爭力及促進龐大的金融服務業暢順運作。\n\n鑑於穩健的銀行體系對聯匯制度的正常運作具關鍵作用，金管局繼續密切監察銀行的信用、流動性及利率風險管理，以及壓力測試結果，並維持對銀行的企業、物業相關及內地相關貸款的監管，以確保銀行體系具備承受衝擊的能力。銀行持有大量外匯基金票據及債券，可經貼現窗用作換取港元流動資金，為利率大幅波動的情況提供有效緩衝。金管局隨時準備透過調整外匯基金票據及債券的發行量以提供額外流動性，以應對資金可能急劇流出港元的情況。金管局亦提醒市民審慎管理市場及利率風險，並為可能出現的市場波動作好準備。\n\n為提高貨幣發行局帳目的透明度，自1998年10月起，外匯基金已有部分資產被指定用作支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（即支持資產相對貨幣基礎的比率）於2018年在107.8至109.9%之間上落，並無觸及上限或下限。該比率於12月31日為109.9%（圖5）。在聯匯制度下，雖然已指定某些外匯基金資產作為支持組合，但外匯基金的全部資產均可用作支持港元匯率。外匯基金的龐大財政資源，能在面對突如其來的衝擊時為保障香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供強力後盾。\n\n圖5 2018年支持比率每日變動\n\n# 貨幣發行委員會\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的貨幣發行委員會（貨幣發行委員會）負責監察和探討與香港貨幣及金融穩定有關的課題。在2018年，貨幣發行委員會探討的課題包括多國央行聯合退出非常規貨幣政策對在香港的境外銀行美元貸款供應造成的潛在影響、港元貨幣需求的利率敏感度，以及聯匯制度自3項優化措施以來的運作機制及理論。貨幣發行委員會會議紀錄及金管局向其呈交的貨幣發行局制度運作報告，均載於金管局網站。\n\n# 研究\n\n香港金融研究中心（研究中心）繼續支持貨幣政策、銀行業及金融範疇的研究工作。過去4年，研究中心更着重政策方面的研究，從所舉辦的研討會及訪問學者計劃尤其可見一斑。一方面，研究中心與主要中央銀行及政策研究機構合作，聯合舉辦更多政策相關的研討會。另一方面，在2016年推出專題研究學者計劃，支持更多與金管局政策制定相關的研究項目。\n\n在2018年，研究中心合共邀請16位研究學者到訪，並發表了25份研究論文。年內研究中心亦舉辦了4場國際研討會：\n- 於1月舉行的「第9屆中國經濟年度國際研討會」，主題為「中國房地產市場及其對經濟與金融穩定的影響」。研討會由研究中心、國務院發展研究中心市場經濟研究所及中國人民銀行金融研究所合辦，集中討論內地房地產市場相關的課題及風險。\n- 於10月舉行由金管局及國際結算銀行合辦的「匯率與貨幣政策框架」研討會。研討會為國際結算銀行於香港的亞太區辦事處成立20周年的慶祝活動之一，旨在探討匯率在貨幣政策框架中的角色。\n- 於11月舉行的「2018年中央銀行金融市場微結構的年度研討會」。研討會討論金融市場微結構理論研究、實證研究結果及近期發展相關的政策影響。\n- 於11月舉行由金管局、歐洲中央銀行及美國聯邦儲備委員會合辦的「中國經濟的新時代」中國專家網絡研討會。研討會討論內地經濟正面對的迫切問題及其對全球經濟的影響，並特別着重與中央銀行決策者相關的政策議題。這是中國專家網絡研討會首次在歐洲以外地區舉行。\n","terms":{"10年期美國國庫券收益率":["10-year US Treasury

rate weakened, approaching the level of the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking. Despite this, the operations of the Hong Kong dollar’s foreign exchange and money markets remained smooth and orderly. The Linked Exchange Rate System is the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability and has continued to demonstrate its resilience in the face of significant shocks.\n\n# Objectives\n\nThe primary objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is to maintain monetary stability, specifically by ensuring the stability of the Hong Kong dollar’s exchange rate, keeping it within the range of HK$7.75 to HK$7.85 per US dollar in the foreign exchange market. This monetary regime primarily operates under a Currency Board system, which requires that the US dollar reserves held by the Exchange Fund provide at least 100% backing to the Monetary Base. Any changes in the Monetary Base must be matched by corresponding adjustments in US dollar reserves, ensuring full alignment with these changes.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n- Certificates of Indebtedness (which fully back the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks)\n- Notes and coins in circulation issued by the Government\n- The total balance of banks’ settlement accounts held with the HKMA (i.e. the Aggregate Balance)\n- Exchange Fund Bills and Notes issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe HKMA maintains the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and a firm commitment to honour the Convertibility Undertaking. If market demand for the Hong Kong dollar exceeds supply, causing the market exchange rate to strengthen to HK$7.75 per US dollar (the strong-side Convertibility Undertaking level), the HKMA will sell Hong Kong dollars to banks and buy US dollars. This increases the Aggregate Balance and lowers Hong Kong dollar interest rates, returning the exchange rate to within the range of 7.75 to 7.85 from the strong-side Convertibility Undertaking level. Conversely, if there is an oversupply of Hong Kong dollars, causing the market exchange rate to weaken to HK$7.85 per US dollar (the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking level), the HKMA will buy Hong Kong dollars from banks. This reduces the Aggregate Balance, raises Hong Kong dollar interest rates, and returns the exchange rate to within the target range from the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking level.\n\n# Review of 2018\n\n# Exchange Rate Stability\n\nDriven by widening negative interest rate differentials between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar, which encouraged carry trade activities, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate gradually weakened from the beginning of the year. On 12 April, the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking, set at 7.85 in 2005, was triggered for the first time. Throughout 2018, the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking was triggered a total of 27 times: 13 times in April, 6 times in May, and 8 times in August. Despite this, Hong Kong dollar trading remained smooth and orderly, with the exchange rate hovering around 7.85 (the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking level) from mid-April to mid-September (Figure 1). The Hong Kong dollar then strengthened slightly, partly due to tightening interbank liquidity as the holiday season, quarter-end, and year-end approached, leading to some unwinding of carry trade positions. Additionally, the Hong Kong dollar was supported to some extent by improved stock market sentiment in early November. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar foreign exchange market operated normally throughout 2018.\n\nFigure 1 Market exchange rate in 2018\n\nAs a result of the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking being triggered, the Aggregate Balance and the outstanding amount of Exchange Fund Bills and Notes decreased from HK$12,268 billion at the end of 2017 to HK$11,362 billion at the end of 2018 (Figure 2). During the year, in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), the HKMA purchased a total of HK$103.5 billion at the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking level of 7.85 upon banks’ requests. This caused the Aggregate Balance to decrease from HK$1,798 billion at the end of 2017 to HK$764 billion at the end of 2018. The outstanding amount of Exchange Fund Bills and Notes did not change significantly during the year. The Monetary Base continued to be fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\nAt the end of 2018, the Aggregate Balance and the outstanding amount of Exchange Fund Bills and Notes totalled HK$11,362 billion.\n\nFigure 2 Aggregate Balance and outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and Notes in 2018\n\n# Money Market\n\nHong Kong interbank interest rates generally rose in 2018 due to reduced interbank liquidity following the triggering of the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking and market expectations of US interest rate hikes. Short-term interbank interest rates experienced larger fluctuations, driven by increased funding demand related to initial public offerings and seasonal liquidity needs (Figure 3). Overall, short-term interbank interest rates in 2018 remained largely below the Base Rate. In response to rising funding costs in the banking system, banks raised their Best Lending Rates by 12.5 to 25 basis points after the target range for the US federal funds rate was increased in late September.\n\nIn response to four increases totalling 100 basis points in the target range for the US federal funds rate during the year (from 1.25–1.50% to 2.25–2.50%), the Base Rate was raised by a total of 100 basis points, from 1.75% to 2.75%, on 22 March, 14 June, 27 September, and 20 December. These adjustments were made in accordance with the revised formula announced on 26 March 2009. Under this formula, the Base Rate is set at either 50 basis points above the lower end of the target range for the US federal funds rate or the average of the five-day moving averages of the overnight and one-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates, whichever is higher.\n\nFigure 3 Hong Kong interbank interest rates in 2018\n\nThe discount on Hong Kong dollar forward exchange rates widened in the first four months, broadly following the trend of interest rate differentials between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar. The 12-month Hong Kong dollar forward points reached negative 620 points in mid-April (Figure 4). Subsequently, as the negative interest rate differential between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar narrowed, the discount on Hong Kong dollar forward exchange rates narrowed slightly before widening again in the fourth quarter. Overall, the Hong Kong money market continued to operate normally. Discount Window borrowing increased from HK$10.3 billion in 2017 to HK$40.2 billion in 2018.\n\nFigure 4 US dollar\/Hong Kong dollar forward points in 2018\n\n# Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nSince its introduction in 1983, the LERS has been a key pillar in maintaining Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, demonstrating its resilience during several regional and global financial crises. As the Hong Kong dollar weakened, the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking, which is part of the LERS design, was triggered multiple times in April, May, and August. The outflow of funds from the Hong Kong dollar is a necessary process for interest rate normalisation in Hong Kong and is a normal operation under the LERS. To enhance public understanding of the relevant operations and mechanisms of the LERS, the HKMA has been committed to explaining its technical details to the public and demonstrating the Hong Kong financial system’s ability to withstand shocks. The Government remains firmly committed to maintaining the LERS. The stability of the foreign exchange and money markets has further strengthened public confidence in the Government’s commitment and in the Hong Kong dollar as a medium of payment and a store of value. During the 2018 Article IV Consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund reiterated its support for the LERS, stating that it remains the most suitable monetary system for Hong Kong. The LERS serves as a pillar of stability, helping to ensure sustained economic growth, maintain competitiveness, and facilitate the smooth operation of the large financial services industry.\n\nGiven that a sound banking system is crucial to the normal operation of the LERS, the HKMA continues to closely monitor banks’ credit, liquidity, and interest rate risk management, as well as stress-test results. It also maintains supervision of banks’ corporate, property-related, and Mainland-related lending to ensure the banking system’s ability to withstand shocks. Banks hold a large amount of Exchange Fund Bills and Notes, which can be used to obtain Hong Kong dollar liquidity through the Discount Window, providing an effective buffer against significant interest rate volatility. The HKMA stands ready to adjust the issuance volume of Exchange Fund Bills and Notes to provide additional liquidity in response to a possible sharp outflow of funds from the Hong Kong dollar. The HKMA also reminds the public to manage market and interest rate risks prudently and to prepare for potential market volatility.\n\nTo enhance the transparency of the Currency Board Account, part of the Exchange Fund’s assets have been designated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio (i.e. the ratio of Backing Assets to the Monetary Base) fluctuated between 107.8% and 109.9% in 2018, without reaching the Trigger Level. The ratio stood at 109.9% on 31 December (Figure 5). Under the LERS, although certain Exchange Fund assets have been designated as the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets can be used to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. The Exchange Fund’s substantial financial resources provide a strong safeguard for Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability in the face of sudden shocks.\n\nFigure 5 Daily changes in the Backing Ratio in 2018\n\n# Currency Board Sub-Committee\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee, under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, is responsible for monitoring and studying issues related to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. In 2018, the Sub-Committee studied issues including the potential impact of multiple central banks jointly exiting unconventional monetary policies on the supply of US dollar loans by foreign banks in Hong Kong, the interest rate sensitivity of Hong Kong dollar monetary demand, and the operational mechanism and theory of the LERS since the implementation of three optimisation measures. The minutes of the Currency Board Sub-Committee meetings and the reports on the operation of the Currency Board system submitted by the HKMA to the Sub-Committee are available on the HKMA website.\n\n# Research\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research (HKIMR) continues to support research in the areas of monetary policy, banking, and finance. Over the past four years, the HKIMR has placed greater emphasis on policy-related research, as evidenced by the policy-focused conferences and visiting fellowship programmes it has organised. On one hand, the HKIMR has collaborated with major central banks and policy institutions to jointly organise more policy-related conferences. On the other hand, a thematic research fellowship programme was launched in 2016 to support more research projects related to the HKMA’s policy formulation.\n\nIn 2018, the HKIMR invited a total of 16 research fellows to visit and published 25 research papers. During the year, the HKIMR also organised four international conferences:\n- The 9th International Conference on the Chinese Economy, held in January, with the theme “China’s Real Estate Market and Its Impact on Economic and Financial Stability”. The conference was jointly organised by the HKIMR, the Institute of Market Economy of the Development Research Centre of the State Council, and the Financial Research Institute of the People’s Bank of China, and focused on issues and risks related to the Mainland’s real estate market.\n- The Conference on Exchange Rate and Monetary Policy Framework, jointly organised by the HKMA and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) in October. The conference was part of the celebration of the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the BIS’s Asia Pacific Office in Hong Kong and aimed to explore the role of exchange rates in the monetary policy framework.\n- The 2018 Annual Central Bank Conference on the Microstructure of Financial Markets, held in November. The conference discussed theoretical research, empirical findings, and recent developments in the microstructure of financial markets, as well as their policy implications.\n- The China Expert Network (CEN) workshop on “A New Era for the Chinese Economy”, jointly organised by the HKMA, the European Central Bank, and the Federal Reserve Board of Governors in November. The workshop discussed the pressing issues facing the Mainland economy and their impact on the global economy, with a particular focus on policy issues relevant to central bank decision-makers. This was the first time a CEN workshop was held outside Europe."}

銀行體系穩定\n\n儘管環球經濟及金融市場的不確定性增加，2018年香港銀行體系維持穩健。認可機構的流動性及信用風險管理制度的成效繼續是金管局年內的監管重點。鑑於網絡威脅持續增加，以及銀行業更廣泛使用金融科技，金管局加強對認可機構科技風險管理及業務操作恢復能力的監管。金管局亦於5月發出《虛擬銀行的認可》指引修訂本，並開始處理虛擬銀行認可申請。在操守監管方面，金管局採取進一步措施，加強監管認可機構銷售投資及保險產品的手法、促進為殘疾人士提供無障礙銀行服務，以及推動以客為本的企業文化。\n\n隨着金融罪行越趨複雜及全球化，金管局繼續借助新科技及風險為本方法，加強香港打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度的應對能力。金管局在香港落實國際監管標準方面進展理想，其中包括資本充足標準、披露標準、流動性標準及大額風險承擔限額。此外，金管局亦加強與銀行業的溝通接觸，確保在監管成效與市場發展兩者間取得適當平衡。\n\n與此同時，金管局繼續致力確保香港備有具公信力的認可機構處置機制，其中包括推出最低吸收虧損能力規定的規則，以解決認可機構處置可行性面對的一大障礙。\n\n# 目標\n\n金管局的整體目標之一是促進銀行體系的安全及穩定。要達致這個目標，實有賴建立及維持具高度應對能力且能為香港經濟提供所需關鍵金融服務的金融體系。\n\n銀行可能因其營運方式，甚或在極端情況下因失序地倒閉而影響銀行體系的穩定。作為監管當局，金融管理專員在保障金融穩定方面擔當重要角色，確保銀行有能力抵禦衝擊、對危機作出應對，並自危機中恢復常態，以最終有助防止出現倒閉。金融管理專員負責對銀行進行審慎監管，以及認可香港的持牌銀行、有限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司（統稱「認可機構」）。金融管理專員亦負責某些金融市場基建的指定及監管。\n\n然而，金融管理專員不能確保金融體系全無風險，香港的審慎監管制度亦非為了確保「零風險」而設。作為其中一個處置機制當局，金融管理專員力求確保一旦有認可機構不再可持續經營，即能有序地處理其倒閉。為此，香港已設立金融機構處置機制，金融管理專員於該機制之下作為包括認可機構在內的若干金融機構的處置機制當局。為建立運作暢順的香港處置機制，必須制定處置法例及政策標準、進行處置規劃以清除認可機構處置可行性的障礙，以及建立金管局處置無法經營的認可機構的運作能力。為有效執行上述工作，金管局需要採納與國際一致及協調的方法。\n\n# 2018年回顧\n\n# 監管工作概覽\n\n金管局在2018年共進行187次非現場審查，涵蓋範圍廣泛，包括認可機構的CAMEL評級、企業管治、業務操作及風險管理，以及認可機構應對金融科技發展的業務策略。為繼續加強認可機構的風險管治水平，金管局與認可機構董事局或董事局轄下委員會共舉行27次會議，並跟進認可機構實施企業管治指引的進度。此外，金管局與認可機構及其外聘核數師共舉行28次三方聯席會議。\n\n除了非現場審查工作外，金管局繼續進行定期現場審查，並以專題評估作為配合，以審視被評估為較高風險的範疇。金管局於年內共進行392次現場審查及專題評估，並繼續以信用風險管理作為審查與評估的主要重點。其他重點為科技風險及業務操作風險管理，以及打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集管控措施。金管局亦增加針對流動性與市場風險管理，以及巴塞爾資本充足架構的實施情況的現場審查及專題評估次數。專項審查小組亦對認可機構的證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（強積金）相關業務進行現場審查。\n\n表1載有金管局於2018年的監管工作概要。\n\n# 信用風險的監管\n\n# 信貸增長及資產質素\n\n2018年信貸增長放緩，全年貸款總額增加4.4%，2017年的增幅則為16.1%（表2）。貿易融資於2018年減少7.6%。貸款增長放緩，主要是因為全球經濟及貿易環境越趨不明朗，以致信貸需求收縮。\n\n表2 貸款及墊款的增長\n\n內地相關貸款總額在2018年底增加1.4%至42,490億港元，低於2017年的增幅（表3）。\n\n表3 內地相關貸款增長\n\n認可機構的資產質素在2018年維持穩健。零售銀行的特定分類貸款比率由2017年底的0.56%下降至2018年底的0.50%，遠低於2000年以來的長期平均水平2.1%；同期，整體銀行業的特定分類貸款比率則由0.68%下降至0.55%。內地相關貸款方面，零售銀行的特定分類貸款比率由0.75%下降至2018年的0.63%，整體銀行業的相關比率亦由一年前的0.67%下降至0.54%。\n\n年內金管局加強監管，確保認可機構繼續採取審慎的信用風險管理準則。尤其金管局更主動了解大型企業的背景及結構，從而加強企業信用風險的監察制度。此外，金管局亦進行以主要信用風險管理監控措施為重點的專題評估，例如大型企業貸款的批核準則及風險管理、貸款分類及撥備制度、信用風險管治架構、地產發展商貸款的風險管理、有抵押貸款及保單抵押貸款等。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n住宅物業價格在2018年7月到達歷史高位，但在下半年出現緩和跡象。金管局自2009年10月以來推出的8輪逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施，已增強香港銀行體系應對本港樓市可能逆轉的抵禦能力。新造住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數由2009年9月金管局推出首輪逆周期措施前的64%，降至2018年12月的46%。平均供款與入息比率亦由2010年8月首度推出有關比率上限時的41%，降至2018年12月的34%（圖1）。\n\n圖1 新造住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數及供款與入息比率\n\n# 業務操作及科技風險的監管\n\n銀行業面對的科技風險仍然偏高。金管局於2016年推出「網絡防衛評估框架」。第一期實施安排涵蓋包括所有大型銀行在內的30間認可機構，該等認可機構已完成3個階段的評估，即自身風險程度評估、成熟程度評估及（如適用）風險資訊主導網絡攻防模擬測試。有關評估有助認可機構查找需要改進的運作範疇及採取補救措施，加強網絡防衛。與此同時，金管局已制定第二及第三期實施安排的時間表，這兩期實施安排將涵蓋其餘認可機構。年內金管局進行現場審查，集中檢視認可機構的網絡保安管控措施、外判安排及資訊科技管治。\n\n# 智慧銀行\n\n金管局繼續就2017年9月公布的7項推動智慧銀行的措施與銀行業合作，以促進金融科技在香港的發展。在監管層面，金管局於5月發出《虛擬銀行的認可》指引修訂本。此外，金管局在「銀行易」措施下，已經精簡有關遙距開戶、網上貸款及網上財富管理的監管要求。這些優化的監管要求有助銀行提供更佳的網上銀行用戶體驗。「銀行易」措施的工作範疇在9月擴大至促進銀行採用金融合規科技(Regtech)，而當中3個新的工作重點包括打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集的監察科技、用於審慎風險管理和合規的金融合規科技，以及「機器可讀」的監管要求。\n\n金管局副總裁阮國恒先生在香港銀行學會主辦的「香港銀行家峰會2018」上發表演辭，題為「智慧銀行新紀元下的金融合規科技」。\n\n# 流動性及市場風險的監管\n\n隨着美國貨幣政策持續正常化，金管局加強了流動性風險的監管，以確保認可機構審慎及有效地管理其流動性風險。年內金管局進行了一輪專題評估，以評估認可機構為美元流動性可能收緊所作的準備，以及其內部流動性壓力測試的能力。此外，金管局亦監察認可機構遵守於1月生效的「穩定資金淨額比率」要求的情況。\n\n金管局除檢視認可機構的債券組合的市場風險管理外，亦進行了針對《環球外匯守則》及非中央結算場外衍生工具的保證金和風險緩解標準的專題現場審查，以審視認可機構在財資業務中遵行新國際標準的情況。\n\n# 打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集\n\n政府於4月發表的《香港洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險評估報告》指出，香港銀行體系面對高洗錢威脅，這與其他國際金融中心一樣，亦反映金融服務日趨全球化及複雜。香港面對的洗錢威脅除源自本地犯罪活動外，在更大程度上也來自境外活動。該等境外活動包括來自境外貪污活動的非法得益、跨國犯罪集團的詐騙活動、逃稅及基於香港作為支付及貿易樞紐的地位而引致與制裁相關的風險。在金管局協助下，政府制定打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集政策聲明，列載對該等威脅的回應，目標是在提高打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度的應對能力的同時，又能吸引及便利正當企業。\n\n《2018年打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集（金融機構）（修訂）條例》於3月1日生效，引入的修訂包括在核實客戶身分方面賦予靈活性，以配合認可機構利用科技方便客戶開戶的發展。新法例亦擴大適用範圍，規定律師、會計師、地產代理及信託或公司服務提供者須負上打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集的責任，從而全面強化打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度。該等修訂連同《公司條例》為提高企業實益擁有權透明度而作出的修訂，有助認可機構執行打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集方面的工作。\n\n為鞏固及進一步強化與認可機構就打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集政策與監管方法的溝通，金管局在10月發出《監管政策手冊》下的全新單元「打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集的監管方法」，及配合相關法例修訂的《打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集指引（認可機構適用）》，以能更有效實施風險為本的方法，並減少認可機構就打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度採用新科技的障礙。\n\n資訊交流在打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度中的作用日見重要；在金管局與香港銀行公會（銀行公會）的支持下，銀行業積極參與反訛騙及洗黑錢情報工作組（情報工作組），並已取得實質成果。有關情報工作組先導計劃的檢討工作於2018年末展開，並會於2019年初完成。\n","terms":{"10年期美國國庫券收益率":["10-year

banking system remained robust in 2018. The effectiveness of authorised institutions’ liquidity and credit risk management systems continued to be a key focus of the HKMA’s supervisory work during the year. In view of the increasing cyber threats and the more widespread use of financial technology in the banking sector, the HKMA strengthened its supervision of technology risk management and operational resilience in authorised institutions. In May, the HKMA also issued a revised version of the Guideline on Authorisation of Virtual Banks and began processing applications for virtual bank authorisation. In terms of conduct supervision, the HKMA took further measures to strengthen the supervision of authorised institutions’ sales practices for investment and insurance products, promote barrier-free banking services for people with disabilities, and foster a customer-centric corporate culture.\n\nAs financial crimes become increasingly complex and globalised, the HKMA continued to leverage new technology and risk-based approaches to enhance Hong Kong’s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing regime. The HKMA made good progress in implementing international regulatory standards in Hong Kong, including capital adequacy standards, disclosure standards, liquidity standards, and large exposure limits. In addition, the HKMA strengthened its communication with the banking sector to ensure an appropriate balance between regulatory effectiveness and market development.\n\nAt the same time, the HKMA continued to work to ensure that Hong Kong has a credible resolution regime for authorised institutions, including introducing rules on minimum loss-absorbing capacity requirements to address a major obstacle to the feasibility of resolving authorised institutions.\n\n# Objectives\n\nOne of the HKMA’s overall objectives is to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this objective relies on building and maintaining a financial system that is highly resilient and capable of providing critical financial services needed by the Hong Kong economy.\n\nBanks may affect the stability of the banking system due to their mode of operation, or even, in extreme cases, due to disorderly failure. As a regulatory authority, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority plays an important role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring that banks are capable of withstanding shocks, responding to crises, and recovering from crises, ultimately helping to prevent failures. The HKMA is responsible for prudential supervision of banks and for authorising licensed banks, restricted licence banks, and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong (collectively referred to as \"authorised institutions\"). The HKMA is also responsible for the designation and supervision of certain financial market infrastructures.\n\nHowever, the HKMA cannot ensure that the financial system is risk-free, and Hong Kong’s prudential regulatory framework is not designed to ensure \"zero risk\". As one of the resolution authorities, the HKMA seeks to ensure that if an authorised institution is no longer viable, its failure can be handled in an orderly manner. To this end, Hong Kong has established a financial institution resolution regime, under which the HKMA acts as the resolution authority for certain financial institutions, including authorised institutions. To establish a smoothly functioning resolution regime in Hong Kong, it is necessary to develop resolution legislation and policy standards, conduct resolution planning to remove obstacles to the feasibility of resolving authorised institutions, and build the HKMA’s operational capability to resolve non-viable authorised institutions. To effectively implement the above, the HKMA needs to adopt an internationally consistent and coordinated approach.\n\n# Review of 2018\n\n# Overview of supervisory work\n\nIn 2018, the HKMA conducted 187 off-site reviews covering a wide range of areas, including authorised institutions’ CAMEL ratings, corporate governance, business operations, risk management, and business strategies for responding to fintech developments. To further enhance the risk governance level of authorised institutions, the HKMA held 27 meetings with the boards or board committees of authorised institutions and followed up on the progress of their implementation of corporate governance guidelines. In addition, the HKMA held 28 tripartite meetings with authorised institutions and their external auditors.\n\nIn addition to off-site review work, the HKMA continued to conduct regular on-site examinations, complemented by thematic reviews to examine areas assessed as higher risk. The HKMA conducted 392 on-site examinations and thematic reviews during the year, continuing to focus primarily on credit risk management. Other areas of focus were technology risk, operational risk management, and anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing controls. The HKMA also increased the number of on-site examinations and thematic reviews focusing on liquidity and market risk management and the implementation of the Basel capital adequacy framework. A specialist examination team also conducted on-site examinations of authorised institutions’ securities, investment products, insurance, and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses.\n\nTable 1 provides an overview of the HKMA’s supervisory work in 2018.\n\n# Supervision of credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nCredit growth slowed in 2018, with total loans increasing by 4.4% for the year, compared with 16.1% in 2017 (Table 2). Trade finance decreased by 7.6% in 2018. The slowdown in loan growth was mainly due to shrinking credit demand as a result of increasing uncertainty in the global economic and trade environment.\n\nTable 2 Growth in loans and advances\n\nMainland-related lending totalled HK$4,249 billion at the end of 2018, an increase of 1.4%, which was lower than the growth in 2017 (Table 3).\n\nTable 3 Growth in Mainland-related lending\n\nAuthorised institutions’ asset quality remained sound in 2018. The classified loan ratio for retail banks fell from 0.56% at the end of 2017 to 0.50% at the end of 2018, well below the long-term average of 2.1% since 2000. Over the same period, the classified loan ratio for the banking sector as a whole fell from 0.68% to 0.55%. For Mainland-related lending, the classified loan ratio for retail banks fell from 0.75% to 0.63% in 2018, while the ratio for the banking sector as a whole fell from 0.67% a year earlier to 0.54%.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA strengthened supervision to ensure that authorised institutions continued to adopt prudent credit risk management standards. In particular, the HKMA took a more proactive approach to understanding the background and structure of large corporations, thereby enhancing the monitoring system for corporate credit risk. In addition, the HKMA conducted thematic reviews focusing on key credit risk management monitoring measures, such as loan approval criteria and risk management for large corporations, loan classification and provisioning systems, credit risk governance frameworks, risk management of loans to property developers, asset-backed financing, and insurance premium financing.\n\n# Mortgage loans\n\nResidential property prices reached a historic high in July 2018 but showed signs of easing in the second half of the year. The eight rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures introduced by the HKMA since October 2009 have enhanced the Hong Kong banking system’s ability to withstand a possible reversal in the local property market. The average loan-to-value ratio for new residential mortgage loans fell from 64% before the HKMA introduced its first round of countercyclical measures in September 2009 to 46% in December 2018. The average debt-servicing ratio also fell from 41% when the ratio cap was first introduced in August 2010 to 34% in December 2018 (Chart 1).\n\nChart 1 Average loan-to-value ratio and debt-servicing ratio for new residential mortgage loans\n\n# Supervision of operational and technology risks\n\nThe banking sector continues to face high technology risks. In 2016, the HKMA launched the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework (C-RAF). The first phase of implementation covered 30 authorised institutions, including all large banks, which completed three stages of assessment: inherent risk assessment, maturity assessment, and (where applicable) cyber attack simulation testing driven by risk intelligence. These assessments help authorised institutions identify areas for improvement in their operations and take remedial measures to strengthen their cyber defences. Meanwhile, the HKMA has developed a timetable for the second and third phases of implementation, which will cover the remaining authorised institutions. During the year, the HKMA conducted on-site examinations focusing on authorised institutions’ cybersecurity controls, outsourcing arrangements, and information technology governance.\n\n# Smart banking\n\nThe HKMA continued to work with the banking sector on the seven measures to promote smart banking announced in September 2017, with a view to fostering fintech development in Hong Kong. At the regulatory level, the HKMA issued a revised version of the Guideline on Authorisation of Virtual Banks in May. In addition, under the Banking Made Easy initiative, the HKMA streamlined regulatory requirements related to remote onboarding, online finance, and online wealth management. These optimised regulatory requirements help banks provide a better online banking experience for users. The scope of the Banking Made Easy initiative was expanded in September to promote banks’ adoption of regulatory technology (RegTech), with three new areas of focus: AML\/CFT surveillance technologies, RegTech for prudential risk management and compliance, and \"machine-readable\" regulatory requirements.\n\nMr Arthur Yuen, Deputy Chief Executive of the HKMA, delivered a speech entitled \"Regulatory Technology in the New Era of Smart Banking\" at the Hong Kong Bankers’ Summit 2018, organised by the Hong Kong Institute of Bankers.\n\n# Supervision of liquidity and market risks\n\nAs the US continued to normalise its monetary policy, the HKMA strengthened its supervision of liquidity risk to ensure that authorised institutions managed their liquidity risk prudently and effectively. During the year, the HKMA conducted a round of thematic reviews to assess authorised institutions’ preparedness for a possible tightening of US dollar liquidity and their internal liquidity stress-testing capabilities. In addition, the HKMA monitored authorised institutions’ compliance with the Net Stable Funding Ratio requirement that took effect in January.\n\nIn addition to reviewing authorised institutions’ market risk management of debt securities portfolios, the HKMA conducted thematic on-site examinations focusing on the Foreign Exchange Global Code and margining and risk mitigation standards for non-centrally cleared over-the-counter derivatives to assess authorised institutions’ compliance with new international standards in treasury business.\n\n# Anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing\n\nThe Hong Kong Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment Report, published by the government in April, pointed out that the Hong Kong banking system faces a high risk of money laundering, similar to other international financial centres. This reflects the increasing globalisation and complexity of financial services. The money laundering threats faced by Hong Kong come not only from local criminal activities but, to a greater extent, from overseas activities. These overseas activities include illicit proceeds from overseas corruption, fraud by transnational criminal groups, tax evasion, and risks related to sanctions arising from Hong Kong’s position as a payment and trading hub. With the assistance of the HKMA, the government formulated an AML\/CFT policy statement setting out responses to these threats, with the aim of enhancing the capacity of the AML\/CFT regime while attracting and facilitating legitimate businesses.\n\nThe Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) (Amendment) Ordinance 2018 came into effect on 1 March, introducing amendments that provide flexibility in customer identity verification to accommodate authorised institutions’ use of technology to facilitate customer onboarding. The new law also expands the scope of application, requiring lawyers, accountants, estate agents, and trust or company service providers to assume responsibility for AML\/CFT, thereby comprehensively strengthening the AML\/CFT regime. These amendments, together with the amendments to the Companies Ordinance to enhance corporate beneficial ownership transparency, help authorised institutions carry out their AML\/CFT work.\n\nTo consolidate and further strengthen communication with authorised institutions on AML\/CFT policies and regulatory approaches, the HKMA issued in October a new module under the Supervisory Policy Manual, \"Regulatory Approaches to Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing\", and the \"Guidance on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing for Authorised Institutions\" to accompany the relevant legislative amendments. This aims to more effectively implement a risk-based approach and reduce obstacles for authorised institutions in adopting new technology for the AML\/CFT regime.\n\nInformation exchange is becoming increasingly important in the AML\/CFT regime. With the support of the HKMA and the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB), the banking sector has actively participated in the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce (FMLIT) and has achieved tangible results. A review of the FMLIT pilot programme began at the end of 2018 and will be completed in early 2019."}

轄下金融市場工作小組主席。\n\n香港金融基建的安全及有效運作，為香港作為國際金融中心的地位奠定穩固基礎。處理銀行同業交易的4個RTGS系統、債務工具中央結算系統（CMU系統）及香港交易資料儲存庫（香港儲存庫）在2018年達到100%的系統可供使用率，高於99.95%的目標水平。透過於內地兩個中央證券託管機構的帳戶，CMU系統繼續協助結算「債券通」北向通交易，以及替相關CMU系統成員持有內地債務證券。\n\n為促進零售支付業的整體安全及效率，金管局於8月根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（《支付條例》）指定多兩個零售支付系統，使其運作受到金管局監察。迄今受金管局監察的指定零售支付系統增至6個。金管局亦對16個儲值支付工具持牌人進行監管。有關持牌人積極推出新產品及服務，致力為客戶提供更多選擇及更佳的用戶體驗。與此同時，電子支票與電子帳單及繳費服務涵蓋範圍，進一步擴展至包括香港與整個廣東省的跨境支付交易。\n\n# 2018年回顧\n\n# 香港作為亞洲的金融科技樞紐\n\n# 推動智慧銀行的措施\n\n金管局於2017年9月公布7項推動智慧銀行的措施，旨在協助銀行業提升至更高層次，並把握銀行與科技結合帶來的龐大機遇。金管局於年內在落實這些措施及為香港金融生態轉型方面，進展良好。\n\n# 「轉數快」\n\n「轉數快」於9月成功啟動，方便銀行及儲值支付工具用戶隨時隨地進行港元及人民幣的跨行即時資金轉帳，用戶只需輸入收款人的手機號碼或電郵地址。共有21間銀行（包括大部分零售銀行）及10間儲值支付工具營運商已加入該系統，為客戶提供即時支付服務及╱或帳戶綁定服務。\n\n「轉數快」在3.5個月內已接獲超過200萬個登記，相對香港人口比例27%。該系統自推出以來處理超過480萬宗交易，涉及總額逾1,049億港元及27.5億元人民幣。\n\n金管局於同月推出香港零售支付共用二維碼標準及相關流動應用程式「香港共用二維碼」(HKQR)，是全球首創將多個二維碼整合成為個綜合二維碼的流動應用程式，方便商戶尤其中小企以同一個二維碼接受不同支付服務營運商的支付方案，無需向客戶展示多個二維碼。\n\n# 開放應用程式介面\n\n開放API是指透過向第三方服務供應商開放銀行的相關數據，更好更方便地融合銀行與其他行業的服務。用家單用一個系統就能在安全環境下享受綜合服務。為促進銀行界研發及提供開放API，金管局於7月發布開放API框架。該框架採用風險為本原則，並分4個階段落實各項開放API功能。截至2019年1月底，20間銀行已開放第一階段約500個開放API接口，涵蓋逾1,000項產品及服務的資料。\n\n# 科研及人才培訓\n\n建基於金管局主導的貿易融資概念驗證成果由香港多間銀行組成的聯盟於10月啟動以分布式分類帳技術(DLT)為基礎的貿易融資平台「貿易聯動」。該平台旨在透過數碼化貿易文件及自動化貿易融資流程，減低失誤及詐騙風險。截至2018年底，已有12間銀行加入成為該聯盟成員。「貿易聯動」與歐洲貿易融資平台「we.trade」於10月簽署《諒解備忘錄》，進行對接雙方平台的概念驗證。金管局亦同步探討「貿易聯動」與其他地區對接的機會，包括與新加坡金融管理局合作推出「全球貿易連接網絡」。\n\n金管局總裁陳德霖先生（左）於「貿易聯動」啟動儀式上。\n\n為培育更多金融科技專才，金管局於1月與香港應用科技研究院（應科院）合作推出「金融科技人才培育計劃」升級版(FCAS 2.0)。FCAS 2.0設有4個項目，適合處於不同職涯發展階段的年輕人才。計劃下有200多名學生受惠。\n\n金管局總裁陳德霖先生（左二）與數碼港主席林家禮博士（左一）、香港應科院主席王明鑫先生（右二）及香港科技園公司行政總裁黃克強先生（右一）出席FCAS 2.0啟動儀式。\n\n# 跨境合作\n\n繼於2017年與深圳市人民政府金融發展服務辦公室（深圳金融辦）簽署《諒解備忘錄》後，金管局繼續加強與深圳的金融科技合作。當中包括金管局贊助「深圳金融科技暑期實習計劃」，讓50名學生到深圳多間著名公司進行為期6星期的實習，體驗當地的金融科技生態；另與深圳金融辦第二次合辦「深港金融科技創新獎」。\n\n金管局副總裁李達志先生（右二）與首批深圳金融科技暑期實習生交談。\n\n金管局亦於2018年與瑞士金融市場監督管理局、波蘭金融監管局、阿布扎比國際金融中心金融服務監管局及巴西中央銀行簽署金融科技合作協議，促進金融科技合作。\n\n在8月，金管局與11間金融監管當局和相關機構公布「全球金融創新網絡」計劃。該網絡旨在為創新型公司提供更有效方式與監管機構進行互動，並促進監管機構之間就創新相關議題的合作。\n\n# 虛擬銀行\n\n引入虛擬銀行將會為香港金融科技應用增添新動力，並為數碼銀行客戶帶來嶄新體驗。虛擬銀行以個人或中小企等零售客戶為對象，因此亦有助促進普及金融。經公眾諮詢，金管局於5月發出《虛擬銀行的認可》指引修訂本，並於8月底接獲約30宗申請。\n\n# 金融科技監管沙盒\n\n年內沙盒的使用穩步上升。為協助建立金融合規科技的生態系統，沙盒於9月起開放予金融合規科技的項目。\n\n截至2018年底，共有42項金融科技或科技產品獲准使用沙盒進行測試，其中28項已完成試行，有關產品亦已於其後推出市場。金管局另接獲220項使用「金融科技監管聊天室」的個案，希望在金融科技項目構思初期取得監管反饋意見。其中有約70%的個案來自科技公司。\n","terms":{"10年期美國國庫券收益率":["10-year

financial centre is one of the HKMA’s principal responsibilities. The seven measures aimed at promoting the development and application of fintech by the banking and payments industry have made good progress over the year, with the successful launch of the Faster Payment System being a prime example.\n\nThe optimisation measures introduced under the mutual access schemes between the mainland Chinese and Hong Kong capital markets, together with the development of the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area, have further strengthened Hong Kong’s unique position as a gateway to mainland China. Hong Kong’s position as a global offshore renminbi business hub has also become more solid, with renminbi financial activities in Hong Kong flourishing.\n\nAt the same time, the HKMA has been committed to exploring new opportunities to further enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, including infrastructure financing, corporate treasury centres and the green bond market. The HKMA has also strengthened its marketing campaigns to promote Hong Kong’s advantages to overseas and mainland stakeholders. At the international level, the HKMA has played a leading role in a number of regional and international committees, which clearly demonstrates Hong Kong’s expertise and commitment in related international work.\n\n# Overview\n\nTo strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia, the HKMA has been committed to implementing the seven measures announced in September 2017 to promote the development and application of fintech by the banking and payments industries. The main progress made in these seven measures to promote smart banking over the year includes:\n\n- Successful launch of the Faster Payment System, which fully connects different banks and stored value payment tools (collectively known as ‘e-wallets’)\n- Issuance of the Open Application Programming Interface (Open API) framework for the banking industry and promotion of the implementation of Open APIs by the industry\n- Enhancement of fintech research and talent training\n- Strengthening of cross-border fintech cooperation\n- Revision of the Guideline on Authorisation of Virtual Banks and processing of virtual bank licence applications\n- Smooth operation of the upgraded version of the Fintech Supervisory Sandbox (FSS 2.0)\n- Expansion of the Banking Made Easy initiative to promote the adoption of regulatory technology by banks\n\nThe Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO) under the HKMA, together with the HKMA’s banking departments, has played an important role in promoting the implementation of the above measures.\n\nFollowing the implementation of the optimisation measures under the mutual access schemes between the mainland Chinese and Hong Kong capital markets, Hong Kong’s unique position as a gateway to mainland China has been further strengthened. The full implementation of the real-time Delivery versus Payment (DvP) settlement mode under Bond Connect and the tax exemption arrangement announced by the State Council for overseas investors investing in the mainland Chinese bond market have further enhanced the efficiency and attractiveness of the scheme. The HKMA has also worked closely with the mainland authorities to explore and implement a number of financial facilitation measures to help individuals and businesses living, working and operating in the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA). Hong Kong’s offshore renminbi business continues to flourish, with the renminbi deposit pool rising by 6% to RMB 6,577 billion over the year; the average daily transaction volume of the renminbi Real-Time Gross Settlement system reached a high level of RMB 10,101 billion.\n\nThe HKMA has been actively exploring new opportunities to further enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. To promote the development of Hong Kong’s bond market, the HKMA has implemented the Pilot Bond Grant Scheme proposed in the budget initiative, which provides funding for institutions issuing bonds in Hong Kong for the first time, and has worked closely with the government to revise the legislation to expand the scope of bond investment income eligible for tax exemption under the Qualifying Debt Instrument scheme. The HKMA has also strengthened its marketing activities to promote Hong Kong’s advantages to overseas and mainland stakeholders, including organising a number of large-scale and thematic outreach events to promote Hong Kong as a hub for green finance, infrastructure financing and corporate treasury centres.\n\nAt the international level, the HKMA leads a number of regional and international committees. The HKMA is currently chair of the Standing Committee on Supervisory and Regulatory Cooperation under the Financial Stability Board, the Supervision and Implementation Group under the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, and the Working Group on Financial Markets under the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP).\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure lays a solid foundation for Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre. The four RTGS systems handling interbank transactions, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) and the Hong Kong Trade Repository achieved a system availability rate of 100% in 2018, exceeding the target level of 99.95%. Through accounts with two central securities depositories in the mainland, the CMU system continues to assist in the settlement of northbound Bond Connect transactions and to hold mainland debt securities for relevant CMU system members.\n\nTo promote the overall safety and efficiency of the retail payments industry, the HKMA designated two more retail payment systems in August under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO), bringing their operations under the HKMA’s supervision. To date, the number of designated retail payment systems under the HKMA’s supervision has increased to six. The HKMA also supervises 16 stored value facility (SVF) licensees. These licensees have been actively launching new products and services to provide customers with more choices and a better user experience. Meanwhile, the coverage of e-cheques and electronic bill presentment and payment services has been further extended to include cross-border payment transactions between Hong Kong and the whole of Guangdong province.\n\n# Review of 2018\n\n# Hong Kong as a fintech hub in Asia\n\n# Measures to promote smart banking\n\nThe HKMA announced seven measures to promote smart banking in September 2017, with the aim of helping the banking industry move to a higher level and seize the huge opportunities brought about by the integration of banking and technology. The HKMA has made good progress in implementing these measures and transforming Hong Kong’s financial ecosystem over the year.\n\n# Faster Payment System\n\nThe Faster Payment System was successfully launched in September, enabling bank and stored value payment tool users to make instant cross-bank fund transfers in Hong Kong dollars and renminbi anytime and anywhere by simply entering the recipient’s mobile phone number or email address. A total of 21 banks (including most retail banks) and 10 stored value payment tool operators have joined the system, providing customers with instant payment services and\/or account binding services.\n\nWithin 3.5 months, the Faster Payment System had received over 2 million registrations, accounting for 27% of Hong Kong’s population. Since its launch, the system has processed over 4.8 million transactions, involving a total amount of over HK$104.9 billion and RMB 2.75 billion.\n\nIn the same month, the HKMA launched the Common QR Code Standard for Retail Payments and the related mobile application, the Hong Kong Common QR Code (HKQR), which is the world’s first mobile application that integrates multiple QR codes into a single comprehensive QR code, enabling merchants – especially SMEs – to accept payment schemes from different payment service operators using the same QR code, without the need to display multiple QR codes to customers.\n\n# Open Application Programming Interface\n\nOpen API refers to the integration of banking services with other industries’ services in a better and more convenient way by opening up relevant banking data to third-party service providers. Users can enjoy integrated services in a secure environment using just one system. To promote the development and provision of Open APIs by the banking industry, the HKMA issued the Open API Framework in July. The framework adopts a risk-based principle and implements various Open API functions in four phases. As at the end of January 2019, 20 banks had opened around 500 Open API endpoints in the first phase, covering data on over 1,000 products and services.\n\n# Research and talent training\n\nBuilding on the trade finance proof-of-concept results led by the HKMA, a consortium of banks in Hong Kong launched the eTradeConnect trade finance platform based on distributed ledger technology (DLT) in October. The platform aims to reduce errors and fraud risks by digitising trade documents and automating trade finance processes. As at the end of 2018, 12 banks had joined the consortium as members. eTradeConnect and the European trade finance platform, we.trade, signed a Memorandum of Understanding in October to conduct a proof-of-concept for connecting the two platforms. The HKMA is also exploring opportunities to connect eTradeConnect with other regions, including the launch of the Global Trade Connectivity Network in collaboration with the Monetary Authority of Singapore.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive Norman Chan (left) at the launch ceremony of eTradeConnect.\n\nTo nurture more fintech talent, the HKMA launched the upgraded version of the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme (FCAS 2.0) in collaboration with the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute (ASTRI) in January. FCAS 2.0 consists of four programmes suitable for young talent at different career development stages. Over 200 students have benefited from the programme.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive Norman Chan (second from left), Cyberport Chairman Dr Charles Chan (first from left), ASTRI Chairman Mr Wang Mingxin (second from right) and Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation Chief Executive Officer Mr Albert Wong (first from right) attended the launch ceremony of FCAS 2.0.\n\n# Cross-border cooperation\n\nFollowing the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding with the Office of Financial Development Service of the People’s Government of Shenzhen Municipality (OFDS) in 2017, the HKMA has continued to strengthen its fintech cooperation with Shenzhen. This includes the HKMA’s sponsorship of the Shenzhen Fintech Summer Internship Programme, which enabled 50 students to intern at several renowned companies in Shenzhen for six weeks to experience the local fintech ecosystem, and the second co-organisation of the Shenzhen–Hong Kong Fintech Award with the OFDS.\n\nHKMA Deputy Chief Executive Mr Howard Lee (second from right) talks with the first batch of Shenzhen fintech summer interns.\n\nThe HKMA also signed fintech cooperation agreements with the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, the Polish Financial Supervision Authority, the Financial Services Regulatory Authority of the Abu Dhabi Global Market and the Central Bank of Brazil in 2018 to promote fintech cooperation.\n\nIn August, the HKMA and 11 financial regulators and related agencies announced the Global Financial Innovation Network initiative. The network aims to provide innovative companies with a more effective way to interact with regulators and to promote cooperation between regulators on innovation-related issues.\n\n# Virtual banks\n\nThe introduction of virtual banks will add new impetus to the application of fintech in Hong Kong and bring a new experience to digital banking customers. Virtual banks target retail customers such as individuals and SMEs, and will therefore also help promote financial inclusion. Following a public consultation, the HKMA issued the revised Guideline on Authorisation of Virtual Banks in May and received around 30 applications by the end of August.\n\n# Fintech supervisory sandbox\n\nThe use of the sandbox increased steadily over the year. To help establish an ecosystem for regulatory technology, the sandbox was opened to regulatory technology projects in September.\n\nAs at the end of 2018, a total of 42 fintech or technology products had been approved to use the sandbox for testing, of which 28 had completed the trial and the related products had been launched in the market. The HKMA also received 220 cases using the FSS Chatroom, seeking regulatory feedback at the early stage of fintech project conception. Around 70% of the cases came from technology companies."}
{"zh":"# 儲備管理\n\n2018年對投資者而言是困難的一年，投資環境備受多項風險因素困擾，包括美國利率持續正常化引發金融狀況收緊、主要經濟體之間的貿易摩擦升級，以及全球多處民粹主義抬頭及地緣政治風險加劇。環球股市普遍向下，美國國庫券收益率亦隨着美國聯邦儲備局4次加息而上升。在美息趨升下，美元轉強。部分新興市場面對國內嚴峻的政治及經濟壓力，其貨幣顯著下挫。儘管投資環境充滿挑戰，外匯基金在2018年仍錄得109億港元投資收入。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》，外匯基金的首要目的是直接或間接影響港元匯價，亦可運用於保持香港貨幣及金融體系穩定健全，藉此保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。金管局根據財政司司長轉授的權力及轉授權力的條款，就外匯基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標及組合架構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會為外匯基金制定下列投資目標：\n\n(a) 保障資本；\n(b) 確保整體貨幣基礎在任何時候都由流通性極高的美元資產提供十足支持；\n(c) 確保流動資金足以維持貨幣及金融穩定；以及\n(d) 在符合上述(a)至(c)項的前提下盡量爭取投資回報，以保障基金的長期購買力。\n\n以上目標全面顧及外匯基金的法定目的，並已於外匯基金的組合結構及目標資產配置中反映。\n\n外匯基金大致上分成兩個主要組合：支持組合及投資組合。支持組合持有流通性極高的美元資產，按照貨幣發行局制度的規定為貨幣基礎提供十足支持。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債市及股市，以保障資產的價值及長期購買力。\n\n為能更妥善管理風險及提高中長期回報，金管局以審慎及循序漸進方式將外匯基金的部分資產分散投資至較多元化的資產類別，包括新興巿場及內地債券與股票、私募股權（包括基建）及房地產。新興巿場及內地債券與股票由投資組合持有，私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合持有。長期增長組合的市值上限為外匯基金累計盈餘的三分之一及未來基金與外匯基金附屬公司存款中與長期增長組合掛鈎部分的總和。\n\n策略性資產組合於2007年設立，以持有政府基於策略性目的而為外匯基金帳目購入的香港交易及結算所有限公司股份。由於這個組合性質獨特，因此外匯基金的投資表現評估並無將其包括在內。\n\n# 於外匯基金的存款\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定組織的存款，利率一般與投資組合的表現掛鈎，但主要以未來基金除外。未來基金存款的利率與投資組合及長期增長組合的表現掛鈎，實際利率視乎組合比重而定。於2018年底，未來基金在投資組合與長期增長組合的比重約為50:50。\n\n# 投資程序\n\n外匯基金的投資程序分別以策略性資產配置及戰略性資產配置作基礎。策略性資產配置，即投資基準反映的配置情況，顯示外匯基金為達到投資目標而可作出的長線資產配置。外匯基金以策略性配置作為指引，對資產進行戰略性配置，以爭取超越基準的回報。因此，實際配置往往會與基準配置（亦即策略性配置）有所偏離，而實際與基準配置之間的差距稱為「戰略性偏離」。財政司司長經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後制定投資基準及循跡誤差限額，金管局獲授權決定戰略性資產配置及定出戰略性偏離的容許範圍。投資組合經理可在戰略性偏離的容許範圍內選持倉盤，從短期市場變化中獲利。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局於8月成立外匯基金投資辦公室，專責投資及相關風險管理職能。該辦公室職員負責直接管理外匯基金約72%的投資，包括整個支持組合及部分投資組合。該部分的投資組合投資於環球定息市場，並透過衍生工具執行外匯基金的宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 外聘投資經理\n\n除透過內部職員管理資產外，金管局亦僱用外聘投資經理負責管理外匯基金約28%的資產，包括所有上市股票組合及其他特別資產。僱用外聘投資經理的目的是要運用市場上最佳的專業投資技術為外匯基金投資，以取得可持續回報，並讓外匯基金受惠於多元化及互補的投資方式，以及汲取市場心得與專業投資技術知識。\n\n僱用外聘投資經理的相關支出包括基金管理與託管費、交易費、預扣稅及其他稅項。這些支出主要受市場因素影響而每年不同。\n\n# 風險管理及監察\n\n投資環境越趨複雜，突顯風險管理的重要。金管局為內部及外聘投資經理所管理的投資組合均訂立嚴格管控措施及投資指引，並密切監察對指引及法規的遵守情況。金管局已加強風險評估，以配合外匯基金越趨多元化的投資；另採用風險管控工具來評估在正常及極度不利市況下的市場風險。金管局亦進行詳細的投資表現因素分析，以識別促成不同表現的成因，藉此評估如何充分利用內部及外聘投資經理的投資管理技術。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n金管局支持負責任投資。例如，金管局已採納證券及期貨事務監察委員會公布的《負責任的擁有權原則》。該套原則旨在協助投資者釐定如何以最佳方法履行其於香港上市公司投資的擁有權責任。就外匯基金的管理而言，金管局已就環境、社會及管治因素制定內部指引，適用於外聘基金經理的甄選、委任及監察程序。獲委任負責主動式管理香港股票組合的外聘基金經理，須在管理有關投資時遵守《負責任的擁有權原則》。整體而言，金管局已將環境、社會及管治因素納入投資及相關監察活動的內部程序。金管局會密切注視環境、社會及管治因素的相關標準的發展，並評估如何能夠將這些標準進一步融入投資程序。此外，為促進負責任投資的國際合作，金管局已成為非牟利組織FCLTGlobal的成員，該組織旨在推動長遠目標為本的業務及投資決定。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2018年的金融市場\n\n在2018年，原先被市場低估的多項風險因素一一浮現，包括美國利率正常化的步伐、美國政府外貿政策和保護主義對全球貿易的衝擊，以及地緣政治的風險，環球金融市場因而出現大幅波動及調整。\n\n中美貿易爭議升級，令投資者非常憂慮，新興市場及香港股市自1月底開始反覆下跌，恒生指數自該月份的高位最多下跌27%。自第4季起，主要歐美股市亦大幅下滑，錄得雙位數字跌幅。就2018年整體而言，全球股市普遍下跌，涵蓋已發展國家股市的MSCI全球指數下跌10.4%，MSCI新興市場指數亦下跌16.6%。\n\n債市方面，由於美國貨幣政策正常化，美國國庫券收益率於2018年大致向上。然而，年內債市仍有波動。例如10年期美國國庫券收益率由年初約2.5%上升至11月3.2%的7年新高，但至年底時受投資者憂慮中美貿易爭議及趨向避險投資所影響而回軟至2.7%。\n\n貨幣市場方面，年內美元跟隨美國加息轉強。美匯指數上升4.4%，歐元及人民幣等主要貨幣兌美元下跌約5%。此外，部分新興市場受到國內政局及經濟不穩影響，其貨幣進一步受挫。例如，阿根廷披索及土耳其里拉兌美元分別下跌約五成及三成。相比之下，避險投資需求帶動日圓兌美元上升2.7%。\n\n表1列載主要貨幣、債巿及股市在2018年的表現。\n\n表1 2018年市場回報\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n外匯基金在2018年錄得109億港元投資收入，當中包括債券投資收益574億港元、香港股票投資虧損207億港元、其他股票投資虧損387億港元、非港元資產外匯估值下調90億港元，以及外匯基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資收益219億港元。另一方面，策略性資產組合錄得5億港元估值下調。\n\n於2018年年底，外匯基金的資產總值達40,549億港元。長期增長組合投資的總市值為2,836億港元，當中私募股權為1,911億港元，房地產為925億港元。已承擔但尚未提取作投資的總額為2,024億港元。\n\n外匯基金（不包括策略性資產組合）在2018年的投資回報率為0.3%，其中投資組合的回報率為負2.4%，支持組合為2.1%。長期增長組合自2009年開展投資以來的內部回報率年率為12.9%。\n\n圖1列明外匯基金由1994至2018年的年度回報率。表2顯示外匯基金在2018年的投資回報率及不同年期的平均投資回報率。外匯基金在過去3年的平均回報率為3.2%、過去5年為2.1%、過去10年為2.8%，以及自1994年起計為4.7%3。表3列載外匯基金資產於2018年12月31日的貨幣比重。\n","terms":{"10年期美國國庫券收益率":["10-year

risk factors. These included the ongoing normalisation of US interest rates, which tightened financial conditions, escalating trade tensions among major economies, and a rise in populism and geopolitical risks globally. Equity markets worldwide generally declined, while US Treasury yields increased following four interest rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve. The US dollar strengthened as US interest rates rose. Some emerging markets faced severe domestic political and economic pressures, leading to significant depreciation of their currencies. Despite these challenges, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$10.9 billion in 2018.\n\n# Exchange Fund\n\nUnder the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the primary purpose of the Exchange Fund is to influence the Hong Kong dollar’s exchange rate directly or indirectly. It may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems, thereby safeguarding Hong Kong’s position as an international financial centre. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is accountable to the Financial Secretary for the management and investment of the Exchange Fund, operating under the powers delegated and sub-delegated by the Financial Secretary.\n\n# Management of the Exchange Fund\n\n## Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee has established the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(a) to safeguard capital;\n(b) to ensure that the overall monetary base is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar assets at all times;\n(c) to ensure sufficient liquidity to maintain monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) to achieve investment returns, within the constraints of (a) to (c) above, in order to preserve the Fund’s long-term purchasing power.\n\nThese objectives fully reflect the statutory purpose of the Exchange Fund and are embodied in its portfolio structure and target asset allocation.\n\nThe Exchange Fund is broadly divided into two main portfolios: the Backing Portfolio and the Investment Portfolio. The Backing Portfolio holds highly liquid US dollar assets to fully back the monetary base, in accordance with the requirements of the Currency Board system. The Investment Portfolio primarily invests in the bond and equity markets of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) member countries to preserve asset value and long-term purchasing power.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance medium- to long-term returns, the HKMA has prudently and progressively diversified a portion of the Exchange Fund’s assets into more varied asset classes. These include emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held within the Investment Portfolio, while private equity and real estate investments are held within the Long-Term Growth Portfolio. The market value ceiling of the Long-Term Growth Portfolio is set at one-third of the Exchange Fund’s accumulated surplus, plus the total of the portions of the Future Fund and the Exchange Fund’s subsidiary deposits that are linked to the Long-Term Growth Portfolio.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio was established in 2007 to hold shares of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited purchased by the Government for strategic purposes on behalf of the Exchange Fund. Due to its unique nature, this portfolio is excluded from the assessment of the Exchange Fund’s investment performance.\n\n## Deposits in the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund periodically accepts deposits from fiscal reserves, government funds, and statutory bodies. Interest rates on these deposits are generally linked to the performance of the Investment Portfolio, with the exception of the Future Fund. The interest rate for the Future Fund’s deposits is linked to the performance of both the Investment Portfolio and the Long-Term Growth Portfolio, with the actual rate determined by the portfolio mix. As of the end of 2018, the Future Fund’s allocation between the Investment Portfolio and the Long-Term Growth Portfolio was approximately 50:50.\n\n## Investment process\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s investment process is based on both strategic and tactical asset allocation. Strategic asset allocation, as reflected in the investment benchmark, represents the long-term asset allocation that the Exchange Fund can make to achieve its investment objectives. The Fund uses this strategic allocation as a guide and makes tactical asset allocations to achieve returns above the benchmark. Consequently, actual allocations often deviate from the benchmark allocation (i.e., the strategic allocation), and the difference between the actual and benchmark allocations is referred to as a “tactical deviation”. The Financial Secretary, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, sets the investment benchmark and tracking error limits. The HKMA is authorised to determine the tactical asset allocation and establish the permissible range for tactical deviations. Portfolio managers can select holdings within this permissible range of tactical deviations to capitalise on short-term market changes.\n\n## Investment management\n\n### Direct investment\n\nIn August, the HKMA established the Exchange Fund Investment Office, which is responsible for investment and related risk management functions. Staff at this office directly manage approximately 72% of the Exchange Fund’s investments, including the entire Backing Portfolio and part of the Investment Portfolio. This portion of the portfolio is invested in global fixed-income markets and utilises derivatives to implement the Exchange Fund’s macro risk management strategies.\n\n### External fund managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets through internal staff, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage approximately 28% of the Exchange Fund’s assets. This includes all listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes. The purpose of employing external fund managers is to leverage the best professional investment expertise available in the market to achieve sustainable returns for the Exchange Fund. This approach also enables the Fund to benefit from diversified and complementary investment strategies, as well as to gain market insights and professional investment knowledge.\n\nThe expenses associated with employing external fund managers include fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. These expenses vary annually, primarily due to market factors.\n\n## Risk management and monitoring\n\nThe increasing complexity of the investment environment underscores the importance of risk management. The HKMA has established stringent control measures and investment guidelines for portfolios managed by both internal and external fund managers and closely monitors compliance with these guidelines and regulations. The HKMA has strengthened risk assessment to accommodate the Exchange Fund’s increasingly diversified investments and employs risk-control tools to evaluate market risk under both normal and extremely adverse conditions. Additionally, the HKMA conducts detailed performance attribution analyses to identify factors contributing to different investment outcomes. This helps assess how best to utilise the investment management expertise of both internal and external fund managers.\n\n## Responsible investment\n\nThe HKMA is committed to responsible investment. For instance, it has adopted the Principles of Responsible Ownership published by the Securities and Futures Commission. These principles aim to assist investors in determining the best methods to fulfil their ownership responsibilities in relation to investments in Hong Kong-listed companies. In managing the Exchange Fund, the HKMA has developed internal guidelines on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors. These guidelines apply to the selection, appointment, and monitoring of external fund managers. External fund managers appointed to actively manage Hong Kong equity portfolios are required to comply with the Principles of Responsible Ownership when managing such investments. Overall, the HKMA has integrated ESG factors into its internal procedures for investment and related monitoring activities. The HKMA will continue to monitor developments in ESG-related standards and assess how these standards can be further incorporated into the investment process. Furthermore, to promote international cooperation in responsible investment, the HKMA has become a member of FCLTGlobal, a non-profit organisation dedicated to fostering long-term, goal-based business and investment decisions.\n\n# Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\n## The financial markets in 2018\n\nIn 2018, several risk factors that had previously been underestimated by the market materialised. These included the pace of US interest rate normalisation, the impact of the US government’s foreign trade policy and protectionism on global trade, and geopolitical risks. These factors caused significant volatility and adjustments in global financial markets.\n\nEscalating US-China trade disputes raised considerable concern among investors, leading to repeated declines in emerging markets and Hong Kong equities from the end of January. The Hang Seng Index fell by as much as 27% from its high in that month. From the fourth quarter onwards, major European and US equity markets also experienced sharp declines, recording double-digit losses. Overall, global equity markets declined in 2018, with the MSCI World Index, which covers developed country equity markets, falling by 10.4%, and the MSCI Emerging Markets Index declining by 16.6%.\n\nIn the bond markets, US Treasury yields generally rose in 2018 due to US monetary policy normalisation. However, bond markets remained volatile throughout the year. For example, the yield on 10-year US Treasury securities increased from around 2.5% at the beginning of the year to a seven-year high of 3.2% in November. However, by year-end, yields softened to 2.7% as investors grew concerned about US-China trade disputes and shifted towards safe-haven assets.\n\nIn currency markets, the US dollar strengthened during the year in line with US interest rate hikes. The US dollar index rose by 4.4%, while major currencies such as the euro and the renminbi fell by approximately 5% against the US dollar. Additionally, some emerging markets faced domestic political and economic instability, causing their currencies to weaken further. For example, the Argentine peso and the Turkish lira fell by approximately 50% and 30% against the US dollar, respectively. In contrast, safe-haven demand drove the Japanese yen up by 2.7% against the US dollar.\n\nTable 1 presents the performance of major currencies, bond markets, and equity markets in 2018.\n\nTable 1: Market returns in 2018\n\n## Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\nIn 2018, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$10.9 billion. This included bond investment gains of HK$57.4 billion, losses on Hong Kong equities of HK$20.7 billion, losses on other equities of HK$38.7 billion, a currency translation effect of HK$9 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets, and other investment income of HK$21.9 billion held by the investment holding subsidiaries of the Exchange Fund. Meanwhile, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation loss of HK$5 billion.\n\nAs of the end of 2018, the total assets of the Exchange Fund amounted to HK$40,549 billion. The total market value of the Long-Term Growth Portfolio’s investments was HK$2,836 billion, with private equity accounting for HK$1,911 billion and real estate accounting for HK$925 billion. The total amount of investment commitments made but not yet drawn down was HK$2,024 billion.\n\nThe Exchange Fund (excluding the Strategic Portfolio) achieved an investment return of 0.3% in 2018, with the Investment Portfolio returning -2.4% and the Backing Portfolio returning 2.1%. The annualised internal rate of return of the Long-Term Growth Portfolio since its inception in 2009 was 12.9%.\n\nFigure 1 illustrates the annual rates of return of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2018. Table 2 shows the Exchange Fund’s investment returns in 2018 and the average investment returns over different periods. The Exchange Fund’s average return over the past three years was 3.2%, over the past five years was 2.1%, over the past ten years was 2.8%, and since 1994 was 4.7%3. Table 3 provides the currency composition of the Exchange Fund’s assets as of 31 December 2018."}

2019年1月1日的主要人力資源數據\n\n# 2018年組織架構變動\n\n外匯基金投資辦公室於8月1日成立，取代過往由儲備管理部與風險管理及監察部負責的投資及相關風險管理職能。外匯基金投資辦公室的成立凸顯金管局的投資職能，提升其機構形象，並能更靈活應對市場的變化，以配合持續擴展及多元化的外匯基金投資工作。\n\n表1按部門列出金管局的職位編制及實際職員人數。\n\n表1 2019年1月1日金管局職位編制及實際職員人數\n\n負責監察投資風險的員工為外匯基金投資辦公室組織架構的一部分， 在此則歸納於風險管理及監察部以方便呈示其工作職能。\n\n# 薪酬福利政策及薪酬檢討機制\n\n財政司司長透過外匯基金諮詢委員會聽取其轄下管治委員會的意見，並參考市場薪酬水平及做法，決定金管局員工的薪酬及服務條件。薪酬組合包括現金薪酬及公積金，另設一些基本福利。現金薪酬包括每月固定薪酬（即基本薪酬）及根據員工工作表現每年一次過發放的浮動薪酬。\n\n財政司司長每年檢討金管局員工薪酬時，會透過外匯基金諮詢委員會聽取其轄下管治委員會的建議，並考慮管治委員會對金管局過去一年的表現評估、獨立人力資源顧問公司進行的金融業薪酬調查結果，以及其他相關因素。個別工作表現優秀的員工的薪酬亦可能獲得特別調整，以保持其薪酬競爭力。\n\n金管局按個別員工的工作表現，分配獲批准用作調整年度固定薪酬及浮動薪酬的款項；而適用於負責投資的員工的浮動薪酬制度，則旨在加強其投資表現與薪酬的連繫。助理總裁及以上職級員工的固定薪酬調整及浮動薪酬的發放，是由財政司司長經參考管治委員會的意見後批准，有關員工在會議討論到其薪酬的議案時會避席。主管及以下職級員工的固定薪酬調整及浮動薪酬的發放，則由金管局總裁根據財政司司長授權，並按照獲批准用作支付薪酬的整筆款項來決定。\n\n# 高層人員薪酬\n\n表2列載2018年高層人員的薪酬資料。\n\n1. 除累積年假外，服務不足1年的員工所得的實際薪酬會化作全年計算，以得出有關職級的平均全年薪酬。\n2. 本表所載員工人數包括服務不足1年的員工。金管局高層人員人數包括香港按揭證券有限公司總裁、處置機制辦公室專員及外匯基金投資辦公室首席營運官在內。\n3. 其他福利包括公積金或合約酬金（視情況而定）、醫療及人壽保險，以及年內累積的年假。這些福利會因應個別高層人員的服務條件而有所不同。\n","terms":{"10年期美國國庫券收益率":["10-year US Treasury yields"],"2014\/2015年為基期的數列":["2014\/2015-based series"],"2018年的金融市場":["The financial

public education programmes and other channels to enhance public understanding of its policies and operations. During the year, the HKMA continued to strengthen its corporate governance, including supporting staff to enhance their professional capabilities, strictly controlling finances and strengthening information technology security, in order to meet the challenges brought about by the implementation of new measures and the increasingly heavy workload.\n\n# Maintaining Contact with the Public\n\n## Media Relations and Social Media\n\nThe HKMA maintains close contact with the media to enhance its transparency and promote public understanding of its policies and work. In 2018, the HKMA organised a total of 96 public media events, including 21 press conferences, 11 stand-up interviews and 64 other public events. In addition, 39 media interviews were arranged during the year, and 462 bilingual press releases were issued, with a large number of media enquiries handled daily.\n\nTo enhance public understanding of the HKMA’s core activities, the HKMA organised media briefings and workshops for local and overseas media covering a wide range of topics, including the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), fintech development, green finance and infrastructure financing. In addition to enriching the content of its existing YouTube channel and LinkedIn page, the HKMA launched an official Facebook page in July to further utilise social media to strengthen communication with the public.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive Mr Norman Chan (left) and the Environment Bureau’s mascot “Big Waster” jointly promoted the use of good-as-new banknotes for lai-sees through social media.\n\n## Public Enquiries\n\nThe Public Enquiry Service is an effective channel for enhancing public understanding of the HKMA’s core activities and operations. In 2018, a total of 9,950 enquiries were handled, about half of which were related to banking policies and regulations, consumer banking issues, banknotes and coins, particularly the Coin Collection Programme, banking products and services, banking-related guidelines and circulars, the Faster Payment System (FPS), virtual banking and the 2018 New Series Hong Kong Banknotes.\n\nFigure 1 shows the total number of public enquiries received each year since 2015, and Figure 2 shows the proportion of different types of enquiries received in 2018.\n\n**Figure 1** Total number of public enquiries\n\n**Figure 2** Enquiries received in 2018, classified by nature\n\n## Publications\n\nIn addition to the HKMA Annual Report, the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report and four issues of the Quarterly Bulletin in 2018, and regularly updated the Monthly Statistical Bulletin to provide the latest and topical information and analysis on Hong Kong’s currency, banking and economic affairs. In addition, the HKMA published 13 inSight articles elaborating on various topical issues related to its work.\n\n## HKMA Website\n\nThe HKMA’s corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk) provides over 60,000 pages of information in English and traditional and simplified Chinese versions to facilitate public access to its latest information. The website also contains the “Register of Authorised Institutions and Local Representative Offices” and the “Register of Securities Staff of Authorised Institutions” maintained under Section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the “Register of Stored Value Facility Licensees” maintained under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance. The website features special pages and prominent quick links to alert the public to new HKMA initiatives, such as FPS, and important and timely matters, such as guarding against telephone scams and the parking locations of Coin Carts under the Coin Collection Programme.\n\nTo encourage the banking sector to implement open application programming interfaces (APIs), the HKMA led by example by providing open APIs on its website from July to facilitate public access to its important information. The first batch of 50 sets of open API data was successfully launched in July, covering areas most frequently accessed by the public, such as banking system and Exchange Fund statistics, press releases and the Coin Cart Schedule. The remaining 80 sets of data will be launched in phases by mid-2019. To further facilitate public access to the HKMA’s latest news and information on the website, it is comprehensively revising the website’s design and content to make it more user-friendly. The newly designed website is expected to be launched in 2019.\n\nThe HKMA is leading by example in promoting the development and application of open APIs.\n\n## Public Education Programmes\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre, located on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre, introduces the HKMA’s work to the public and enhances their understanding of monetary and banking matters. The Information Centre is divided into an exhibition hall and a library, and is open to the public six days a week. The exhibition hall introduces the HKMA’s work and the development of Hong Kong’s currency and banking sector, and provides reading materials and exhibits for research on Hong Kong’s currency, banking and financial affairs.\n\nThe currency section of the Information Centre introduces the design, security features, production process and other interesting facts about Hong Kong’s banknotes and coins. The section underwent a revamp in the first quarter of 2018, with the addition of interactive elements such as games that combine learning with fun, allowing visitors to learn about Hong Kong’s currency while enjoying themselves. A new Bauhinia tree artwork was also added, made up of 2,018 see-through cubes crafted from shredded banknotes no longer fit for circulation, complementing a mosaic artwork in the section made from Hong Kong coins. The revamped currency section reopened on 16 August.\n\nThe Information Centre provides guided tours for visitors. During the year, it received over 59,000 visitors and provided more than 580 guided tours for schools and other groups (Figure 3). Since its opening in December 2003, the Information Centre has received a cumulative total of over 705,000 visitors. Adjacent to the exhibition hall is a library with a collection of over 26,000 books, journals and other publications for research on Hong Kong’s currency, banking, finance and central banking issues. The library also houses the “Register of Authorised Institutions and Local Representative Offices” and the “Register of Securities Staff of Authorised Institutions” as required under Section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nInteractive games were introduced to explain the production process of Hong Kong banknotes.\n\nThe Bauhinia tree artwork is suspended in mid-air, with lighting effects showcasing its beauty in different seasons.\n\nThe Information Centre provides guided tours for schools and other groups.\n\nSecondary school students and teachers from various districts attended a public education seminar.\n\nTo maintain contact with the community and enhance public understanding of its work, the HKMA organised three public education seminars in 2018, attracting about 1,500 secondary school students and teachers. Topics covered included LERS, Hong Kong banknotes, banking system stability, the Deposit Protection Scheme, FPS, stored value facilities, fintech, consumer protection and careers in the financial industry. Since its launch in 1998, the education seminar has been attended by nearly 60,000 teachers and students.\n\n**Figure 3** Types of groups visiting the Information Centre in 2018\n\n## HKMA Staff\n\nThe HKMA is part of the government structure but employs staff on non-civil service terms to attract talent with appropriate experience and expertise. As a public-sector entity, it continuously streamlines its work processes to improve efficiency and cost-effectiveness. The HKMA strives to maintain a lean and flexible organisational structure and, where possible, implements new measures and copes with increasing workloads by redeploying existing staff.\n\nThe HKMA is an equal opportunities employer and ensures that employees can work in an environment free from discrimination. Its equal opportunities policy applies to recruitment, remuneration and benefits, performance appraisal, promotion, transfer\/training opportunities and general conduct.\n\nThe HKMA recruits, trains and maintains a professional and excellent workforce to achieve its policy objectives and respond flexibly to changes in work requirements. It requires its employees to maintain high standards of integrity and ethics, observe the highest standards of personal conduct and integrity at all times, and act in its best interests.\n\n## Key Human Resources Data as at 1 January 2019\n\n## Organisational Changes in 2018\n\nThe Exchange Fund Investment Office (EFIO) was established on 1 August, replacing the investment and related risk management functions previously performed by the Reserves Management Department and the Risk and Compliance Department. The establishment of the EFIO highlights the HKMA’s investment function, enhances its institutional image, and enables it to respond more flexibly to market changes in order to support the continued expansion and diversification of the Exchange Fund’s investment activities.\n\nTable 1 shows the HKMA’s establishment and actual staff numbers by department.\n\n**Table 1** HKMA establishment and actual staff numbers as at 1 January 2019\n\nStaff responsible for monitoring investment risks are part of the EFIO’s organisational structure but are grouped under the Risk and Compliance Department here for ease of presentation of their work functions.\n\n## Remuneration and Benefits Policy and Remuneration Review Mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary determines the remuneration and terms of service of HKMA staff, having regard to the advice of the Governance Sub-Committee (GSC) under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) and to market remuneration levels and practices. The remuneration package comprises a cash package and a provident fund scheme, together with some basic benefits. The cash package includes a monthly fixed pay (i.e. basic salary) and a variable pay payable once a year based on staff performance.\n\nWhen reviewing HKMA staff remuneration each year, the Financial Secretary seeks advice from the GSC under EFAC and takes into account the GSC’s assessment of the HKMA’s performance in the previous year, the results of a remuneration survey of the financial sector conducted by an independent human resources consultancy, and other relevant factors. The remuneration of individual staff members who perform exceptionally well may also be specially adjusted to maintain its competitiveness.\n\nThe HKMA allocates the funds approved for adjusting annual fixed pay and variable pay according to individual staff performance. The variable pay system applicable to investment staff is designed to strengthen the link between their investment performance and remuneration. Adjustments to fixed pay and payment of variable pay for staff at the rank of Executive Director and above are approved by the Financial Secretary after reference to the GSC’s advice, with the staff members concerned absenting themselves from the meeting when their remuneration is discussed. Adjustments to fixed pay and payment of variable pay for staff at the rank of Division Head and below are determined by the HKMA Chief Executive under the Financial Secretary’s authorisation and in accordance with the lump sum approved for payment of remuneration.\n\n## Senior Staff Remuneration\n\nTable 2 shows the remuneration of senior staff in 2018.\n\n1. Except for accumulated leave, the actual remuneration received by staff with less than one year of service is annualised to derive the average annual remuneration for the rank concerned.  \n2. The number of staff shown in this table includes staff with less than one year of service. The number of HKMA senior staff includes the Chief Executive Officer of the Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation Limited, the Commissioner of the Resolution Office and the Chief Operating Officer of EFIO.  \n3. Other benefits include provident fund or contractual bonus (as applicable), medical and life insurance, and annual leave accumulated during the year. These benefits vary according to the terms of service of individual senior staff members."}
{"zh":"# 外匯基金\n\n- 審計署署長報告\n- 外匯基金財務報表\n\n# 審計署署長報告\n\n# 獨立審計師報告致財政司司長\n\n# 意見\n\n茲證明我已審計列載於第167至273頁外匯基金及其附屬公司（「集團」）的財務報表，該等財務報表包括外匯基金及集團於2018年12月31日的資產負債表與截至該日止年度的收支帳目、全面收益表、權益變動表和現金流量表，以及財務報表的附註，包括主要會計政策概要。\n\n我認為，該等財務報表已按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》真實而中肯地反映外匯基金及集團於2018年12月31日的財務狀況及截至該日止年度的財務表現和現金流量，並已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》（第66章）第7條下所發出的指示妥為擬備。\n\n# 意見的基礎\n\n我已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示及審計署的審計準則進行審計。我根據該等準則而須承擔的責任，詳載於本報告「審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任」部分。根據該等準則，我獨立於集團，並已按該等準則履行其他道德責任。我相信，我所獲得的審計憑證是充足和適當地為我的審計意見提供基礎。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項是根據我的專業判斷，對截至2018年12月31日止年度財務報表的審計最為重要的事項。我對整體財務報表進行審計及形成意見時處理了這些事項，而我不會對這些事項提供單獨的意見。\n\n# 按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.5、2.6及40.1。\n\n於2018年12月31日，集團按公平值列帳的金融資產共36,935.89億港元，金融負債共11,338.29億港元。\n\n93%的該等金融資產及所有該等金融負債的公平值為相同資產或負債於活躍市場的報價（第1級參數），或是以估值方法估計，而所用的參數是以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第2級參數）。\n\n其餘7%的該等金融資產的公平值，是以估值方法估計，而所用的參數並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第3級參數）。有關金融資產共2,756.31億港元，主要包括非上市投資基金。\n\n鑑於所涉數額龐大及涉及估計，按公平值列帳的金融 資產及金融負債的估值屬關鍵審計事項。\n\n就按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值，審計程序包括：\n\n- 了解不同類別金融資產及金融負債的估值程序，包括相關監控措施；\n- 評價及測試監控措施，包括電腦系統的相關應用程式監控措施；\n- 就金融資產及金融負債的估值、存在、權利與責任及完整性取得函證；\n- 若使用市場報價，根據獨立來源核實價格；\n- 若所用估值方法的參數是以可觀察市場數據為基礎，評價估值方法是否適合及有關假設是否合理，以及根據獨立來源核實參數；及\n- 若所用估值方法的參數並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎，評價估值方法是否適合，以及有關假設與參數是否合理。\n\n# 按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.12、20及21。\n\n集團的投資物業按公平值列帳，於2018年12月31日共值253.21億港元。集團亦於3間聯營公司及20間合營公司擁有權益，該等公司主要業務為持有海外投資物業，有關權益共值443.36億港元。不論是由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有，該等投資物業的公平值均主要根據獨立專業估值師的估值釐定。該等估值涉及重大判斷及估計，包括所用的估值方法及假設。\n\n就按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值，審計程序包括：\n\n- 獲取及審視由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有的投資物業的估值報告，並核實公平值是根據有關估值報告所列的估值釐定；\n- 評估估值師的獨立性及資歷；及\n- 評價估值方法是否適合，以及有關假設與參數是否合理。\n\n# 其他資料\n\n金融管理專員須對其他資料負責。其他資料包括金融管理局2018年年報內的所有資料，但不包括財務報表及我的審計師報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見並不涵蓋其他資料，我亦不對其他資料發表任何形式的鑒證結論。\n\n就財務報表審計而言，我有責任閱讀其他資料，從而考慮其他資料是否與財務報表或我在審計過程中得悉的情況有重大矛盾，或者似乎存有重大錯誤陳述。基於我已執行的工作，如果我認為其他資料存有重大錯誤陳述，我需要報告該事實。在這方面，我沒有任何報告。\n\n# 金融管理專員及外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會就財務報表而須承擔的責任\n\n金融管理專員須負責按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》及行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示擬備真實而中肯的財務報表，及落實其認為必要的內部控制， 使財務報表不存有因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在擬備財務報表時，金融管理專員須負責評估集團持續經營的能力，以及在適用情況下披露與持續經營有關的事項，並以持續經營作為會計基礎。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會負責監督集團的財務報告過程。\n\n# 審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任\n\n我的目標是就整體財務報表是否不存有任何因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述取得合理保證，並發出包括我意見的審計師報告。合理保證是高水平的保證，但不能確保按審計署審計準則進行的審計定能發現所存有的任何重大錯誤陳述。錯誤陳述可以由欺詐或錯誤引起，如果合理預期它們個別或滙總起來可能影響財務報表使用者所作出的經濟決定，則會被視作重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在根據審計署審計準則進行審計的過程中，我會運用專業判斷並秉持專業懷疑態度。我亦會：\n\n- 識別和評估因欺詐或錯誤而導致財務報表存有重大錯誤陳述的風險；設計及執行審計程序以應對這些風險；以及取得充足和適當的審計憑證，作為我意見的基礎。由於欺詐可能涉及串謀、偽造、蓄意遺漏、虛假陳述，或凌駕內部控制的情況，因此未能發現因欺詐而導致重大錯誤陳述的風險，較未能發現因錯誤而導致者為高；\n- 了解與審計相關的內部控制，以設計適當的審計程序。然而，此舉並非旨在對集團內部控制的有效性發表意見；\n- 評價金融管理專員所採用的會計政策是否恰當，以及其作出的會計估計和相關資料披露是否合理；\n- 判定金融管理專員以持續經營作為會計基礎的做法是否恰當，並根據所得的審計憑證，判定是否存在與事件或情況有關，而且可能對集團持續經營的能力構成重大疑慮的重大不確定性。如果我認為存在重大不確定性，則有必要在審計師報告中請使用者留意財務報表中的相關資料披露。假若所披露的相關資料不足，我便須發出非無保留意見的審計師報告。我的結論是基於截至審計師報告日止所取得的審計憑證。然而，未來事件或情況可能導致集團不能繼續持續經營；\n- 評價財務報表的整體列報方式、結構和內容，包括披露資料，以及財務報表是否中肯反映交易和事項；及\n-

Director of Audit\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report to the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) set out on pages 167 to 273, which comprise the Group’s balance sheet as at 31 December 2018, and the income and expenditure account, the statement of comprehensive income, the statement of changes in equity and the statement of cash flows for the year then ended, together with the notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Exchange Fund and the Group as at 31 December 2018, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants. They have also been properly prepared in accordance with the directions given by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for Opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directions given by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the auditing standards of the Audit Commission. My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the “Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements” section of my report. I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities under them. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2018. These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.5, 2.6 and 40.1 to the financial statements.\n\nAs at 31 December 2018, the Group’s financial assets measured at fair value totalled HK$36,935.89 billion, and its financial liabilities totalled HK$11,338.29 billion.\n\nThe fair values of 93% of these financial assets and all of these financial liabilities were quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 inputs), or were estimated using valuation techniques whose inputs were based on observable market data (Level 2 inputs).\n\nThe fair values of the remaining 7% of these financial assets were estimated using valuation techniques whose inputs were not based on observable market data (Level 3 inputs). These financial assets totalled HK$2,756.31 billion and mainly comprised unlisted investment funds.\n\nThe valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value is a key audit matter given the significant amounts involved and the estimation required.\n\nThe audit procedures I performed in relation to the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value included the following:\n\n- Understanding the valuation processes for different categories of financial assets and financial liabilities, including related monitoring controls;\n- Evaluating and testing monitoring controls, including relevant application controls in computer systems;\n- Obtaining confirmations on the valuation, existence, rights and obligations, and completeness of financial assets and financial liabilities;\n- Verifying prices against independent sources when market quotations were used;\n- When valuation techniques whose inputs were based on observable market data were used, evaluating whether the valuation techniques were appropriate and the assumptions were reasonable, and verifying the inputs against independent sources; and\n- When valuation techniques whose inputs were not based on observable market data were used, evaluating whether the valuation techniques were appropriate and whether the assumptions and inputs were reasonable.\n\n# Valuation of investment properties measured at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.12, 20 and 21 to the financial statements.\n\nThe Group’s investment properties were measured at fair value and totalled HK$253.21 billion as at 31 December 2018. The Group also held interests in three associates and 20 joint ventures whose principal activities were holding overseas investment properties, with such interests totalling HK$443.36 billion. The fair values of these investment properties, whether held directly by the Group or by associates or joint ventures, were primarily determined based on valuations by independent professional valuers. These valuations involved significant judgements and estimates, including the valuation techniques and assumptions used.\n\nThe audit procedures I performed in relation to the valuation of investment properties measured at fair value included the following:\n\n- Obtaining and reviewing valuation reports for investment properties held directly by the Group or by associates or joint ventures, and verifying that the fair values were determined based on the valuations stated in those reports;\n- Assessing the independence and qualifications of the valuers; and\n- Evaluating whether the valuation techniques were appropriate and whether the assumptions and inputs were reasonable.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises all the information in the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s Annual Report for 2018, but does not include the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information, and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee in relation to the financial statements\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is responsible for preparing financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants and with the directions given by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for implementing such internal control as it determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the auditing standards of the Audit Commission will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with the auditing standards of the Audit Commission, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. I also:\n\n- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.\n- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\n- Conclude on the appropriateness of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- Obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. I bear full responsibility for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide a statement to the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and the related safeguards, if applicable.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements for the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nDirector of Audit\nChu Nai-cheung\n\n4 April 2019"}

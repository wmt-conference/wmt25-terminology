{"zh":"# 總裁報告\n\n2016年的全球政經舞台上「黑天鵝」身影頻仍，英國脫歐公投和美國總統大選結果固然令各種民調淪為笑柄，但更出乎意料的卻是金融市場的反應。以美國大選為例，特朗普當選消息令美股三大指數的期貨在開市前急挫，但開市不久美股指數隨即反彈，此後凱歌高奏，屢創新高。連串事件，凸顯了傳統智慧和思維對預測市場能力的局限性，也標誌着未來環球局勢發展的重大不確定性。\n\n過去一年，多項主要金融數據都反映市場情緒異常敏感：美國十年期國庫債券收益率在7月跌至1.36厘歷史低位後，在美國總統大選後的12月中旬飆升至2.6厘。反映美元兌一籃子貨幣走勢的美匯指數在年底升至14年高位；紐約原油期貨價格由年初每桶26美元低位反彈至年底的54美元。本港股市方面，恒生指數全年微升86點，但期內峰谷差逾6,000點。外圍形勢驚濤駭浪，更形金融體系尤其是貨幣和銀行體系穩定的重要和可貴。\n\n2016年1月，國際對沖基金部署狙擊人民幣和港元的傳言甚囂塵上，人心虛怯。金管局迅即向市場發放明確、堅定的訊息，我們絕對有信心、有能力捍衛聯匯制度和香港的金融體系穩定，適時穩住了市場信心。綜觀2016年全年，港元長時間貼近強方兌換保證。由於銀行體系資金非常充裕，即使去年12月和今年3月美國聯儲局加息，對港元利率和匯率並未有明顯的即時影響。\n\n香港銀行體系繼續穩步發展，去年整體貸款錄得6.5%溫和增長，資產質素保持良好，不良貸款比率維持在0.85%的健康水平，遠低於2000年以來約2%的長期平均水平。銀行體系的資本充足率和流動性比率均保持在高於法定要求的高水平。在樓宇按揭業務方面，經過七輪逆周期措施，新造住宅物業按揭平均成數從2009年9月的64%下降至2016年底的51%，平均供款與入息比率也從2010年8月的41%下降至2016年底的34%，為樓市周期一旦逆轉而令銀行體系受到衝擊時，提供了所需的緩衝。金管局會繼續密切留意樓市的發展，因應周期變化而採取合適措施，以保持銀行體系穩定。\n\n進一步強化銀行體系穩定的立法工作去年取得令人鼓舞的進展。優化存款保障制度和針對金融機構「大得不能倒」風險的兩條法例，及時在上屆立法會任期屆滿前順利通過。前者加快存款保障金的發放速度，簡化發放程序，有助加強存戶對銀行體系的信心；後者則為包括銀行在內的金融機構建立處置機制，防範這些機構一旦倒閉而引發的系統性金融風險，並盡量避免動用公帑為它們「包底埋單」。金管局已在今年4月1日設立處置機制辦公室，落實執行法例的要求和跟進工作。\n\n銀行業素有「百業之母」之稱，是實體經濟和普羅市民日常生活倚重的儲蓄、支付渠道和信貸來源。年內，部分中小企業界代表反映融資有困難。金管局即時與銀行界溝通，希望銀行在維持審慎風險管理的情況下，盡可能為中小企的營運和發展繼續提供資金支援。我們又透過轄下香港按揭證券公司，加強向工商界推廣政府的「中小企融資擔保計劃」，並與銀行業界緊密溝通，以釋除疑慮、釐清誤解及理順處理壞帳的索償程序，從而提高銀行參與該計劃的意願。多管齊下，收到了一定成效，根據金管局對銀行進行的調查，中小企整體信貸額度在去年保持平穩，超過九成企業的信貸額度得以維持甚至增加。同時，「中小企融資擔保計劃」的申請數字亦明顯上升。\n\n近年來金管局大力推動普及金融，就是考慮到基本銀行服務已是營商和日常生活不可或缺的環節。去年當我們得知有些海外公司和初創企業在香港開戶遇到困難後，旋即展開跟進工作，與多個國際商會和企業協會聯繫，並跟銀行業界深入溝通，對症下藥。去年9月我向香港所有銀行簽發通告，闡釋應如何理解金管局針對反洗錢和恐怖分子資金籌集活動的「風險為本」監管原則，如何將這項原則應用在開戶申請和對現有客戶的盡職審查措施上，強調銀行不應對所有客戶採用「一刀切」的要求和程序。經我們與銀行和商界協商後，企業開戶情況有所改善，但仍有進步空間，這也是我們今年工作重點之一。\n\n普及金融還涉及銀行分行服務的覆蓋面。金管局一直鼓勵銀行在營商圖利之餘，也要顧及市民的基本銀行服務需要。金融科技一日千里，銀行提供服務的渠道也更趨多元化。除了日益普及的網上銀行服務外，去年多家銀行紛紛推出流動銀行車或視像櫃員機服務，提供較傳統櫃員機更貼身、更全面的銀行服務。在我們的推動下，多家銀行也計劃在偏遠地區設立實體分行，加強對當區居民的服務。\n\n金融中心的發展就如逆水行舟，因此，金管局多年來不斷為香港金融業發展尋求新的契機，開拓新的領域。2016年可說是成果豐碩的一年，當中又以金融科技(Fintech)和基建融資為亮點。\n\n在金融科技方面，香港的零售支付服務在2016年進入新時代。金管局去年發出13個儲值支付工具牌照，通過發牌和恒常監管制度為零售支付服務創造有利的營商環境，配以一系列公眾教育宣傳，讓消費者在享受新科技帶來的便捷之餘，權益也得到合理保障。\n\n此外，去年3月金管局成立了金融科技促進辦公室，以此平台推動與銀行業相關的金融科技發展。幾個月間，我們推出多項新猷，包括「網絡防衛計劃」(Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative)，為強化銀行體系網絡安全建立風險評估、資訊共享和人才培訓三足鼎立的新平台。我們並與香港應用科技研究院（應科院）合作，開展分布式分類帳技術(distributed ledger technology)專項研究，探討該技術在香港銀行業應用的可行性，並在應科院設立金融科技創新中心(Fintech Innovation Hub)，為銀行業界和金融科技界提供技術支援。金管局的銀行監管部門還設立「金融科技監管沙盒」(Fintech Supervisory Sandbox)，讓銀行在較小和可控範圍內測試新技術的應用，為新產品、新服務的開發提速。自去年9月至今年3月，已有6家銀行共14項新技術項目使用沙盒進行測試，部分項目亦已相繼推出市場，為市民帶來更多金融科技的新產品。\n\n世界各地對基建融資的需求巨大，特別是「一帶一路」倡議提出以來，基建融資更成中外矚目的議題。香港是亞洲的國際金融中心，在基建融資領域極具優勢。去年7月金管局成立了基建融資促進辦公室(Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office，簡稱IFFO)，搭建一個嶄新和獨特的平台，匯聚60多家世界級的多邊機構、機構投資者、銀行、保險公司和其他金融機構、基建項目的建設和營運方、各類專業機構等，就基建投融資課題互通訊息、交流經驗、尋求合作機會。IFFO成立至今已舉辦十多場大型會議、研討會和工作坊，金管局並分別與國際金融公司(International Finance Corporation)、全球基礎設施中心(Global Infrastructure Hub)、國家開發銀行(China Development Bank)和中國進出口銀行(The Export-Import Bank of China)簽署了共同促進基建投融資活動的《諒解備忘錄》。起步時間雖然不長，但為香港未來作為基建投融資中心奠下堅實的基礎。\n\n拆牆鬆綁是提升競爭力的不二法門。年內，金管局積極參與和支援特區政府修訂稅務條例，向在港經營集團內部財資業務的企業提供有利的稅務環境。我們並積極接觸跨國企業，吸引它們來港發展或擴充企業財資活動，藉此進一步強化香港金融市場的功能。\n\n去年的離岸人民幣市場處於調整期。受市場波動和對人民幣匯率預期等因素影響，全球離岸人民幣資金池規模普遍收縮。儘管如此，香港仍穩執離岸人民幣業務的牛耳，保持全球最大的人民幣資金池，經香港結算的人民幣維持在日均約8,600億元人民幣高位。為進一步優化香港離岸人民幣市場的流動性安排，去年10月我們將一級流動性提供行由7家增至9家，支援雙邊流動資金的總額度由原來的140億元人民幣增至180億元，確保在離岸人民幣市場資金出現緊絀的情況下，仍可保持市場有序運作。去年12月股票市場「深港通」開通，令香港的人民幣業務再添動力。金管局亦正與內地有關當局研究「債券通」方案，進一步便利兩地投資者參與債券市場，並優化債券市場基礎設施的聯繫。\n\n儘管去年全球投資環境充斥着各種不穩因素，但有賴於過去一段時間所採取的多項防禦性部署，外匯基金去年錄得681億港元投資收入。自1994年以來外匯基金的複合年度投資回報率達4.8%，高於同期2.1%的本地通脹率。\n\n外匯基金將繼續推動多元化投資，包括進一步擴展資產類別，加大對於信貸資產、抵禦通脹類投資產品和新興市場的投資。而作為多元化投資旗艦的「長期增長組合」，透過私募股權和房地產項目等投資於另類資產。該組合自2009年啟動以來一直保持不俗的成績，成立至今的平均內部回報率年率約12%，而隨着政府「未來基金」部分投放於該組合，我們加快了投資步伐，去年底「長期增長組合」的資產規模約1,818億港元，已批出但未提取作投資的總額約1,338億港元。外匯基金將繼續恪守「保本先行、長期增值」的投資策略，在保持充裕的流動性和備用資金的前提下，尋求長遠穩定的回報。\n","terms":{"10年Plus同心展關懷標誌":["10

While the results of the UK’s Brexit referendum and the US presidential election rendered various polls laughable, the reactions of financial markets were even more unexpected. Take the US election as an example: news of Trump’s victory caused the futures of the three major US stock indices to plunge before the market opened, but the indices rebounded shortly after opening and continued to hit new highs. These events highlight the limitations of traditional wisdom and thinking in predicting market behaviour and signal significant uncertainties in future global developments.\n\nOver the past year, several key financial indicators reflected unusually sensitive market sentiment: the yield on 10-year US Treasury bonds fell to a historic low of 1.36% in July, then soared to 2.6% in mid-December after the US presidential election. The US dollar index, which reflects the greenback’s performance against a basket of currencies, rose to a 14-year high at the end of the year; New York crude oil futures rebounded from a low of US$26 per barrel at the beginning of the year to US$54 at the end. As for Hong Kong’s stock market, the Hang Seng Index rose slightly by 86 points for the year, but the peak-to-trough difference during the period exceeded 6,000 points. The turbulent external environment underscores the importance and value of financial stability, particularly in the monetary and banking systems.\n\nIn January 2016, rumours that international hedge funds were planning to attack the renminbi and the Hong Kong dollar caused widespread anxiety. The HKMA promptly sent a clear and firm message to the market that we had absolute confidence and ability to defend the linked exchange rate system and maintain Hong Kong’s financial stability, which helped to stabilise market confidence in a timely manner. Throughout 2016, the Hong Kong dollar remained close to the strong side of its convertibility undertaking for a long time. As the banking system was flush with funds, even though the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates in December 2016 and March 2017, there was no significant immediate impact on Hong Kong dollar interest rates and the exchange rate.\n\nHong Kong’s banking system continued to grow steadily last year, with overall loans recording a moderate growth of 6.5%. Asset quality remained sound, with the classified loan ratio staying at a healthy level of 0.85%, far below the long-term average of around 2% since 2000. The banking system’s capital adequacy ratios and liquidity ratios both remained at high levels above statutory minimum requirements. In the mortgage lending business, after seven rounds of countercyclical measures, the average loan-to-value ratio for new residential property mortgages fell from 64% in September 2009 to 51% at the end of 2016, and the average debt-servicing ratio fell from 41% in August 2010 to 34% at the end of 2016, providing a necessary buffer in case the property market cycle reverses and impacts the banking system. The HKMA will continue to closely monitor property market developments and take appropriate measures in response to cyclical changes to maintain banking stability.\n\nLegislative work to further strengthen banking stability made encouraging progress last year. Two pieces of legislation – one to improve the Deposit Protection Scheme and the other to address the \"too big to fail\" risk of financial institutions – were passed just before the end of the last Legislative Council term. The former speeds up the payout of deposit protection funds and simplifies the payout process, helping to strengthen depositors’ confidence in the banking system; the latter establishes a resolution regime for financial institutions, including banks, to prevent systemic financial risks arising from the failure of these institutions and to avoid using public funds to \"bail them out\" as much as possible. The HKMA established a Resolution Office on 1 April this year to implement the requirements of the legislation and follow up on its work.\n\nThe banking industry has long been known as \"the mother of all industries\" and is a vital source of savings, payment channels and credit for the real economy and ordinary citizens’ daily lives. During the year, some representatives of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) reported difficulties in obtaining financing. The HKMA immediately communicated with the banking sector, hoping that banks would continue to provide financial support for SMEs’ operations and development as much as possible while maintaining prudent risk management. We also, through our subsidiary the Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation, stepped up promotion of the government’s SME Financing Guarantee Scheme to the business sector and maintained close communication with the banking sector to address concerns, clarify misunderstandings and streamline the claims process for handling bad debts, thereby increasing banks’ willingness to participate in the scheme. These efforts have yielded some results: according to a survey conducted by the HKMA on banks, overall credit facility limits for SMEs remained stable last year, with more than 90% of enterprises maintaining or even increasing their credit facility limits. At the same time, applications for the SME Financing Guarantee Scheme also increased significantly.\n\nIn recent years, the HKMA has vigorously promoted financial inclusion, recognising that basic banking services are essential for business and daily life. Last year, when we learned that some overseas companies and start-up companies were having difficulty opening accounts in Hong Kong, we immediately followed up, contacting several international chambers of commerce and SME associations and communicating closely with the banking sector to address the problem. In September last year, I issued a circular to all banks in Hong Kong explaining how to understand the HKMA’s \"risk-based\" regulatory principles for anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing activities, how to apply these principles to account opening applications and due diligence measures for existing customers, and emphasising that banks should not adopt a \"one-size-fits-all\" approach and procedures for all customers. After our consultations with banks and the business sector, the situation regarding corporate account opening has improved, but there is still room for progress, which is one of our work priorities this year.\n\nFinancial inclusion also involves the coverage of bank branch services. The HKMA has always encouraged banks to, while pursuing profits, also take into account the basic banking service needs of citizens. Financial technology is advancing rapidly, and banks’ service channels are becoming more diversified. In addition to the increasingly popular online banking services, many banks launched mobile bank branches or video teller machines last year, providing more personalised and comprehensive banking services than traditional ATMs. Under our encouragement, several banks also plan to set up physical branches in remote areas to enhance services to local residents.\n\nThe development of a financial centre is akin to swimming against the tide: if you don’t move forward, you fall back. That’s why the HKMA has been continuously seeking new opportunities and exploring new areas for the development of Hong Kong’s financial industry over the years. 2016 was a fruitful year, with financial technology (fintech) and infrastructure financing being the highlights.\n\nIn terms of financial technology, Hong Kong’s retail payment services entered a new era in 2016. Last year, the HKMA issued 13 stored value facility licences, creating a favourable business environment for retail payment services through a licensing and supervisory regime, coupled with a series of public education campaigns, so that consumers can enjoy the convenience brought by new technology while having their rights and interests reasonably protected.\n\nIn addition, the HKMA established a Fintech Facilitation Office in March last year to promote fintech development related to the banking industry through this platform. Within a few months, we launched several new initiatives, including the Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative, which establishes a new platform based on risk assessment, information sharing and talent training to strengthen the cybersecurity of the banking system. We also collaborated with the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute (ASTRI) to conduct a special study on distributed ledger technology to explore its feasibility for application in Hong Kong’s banking industry, and established a Fintech Innovation Hub at ASTRI to provide technical support for the banking and fintech sectors. The HKMA’s Banking Supervision Department also established a Fintech Supervisory Sandbox to allow banks to test new technologies in a smaller and more controlled environment, accelerating the development of new products and services. From September last year to March this year, six banks conducted tests on 14 new technology projects using the sandbox, and some of the projects have already been launched on the market, bringing more fintech products to citizens.\n\nThere is huge demand for infrastructure financing around the world, and it has become a topic of interest both at home and abroad, especially since the launch of the Belt and Road Initiative. Hong Kong, as Asia’s international financial centre, has a strong advantage in infrastructure financing. In July last year, the HKMA established the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO), a new and unique platform that brings together more than 60 world-class multilateral organisations, institutional investors, banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions, infrastructure project developers and operators, and various professional firms to exchange information, share experiences and explore cooperation opportunities on infrastructure investment and financing issues. Since its establishment, IFFO has organised more than a dozen large-scale conferences, seminars and workshops, and the HKMA has signed memoranda of understanding with the International Finance Corporation, the Global Infrastructure Hub, the China Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank of China to jointly promote infrastructure investment and financing activities. Although it has not been long since its establishment, IFFO has laid a solid foundation for Hong Kong’s future as an infrastructure investment and financing centre.\n\nRemoving barriers is key to enhancing competitiveness. During the year, the HKMA actively participated in and supported the HKSAR government’s revision of tax laws to provide a favourable tax environment for companies operating corporate treasury centres in Hong Kong. We also actively approached multinational corporations to attract them to develop or expand their corporate treasury activities in Hong Kong, thereby further strengthening the functions of Hong Kong’s financial market.\n\nThe offshore renminbi market was in an adjustment period last year. Affected by market volatility and expectations of the renminbi exchange rate, the size of the global offshore renminbi liquidity pool generally shrank. Nevertheless, Hong Kong remained the leader in offshore renminbi business, maintaining the world’s largest renminbi liquidity pool, with renminbi settlement through Hong Kong averaging around RMB860 billion per day. To further optimise Hong Kong’s offshore renminbi market liquidity arrangements, in October last year we increased the number of primary liquidity providers from seven to nine, and raised the total amount of bilateral liquidity support from RMB14 billion to RMB18 billion, ensuring that the market can still operate in an orderly manner even if offshore renminbi funds become tight. The launch of the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect in December last year gave a further boost to Hong Kong’s renminbi business. The HKMA is also working with relevant authorities on the mainland to study a \"Bond Connect\" scheme to further facilitate participation in the bond market by investors from both sides and optimise the connectivity of bond market infrastructure.\n\nDespite various uncertainties in the global investment environment last year, thanks to the defensive measures taken over the past period, the Exchange Fund recorded investment income of HK$68.1 billion. Since 1994, the Exchange Fund’s compounded annual investment return has been 4.8%, higher than the local inflation rate of 2.1% over the same period.\n\nThe Exchange Fund will continue to promote diversified investment, including further expanding asset classes and increasing investment in credit assets, inflation-linked investment products and emerging markets. As the flagship of diversified investment, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio invests in alternative assets through private equity and real estate projects. The portfolio has performed well since its launch in 2009, with an annualised internal rate of return of around 12%, and with part of the government’s Future Fund being allocated to the portfolio, we have accelerated our investment pace: at the end of last year, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio’s asset size was around HK$181.8 billion, with a total of around HK$133.8 billion approved but not yet drawn down for investment. The Exchange Fund will continue to adhere to the investment strategy of \"capital preservation first, long-term growth next\", seeking long-term stable returns while maintaining sufficient liquidity and reserve funds."}

During the year, the territory’s stock and residential property markets experienced volatility, while housing affordability remained constrained.\n\nDespite heightened risks and shocks in global markets, Hong Kong’s banking system remained robust. Banks’ capital and liquidity positions stayed sound, and although asset quality deteriorated slightly, it remained at a healthy level.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained stable despite a volatile external environment, demonstrating the resilience of the Linked Exchange Rate System to external shocks.\n\nThe money market continued to function smoothly, with ample interbank liquidity. In December, following the US Federal Reserve’s decision to raise the target range for the Federal Funds Rate, Hong Kong’s base rate was increased by 25 basis points to 1.00%.\n\n# Banking System Stability\n\nThe HKMA strengthened its oversight of banks’ risk governance frameworks, as well as their credit, liquidity, and technology risk management. It also took concrete steps to promote financial inclusion and address the challenges businesses face in opening and maintaining bank accounts in Hong Kong.\n\nSignificant progress was made in regulatory policy, particularly in preparing for the implementation of international supervisory and accounting standards in Hong Kong, including the resolution framework under the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance.\n\n# Hong Kong’s Status as an International Financial Centre\n\nHong Kong retained its position as a global hub for offshore renminbi business and as an asset management centre. Further improvements to the tax regime created a more favourable environment for attracting multinational corporations to establish corporate treasury centres in the city.\n\nTo develop Hong Kong into an infrastructure financing centre and a fintech hub, the HKMA established the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office and the Fintech Facilitation Office. The HKMA successfully began implementing the regulatory regime for stored value facilities and retail payment systems, issuing 13 stored value facility licences in the process.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\nDespite a challenging investment environment marked by black swan events, the Exchange Fund achieved an overall investment return of 2%, thanks to a series of defensive measures implemented over the past few years that enhanced its resilience to shocks.\n\nThe HKMA accelerated its diversification of investments, particularly in the long-term growth portfolio.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintained effective communication with society and markets through media, public education activities, and other channels, enhancing public understanding of its policies and operations.\n\nThe HKMA continued to strengthen its corporate governance, promoting professional development among employees, maintaining strict financial discipline, and enhancing information technology security to address the challenges posed by new initiatives and increasing workloads."}

{"zh":"# 經濟及金融環境\n\n隨着環球經濟及貿易活動疲弱，香港經濟增長在2016年回軟。面對外圍環境不明朗因素加劇，預期2017年經濟增長仍然溫和。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 概覽\n\n香港經濟增長在2016年放緩，實質本地生產總值增長由2015年的2.4%降至1.9%（表1）。淨出口是主要拖累，當中訪港旅遊業疲弱令服務輸出受壓（圖1）。本地需求動力亦放緩，但繼續為整體經濟增長提供主要支持。勞工市場大致保持穩定，失業率維持於3.3至3.4%的低位。由於本地成本及外部價格壓力減退，消費物價通脹進一步放緩。面對波動的外圍環境及多變的市場氣氛，資產市場增添起伏。鑑於住宅物業市場再度暢旺，政府於11月實施新印花稅措施。\n\n儘管外圍環境波動及美元利率上升，本港外匯及貨幣市場繼續運作暢順。港元現貨匯率於1月份略為轉弱後一直在7.75附近水平徘徊。年內兌換保證並無被觸發，總結餘與未償還外匯基金票據及債券合計幾乎維持不變，約為1.2萬億港元。繼美國於12月中加息後，金管局基本利率由0.75厘上調至1厘。香港銀行同業拆息及較長期債券收益率維持在相對較低水平，但在接近年底時稍升，部分反映美元相應拆息及收益率的走勢。整體銀行貸款增長在2016年加快至6.5%。雖然整體貸款質素略為轉差，但特定分類貸款比率仍然維持在極低水平。\n\n圖

本地需求\n\n本地需求的增長力度在2016年略為減弱。儘管穩定的就業及收入狀況繼續為私人消費帶來支持，但其增速仍降至1.6%，部分反映經濟不明朗因素加劇。政府消費增長亦略為減慢至3.3%。本地固定資本形成總額繼續按季大幅上落（圖2），累計全年收縮0.5%。私營部門機器及設備購置成為主要拖累，在營商前景欠佳下連續第3年收縮，而樓宇及建造活動則因住屋動工項目增加而轉殷。\n\n圖 2 本地需求\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 外部需求\n\n香港出口在接近2016年底時有回穩跡象，但綜合全年表現仍然乏力（圖3）。貨品出口較2015年的低基數上升1.7%。香港對先進經濟體的出口仍然呆滯；但在區內貿易流動轉趨穩定下，香港對中國內地、印度、韓國、新加坡及台灣的出口則較2015年好轉。\n\n部分反映零售銷售在近年急速增長後轉趨正常化，香港服務輸出在2016年顯著收縮3.1%。貨品進口在2015年收縮後於2016年收復部分失地，服務輸入則部分受惠於本地居民外遊意欲而持續增長。2016年整體貿易順差收窄，拖累本地經濟增長。\n\n圖

通脹\n\n通脹壓力在2016年仍然受控。剔除政府一次性紓緩措施的影響後，基本通脹率由2015年的2.5%下降至2016年的2.3%（圖4）。在早前新訂私人住宅租金下調所帶來的傳遞效應下，綜合消費物價指數中的租金組成項目通脹回落。受惠於全球商品價格偏軟及港元強勢，進口價格通脹受到遏抑。另一方面，在勞工成本穩定增長及租金成本壓力（尤其零售範疇）有所紓緩下，本地成本壓力保持溫和。\n\n圖 4 基本消費物價通脹\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 勞工市場\n\n勞工市場在2016年大致保持穩定，勞工供求升幅相若。按行業分析，旅遊相關行業的勞工市場狀況轉差，其他行業則大致平穩。整體而言，經季節因素調整失業率由2015年的3.3%稍升至3.4%（圖5）。在勞工市場穩定下，名義工資在首3季上升3.8%，而2015年的升幅為4.6%。首3季實質工資亦上升0.9%，而2015年的升幅為1.5%。\n\n圖 5 勞工市場狀況\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 股市\n\n香港股市在2016年大幅上落。受到人民幣貶值壓力及內地股市波動所影響，恒生指數於2月份跌至3年來的低位（圖6）。本港股市在3月份跟隨美國及其他主要股市顯著造好而回升。儘管英國脫歐公投觸發市場波動，但在外界預期美國聯邦儲備局會放緩加息步伐及其他主要央行推行貨幣寬鬆政策下，市場氣氛迅速改善。恒生指數於9月份升至24,100點的一年高位。然而，受到美國總統選舉結果及預計美國會加快加息步伐所影響，本港股市在第4季再度受壓。整體而言，恒生指數於2016年微升0.4%，在2015年則下跌7.2%。平均每日成交額由上年的1,056億港元降至669億港元，而本港股市集資總額亦由上年的11,156億港元減少至4,901億港元。\n\n圖

物業市場\n\n住宅物業市場在2016年略為波動。物業成交量於第1季錄得歷史新低後，在其後數月有所回升，但在11月推出新印花稅措施後再度下挫。整體而言，成交量在2016年稍跌至54,701宗。另一方面，樓價自第2季起上升並超越2015年9月的高位，2016年的累計升幅為7.8%（圖6）。置業負擔能力依然偏緊，樓價與收入比率為15.9，超越1997年的歷史高位；而收入槓桿比率為72.0%，遠高於長期平均水平。2 由於銀行推出具競爭力的按揭計劃，按揭利率稍為回落，於接近年底時則跟隨香港銀行同業拆息上升而略為回升。工商物業市場方面，全年交投大致保持穩定。由於非住宅物業價格較2015年高位回落，相應租金收益率較上年微升，但仍處於低位。\n\n# 經濟前景\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n預期2017年實質本地生產總值增長將保持溫和。政府預測經濟增長幅度介乎2至3%之間，私營機構分析員預測增幅平均為2.0%。外圍方面，隨着環球宏觀經濟及金融環境變得不明朗，全球經濟及貿易增長或會保持溫和；再加上港元實質有效匯率因美元強勢而上升，將會抑制香港的出口表現。本地方面，雖然穩定的就業及收入狀況會支持消費，但受利率上升所拖累，預期私人消費會溫和增長。受惠於住屋供應增加及多個基建項目展開，樓宇及建造活動應會穩步增長，但營商氣氛疲弱及利率趨升將影響商界資本投資。\n\n# 通脹及勞工市場\n\n預計2017年通脹壓力仍然溫和。一方面環球商品價格上漲及中國內地通脹趨升或會令進口價格上升，另一方面港元轉強卻可能會令上述壓力受到遏抑。在溫和的經濟動力下，本地成本壓力仍可受控，但由於新訂住宅租金於2017年初上升，綜合消費物價指數中的租金組成項目通脹可能會稍升。市場共識預測2017年整體通脹率為1.9%，政府預期基本通脹率為2.0%。雖然不明朗因素加劇或會影響招聘意欲，私營機構分析員預計2017年失業率會維持於3.4%。\n\n# 不明朗因素及風險\n\n2017年經濟前景會受制於眾多不明朗因素，當中來自外圍環境的影響尤甚。美國新一屆政府政策的不確定性，將令環球經濟前景變得不明朗，當中可能出現的保護主義政策亦會對全球貿易帶來阻力。英國脫歐進程及歐洲幾個主要國家舉行大選，亦可能導致資產市場波動，並影響港元資金流向。此外，美國利率正常化將會令本地貨幣狀況收緊，並對實質經濟及資產價格構成下調壓力；當中樓市繼續偏緊，市場前景仍然很不明朗。短期而言，按揭息率仍然偏低、就業及收入狀況穩定，以及地產發展商加推優惠（例如折扣及現金回贈）令累積的購買力獲得釋放，均可為住宅需求帶來支持。另一方面，新印花稅措施、美國可能加快加息步伐及房屋供應穩步增長，則可能繼續為樓市帶來阻力。\n\n# 銀行體系表現\n\n儘管本港經濟面對阻力，加上國際政治事件出乎意料的結果令市場波動加劇，香港銀行體系在2016年仍然穩健。認可機構的資本及流動性狀況維持良好，資產質素輕微轉差，但仍處於健康水平。\n\n# 利率走勢\n\n隨着美國利率上升，香港銀行同業拆息在11月及12月顯著上升。反映零售銀行港元資金成本的綜合利率則輕微上升（圖7）。\n\n圖 7 香港銀行同業拆息、綜合利率及最優惠貸款利率\n\n註：\n1. 香港銀行同業拆息（每月平均數）由香港銀行公會公布。\n2. 最優惠貸款利率（每月平均數）是參考香港上海滙豐銀行有限公司所報利率。\n\n# 盈利走勢\n\n零售銀行在2016年的盈利略為改善，其香港業務的整體除稅前經營溢利增長8.7%。增長主要是由外匯及衍生工具業務收入（+39.7%）、附屬公司派發的股息收入（+123.5%）及淨利息收入（+2.8%）所帶動，不過部份增長被費用及佣金收入減少(-11.3%)所抵銷。零售銀行除稅後溢利錄得44.4%的升幅，增長主要來自非經常項目。零售銀行除稅後平均資產回報率亦相應由2015 年的 1.04% 上升至 1.44%（圖 8）。\n\n圖8 零售銀行的表現\n\n2016年零售銀行淨息差為1.32%，與2015年的水平相同（圖9）。雖然零售銀行繼續將剩餘資金配置於息率較低而流動性較高的金融投資，但利息收益的減少被利息成本下降所抵銷。\n\n圖9 零售銀行淨息差\n\n零售銀行非利息收入佔總經營收入的比例為44.3%，大致維持穩定。雖然費用與佣金收入下跌11.3%，但股息收入及外匯與衍生工具業務收入分別上升123.5%及39.7%。\n","terms":{"10年Plus同心展關懷標誌":["10 years plus Caring Organisation Logo"],"2016年存款保障計劃（修訂）條例":["Deposit

Faced with heightened uncertainty in the external environment, economic growth is expected to remain moderate in 2017.\n\n# Economic Review\n\n# Overview\n\nHong Kong’s economic growth slowed in 2016, with real GDP growth falling from 2.4% in 2015 to 1.9% (Table 1). Net exports were the main drag, with weak inbound tourism weighing on service exports (Chart 1). Domestic demand also slowed but continued to provide the main support for overall economic growth. The labour market remained largely stable, with the unemployment rate staying at a low level of 3.3% to 3.4%. Consumer price inflation eased further as local cost and external price pressures subsided. Amid a volatile external environment and fluctuating market sentiment, asset markets became more volatile. In view of the renewed buoyancy in the residential property market, the government implemented new stamp duty measures in November.\n\nDespite the volatile external environment and rising US interest rates, Hong Kong’s foreign exchange and monetary markets continued to operate smoothly. The Hong Kong dollar spot exchange rate weakened slightly in January but then hovered around 7.75. The convertibility undertaking was not triggered during the year, and the aggregate balance together with outstanding Exchange Fund paper remained almost unchanged at around HK$1.2 trillion. Following the US interest rate hike in mid-December, the HKMA Base Rate was raised from 0.75% to 1%. Hong Kong interbank offered rates (HIBORs) and longer-term bond yields remained at relatively low levels but edged up towards the end of the year, partly reflecting the movements of their US counterparts. Overall bank loan growth accelerated to 6.5% in 2016. Although overall loan quality deteriorated slightly, the classified loan ratio remained at a very low level.\n\nChart 1 Contributions of components to real GDP growth\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\nTable 1 Real GDP growth by expenditure component (compared with the preceding period)\n\nNote: The quarterly change in gross fixed capital formation adjusted for seasonal factors is not available.\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Domestic Demand\n\nThe growth of domestic demand weakened slightly in 2016. Despite stable employment and income conditions continuing to support private consumption, its growth slowed to 1.6%, partly reflecting heightened economic uncertainty. Growth in government consumption also slowed slightly to 3.3%. Gross fixed capital formation continued to fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis (Chart 2), contracting by 0.5% for the whole year. Machinery and equipment purchases by the private sector were the main drag, contracting for the third consecutive year amid a weak business outlook, while building and construction activities turned more buoyant as a result of increased housing project commencements.\n\nChart 2 Domestic demand\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# External Demand\n\nHong Kong’s exports showed signs of stabilisation towards the end of 2016, but overall performance for the year remained weak (Chart 3). Merchandise exports rose by 1.7% from a low base in 2015. Hong Kong’s exports to advanced economies remained sluggish; but exports to the mainland, India, Korea, Singapore and Taiwan improved from 2015 as regional trade flows stabilised.\n\nPartly reflecting the normalisation of retail sales after rapid growth in recent years, Hong Kong’s service exports contracted significantly by 3.1% in 2016. Merchandise imports recovered some lost ground in 2016 after contracting in 2015, while service imports continued to grow, partly supported by local residents’ outbound travel demand. The overall trade surplus narrowed in 2016, weighing on domestic economic growth.\n\nChart 3 Merchandise exports and service exports\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Inflation\n\nInflationary pressures remained under control in 2016. Excluding the effects of the government’s one-off relief measures, underlying inflation fell from 2.5% in 2015 to 2.3% in 2016 (Chart 4). Amid the pass-through effects of earlier reductions in newly let private residential rentals, inflation of the rental component in the Composite Consumer Price Index eased. Benefiting from weak global commodity prices and a strong Hong Kong dollar, inflation of import prices was contained. On the other hand, local cost pressures remained moderate as labour costs grew steadily and rental cost pressures (especially in the retail sector) eased.\n\nChart 4 Underlying consumer price inflation\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Labour Market\n\nThe labour market remained largely stable in 2016, with similar growth in both labour demand and supply. By industry, labour market conditions worsened in the tourism-related sector, but remained generally stable in other sectors. Overall, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate edged up slightly from 3.3% in 2015 to 3.4% (Chart 5). Amid a stable labour market, nominal wages rose by 3.8% in the first three quarters, compared with a 4.6% increase in 2015. Real wages also rose by 0.9% in the first three quarters, compared with a 1.5% increase in 2015.\n\nChart 5 Labour market conditions\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Stock Market\n\nHong Kong’s stock market fluctuated significantly in 2016. Affected by depreciation pressure on the renminbi and volatility in mainland stock markets, the Hang Seng Index fell to a three-year low in February (Chart 6). Hong Kong’s stock market rebounded in March, following significant gains in US and other major stock markets. Despite market volatility triggered by the Brexit referendum, market sentiment improved rapidly amid expectations that the US Federal Reserve would slow the pace of interest rate hikes and other major central banks would implement monetary easing policies. The Hang Seng Index rose to a one-year high of 24,100 in September. However, Hong Kong’s stock market came under pressure again in the fourth quarter, affected by the results of the US presidential election and expectations that the US would accelerate the pace of interest rate hikes. Overall, the Hang Seng Index rose slightly by 0.4% in 2016, after falling by 7.2% in 2015. Average daily turnover fell from HK$105.6 billion in the previous year to HK$66.9 billion, while total funds raised in Hong Kong’s stock market also fell from HK$1,115.6 billion in the previous year to HK$490.1 billion.\n\nChart 6 Asset prices\nSource: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\n\n# Property Market\n\nThe residential property market fluctuated slightly in 2016. Property transaction volume hit a historical low in the first quarter, then rebounded in the following months, but fell again after the introduction of new stamp duty measures in November. Overall, transaction volume fell slightly to 54,701 in 2016. On the other hand, property prices rose from the second quarter and surpassed the high recorded in September 2015, with a cumulative increase of 7.8% in 2016 (Chart 6). Housing affordability remained tight, with the price-to-income ratio at 15.9, surpassing the historical high recorded in 1997; and the income-to-debt ratio at 72.0%, far above the long-term average. 2 Mortgage rates fell slightly as banks launched competitive mortgage programmes, but edged up towards the end of the year as they followed the rise in HIBORs. In the commercial property market, transaction volume remained largely stable throughout the year. As non-residential property prices fell from their 2015 highs, the corresponding rental yields rose slightly from the previous year, but remained at a low level.\n\n# Economic Prospects\n\n# Economic Environment\n\nReal GDP growth is expected to remain moderate in 2017. The government forecasts economic growth of between 2% and 3%, while private sector analysts predict an average growth rate of 2.0%. Externally, as the global macroeconomic and financial environment becomes more uncertain, global economic and trade growth is likely to remain moderate; and the appreciation of the Hong Kong dollar’s real effective exchange rate due to a strong US dollar will weigh on Hong Kong’s export performance. Domestically, although stable employment and income conditions will support consumption, private consumption is expected to grow moderately, dragged down by rising interest rates. Benefiting from increased housing supply and the commencement of various infrastructure projects, building and construction activities should grow steadily, but weak business sentiment and rising interest rates will affect business capital investment.\n\n# Inflation and Labour Market\n\nInflationary pressures are expected to remain moderate in 2017. On the one hand, rising global commodity prices and inflation in the mainland may push up import prices, but on the other hand, a stronger Hong Kong dollar may contain such pressures. Amid moderate economic momentum, local cost pressures should remain under control, but inflation of the rental component in the Composite Consumer Price Index may edge up slightly as newly let residential rentals rose in early 2017. Market consensus predicts overall inflation of 1.9% in 2017, while the government expects underlying inflation of 2.0%. Although heightened uncertainty may affect hiring intentions, private sector analysts expect the unemployment rate to remain at 3.4% in 2017.\n\n# Uncertainties and Risks\n\nThe economic outlook for 2017 will be constrained by numerous uncertainties, particularly those arising from the external environment. The uncertainty surrounding the policies of the new US administration will make the global economic outlook unclear, and potential protectionist policies may also hinder global trade. The Brexit process and elections in several major European countries may also cause volatility in asset markets and affect capital flows in the Hong Kong dollar. In addition, US interest rate normalisation will tighten local monetary conditions and exert downward pressure on the real economy and asset prices; the property market remains tight, and its outlook is still highly uncertain. In the short term, low mortgage rates, stable employment and income conditions, and incentives offered by property developers (such as discounts and cash rebates) that release accumulated purchasing power can all support residential demand. On the other hand, new stamp duty measures, the possibility of faster US interest rate hikes, and steady growth in housing supply may continue to weigh on the property market.\n\n# Performance of the Banking System\n\nDespite headwinds facing Hong Kong’s economy and heightened market volatility caused by unexpected outcomes of international political events, Hong Kong’s banking system remained robust in 2016. Authorised institutions’ capital and liquidity positions remained sound, and asset quality deteriorated slightly but remained healthy.\n\n# Interest Rate Trends\n\nAs US interest rates rose, HIBORs rose significantly in November and December. The composite interest rate, which reflects retail banks’ Hong Kong dollar funding costs, rose slightly (Chart 7).\n\nChart 7 Hong Kong interbank offered rates, composite interest rate and best lending rate\n\nNotes:\n1. HIBORs (monthly averages) are published by the Hong Kong Association of Banks.\n2. The best lending rate (monthly average) is based on the rate reported by The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited.\n\n# Profitability Trends\n\nRetail banks’ profitability improved slightly in 2016, with overall pre-tax operating profit from their Hong Kong operations rising by 8.7%. The growth was mainly driven by foreign exchange and derivative portfolio income (+39.7%), dividend income from subsidiaries (+123.5%) and net interest income (+2.8%), although part of the growth was offset by a decline in fee and commission income (-11.3%). Retail banks’ post-tax profit rose by 44.4%, with growth mainly coming from non-recurring items. Retail banks’ post-tax return on average assets also rose accordingly from 1.04% in 2015 to 1.44% (Chart 8).\n\nChart 8 Performance of retail banks\n\nRetail banks’ net interest margin was 1.32% in 2016, the same as in 2015 (Chart 9). Although retail banks continued to allocate surplus funds to financial investments with lower interest rates but higher liquidity, the decline in interest income was offset by a decline in interest costs.\n\nChart 9 Retail banks’ net interest margin\n\nNon-interest income accounted for 44.3% of retail banks’ total operating income, remaining largely stable. Although fee and commission income fell by 11.3%, dividend income and foreign exchange and derivative portfolio income rose by 123.5% and 39.7% respectively."}
{"zh":"# 貨幣穩定\n\n儘管外圍環境波動及美元息率上升，港元匯率在2016年仍然保持穩定。香港貨幣市場亦繼續運作暢順，銀行同業流動資金充裕。聯繫匯率制度繼續展現高度承受衝擊的能力，是香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的主要目標是維持貨幣穩定，即確保港元匯價穩定，使港元在外匯市場兌美元的匯率保持在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的區間內。該貨幣體制主要採用貨幣發行局制度，規定由外匯基金所持的美元儲備向貨幣基礎提供最少百分之百的支持；貨幣基礎若有變動，美元儲備亦必須作出相應增減，與貨幣基礎的變動百分之百配合。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n- 負債證明書（為3間發鈔銀行發行的銀行紙幣提供十足支持）\n- 政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣\n- 銀行在金管局所持結算戶口的結餘總額（即總結餘）\n- 金管局代表政府發行的外匯基金票據及債券。\n\n表1 貨幣基礎\n\n金管局透過自動利率調節機制及履行兌換保證的堅決承諾來維持港元匯率的穩定。若市場對港元的需求大過供應，令市場匯率轉強至7.75港元兌1美元的強方兌換保證匯率，金管局會向銀行沽出港元、買入美元，使總結餘增加及港元利率下跌，從而令港元匯率從強方兌換保證匯率水平回復至7.75到7.85的兌換範圍內。相反，若港元供過於求，令市場匯率轉弱至7.85港元兌1美元的弱方兌換保證匯率，金管局會向銀行買入港元，使總結餘減少及推高港元利率，港元匯率隨之由弱方兌換保證匯率水平回復至兌換範圍內。\n\n# 2016年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n港元匯率在2016年首兩個月略有波動後，於年內餘下時間一直窄幅徘徊。港元在2016年初兌美元顯著轉弱，由1月4日的7.7510降至1月20日的7.8196（圖1）。港元匯率轉弱符合聯繫匯率制度的正常運作，反映美國在2015年12月加息後港元與美元的負息差擴濶。此外，其他市場相關因素，包括香港股市出現拋售、內地及香港經濟前景不及以前樂觀、人民幣匯率波動增加，以及亞洲貨幣普遍疲弱，均導致港元需求減弱。受到市場氣氛改善支持，港元匯率在2月略為轉強，並自3月起一直在7.753至7.776之間窄幅徘徊，即使英國脫歐公投及美國總統選舉引發市場波動亦未受影響。由於市場預期美國會在夏季加息，港元匯率於5月出現短暫的轉弱壓力。整體而言，港元外匯市場在2016年一直正常運作。\n\n圖 1 2016年市場匯率\n\n由於兌換保證沒有被觸發，因此總結餘及未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額在2016年沒有明顯變動，大致維持在12,222億港元左右（圖2）。年內金管局增發總值1,320億港元的外匯基金票據，以滿足銀行在流動性管理方面的龐大需求，令總結餘相應減少至2016年底的2,596億港元。增發外匯基金票據符合貨幣發行局制度的原則，這是由於增發外匯基金票據只屬貨幣基礎組成部分之間的轉移，即由總結餘移至未償還外匯基金票據及債券，貨幣基礎仍然由外匯儲備提供十足支持。\n\n圖 2 2016年總結餘及未償還外匯基金票據及債券\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n香港銀行同業拆息在2016年大部分時間維持在較低水平（圖3）。香港銀行同業拆息在1、2月期間因金融市場波動加劇而面對一些上升壓力，但在3月隨着金融環境回復平靜而轉趨穩定。於第2及第3季，儘管市場關注英國脫歐公投結果以及美國貨幣市場基金改革，香港銀行同業拆息仍大致保持穩定。部分受到年底資金需求影響，以及港元拆息追回美元拆息的升幅，香港銀行同業拆息在第4季錄得較大升幅。儘管如此，短期銀行同業拆息在2016年大致維持在低於基本利率的水平。\n\n因應美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍於12月14日（美國時間）由0.25至0.50厘上調至0.50至0.75厘，基本利率於12月15日由0.75厘上調至1.00厘。基本利率的調整是按照於2009年3月26日宣布的經修訂計算公式作出。按照該公式，基本利率定於美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍下限加50基點的水平，或隔夜與1個月香港銀行同業拆息的5天移動平均數的平均值水平，兩者以較高者為準。\n\n圖 3 2016年香港銀行同業拆息\n\n港元遠期匯率點子在1月出現大幅溢價，大致跟隨港元與美元息差的走勢，以及部分反映投資者為其港股組合作出外匯對沖的需求（圖4）。遠期匯率溢價在2月開始收窄。隨着市況轉趨穩定，港元遠期匯率點子在3至11月期間大致保持穩定，其後在12月因港元與美元息差收窄而再度上升。整體而言，香港貨幣市場運作暢順，銀行同業流動資金充裕。貼現窗借貸在2016年並不活躍，僅涉及53億港元。\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n儘管經歷多次區內以至全球金融危機，聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）過去數十年來一直是香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石。2016年初市場波動加劇，再度引起有關港元轉弱及情況有如亞洲金融危機時期的評論。為增進各界對聯匯制度的認識，金管局向公眾闡釋聯匯制度的技術細節，並指出香港金融體系有能力抵禦衝擊。政府亦重申堅決維持聯匯制度。外匯及貨幣市場穩定，進一步鞏固公眾對政府維持聯匯制度的決心以及港元作為支付及保值貨幣的信心。國際貨幣基金組織在與香港進行年度第四條磋商時，明確表示聯匯制度是最適合香港的貨幣制度，指出香港靈活的經濟結構、充裕的財政及儲備緩衝、以及穩健有效的金融監管是聯匯制度的後盾。\n\n圖 4 2016年美元兌港元遠期匯率點子\n\n鑑於穩健的銀行體系對聯匯制度的正常運作具關鍵作用，金管局繼續密切監察銀行的信用、流動性及利率風險管理以及壓力測試結果，並加強對銀行個人、企業及內地相關貸款的監管，以確保銀行體系具備應付衝擊的能力。面對美國貨幣政策正常化，香港銀行同業拆息開始上升，金管局提醒市民保持警覺，並作好準備以應付可能出現的市場波動及風險。\n\n為提高貨幣發行局帳目的透明度，自1998年10月起，外匯基金已有部分資產被指定用作支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（即支持資產相對貨幣基礎的比率）於2016年在106.3至107.5%之間的窄幅上落，並無觸及上限或下限。該比率於2016年12月31日為106.7%（圖5）。在聯匯制度下，雖然已指定某些外匯基金資產作為支持組合，但外匯基金的全部資產均可用作支持港元匯率。外匯基金的龐大財政資源，能在面對突如其來的衝擊時為香港貨幣及金融穩定提供強力後盾。\n\n圖5 2016年支持比率每日變動\n\n# 研究工作\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的貨幣發行委員會負責監察和探討與香港貨幣及金融穩定有關的課題。在2016年，貨幣發行委員會探討的課題包括香港與中國內地及美國經濟增長同步性、港元貨幣外部需求及香港的金融狀況指數。貨幣發行委員會會議紀錄及金管局向其呈交的貨幣發行局制度運作報告，均載於金管局網站。\n\n香港金融研究中心繼續支持貨幣政策、銀行業及金融範疇的研究工作。在2016年，研究中心合共邀請18位學者到訪，並發表20份工作論文。\n\n年內研究中心舉辦6項國際會議及研討會，主要包括：\n- 於1月舉辦「第7屆中國經濟年度國際研討會」，主題為「中國對全球經濟的影響日益加深」，其間發表8份涵蓋廣泛議題的研究論文，包括中國增長再平衡及增長潛力、來自中國的經濟外溢效應、人民幣對全球及區內的影響，以及人民幣市場之間的利差交易走勢及資訊流動。\n- 於3月與香港科技大學及慶應大學合辦「科技大學與慶應大學及研究中心匯率及宏觀經濟研討會」，內容涵蓋多個不同經濟議題，包括全球經濟失衡、匯率動態變化、資本管制及貨幣政策。\n- 於8月與香港城市大學合辦「房地產與金融穩定研討會」，會上發表的論文內容涵蓋年齡、人口與住屋需求；大額投資者對資產質素的影響；香港房屋價格動態變動；住屋市場負擔能力；按揭規例對家庭生命周期置業決定的影響，以及中國內地的住宅物業市場。\n- 於10月與金管局及國際結算銀行合辦有關亞太區經濟體系的研討會，主題為「在動盪不穩的全球環境下區內經濟體系的抗震能力」。研討會吸引多間央行的高層、主要學者及來自國際組織與私人機構的專家出席，就亞太區經濟體系最迫切的事項進行互動式圓桌討論，交流意見。探討的議題涵蓋廣泛，包括亞洲的金融失衡狀況、資金流、內地經濟放緩對區內其他地方的外溢效應，以及亞洲潛在增長受到的影響及前景。\n\n研究中心亦於8月舉辦「第14屆年度夏季研討會」，並於9月舉辦「第14屆中國內地經濟研討會」，探討內地銀行的資產質素及金融穩定事項。上述會議及研討會吸引學術界、金融服務界及各地央行代表參加。研究中心亦於年內舉辦21場公開小型研討會，探討廣泛的經濟、貨幣及金融議題。\n\n# 紙幣及硬幣\n\n截至2016年底，流通銀行紙幣（指發鈔銀行發行的紙幣）總值4,078億港元，較上年增加13.2%（圖6、7及8）。政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣總值118億港元，較上年增加5.3%（圖9及10）。在政府發行的紙幣及硬幣中，10港元流通紙幣總值44億港元，當中塑質鈔票佔86%。\n","terms":{"10年Plus同心展關懷標誌":["10 years plus Caring

Hong Kong’s monetary market also continued to operate smoothly, with ample interbank liquidity. The Linked Exchange Rate System continued to demonstrate its strong capacity to withstand shocks, underpinning Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\n# Objectives\n\nThe primary objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is to maintain monetary stability, i.e. to ensure the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, keeping it within the range of HK$7.75 to HK$7.85 per US dollar in the foreign exchange market. The monetary system primarily operates under the Currency Board System, which stipulates that the US dollar reserves held by the Exchange Fund must provide at least 100% backing to the monetary base. If the monetary base changes, the US dollar reserves must also be adjusted accordingly, matching the change in the monetary base by 100%.\n\nThe monetary base (Table 1) includes:\n- Certificates of indebtedness (which fully back the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks)\n- Government-issued notes and coins in circulation\n- The total balance of banks’ settlement accounts held with the HKMA (i.e. the Aggregate Balance)\n- Exchange Fund paper issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nTable 1 Monetary Base\n\nThe HKMA maintains the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and a firm commitment to the convertibility undertaking. If market demand for the Hong Kong dollar exceeds supply, causing the market exchange rate to strengthen to HK$7.75 per US dollar (the strong-side convertibility undertaking rate), the HKMA will sell Hong Kong dollars to banks and buy US dollars, thereby increasing the Aggregate Balance and lowering Hong Kong dollar interest rates. This brings the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate back from the strong-side convertibility undertaking level to within the convertibility zone of HK$7.75 to HK$7.85. Conversely, if the supply of Hong Kong dollars exceeds demand, causing the market exchange rate to weaken to HK$7.85 per US dollar (the weak-side convertibility undertaking rate), the HKMA will buy Hong Kong dollars from banks, thereby reducing the Aggregate Balance and pushing up Hong Kong dollar interest rates. This brings the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate back from the weak-side convertibility undertaking level to within the convertibility zone.\n\n# Review of 2016\n\n# Exchange Rate Stability\n\nAfter some fluctuations in the first two months of 2016, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate traded in a narrow range for the rest of the year. The Hong Kong dollar weakened significantly against the US dollar at the beginning of 2016, falling from 7.7510 on 4 January to 7.8196 on 20 January (Figure 1). This weakening of the Hong Kong dollar was consistent with the normal operation of the Linked Exchange Rate System, reflecting the widening negative interest rate differential between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar after the US raised interest rates in December 2015. In addition, other market-related factors contributed to weaker demand for the Hong Kong dollar, including a sell-off in the Hong Kong stock market, less optimistic economic prospects for the Mainland and Hong Kong, increased volatility in the renminbi exchange rate, and general weakness in Asian currencies. Supported by an improvement in market sentiment, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate strengthened slightly in February and traded in a narrow range of 7.753 to 7.776 from March onwards, unaffected even by market volatility triggered by the Brexit referendum and the US presidential election. The Hong Kong dollar came under brief weakening pressure in May as the market expected the US to raise interest rates in the summer. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar foreign exchange market operated normally in 2016.\n\nFigure 1 Market exchange rate in 2016\n\nAs the convertibility undertaking was not triggered, the Aggregate Balance and the total amount of outstanding Exchange Fund paper did not change significantly in 2016, remaining at around HK$1,222.2 billion (Figure 2). During the year, the HKMA issued additional Exchange Fund paper totalling HK$132 billion to meet banks’ strong demand for liquidity management, resulting in a corresponding decline in the Aggregate Balance to HK$259.6 billion at the end of 2016. The issuance of additional Exchange Fund paper was in line with the principles of the Currency Board System, as it only involved a transfer between components of the monetary base – from the Aggregate Balance to outstanding Exchange Fund paper – and the monetary base remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\nFigure 2 Aggregate Balance and outstanding Exchange Fund paper in 2016\n\n# Monetary Market\n\nHong Kong interbank offered rates (HIBORs) remained at relatively low levels for most of 2016 (Figure 3). HIBORs faced some upward pressure in January and February due to heightened volatility in financial markets, but stabilised in March as financial conditions calmed. In the second and third quarters, despite market concerns about the outcome of the Brexit referendum and reforms to US money market funds, HIBORs remained largely stable. HIBORs recorded a larger increase in the fourth quarter, partly due to year-end funding demand and the catch-up of Hong Kong interbank rates with the rise in US interbank rates. Nevertheless, short-term interbank rates remained generally below the Base Rate in 2016.\n\nIn response to the upward adjustment of the target range for the US Federal Funds Rate from 0.25–0.50% to 0.50–0.75% on 14 December (US time), the Base Rate was raised from 0.75% to 1.00% on 15 December. This adjustment was made in accordance with the revised formula announced on 26 March 2009. Under this formula, the Base Rate is set at either 50 basis points above the lower end of the target range for the US Federal Funds Rate or the average of the five-day moving averages of the overnight and one-month HIBORs, whichever is higher.\n\nFigure 3 Hong Kong interbank offered rates in 2016\n\nHong Kong dollar forward points recorded a substantial premium in January, broadly following the movement of the interest rate differential between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar, and partly reflecting investors’ demand for currency hedging of their Hong Kong equity portfolios (Figure 4). The forward premium narrowed in February. As market conditions stabilised, Hong Kong dollar forward points remained largely stable between March and November, before rising again in December due to a narrowing of the interest rate differential between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar. Overall, the Hong Kong monetary market operated smoothly, with ample interbank liquidity. Discount window lending was not active in 2016, involving only HK$5.3 billion.\n\n# Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nDespite experiencing several regional and global financial crises, the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has been the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability over the past few decades. Heightened market volatility at the beginning of 2016 once again triggered comments about the weakening of the Hong Kong dollar and comparisons with the Asian financial crisis. To enhance public understanding of the LERS, the HKMA explained its technical details to the public and emphasised that Hong Kong’s financial system was capable of withstanding shocks. The Government also reiterated its commitment to maintaining the LERS. The stability of the foreign exchange and monetary markets further reinforced public confidence in the Government’s determination to maintain the LERS and in the Hong Kong dollar as a medium for payment and store of value. In its annual Article IV Consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) explicitly stated that the LERS was the most suitable monetary system for Hong Kong, noting that Hong Kong’s flexible economic structure, ample fiscal and reserve buffers, and robust and effective financial regulation were the underpinnings of the LERS.\n\nFigure 4 US dollar\/Hong Kong dollar forward points in 2016\n\nGiven that a robust banking system is critical to the normal operation of the LERS, the HKMA continued to closely monitor banks’ credit, liquidity and interest rate risk management, as well as stress-test results, and strengthened supervision of banks’ personal, corporate and Mainland-related lending to ensure that the banking system was capable of withstanding shocks. As Hong Kong interbank rates began to rise in response to the normalisation of US monetary policy, the HKMA reminded the public to remain vigilant and prepare for potential market volatility and risks.\n\nTo enhance the transparency of the Currency Board Account, part of the assets of the Exchange Fund have been designated to back the monetary base since October 1998. The backing ratio (i.e. the ratio of backing assets to the monetary base) fluctuated narrowly between 106.3% and 107.5% in 2016, without touching the upper or lower limit. The ratio stood at 106.7% on 31 December 2016 (Figure 5). Under the LERS, although certain assets of the Exchange Fund have been designated as the backing portfolio, all assets of the Exchange Fund can be used to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. The Exchange Fund’s substantial financial resources provide a strong buffer for Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability in the face of unexpected shocks.\n\nFigure 5 Daily movement of the backing ratio in 2016\n\n# Research Work\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (eFAC) is responsible for monitoring and studying issues related to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. In 2016, the Sub-Committee studied issues including the synchronisation of economic growth between Hong Kong, Mainland China and the US, external demand for the Hong Kong dollar currency, and Hong Kong’s financial conditions indexes. The minutes of the Sub-Committee’s meetings and the HKMA’s reports to it on the operation of the Currency Board System are available on the HKMA website.\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research (HKIMR) continued to support research work in the areas of monetary policy, banking and finance. In 2016, the Institute invited 18 scholars to visit and published 20 working papers.\n\nDuring the year, the Institute organised six international conferences and seminars, including:\n- The Seventh Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy, held in January, with the theme “China’s Growing Impact on the Global Economy”. Eight research papers covering a wide range of topics were presented, including China’s growth rebalancing and growth potential, economic spillovers from China, the impact of the renminbi on the global and regional economies, and trends in carry trades and information flows between renminbi markets.\n- The HKUST-Keio-HKIMR Conference on Exchange Rates and Macroeconomics, co-organised with the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and Keio University in March, covered various economic issues, including global imbalances, exchange rate dynamics, capital controls and monetary policy.\n- The Real Estate and Financial Stability Conference, co-organised with the City University of Hong Kong in August, featured papers on topics such as age, population and housing demand; the impact of large investors on asset quality; Hong Kong’s housing price dynamics; housing affordability; the impact of mortgage regulations on household life-cycle home purchase decisions; and the Mainland’s residential property market.\n- A seminar on Asia-Pacific economies co-organised with the HKMA and the Bank for International Settlements in October, with the theme “Resilience of Regional Economies in a Turbulent Global Environment”. The seminar attracted senior officials from central banks, leading academics and experts from international organisations and private institutions, who engaged in interactive roundtable discussions on the most pressing issues facing Asia-Pacific economies. The topics covered a wide range of issues, including Asia’s financial imbalances, capital flows, spillovers from the Mainland’s economic slowdown to other parts of the region, and the impact on and prospects for Asia’s potential growth.\n\nThe Institute also organised the 14th HKIMR Summer Workshop in August and the 14th Conference on the Mainland Economy in September, which discussed asset quality and financial stability issues of Mainland banks. The above conferences and seminars attracted participants from academia, the financial services industry and central banks around the world. The Institute also organised 21 public seminars during the year to discuss a wide range of economic, monetary and financial issues.\n\n# Notes and Coins\n\nAs at the end of 2016, the total value of bank notes in circulation (i.e. notes issued by note-issuing banks) was HK$4,078 billion, an increase of 13.2% over the previous year (Figures 6, 7 and 8). The total value of government-issued notes and coins in circulation was HK$11.8 billion, an increase of 5.3% over the previous year (Figures 9 and 10). Among the government-issued notes and coins, the total value of HK$10 notes in circulation was HK$4.4 billion, of which 86% were polymer notes."}
{"zh":"# 銀行體系穩定\n\n儘管環球市場風險及震盪增加，香港銀行體系在2016年仍維持穩健。金管局在年內加強監管認可機構的風險管治架構，以及信用與流動性風險管理系統的成效。鑑於網絡攻擊日趨頻繁，金管局亦加強監管認可機構的科技風險管理。為貫徹金管局致力打擊金融罪行的目標，認可機構打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集監控措施的成效，繼續是金管局的監管重點。在監管認可機構的操守方面，金管局採取實質行動，推動以客為本的企業文化及促進普及金融，和應對海外中小企及初創企業在香港開立及維持銀行帳戶方面遇到的困難。金管局亦加強監管認可機構銷售投資及保險產品的手法，以進一步提升對客戶的保障。\n\n在監管政策方面，金管局就香港實施國際監管及會計標準的準備工作取得重大進展；當中包括穩定資金淨額比率、大額風險承擔限額、國際財務報告準則第9號及《金融機構（處置機制）條例》下的處置框架。\n\n# 2016年回顧\n\n# 監管工作概覽\n\n金管局在2016年共進行188次非現場審查，涵蓋範圍廣泛，包括認可機構的CAMEL評級、企業管治、業務運作及風險管理。金管局加強與認可機構董事局的聯繫，以強化銀行業的風險管治及企業文化。除與董事局或董事局委員會舉行會議外，亦另行與獨立非執行董事（獨立非執董）會面，就企業文化及風險管治事宜交換意見。金管局亦與認可機構及其外聘審計師舉行三方聯席會議。此外，金管局就認可機構的薪酬制度是否有助促進有效的風險管理進行評估。\n\n在資本充足水平方面，金管局審視認可機構的資本計劃，包括其未來數年的資本目標，以便就2019年全面實施《巴塞爾協定三》緩衝資本作好準備。認可機構的償付能力壓力測試亦因應當前宏觀經濟環境作出改進。金管局又審慎評估各主要零售銀行的恢復計劃，並就需要改善的環節提出意見。\n\n除了非現場審查工作外，金管局繼續以專題評估配合定期現場審查，而專題評估主要適用於被評定為較高風險的範疇。這種監管方法讓金管局更有效地調配監管資源，以應對認可機構所面對的各項新增及主要風險。金管局在2016年共進行377次現場審查及專題評估。這些審查與評估的重點仍是信用風險管理與監控，尤其涉及內地相關業務的信用風險；另一個重點是打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集監控措施。金管局又增加對流動性風險、業務操作風險及科技風險管理的現場審查及專題評估次數。年內專項審查小組亦對認可機構的證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（強積金）相關業務進行現場審查。\n\n表1載有金管局於2016年的監管工作概要。\n\n# 信用風險的監管\n\n# 信貸增長及資產質素\n\n銀行貸款在2016年增長溫和。未償還貸款總額全年增加6.5%；2015年的增幅則為3.5%（表2）。由於客戶存款的增幅超過銀行貸款的增幅，整體貸存比率由2015年底的70.1%降至2016年底的68.4%。\n\n表 2 貸款及墊款的增長\n\n內地相關貸款總額在2016年底增加7%至35,640億港元（表3），其中包括在香港註冊的銀行設於內地的附屬公司入帳的5,450億港元貸款。\n\n銀行業的資產質素在2016年維持穩健。儘管零售銀行的特定分類貸款比率由2015年底的0.69%微升至2016年底的0.72%，但仍遠低於2000年以來的長期平均水平2.4%。同期，整體銀行業的特定分類貸款比率由0.73%上升至0.85%。年內銀行業的內地相關貸款的資產質素呈相若走勢；同期，零售銀行這些貸款的特定分類貸款比率由0.78%微升至0.82%，整體銀行業的相關比率亦由一年前的0.77%微升至0.80%。\n\n金管局投入大量監管資源，以確保認可機構繼續採用審慎的信貸審批標準，並維持有效的貸款分類及撥備制度。金管局在監管過程中亦特別關注認可機構對中國內地民營企業的風險承擔持續增加，以及為增加收益而投資於債務證券所引起的信用風險。此外，金管局就認可機構分銷高風險投資產品的信用風險管理進行專題評估。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n金管局繼續密切留意認可機構的物業貸款業務。住宅物業價格於2015年9月開始出現調整，但其後於2016年3月再度上升，全年上升8%。新造住宅物業按揭貸款的平均按揭成數，由2009年9月金管局尚未推出首輪物業貸款逆周期措施時的64%，降至2016年12月的51%。新造住宅物業按揭貸款的平均供款與入息比率亦由2010年8月首度推出供款與入息比率上限時的41%，降至2016年12月的34%（圖1）。\n\n圖 1 新造住宅物業按揭貸款的平均按揭成數及供款與入息比率\n金管局推出首輪物業貸款逆周期措施前推出供款與入息比率上限\n\n根據金管局於2015年2月推出的第七輪逆周期措施，使用內部評級基準計算法計算信用風險資本要求的認可機構須將15%信用風險加權下限的應用，由新造按揭貸款延伸至整個住宅按揭貸款組合。這項規定於2016年6月生效。\n\n年內有更多地產發展商向物業買家直接提供按揭貸款，其按揭成數往往高於金管局對認可機構實施審慎要求下許可的水平。金管局密切留意有關發展，並定期與認可機構溝通，以評估銀行有否繼續有效管理對地產發展商的風險承擔。此外，土地註冊處應金管局要求，同意向認可機構提供電子提示服務。使用這項服務的認可機構，當有其他按揭文書就其承按的物業交付土地註冊處辦理註冊時，會收到該處發出的電子提示訊息。這項服務將有助應對按揭借款人未有事先獲得承按認可機構同意下，擅自以同一物業借取額外按揭貸款的情況。土地註冊處已於2017年第1季推出電子提示服務。\n\n# 業務操作及科技風險的監管\n\n與其他國際金融中心一樣，香港面對的網絡威脅與日俱增。金管局於2016年接到認可機構通報發現未經授權股票交易及試圖入侵其支付系統的個案，並隨即採取行動應對這些攻擊造成的風險。金管局發出電子銀行服務提示，提醒公眾慎防網上股票交易騙案，並建議公眾採取預防措施。金管局又向認可機構發出通告，就進一步加強網上銀行服務監控可採取的保安措施提供指引。有關試圖入侵銀行支付系統的個案，金管局在香港首次發現相關個案時已提醒認可機構留意這類騙案，並在警方協助下說明這類騙案的犯案手法，以及要求認可機構在加強支付操作的監控措施時須顧及有關手法。\n\n為進一步提升銀行體系應對網絡風險的能力，金管局於2016年5月推出網絡防衛計劃。此計劃由三項支柱組成，即網絡防衛評估框架、專業培訓計劃及網絡風險資訊共享平台（詳見「香港的國際金融中心地位」一章「金融科技促進辦公室」部分）。金管局在12月向認可機構發出通告，列載網絡防衛評估框架的實施時間表。\n\n金融科技在銀行業的應用於2016年長足發展，多間認可機構推出新的金融科技產品，其中個人小額支付服務、非接觸式流動支付及生物認證這幾個範疇的發展尤為顯著。金管局在9月推出「金融科技監管沙盒」，讓認可機構能在受控環境中就其金融科技項目先作試行，而無需完全符合金管局的監管規定。有關安排讓認可機構在正式推出金融科技服務前，可及早收集真實數據及用戶意見，以便作出適當修改。截至2016年底，共有6項使用金融科技監管沙盒的申請獲批，有關的新金融科技產品涉及生物認證、證券交易及用於按揭估值的區塊鏈。金管局又在11月上調無需雙重認證的網上銀行個人小額支付服務的交易上限至每個帳戶每日5,000港元，以應付日益增加的簡便個人支付服務需求。\n\n2016年發生多宗與物業相關的騙案，當中涉及騙徒假扮業主，試圖藉申請按揭貸款或出售有關物業謀取利益。雖然這些騙案並不涉及認可機構，但金管局仍與警方及香港銀行公會（銀行公會）緊密合作，就偵測及防止這些騙案在銀行業內發生向認可機構提供指引。年內金管局出版兩期《操作事故通訊》，與業界分享從認可機構發生過的操作事故中汲取的教訓。金管局亦對認可機構的業務操作風險管理制度、詐騙管理方法、信託╱託管業務操作及防範違規或未經授權交易活動的風險管理及監控措施進行現場審查及專題評估。\n\n# 財資業務及流動性風險的監管\n\n2016年發生數宗重大政治事件，引致金融市場在年內多次大幅波動。與此同時，美國利率繼續緩慢地正常化，聯邦公開市場委員會於12月決定調高聯邦基金利率，是全球金融危機以來的第二次。為應對這些政治事件作好準備，金管局與境外監管機構繼續保持緊密聯繫，並評估事件對香港銀行體系的影響，以及要求銀行保持警覺並加強其風險管理以應對不利的市場發展。\n\n在流動性風險管理方面，金管局進行額外的流動性壓力測試，以評估銀行體系應對可能發生的嚴峻壓力情境的能力，並對認可機構作出跟進，以加強其應對能力。金管局在2015年針對利率風險管理進行一輪現場審查後，再進行額外的現場審查，以評估認可機構的市場風險管理，並要求在監控方面存有不足的認可機構作出糾正。\n\n# 打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集活動\n\n金管局的風險為本打擊洗錢監管包括現場審查及非現場審查（包括就特定事件與認可機構進行的監管聯繫），主要針對洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險較高的範疇。審查內容涵蓋認可機構對洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險的評估、風險為本方法的落實情況，以及交易監察與制裁合規的制度和程序。金管局的專項監管人員在2016年共進行17次現場審查及30次非現場審查。\n\n在政策發展方面，金管局優先處理某些行業及人士在開立銀行帳戶方面遇到困難的情況，並發出指引與「常見問題」，以釐清若干客戶盡職審查的規定，以及金管局就風險為本方法的監管期望。與此同時，金管局繼續與業內公會緊密合作，發出指引以協助認可機構處理某些範疇的風險，例如貿易相關的洗錢活動。\n","terms":{"10年Plus同心展關懷標誌":["10

During the year, the HKMA strengthened its oversight of authorised institutions’ risk governance frameworks and the effectiveness of their credit and liquidity risk management systems. In light of the growing frequency of cyberattacks, the HKMA also enhanced its supervision of authorised institutions’ technology risk management. To further the HKMA’s goal of combating financial crime, the effectiveness of authorised institutions’ anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing controls remained a key focus of the HKMA’s supervision. In terms of regulating the conduct of authorised institutions, the HKMA took concrete actions to promote a customer-centric culture and financial inclusion, and to address the difficulties faced by overseas SMEs and start-up companies in opening and maintaining bank accounts in Hong Kong. The HKMA also strengthened its supervision of authorised institutions’ sales practices for investment and insurance products to further enhance customer protection.\n\nIn terms of regulatory policy, the HKMA made significant progress in preparing Hong Kong for the implementation of international supervisory and accounting standards, including the Net Stable Funding Ratio, large exposure limits, International Financial Reporting Standard 9 and the resolution framework under the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance.\n\n# 2016 Review\n\n# Overview of supervisory work\n\nIn 2016, the HKMA conducted 188 off-site reviews, covering a wide range of areas including authorised institutions’ CAMEL ratings, corporate governance, business operations and risk management. The HKMA strengthened its communication with authorised institutions’ boards of directors to enhance risk governance and corporate culture in the banking sector. In addition to meetings with the board or board committees, separate meetings were held with independent non-executive directors to exchange views on corporate culture and risk governance. The HKMA also held tripartite meetings with authorised institutions and their external auditors. Furthermore, the HKMA assessed whether authorised institutions’ remuneration systems were conducive to effective risk management.\n\nIn terms of capital adequacy, the HKMA reviewed authorised institutions’ capital plans, including their capital targets for the next few years, in preparation for the full implementation of Basel III capital buffers in 2019. Authorised institutions’ solvency stress testing programme was also improved to reflect the current macroeconomic environment. The HKMA also prudently assessed the recovery plans of major retail banks and provided comments on areas that needed improvement.\n\nIn addition to off-site reviews, the HKMA continued to conduct thematic reviews in conjunction with regular on-site examinations, with thematic reviews mainly applicable to areas assessed as higher risk. This supervisory approach enabled the HKMA to allocate supervisory resources more effectively to address new and major risks faced by authorised institutions. In 2016, the HKMA conducted 377 on-site examinations and thematic reviews. The focus of these examinations and reviews remained on credit risk management and monitoring, particularly credit risks associated with Mainland-related business; another focus was on anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing controls. The HKMA also increased the number of on-site examinations and thematic reviews on liquidity risk, operational risk and technology risk management. During the year, a special inspection team also conducted on-site examinations of authorised institutions’ securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses.\n\nTable 1 provides a summary of the HKMA’s supervisory work in 2016.\n\n# Supervision of credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nBank lending grew moderately in 2016. Total outstanding loans increased by 6.5% over the year; the increase in 2015 was 3.5% (Table 2). As customer deposits grew faster than bank loans, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio fell from 70.1% at the end of 2015 to 68.4% at the end of 2016.\n\nTable 2 Growth in loans and advances\n\nTotal Mainland-related loans increased by 7% to HK$3,564 billion at the end of 2016 (Table 3), including HK$545 billion in loans booked by Mainland subsidiaries of banks incorporated in Hong Kong.\n\nThe asset quality of the banking sector remained sound in 2016. Although the classified loan ratio for retail banks edged up slightly from 0.69% at the end of 2015 to 0.72% at the end of 2016, it was still far below the long-term average of 2.4% since 2000. Over the same period, the classified loan ratio for the banking sector as a whole rose from 0.73% to 0.85%. The asset quality of Mainland-related loans of the banking sector followed a similar trend during the year; over the same period, the classified loan ratio for these loans of retail banks edged up slightly from 0.78% to 0.82%, while the corresponding ratio for the banking sector as a whole also edged up slightly from 0.77% a year earlier to 0.80%.\n\nThe HKMA devoted substantial supervisory resources to ensuring that authorised institutions continued to adopt prudent credit approval standards and maintain effective loan classification and provisioning systems. In the course of its supervision, the HKMA also paid particular attention to authorised institutions’ increasing risk exposure to privately owned enterprises in Mainland China and the credit risks arising from investment in debt securities for yield enhancement. In addition, the HKMA conducted thematic reviews on authorised institutions’ credit risk management in distributing high-risk investment products.\n\n# Mortgage loans\n\nThe HKMA continued to closely monitor authorised institutions’ property lending business. Residential property prices began to adjust in September 2015, but then rose again in March 2016, increasing by 8% over the year as a whole. The average loan-to-value ratio for new residential mortgage loans fell from 64% in September 2009, before the HKMA introduced the first round of countercyclical prudential measures for property loans, to 51% in December 2016. The average debt-servicing ratio for new residential mortgage loans also fell from 41% in August 2010, when the debt-servicing ratio cap was first introduced, to 34% in December 2016 (Chart 1).\n\nChart 1 Average loan-to-value ratio and debt-servicing ratio for new residential mortgage loans\nThe HKMA introduced a debt-servicing ratio cap before the first round of countercyclical measures for property loans\n\nUnder the HKMA’s seventh round of countercyclical measures introduced in February 2015, authorised institutions using the Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) approach to calculate credit risk capital requirements were required to extend the application of the 15% risk-weight floor from new mortgage loans to the entire residential mortgage loan portfolio. This requirement took effect in June 2016.\n\nDuring the year, more property developers provided mortgage loans directly to property buyers, with loan-to-value ratios often higher than the level permitted under the HKMA’s prudential requirements for authorised institutions. The HKMA closely monitored these developments and maintained regular communication with authorised institutions to assess whether banks continued to manage their risk exposure to property developers effectively. In addition, at the HKMA’s request, the Land Registry agreed to provide an e-Alert service to authorised institutions. Authorised institutions using this service would receive an electronic alert message from the Land Registry when other mortgage documents relating to a property mortgaged to them were submitted to the Land Registry for registration. This service would help address the situation where a mortgage borrower obtained additional mortgage financing for the same property without prior consent from the mortgaging authorised institution. The Land Registry launched the e-Alert service in the first quarter of 2017.\n\n# Supervision of operational and technology risks\n\nLike other international financial centres, Hong Kong faces increasing cyber threats. In 2016, the HKMA received reports from authorised institutions about unauthorised stock trading and attempted hacking of their payment systems, and took immediate action to address the risks posed by these attacks. The HKMA issued an e-banking services alert to remind the public to beware of online stock trading scams and to suggest preventive measures. The HKMA also issued a circular to authorised institutions providing guidance on further security measures that could be taken to enhance monitoring of online banking services. In relation to attempted hacking of bank payment systems, the HKMA alerted authorised institutions to this type of scam when it first discovered such cases in Hong Kong, and, with the assistance of the police, explained the modus operandi of such scams and required authorised institutions to take these into account when enhancing their monitoring of payment operations.\n\nTo further enhance the banking sector’s cyber resilience, the HKMA launched a Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative in May 2016. The initiative comprises three pillars, namely a Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework, a professional training programme and a Cyber Intelligence Sharing Platform (see the section on the “Fintech Facilitation Office” in the chapter on “Hong Kong’s International Financial Centre Status”). In December, the HKMA issued a circular to authorised institutions setting out the implementation timetable for the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework.\n\nFintech applications in the banking sector made significant progress in 2016, with many authorised institutions launching new fintech products, particularly in the areas of person-to-person small-value payment services, contactless mobile payments and biometric authentication. In September, the HKMA launched a Fintech Supervisory Sandbox to allow authorised institutions to pilot their fintech projects in a controlled environment without having to fully comply with the HKMA’s supervisory requirements. This arrangement enabled authorised institutions to collect real data and user feedback at an early stage before formally launching fintech services, so that appropriate modifications could be made. As at the end of 2016, six applications to use the Fintech Supervisory Sandbox had been approved, involving new fintech products relating to biometric authentication, securities trading and blockchain for mortgage valuation. In November, the HKMA raised the transaction limit for person-to-person small-value payment services conducted through online banking without two-factor authentication to HK$5,000 per account per day to meet the growing demand for convenient person-to-person payment services.\n\nIn 2016, there were a number of property-related scams involving fraudsters impersonating property owners and attempting to profit by applying for mortgage loans or selling the properties concerned. Although these scams did not involve authorised institutions, the HKMA worked closely with the police and the Hong Kong Association of Banks to provide guidance to authorised institutions on detecting and preventing such scams in the banking sector. During the year, the HKMA published two issues of the Operational Incidents Watch to share with the industry lessons learned from operational incidents that had occurred at authorised institutions. The HKMA also conducted on-site examinations and thematic reviews of authorised institutions’ operational risk management systems, fraud management methods, trustee\/custodian operations and risk management and monitoring measures to prevent rogue or unauthorised trading activities.\n\n# Supervision of treasury activities and liquidity risk\n\nA number of major political events occurred in 2016, causing significant volatility in financial markets during the year. At the same time, US interest rates continued their gradual normalisation, with the Federal Open Market Committee deciding in December to raise the Federal Funds Rate for the second time since the global financial crisis. To prepare for these political events, the HKMA maintained close contact with overseas regulators and assessed the impact of the events on Hong Kong’s banking system, and required banks to remain vigilant and strengthen their risk management to cope with adverse market developments.\n\nIn terms of liquidity risk management, the HKMA conducted additional liquidity stress tests to assess the banking sector’s ability to cope with potentially severe stress scenarios and followed up with authorised institutions to enhance their coping ability. Following a round of on-site examinations on interest rate risk management in 2015, the HKMA conducted additional on-site examinations to assess authorised institutions’ market risk management and required authorised institutions with deficiencies in monitoring to make corrections.\n\n# Prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing\n\nThe HKMA’s risk-based anti-money laundering supervision includes on-site and off-site reviews (including regulatory liaison with authorised institutions on specific cases), focusing mainly on areas with higher risks of money laundering and terrorist financing. The reviews cover authorised institutions’ assessment of money laundering and terrorist financing risks, implementation of a risk-based approach, and systems and procedures for transaction monitoring and sanctions compliance. In 2016, the HKMA’s specialist supervisory staff conducted 17 on-site examinations and 30 off-site reviews.\n\nIn terms of policy development, the HKMA gave priority to addressing the difficulties faced by certain industries and individuals in opening bank accounts, and issued guidance and “frequently asked questions” to clarify certain customer due diligence requirements and the HKMA’s supervisory expectations in relation to the risk-based approach. At the same time, the HKMA continued to work closely with industry associations to issue guidance to help authorised institutions address risks in certain areas, such as trade-based money laundering."}
{"zh":"# 香港的國際金融中心地位\n\n香港維持其作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位。去年的稅務修訂有助營造有利環境，吸引跨國公司在港設立企業財資中心。為發展香港成為基建融資中心與金融科技樞紐，金管局在年內成立基建融資促進辦公室及金融科技促進辦公室。年內金管局向儲值支付工具發行人批出13個牌照。香港穩健的財政表現及龐大的對外資產淨值，繼續獲得信貸評級機構確認，其中標準普爾維持對香港AAA的評級。\n\n# 概覽\n\n受到環球金融市場波動及人民幣匯率前景不確定性影響，2016年全球離岸人民幣業務有所放緩。儘管如此，香港維持其作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位，處理全球約七成人民幣支付交易。深港股票市場交易互聯互通機制「深港通」於12月推出，標誌着內地資本帳開放的另一里程碑，並且是提升香港的國際金融中心地位的重要一步。金管局亦透過擴大對市場的人民幣流動性支援及推出措施增加人民幣市場流動性的透明度，強化金融基建。\n\n金管局於7月成立基建融資促進辦公室(IFFO)，透過匯聚主要持份者促進基建發展，並發展香港成為基建融資中心。截至2017年1月底，已有超過60間機構加入IFFO成為合作夥伴。年內金管局亦成功推動法例修訂的通過，以消除稅務不對稱及提供稅務優惠，鼓勵跨國及內地公司在香港設立企業財資中心，為金融及專業服務行業帶來更多商機。在香港駐設業務的機構投資者數目亦逐漸增加，其中作為全球第三大主權基金的阿布扎比投資局於10月宣布在香港成立海外辦事處，是該機構唯一設於阿布扎比以外的辦事處。\n\n國際貨幣基金組織（基金組織）在去年的第四條磋商討論中對我們致力鞏固香港作為國際金融中心的地位給予正面評價。年內金管局積極參與國際討論，致力推進全球與區內金融穩定。金管局亦與國際信貸評級機構保持緊密溝通，有關工作有助香港的信貸評級在2016年獲得主要信貸評級機構確認。\n\n香港金融基建的安全有效運作與持續發展，對鞏固香港作為國際金融中心及全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的競爭力發揮重要作用。處理銀行同業交易的4個即時支付結算(RTGS)系統及債務工具中央結算系統（CMU系統）在2016年達到100%的系統可供使用率，高於99.95%的目標水平。\n\n金管局在2016年進一步加強香港的零售支付金融基建。年內根據2016年11月全面生效的《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（《支付條例》）批出總共13個儲值支付工具牌照。電子支票服務涵蓋範圍亦已擴展至香港和廣東省（包括深圳）之間的跨境支付。\n\n為促進香港金融科技的發展，金管局於3月成立金融科技促進辦公室。年內實施的多項重要措施均取得理想進展。\n\n金管局推出一系列措施加強銀行業軟實力，包括(i)推出提升董事專業能力計劃；(ii)訂立整體業界的銀行從業員專業資歷架構；及(iii)推行消費者教育計劃。\n\n# 2016年回顧\n\n# 離岸人民幣業務\n\n2016年環球金融市場波動及人民幣匯率前景不確定性令全球離岸人民幣業務有所放緩。截至年底，香港人民幣客戶存款及存款證餘額合共為6,251億元人民幣，較上年減少38%（圖1）。年內離岸人民幣債券發行量降至528億元人民幣，經香港銀行處理的人民幣貿易結算額亦降至45,421億元人民幣。另一方面，香港銀行截至年底的人民幣貸款餘額為2,948億元人民幣，與上年相若（圖2）。人民幣RTGS系統的交易額維持於高位，於2016年平均每日處理的交易額為8,636億元人民幣。由此可見，儘管人民幣資金池有所縮減，但仍繼續支持大量人民幣金融中介活動在香港進行。根據環球銀行金融電信協會(SWIFT)統計數字，2016年香港處理約七成人民幣支付交易，足以證明香港作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位。\n\n圖1 人民幣客戶存款及存款證\n\n圖2 人民幣融資活動\n\n年內金管局與內地有關當局緊密合作爭取更大政策空間，推展香港人民幣業務。年內推出多項新措施，包括進一步加大內地銀行間債券市場及外匯市場對外開放，以及在12月推出「深港通」。因應跨境投資渠道及市場對流動性管理需求增加，金管局擴大人民幣流動資金安排。於10月，金管局將一級流動性提供行的數目由7間增加至9間，有關計劃的總額度亦由140億元人民幣增加至180億元人民幣。金管局人民幣流動資金安排使用情況的透明度亦提高，有助參加行更有效管理流動資金。\n\n在3月公布的國家「十三五」規劃再次肯定香港作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位，顯示中央政府支持香港進一步發展離岸人民幣業務。\n\n與此同時，金管局繼續加強與其他經濟體的合作，發展離岸人民幣業務。金管局亦積極參加各類活動，推廣香港作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐及內地「走出去策略跳板的主要角色，包括參與業界組織及私營機構舉辦的本地活動，以及在中國內地、德國、哈薩克斯坦和英國等地的境外活動。\n\n# 內地與香港關於建立更緊密經貿關係的安排\n\n在《內地與香港關於建立更緊密經貿關係的安排》框架下有關內地與香港基本實現服務貿易自由化的新協議，於2015年簽署。金管局繼續密切留意現行安排下的措施的實施情況，並與政府當局合作探討進步擴大內地市場對香港金融業的開放及便利措施。\n\n# 基建融資促進辦公室(IFFO)\n\n# IFFO的使命\n\nIFFO的使命是透過匯聚主要持份者，共同促進基建投融資。IFFO的職能是：\n- 提供一個資訊交流和經驗分享的平台；\n- 提升基建投融資方面的技能和知識；\n- 推廣市場及產品發展；\n- 及促進基建投融資活動。\n\n金管局總裁陳德霖先生（左七）於IFFO啟動儀式上聯同其他嘉賓祝酒。\n\n金管局於7月成立IFFO，其使命是透過匯聚主要持份者共同促進基建投融資。截至2017年1月底，已有超過60間來自中國內地、香港及海外的機構加入IFFO成為合作夥伴，當中包括多邊金融機構及發展銀行、公營機構投資者、私營機構投資者、資產管理公司、銀行、保險公司、基建項目發展及營運機構、專業服務公司及國際貿易協會（表1）。\n\nIFFO自成立以來取得良好進展。為致力提升技能，IFFO於10月聯同世界銀行集團旗下國際金融公司和瀚亞投資主辦行政人員工作坊，主題為「私營資金參與新興市場基建項目的投融資」。該工作坊獲得參與者非常正面的回應，有助增長知識及建立網絡。IFFO另於11月舉辦高層研討會，並邀請亞洲基礎設施投資銀行行長金立群先生主講及分享基建項目規劃、營運與管理的經驗。於7月，IFFO分別與國際金融公司及全球基礎設施中心簽訂《諒解備忘錄》，建立合作框架。另於12月分別與國家開發銀行及中國進出口銀行簽訂《諒解備忘錄》，透過IFFO平台促進該兩間銀行的基建項目融資。這些活動有助加強香港作為基建融資中心的地位及國際形象。\n\n金管局總裁陳德霖先生（前左）與國際金融公司執行副總裁兼首席執行官菲利普• 勒奧魯先生（前右）簽署《諒解備忘錄》，促成兩者合作利用IFFO平台，為區內基建投融資營造更有效率及有利的市場環境。\n\n金管局總裁陳德霖先生（前左）與全球基礎設施中心首席執行官Chris Heathcote先生（前右）簽署《諒解備忘錄》，建立策略性合作框架，促進基建項目融資。\n\n金管局總裁陳德霖先生（左）與國家開發銀行董事長胡懷邦先生簽署《諒解備忘錄》，加強該行與金管局的合作。\n\n# 企業財資中心\n\n為進一步吸引跨國公司在香港設立企業財資中心，金管局與政府當局合作，營造一個對企業財資中心有利的稅務環境。具體上，《2016年稅務（修訂）（第2號）條例》（《修訂條例》）於6月通過，容許企業在符合指明條件下，在計算利得稅時可獲扣減經營集團內部融資業務的利息支出，以及就合資格企業財資中心指明財資業務的利潤，寬減利得稅百分之五十（即降至8.25%）。表2簡載《修訂條例》部分要點：\n\n除立法工作外，金管局亦積極向跨國和內地企業推廣在香港設立企業財資中心的優勢。截至年底，金管局已接觸近400間公司、金融機構及行業組織。金管局亦於11月與香港中國企業協會簽署《諒解備忘錄》，協助香港的中資企業進一步了解及更多利用我們的企業財資中心平台。\n\n# 推廣資產管理業務\n\n金管局繼續致力推廣香港作為資產管理中心。根據證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會），從事資產管理的持牌法團數目於2016年底為1,300間，按年增加近15%。根據《亞洲創業投資期刊》，2016年在香港的私募基金公司（包括證監會持牌法團及非證監會持牌法團）數目亦增加4.6%，至431間。迄今全球百大資產管理公司中有接近70間，以及內地二十大互惠基金公司中的大多數，已在香港設有業務或相聯公司。在香港駐設業務的機構投資者數目亦逐漸增加，其中作為全球第三大主權基金的阿布扎比投資局於10月宣布在香港成立海外辦事處，是該機構於阿布扎比以外設立的唯一辦事處。\n\n# 引入開放式基金型公司結構\n\n為吸引基金來港註冊，金管局繼續與政府及業界合作，營造更有利的稅務及監管環境。於6月，《2016年證券及期貨（修訂）條例草案》獲得通過，引入開放式基金型公司結構，令香港的基金註冊平台更多元化，並為基金經理營造更靈活的經營環境，從而加強香港作為國際資產管理中心的競爭力。\n\n# 伊斯蘭金融\n\n金管局繼續致力增加市場對伊斯蘭金融的認識和了解，包括聯同業界公會舉辦及參與伊斯蘭金融研討會及講座，並與市場參與者分享有關發行伊斯蘭債券的經驗，鼓勵它們使用香港的平台。繼成功發行上兩批伊斯蘭債券後，金管局與政府一直緊密合作，在市場條件合適時推出第三批伊斯蘭債券。\n","terms":{"10年Plus同心展關懷標誌":["10 years plus Caring

Last year’s tax reforms helped create a favourable environment to attract multinational corporations to establish corporate treasury centres in Hong Kong. To develop Hong Kong into an infrastructure financing hub and a financial technology centre, the HKMA established the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office and the Fintech Facilitation Office during the year. During the year, the HKMA granted 13 licences to issuers of stored value facilities. Hong Kong’s robust fiscal performance and substantial net external assets continued to be recognised by credit rating agencies, with Standard & Poor’s maintaining Hong Kong’s triple-A rating.\n\n# Overview\n\nGlobal offshore renminbi business slowed in 2016 due to volatility in global financial markets and uncertainty over the renminbi exchange rate outlook. Nevertheless, Hong Kong maintained its position as a global offshore renminbi business hub, handling around 70% of global renminbi payment transactions. The Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect, a stock market trading link between Shenzhen and Hong Kong, was launched in December, marking another milestone in the opening up of mainland China’s capital account and an important step in enhancing Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre. The HKMA also strengthened financial infrastructure by expanding renminbi liquidity support to the market and introducing measures to increase the transparency of renminbi market liquidity.\n\nIn July, the HKMA established the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO) to promote infrastructure development by bringing together key stakeholders and to develop Hong Kong into an infrastructure financing hub. As at the end of January 2017, more than 60 institutions had joined IFFO as partners. During the year, the HKMA also successfully promoted the passage of legislative amendments to eliminate tax asymmetry and provide tax incentives to encourage multinational and mainland companies to establish corporate treasury centres in Hong Kong, thereby creating more business opportunities for the financial and professional services industries. The number of institutional investors operating in Hong Kong has also been gradually increasing. In October, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, the world’s third largest sovereign wealth fund, announced the establishment of an overseas office in Hong Kong, its only office outside Abu Dhabi.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) gave a positive assessment of our efforts to consolidate Hong Kong’s position as an international financial centre during last year’s Article IV Consultation discussions. During the year, the HKMA actively participated in international discussions to promote global and regional financial stability. The HKMA also maintained close communication with international credit rating agencies, which helped Hong Kong’s credit ratings to be affirmed by major credit rating agencies in 2016.\n\nThe safe, efficient operation and continued development of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure play an important role in consolidating Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre and a global offshore renminbi business hub. The four real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems for processing interbank transactions and the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) system achieved a system availability rate of 100% in 2016, exceeding the target level of 99.95%.\n\nThe HKMA further strengthened Hong Kong’s retail payment financial infrastructure in 2016. During the year, a total of 13 stored value facility licences were granted under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO), which came into full effect in November 2016. The coverage of e-cheque services has also been extended to cross-border payments between Hong Kong and Guangdong Province (including Shenzhen).\n\nTo promote the development of financial technology in Hong Kong, the HKMA established the Fintech Facilitation Office in March. A number of important measures implemented during the year have made good progress.\n\nThe HKMA introduced a series of measures to strengthen the soft power of the banking sector, including (i) launching a director professional development programme; (ii) establishing a competency framework for banking practitioners across the industry; and (iii) implementing a consumer education programme.\n\n# Review of 2016\n\n# Offshore renminbi business\n\nGlobal offshore renminbi business slowed in 2016 due to volatility in global financial markets and uncertainty over the renminbi exchange rate outlook. As at the end of 2016, the combined balance of renminbi customer deposits and certificates of deposit in Hong Kong was RMB6,251 billion, down 38% from the previous year (Figure 1). During the year, offshore renminbi bond issuance fell to RMB528 billion, and renminbi trade settlement processed through Hong Kong banks also fell to RMB45,421 billion. On the other hand, renminbi loans outstanding at Hong Kong banks as at the end of 2016 were RMB2,948 billion, similar to the previous year (Figure 2). Transaction volume in the renminbi RTGS system remained high, with an average daily transaction volume of RMB8,636 billion in 2016. This shows that despite a shrinking renminbi liquidity pool, a large volume of renminbi financial intermediation activities continued to be supported in Hong Kong. According to statistics from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), Hong Kong handled around 70% of renminbi payment activities globally in 2016, which is testament to Hong Kong’s position as a global offshore renminbi business hub.\n\nFigure 1 Renminbi customer deposits and certificates of deposit\n\nFigure 2 Renminbi financing activities\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA worked closely with relevant mainland authorities to seek greater policy flexibility to promote renminbi business in Hong Kong. A number of new measures were introduced during the year, including further opening up of mainland China’s onshore interbank bond and foreign exchange markets, and the launch of Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect in December. In response to increased demand for cross-border investment channels and liquidity management, the HKMA expanded its renminbi liquidity facility. In October, the HKMA increased the number of primary liquidity providers from seven to nine, and the total size of the facility was increased from RMB140 billion to RMB180 billion under the PLP scheme. The transparency of the HKMA’s renminbi liquidity facility utilisation was also enhanced, helping participating banks to manage liquidity more effectively.\n\nThe 13th Five-Year Plan, announced in March, reaffirmed Hong Kong’s position as a global offshore renminbi business hub, demonstrating the central government’s support for Hong Kong to further develop its offshore renminbi business.\n\nAt the same time, the HKMA continued to strengthen cooperation with other economies to develop offshore renminbi business. The HKMA also actively participated in various activities to promote Hong Kong’s role as a global offshore renminbi business hub and a key platform for mainland China’s “go global” strategy, including local events organised by industry associations and private institutions, and overseas events in mainland China, Germany, Kazakhstan and the United Kingdom.\n\n# Arrangement between mainland China and Hong Kong on establishing a closer economic partnership\n\nA new agreement on the basic realisation of service trade liberalisation between mainland China and Hong Kong under the framework of the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA) was signed in 2015. The HKMA continues to closely monitor the implementation of measures under the current arrangement and to work with government authorities to explore further measures to expand the opening up of mainland China’s market to Hong Kong’s financial industry and to facilitate such access.\n\n# Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO)\n\n# Mission of IFFO\n\nIFFO’s mission is to promote infrastructure investment and financing by bringing together key stakeholders. IFFO’s functions are:\n- To provide a platform for information exchange and experience sharing;\n- To enhance skills and knowledge in infrastructure investment and financing;\n- To promote market and product development; and\n- To facilitate infrastructure investment and financing activities.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive Mr Norman Chan (seventh from left) toasts with other guests at the IFFO launch ceremony.\n\nThe HKMA established IFFO in July with the mission of promoting infrastructure investment and financing by bringing together key stakeholders. As at the end of January 2017, more than 60 institutions from mainland China, Hong Kong and overseas had joined IFFO as partners, including multilateral financial institutions and development banks, public institutional investors, private institutional investors, asset management companies, banks, insurance companies, infrastructure project development and operation companies, professional services firms and international business councils (Table 1).\n\nIFFO has made good progress since its establishment. To enhance skills, IFFO co-hosted an executive workshop with the International Finance Corporation (IFC) of the World Bank Group and Eastspring Investments in October on the theme of “Private participation in infrastructure project finance in emerging markets”. The workshop received very positive feedback from participants and helped to increase knowledge and build networks. IFFO also organised a senior executive seminar in November, with Mr Jin Liqun, President of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, as the keynote speaker, sharing his experience in infrastructure project planning, operation and management. In July, IFFO signed memorandums of understanding (MOUs) with the IFC and the Global Infrastructure Hub to establish a cooperation framework. In December, IFFO also signed MOUs with the China Development Bank (CDB) and the Export-Import Bank of China to promote infrastructure project financing by the two banks through the IFFO platform. These activities helped to strengthen Hong Kong’s position and international image as an infrastructure financing hub.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive Mr Norman Chan (front left) and Mr Philippe Le Houérou, Executive Vice President and CEO of the IFC (front right), signed a memorandum of understanding to enable both parties to cooperate in using the IFFO platform to create a more efficient and favourable market environment for infrastructure investment and financing in the region.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive Mr Norman Chan (front left) and Mr Chris Heathcote, CEO of the Global Infrastructure Hub (front right), signed a memorandum of understanding to establish a strategic cooperation framework to promote infrastructure project financing.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive Mr Norman Chan (left) and Mr Hu Huaibang, Chairman of the CDB, signed a memorandum of understanding to strengthen cooperation between the bank and the HKMA.\n\n# Corporate treasury centres\n\nTo further attract multinational corporations to establish corporate treasury centres (CTCs) in Hong Kong, the HKMA worked with government authorities to create a favourable tax environment for CTCs. Specifically, the Inland Revenue (Amendment) (No. 2) Ordinance 2016 was passed in June, allowing enterprises, subject to specified conditions, to deduct interest expenses incurred in intra-group financing business when calculating profits tax, and to enjoy a 50% profits tax concession (i.e. a reduction to 8.25%) on profits derived from specified treasury activities conducted by eligible CTCs. Table 2 summarises some key points of the revised tax regime.\n\nIn addition to legislative work, the HKMA also actively promoted the advantages of establishing CTCs in Hong Kong to multinational and mainland enterprises. As at the end of 2016, the HKMA had contacted nearly 400 companies, financial institutions and industry associations, including SME associations. In November, the HKMA also signed a memorandum of understanding with the Hong Kong Chinese Enterprises Association to help mainland enterprises in Hong Kong to better understand and make more use of our CTC platform.\n\n# Promotion of asset management business\n\nThe HKMA continued to promote Hong Kong as an asset management centre. According to the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), the number of licensed corporations engaged in asset management was 1,300 at the end of 2016, an increase of nearly 15% year-on-year. According to the Asian Venture Capital Journal, the number of private equity firms in Hong Kong (including SFC-licensed and non-SFC-licensed firms) also increased by 4.6% to 431 in 2016. To date, nearly 70 of the world’s top 100 asset management companies, and most of the top 20 mainland mutual fund companies, have established operations or affiliated companies in Hong Kong. The number of institutional investors, or asset owners, operating in Hong Kong has also been gradually increasing. In October, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, the world’s third largest sovereign wealth fund, announced the establishment of an overseas office in Hong Kong, its only office outside Abu Dhabi.\n\n# Introduction of open-ended fund company structure\n\nTo attract funds to domicile in Hong Kong, the HKMA continued to work with the government and the industry to create a more favourable tax and regulatory environment. In June, the Securities and Futures (Amendment) Ordinance 2016 was passed, introducing an open-ended fund company structure to make Hong Kong’s fund domiciliation platform more diversified and to create a more flexible operating environment for fund managers, thereby enhancing Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international asset management centre.\n\n# Islamic finance\n\nThe HKMA continued to enhance market understanding and knowledge of Islamic finance, including co-organising and participating in Islamic finance conferences with industry associations, and sharing experience in sukuk issuance with market participants to encourage them to use Hong Kong’s platform. Following the successful issuance of the first two batches of sukuk, the HKMA and the government have been working closely to launch a third batch of sukuk when market conditions are appropriate."}
{"zh":"# 儲備管理\n\n2016年是充滿意外和黑天鵝事件的一年，環球金融市場出現大波動和震盪。2016年年初市場憂慮內地經濟硬着陸及全球增長放緩，促使環球股市大幅下挫。6月英國脫歐公投和11月美國大選結果亦出人意表。儘管投資環境困難，金管局在過去幾年已採取連串防禦措施，增強外匯基金的抗震能力，因此外匯基金在2016年仍錄得2% 的整體投資回報。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》，外匯基金的首要目的是直接或間接影響港元匯價，亦可運用於保持香港貨幣及金融體系穩定健全，藉此保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。外匯基金由財政司司長掌有控制權，並投資於其經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後認為合適的證券或其他資產。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標及組合結構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會為外匯基金制定下列投資目標：\n(a) 保障資本；\n(b) 確保整體貨幣基礎在任何時候都由流通性極高的美元資產提供十足支持；\n(c) 確保流動資金足以維持貨幣及金融穩定；以及\n(d) 在符合上述(a)至(c)項的前提下盡量爭取投資回報，以保障基金的長期購買力。\n\n以上目標全面顧及外匯基金的法定目的，並已於外匯基金的組合結構及目標資產分布中反映。\n\n外匯基金大致上分成兩個主要組合：支持組合及投資組合。支持組合持有流通性極高的美元資產，按照貨幣發行局制度的規定為貨幣基礎提供十足支持。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債市及股市，以保障資產的價值及長期購買力。這兩個組合整體債券與股票的長線目標分布比率為71比29。以目標貨幣比重計，91%的資產分配予美元及港元，其餘9%分配予其他貨幣。\n\n為能更妥善管理風險及提高中長期回報，金管局以審慎及循序漸進方式將外匯基金的部分資產分散投資至較多元化的資產類別，包括新興巿場及內地債券與股票、私募股權，以及海外投資物業。新興巿場及內地債券與股票由投資組合持有，私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合持有。長期增長組合的市值上限為外匯基金累計盈餘的三分之一，但因應部分未來基金投放於長期資產，市值上限還有增加的空間。\n\n策略性資產組合於2007年設立，以持有政府基於策略性目的而為外匯基金帳目購入的香港交易及結算所有限公司股份。由於這個組合性質獨特，因此外匯基金的投資表現評估並無將其包括在內。\n\n# 於外匯基金的存款\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定組織的存款，利率一般與投資組合的表現掛鈎2，惟未來基金存款則除外。未來基金存款的利率與投資組合及長期增長組合的表現掛鈎，實際利率視乎組合比重而定。於2016年底，未來基金在投資組合與長期增長組合的比重為80：20。預期截至2018年底，未來基金存款中與長期增長組合掛鈎的部分會逐步增加至約50%。\n\n# 投資程序\n\n外匯基金的投資程序分別以策略性資產分布及戰略性資產分布作基礎。策略性資產分布，即投資基準反映的分布情況，顯示外匯基金為達到投資目標而可以作出的最佳長線資產分布。外匯基金以策略性分布作為指引，對資產進行戰略性分布，以爭取超越基準的回報。因此，實際分布往往會與基準分布（亦即策略性分布）有所偏離，而實際與基準分布之間的差距稱為「戰略性偏離」。財政司司長經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後制定投資基準及戰略性偏離的限度，金管局獲授權決定戰略性資產分布。投資組合經理可在戰略性偏離的限度內選持倉盤，從短期市場變化中獲利。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局儲備管理部職員直接管理外匯基金約74%的投資，其中包括整個支持組合及部分投資組合。該部分投資組合投資於環球定息市場，並透過衍生工具執行外匯基金的宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 外聘投資經理\n\n除透過內部職員管理資產外，金管局亦僱用外聘投資經理負責管理外匯基金約26%的資產，其中包括所有上市股票組合及其他特別資產。僱用外聘投資經理的目的，是要運用市場上最佳的專業投資技術為外匯基金投資，並讓外匯基金受惠於多元化的投資方式，以及讓內部專業人員汲取市場知識與資訊。\n\n僱用外聘投資經理的相關支出包括基金管理與託管費、交易費、預扣稅及其他稅項。這些支出主要受市場因素影響而每年不同。\n\n金管局支持證券及期貨事務監察委員會於2016年3月7日發布的《負責任的擁有權原則》（《原則》）。《原則》屬自願性質，旨在協助投資者釐定如何以最佳方法履行其於香港上市公司的投資的擁有權責任。就外匯基金的管理而言，金管局鼓勵獲委任負責管理香港股票組合的外聘基金經理在管理有關投資時採納《原則》。\n\n# 風險管理及監察\n\n近年金融市場波動極大，凸顯風險管理的重要。金管局為內部及外聘投資經理所管理的投資組合均訂立嚴格管控措施及投資指引，並密切監察對指引及法規的遵守情況；另亦採用風險管控工具來評估在正常及極度不利市況下的市場風險。金管局亦進行詳細的投資表現因素分析，務求能最有效地運用內部及外聘投資經理的投資管理技術。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2016年的金融市場\n\n2016年環球金融市場出現大波動和震盪。股票市場方面，1月市場憂慮內地經濟硬着陸及全球增長放緩，促使香港及其他主要股市大幅下挫，直至2月中旬市場才穩定下來。6月英國脫歐公投及11月美國大選結果相繼出人意表，但股市在經歷短暫下挫後迅速收復失地。全年計，環球股市普遍表現理想。\n\n債券市場方面，第1季商品價格進一步下跌加深市場對全球增長放緩及低通脹的憂慮，加上第2季英國脫歐公投帶來的不明朗因素及市場對中央銀行維持寬鬆政策的預期，加大了市場對安全資產的需求，支持政府債市於2016年上半年有不俗表現。其中10年期美國國庫券收益率在7月跌至1.36%的歷史低位。然而，在下半年由於市場對美國加息的預期升溫，尤其在美國總統選舉後，美國國庫券收益率飆升。其他主要政府債券的收益率亦上升，但升幅較小。\n\n貨幣市場方面，美元在2016年繼續走強，美元匯價指數升至14年來的高位。美元持續強勢，是受到美元與其他主要貨幣的利率差距擴大所支持。雖然日圓兌美元於2016年上升約3%，歐元兌美元下跌約3%。在英國脫歐公投結果帶來的不明朗因素持續困擾下，英鎊兌美元於年內亦下跌16%，是自2008年以來的最大跌幅。\n\n表1列載主要貨幣、債巿及股市在2016年的表現。\n\n表1 2016年市場回報\n股市表現按照年內指數價格變動計算。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n儘管金融市場大幅波動，外匯基金在2016年仍錄得681億港元投資收入，包括外地股票收益286億港元、香港股票收益53億港元、債券收益331億港元、外匯基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資收益169億港元，以及非港元資產外匯估值下調158億港元。由於去年美元匯價急升，外匯基金非美元投資轉作港元時無可避免出現外匯估值下調。另一方面，策略性資產組合錄得7億港元估值虧損。\n\n於2016年年底，外匯基金的資產總額達36,187億港元。長期增長組合投資的市值總計1,818億港元，當中包括私募股權1,168億港元及房地產650億港元，已承擔但尚未提取作投資的總額為1,338億港元。\n\n儘管投資環境挑戰不絕，外匯基金在2016年仍錄得2%的投資回報率（不包括策略性資產組合）。長期增長組合自2009年開展投資以來的內部回報率年率約為12%。\n\n由於外圍投資環境持續惡化，過去幾年金管局已作出一系列防禦部署，包括縮短債券組合年期、增持現金及大幅減持非美元及非港元資產。我們亦加快多元化投資的步伐，特別是長期增長組合的投資。這些部署大大增強外匯基金的抗震能力。\n\n圖1列明外匯基金由1994至2016年的年度回報率。表2顯示外匯基金在2016年的投資回報率及不同年期的平均投資回報率。外匯基金在過去3年的平均回報率為0.9%、過去5年為2.0%、過去10年為2.6%，以及由1994年起為4.8%。表3列載外匯基金資產於2016年12月31日的貨幣比重。\n\n圖

upheaval. At the start of the year, concerns about a hard landing in the Chinese mainland economy and a global economic slowdown prompted a sharp decline in global stock markets. The results of the UK’s Brexit referendum in June and the US presidential election in November were also unexpected. Despite the challenging investment climate, the HKMA has implemented a series of defensive measures over the past few years to strengthen the Exchange Fund’s resilience, enabling it to achieve an overall investment return of 2% in 2016.\n\n# Exchange Fund\n\nUnder the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the primary purpose of the Exchange Fund is to influence the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar directly or indirectly. It may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems, thereby preserving Hong Kong’s position as an international financial centre. The Exchange Fund is controlled by the Financial Secretary and is invested in securities or other assets deemed appropriate after consultation with the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee.\n\n# Management of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee has established the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n(a) to safeguard capital;\n(b) to ensure that the overall monetary base is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar assets at all times;\n(c) to ensure sufficient liquidity to maintain monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) to achieve investment returns, within the constraints of (a) to (c) above, in order to preserve the Fund’s long-term purchasing power.\n\nThese objectives fully reflect the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund and are embodied in its portfolio structure and target asset allocation.\n\nThe Exchange Fund is broadly divided into two main portfolios: the Backing Portfolio and the Investment Portfolio. The Backing Portfolio holds highly liquid US dollar assets to fully back the monetary base, in accordance with the requirements of the Currency Board system. The Investment Portfolio is primarily invested in the bond and equity markets of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development member countries, with the aim of preserving asset value and long-term purchasing power. The long-term target bond-to-equity ratio for these two portfolios combined is 71:29. In terms of target currency allocation, 91% of assets are denominated in US dollars and Hong Kong dollars, with the remaining 9% in other currencies.\n\nTo better manage risk and enhance medium- to long-term returns, the HKMA has prudently and progressively diversified a portion of the Exchange Fund’s assets into more varied asset classes, including emerging market and mainland Chinese bonds and equities, private equity, and overseas investment properties. Emerging market and mainland Chinese bonds and equities are held within the Investment Portfolio, while private equity and real estate investments are held within the Long-Term Growth Portfolio. The market value cap of the Long-Term Growth Portfolio is one-third of the Exchange Fund’s accumulated surplus, but this cap may increase as some future funds are invested in long-term assets.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio was established in 2007 to hold shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, which were purchased by the government for strategic purposes on behalf of the Exchange Fund. Due to its unique nature, this portfolio is excluded from the assessment of the Exchange Fund’s investment performance.\n\n# Deposits in the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund periodically accepts deposits from fiscal reserves, government funds, and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the investment portfolio, except for deposits from the Future Fund. The interest rate for Future Fund deposits is linked to the performance of both the investment portfolio and the Long-Term Growth Portfolio, with the actual rate depending on the portfolio mix. At the end of 2016, the Future Fund’s allocation between the investment portfolio and the Long-Term Growth Portfolio was 80:20. It is expected that by the end of 2018, the portion of Future Fund deposits linked to the Long-Term Growth Portfolio will gradually increase to around 50%.\n\n# Investment process\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s investment process is based on both strategic and tactical asset allocation. Strategic asset allocation, as reflected in the investment benchmark, represents the optimal long-term asset allocation that the Exchange Fund can adopt to achieve its investment objectives. The Exchange Fund uses this strategic allocation as a guide and makes tactical asset allocation decisions to achieve returns above the benchmark. Consequently, actual allocation often deviates from the benchmark (i.e., the strategic allocation), and the difference between actual and benchmark allocation is referred to as a “tactical deviation”. The Financial Secretary, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, sets the investment benchmark and limits on tactical deviations. The HKMA is authorised to determine the tactical asset allocation. Portfolio managers can select holdings within the limits of tactical deviations to capitalise on short-term market changes.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nStaff from the HKMA’s Reserves Management Department directly manage approximately 74% of the Exchange Fund’s investments, including the entire Backing Portfolio and part of the Investment Portfolio. This portion of the Investment Portfolio is invested in global fixed-income markets and uses derivative instruments to implement the Exchange Fund’s macro risk management strategies.\n\n# External managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets through internal staff, the HKMA also employs external managers to manage around 26% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all listed equity portfolios and other special assets. The purpose of employing external managers is to leverage the best professional investment expertise available in the market, enable the Exchange Fund to benefit from diversified investment approaches, and allow internal professionals to gain market knowledge and insights.\n\nThe costs associated with employing external managers include fund management and custodian fees, transaction fees, withholding taxes, and other taxes. These costs vary from year to year, primarily due to market factors.\n\nThe HKMA supports the Principles of Responsible Ownership published by the Securities and Futures Commission on 7 March 2016. These Principles are voluntary and aim to help investors determine how best to fulfil their ownership responsibilities in relation to their investments in Hong Kong-listed companies. When managing the Exchange Fund, the HKMA encourages external fund managers responsible for Hong Kong equity portfolios to adopt these Principles in their investment management practices.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nIn recent years, significant volatility in financial markets has underscored the importance of risk management. The HKMA has established strict control measures and investment guidelines for portfolios managed by both internal and external managers and closely monitors compliance with these guidelines and regulations. It also employs risk-control tools to assess market risks under both normal and extremely adverse conditions. Furthermore, the HKMA conducts detailed performance attribution analyses to optimise the use of investment management expertise from both internal and external managers.\n\n# Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Financial markets in 2016\n\nGlobal financial markets experienced significant volatility and upheaval in 2016. In the equity markets, concerns about a hard landing in the Chinese mainland economy and a global economic slowdown in January led to sharp declines in Hong Kong and other major stock markets, which only stabilised by mid-February. The outcomes of the UK’s Brexit referendum in June and the US presidential election in November were both unexpected, but equity markets recovered quickly after brief downturns. Overall, global equity markets performed well throughout the year.\n\nIn the bond markets, further declines in commodity prices in the first quarter heightened concerns about a global economic slowdown and low inflation. Additionally, uncertainty stemming from the UK’s Brexit referendum in the second quarter and expectations of continued accommodative policies by central banks increased demand for safe assets, supporting strong performance in government bond markets during the first half of 2016. The yield on 10-year US Treasury notes fell to a historic low of 1.36% in July. However, yields on US Treasury notes surged in the second half of the year as expectations of a US interest rate hike intensified, particularly after the presidential election. Yields on other major government bonds also rose, albeit by a smaller margin.\n\nIn the currency markets, the US dollar continued to strengthen in 2016, with the US dollar index reaching a 14-year high. The sustained strength of the US dollar was supported by the widening interest rate differential between the US dollar and other major currencies. While the yen appreciated by around 3% against the US dollar in 2016, the euro depreciated by around 3%. Amid ongoing uncertainty following the UK’s Brexit referendum result, the pound fell by 16% against the US dollar during the year, marking its largest decline since 2008.\n\nTable 1 presents the performance of major currencies, bond markets, and equity markets in 2016.\n\nTable 1 Market returns in 2016\nEquity market performance is calculated based on index price changes over the year.\n\n# Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\nDespite significant market volatility, the Exchange Fund recorded investment income of HK$68.1 billion in 2016. This included overseas equity returns of HK$28.6 billion, Hong Kong equity returns of HK$5.3 billion, bond returns of HK$33.1 billion, other investment returns of HK$16.9 billion from the Exchange Fund’s investment holding subsidiaries, and a negative currency translation effect of HK$15.8 billion for non-Hong Kong dollar assets. The negative currency translation effect arose when non-US dollar investments were converted into Hong Kong dollars due to the sharp appreciation of the US dollar during the year. Meanwhile, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation loss of HK$7 billion.\n\nAt the end of 2016, the total assets of the Exchange Fund amounted to HK$3,618.7 billion. The total market value of investments in the Long-Term Growth Portfolio was HK$181.8 billion, comprising private equity of HK$116.8 billion and real estate of HK$65.0 billion, with outstanding investment commitments of HK$1,338 billion.\n\nDespite a challenging investment environment, the Exchange Fund achieved an investment return of 2% in 2016 (excluding the Strategic Portfolio). The annualised internal rate of return of the Long-Term Growth Portfolio since its inception in 2009 has been approximately 12%.\n\nGiven the deteriorating external investment environment, the HKMA has implemented a series of defensive measures over the past few years, including shortening the duration of bond portfolios, increasing cash holdings, and significantly reducing non-US dollar and non-Hong Kong dollar assets. We have also accelerated the pace of diversification, particularly within the Long-Term Growth Portfolio. These measures have substantially enhanced the Exchange Fund’s resilience.\n\nChart 1 illustrates the annual returns of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2016. Table 2 shows the Exchange Fund’s investment returns in 2016 and its average investment returns over various periods. The average return of the Exchange Fund over the past 3 years was 0.9%, over the past 5 years was 2.0%, over the past 10 years was 2.6%, and since 1994 was 4.8%.

薪酬福利政策及薪酬檢討機制\n\n財政司司長透過外匯基金諮詢委員會聽取其轄下管治委員會提供的意見，並參考市場薪酬水平及做法，決定金管局員工的薪酬及服務條件。薪酬組合包括現金薪酬及公積金，另設一些基本福利。現金薪酬包括每月固定薪酬（即基本薪酬）及根據員工工作表現每年一次過發放的浮動薪酬。\n\n財政司司長每年檢討金管局員工薪酬時，會透過外匯基金諮詢委員會聽取其轄下管治委員會的建議，並考慮管治委員會對金管局過去一年的表現評估、獨立人力資源顧問公司進行的金融業薪酬調查結果，以及其他相關因素。個別工作表現優秀的員工的薪酬亦可能獲得特別調整，以保持其薪酬競爭力。\n\n金管局按個別員工的工作表現，分配獲批准用作調整年度固定薪酬或發放浮動薪酬的款項；而用於專業投資人員的浮動薪酬制度，則旨在加強其投資表現與薪酬的連繫。助理總裁或以上職級員工的固定薪酬調整或浮動薪酬的發放，是由財政司司長經參考管治委員會的意見後批准，有關員工在會議討論到其薪酬的議案時會避席。主管及以下職級員工的固定薪酬調整或浮動薪酬的發放，則由金管局總裁根據財政司司長授權，並按照獲批准用作支付薪酬的整筆款項來決定。\n\n# 高層人員薪酬\n\n表2列載2016年高層人員的薪酬資料。\n\n1. 除累積年假外，服務不足1年的員工所得的實際薪酬會化作全年計算，以得出有關職級的平均全年薪酬。2. 本表所載員工人數包括服務不足1年的員工。高級助理總裁職級人數包括香港按揭證券有限公司總裁在內。3. 其他福利包括公積金、醫療及人壽保險，以及年內累積的年假。這些福利會因應個別高層人員的服務條件而有所不同。\n","terms":{"10年Plus同心展關懷標誌":["10 years plus Caring Organisation Logo"],"2016年存款保障計劃（修訂）條例":["Deposit Protection Scheme (Amendment) Ordinance

education activities, and other channels to enhance public understanding of its policies and operations. During the year, the HKMA continued to strengthen its corporate governance, including promoting staff professional development, tightening financial control, and enhancing information technology security, to meet the challenges posed by the implementation of new measures and the increasing workload.\n\n# Institutional Development to Maintain Public Engagement\n\n# Public Communications\n\nThe HKMA maintains close contact with the media to enhance its transparency and improve public understanding of its policies and work. In 2016, the HKMA conducted 81 public media events, including 14 press conferences, 13 on-site interviews, and 54 other public events, and arranged 30 media interviews. During the year, 326 bilingual press releases were issued, and a large number of media enquiries were handled daily.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA established two important offices: the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO) and the Financial Technology Facilitation Office (FFO). To explain their functions and work plans, the HKMA conducted various public communication activities. In addition, the HKMA organised media briefings and seminars to enhance public understanding of its operations and measures in areas such as financial inclusion, reserves management, the Fintech Supervisory Sandbox, cybersecurity, and small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) financing.\n\nThe Chief Executive of the HKMA, Mr Norman Chan, met with reporters during the Hong Kong Association of Banks’ annual Beijing trip in December 2016.\n\n# Public Enquiries\n\nThe Public Enquiry Service provides an effective channel for citizens to obtain information about the HKMA’s functions and work. In 2016, this service handled 10,170 enquiries, a 12% increase compared to 2015. About half of the enquiries were related to banking policies and regulations, monetary and economic issues, and consumer banking matters, particularly banking products and services, the Coin Collection Programme, banking-related guidelines and circulars, stored value facilities (SVFs), retail payment systems, the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing, and prudential measures for property mortgage loans.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received each year since 2013, and Chart 2 shows the proportion of different types of enquiries in 2016.\n\n# Publications\n\nIn addition to the HKMA Annual Report, the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report and four issues of the Quarterly Bulletin during the year. It also regularly updated the Monthly Statistical Bulletin to provide the latest and topical information and analysis on Hong Kong’s currency, banking, and economic affairs. Furthermore, the HKMA published 32 inSight articles in 2016, a significant increase from 14 in 2015, analysing various topics related to its work.\n\nThe HKMA’s 2015 Annual Report won the Silver Award in the “Non-Profit and Charitable Organisations” category at the 2016 Best Annual Reports Awards organised by the Hong Kong Management Association.\n\n# Public Education Programme\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre, located on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre, introduces the HKMA’s work to the public and enhances public understanding of monetary and banking matters. The Information Centre consists of an exhibition area and a library, both open to the public six days a week. The exhibition area introduces the HKMA’s work and the development of Hong Kong’s currency and banking sector, and provides reading materials and exhibits for research on Hong Kong’s currency, banking, and financial affairs.\n\nThe policy exhibition area of the Information Centre, which explains the HKMA’s work and introduces related financial knowledge, underwent renovation in the fourth quarter of 2016. The renovation enriched the exhibition content and added various interactive elements, particularly interactive games that combine learning with play to explain financial concepts in a simple and accessible manner. There are also colourful touchscreens that provide a more comprehensive and in-depth introduction to the HKMA’s work, aiming to offer visitors a brand-new experience. Additionally, the renovated Information Centre features a mosaic of Victoria Harbour made from over 130,000 Hong Kong coins. The newly designed policy exhibition area reopened to the public on 24 February 2017.\n\n# HKMA Website\n\nThe HKMA’s corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk) provides over 50,000 pages of information in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, making it convenient for the public to access the latest information about the HKMA. The website also contains the Register of Securities Staff of Authorised Institutions and the Register of Authorised Institutions and Local Representative Offices maintained under Section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the Register of SVF Licensees maintained under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance. The website features special topic pages and prominent quick links to remind the public of the HKMA’s new measures, such as the regulatory regime for SVFs, IFFO and FFO, and important and timely matters, such as precautions against telephone scams and the parking locations of coin collection carts.\n\nThe new design of the policy exhibition area at the Information Centre.\n\nA mosaic of Victoria Harbour made from Hong Kong coins.\n\nThe Information Centre provides guided tours for visitors. During the year, the Information Centre received over 56,200 visitors and provided more than 580 guided tours for schools and other groups (Chart 3). Since its opening in December 2003, the Information Centre has cumulatively received over 586,600 visitors.\n\nAdjacent to the exhibition area, the library houses over 23,000 books, journals, and other publications for in-depth research on Hong Kong’s currency, banking, finance, and central banking issues. The library also maintains the electronic registers of authorised institutions and local representative offices, as well as the register of securities staff of authorised institutions, as required under Section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nTo maintain contact with the community and enhance public understanding of the HKMA’s work, the HKMA continued to organise public education seminars. In 2016, the HKMA held three public seminars, attracting over 1,750 secondary school students and teachers. The topics included the linked exchange rate system, banking stability, banknotes in Hong Kong, smart tips for using banking products and services, and the Deposit Protection Scheme. Since its launch in 1998, the education seminar programme has been attended by over 56,400 citizens.\n\nStudents and teachers from various secondary schools attended one of the public education seminars.\n\nChart 3 Types of groups visiting the Information Centre in 2016\n\n# Human Resources\n\nThe HKMA recruits, trains, and maintains a professional and excellent workforce to achieve its policy objectives and respond flexibly to changes in work priorities. The HKMA is part of the government structure but employs staff under non-civil service terms to attract talent with appropriate experience and expertise. As a public institution, the HKMA strives to maintain a streamlined and flexible organisational structure and implements new measures and copes with increasing workloads by redeploying existing staff as much as possible.\n\n# Staffing\n\nThe HKMA’s staffing level was 875 at the beginning of 2016. In the second half of 2016, 12 positions were added to fulfil the HKMA’s regulatory functions under the new insurance regulatory regime. Therefore, the HKMA’s staffing level was 887 at the end of 2016.\n\nTo ensure sufficient resources for implementing new laws and policies, continuing pilot projects that need to be sustained, and handling increasingly heavy and complex existing work, the HKMA’s overall establishment increased by 40 to 927 in 2017 (a 4.5% increase). The new positions are responsible for the following functions:\n- Promoting the stability of the banking and financial system, including:\n    - Strengthening supervisory capacity to manage banks’ increasing technology risks and new fintech projects, and to cope with banks’ regional and business expansion;\n    - Strengthening regulatory and enforcement efforts to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, and preparing for the 2018 mutual evaluation by the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering;\n    - Planning and preparing for the implementation of the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance to address the “too big to fail” issue in the financial sector in accordance with international standards; and\n    - Strengthening supervisory capacity to comply with new international standards on capital and market risks, and allocating more resources to handle consumer protection matters and bank complaints.\n- Strengthening investment, risk management, and other related support in response to the increased investment work involved in further promoting the diversification of Exchange Fund investment products, while enhancing strategic asset allocation and investment processes to cope with the increasingly challenging investment environment.\n- Formulating and implementing talent development programmes and strengthening related resources to ensure that the HKMA has the human resources needed to respond to market developments and future challenges.\n- Strengthening research on monetary policy and the processing of monetary statistics, and providing resources to handle enquiries and complaints related to licensing\/designation and regulatory matters for SVFs and retail payment systems.\n\nTable 1 shows the HKMA’s establishment and actual staff numbers by department.\nTable 1: HKMA establishment and actual staff numbers as at 1 January 2017\n\nThe HKMA allocates temporary resources to handle other work and seconds staff to international or local institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Development Bureau, to assist with work or policies in which Hong Kong or the HKMA is involved. In addition, the HKMA assigns staff to the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board and the Treasury Markets Association to provide full-time or assistance-based operational support.\n\n# Remuneration Policies and Salary Review Mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary determines the remuneration and terms of service of HKMA employees through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (eFAC), taking into account the views of its Governance Sub-Committee (GSC) and market remuneration levels and practices. The remuneration package includes cash remuneration and a provident fund scheme, as well as some basic benefits. Cash remuneration consists of a monthly fixed salary (i.e. basic salary) and variable pay based on annual employee performance.\n\nWhen reviewing HKMA employees’ salaries annually, the Financial Secretary seeks advice from the GSC of the eFAC and considers the GSC’s assessment of the HKMA’s performance in the previous year, the results of a salary survey of the financial sector conducted by an independent human resources consultancy, and other relevant factors. The salaries of individual employees with outstanding performance may also be specially adjusted to maintain their competitiveness.\n\nThe HKMA allocates funds approved for adjusting annual fixed salaries or paying variable pay based on individual employees’ performance. The variable pay system for investment professionals is designed to strengthen the link between their investment performance and remuneration. Adjustments to the fixed salaries or payments of variable pay for Assistant Presidents or above are approved by the Financial Secretary after consulting the GSC. The employees concerned will absent themselves from meetings when their remuneration is discussed. Adjustments to the fixed salaries or payments of variable pay for Division Heads and below are determined by the Chief Executive of the HKMA under the Financial Secretary’s authorisation and in accordance with the lump sum approved for salary payments.\n\n# Senior Staff Remuneration\n\nTable 2 shows the remuneration of senior staff in 2016.\n\n1. Except for accumulated leave, the actual remuneration of employees with less than one year of service is annualised to derive the average annual remuneration for the respective grade.  \n2. The number of employees shown in this table includes those with less than one year of service.

{"zh":"# 外匯基金\n\n# 審計署署長報告\n\n# 香港特別行政區政府審昇計毐署\n\n# 獨立審計師報告致財政司司長\n\n# 意見\n\n茲證明我已審計列載於第149至237頁外匯基金及其附屬公司（「集團」）的財務報表，該等財務報表包括外匯基金及集團於2016年12月31日的資產負債表與截至該日止年度的收支帳目、全面收益表、權益變動表和現金流量表，以及財務報表的附註，包括主要會計政策概要。\n\n我認為，該等財務報表已按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》真實而公平地反映外匯基金及集團於2016年12月31日的財務狀況及截至該日止年度的財務表現和現金流量，並已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》 （第66章）第7條下所發出的指示妥為擬備。\n\n# 意見的基礎\n\n我已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示及審計署的審計準則進行審計。我根據該等準則而須承擔的責任，詳載於本報告「審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任」部分。根據該等準則，我獨立於集團，並已按該等準則履行其他道德責任。我相信，我所獲得的審計憑證是充足和適當地為我的審計意見提供基礎。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項是根據我的專業判斷，對截至2016年12月31日止年度財務報表的審計最為重要的事項。我對整體財務報表進行審計及形成意見時處理了這些事項，而我不會對這些事項提供單獨的意見。\n\n# 審計署署長報告（續）\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n我在審計中如何處理有關事項\n\n# 按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.5、2.6及36.1。\n\n於2016年12月31日，集團按公平值列帳的金融資產共31,989.75億港元，金融負債共9,639.77億港元。\n\n95%的該等金融資產及所有該等金融負債的公平值為相同資產或負債於活躍市場的報價（第1級參數），或是以估值方法估計，而所用的參數是以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第2級參數）。\n\n其餘5%的該等金融資產的公平值，是以估值方法估計，而所用的參數並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第3級參數）。有關金融資產共1,758.86億港元，主要包括非上市投資基金。\n\n鑑於所涉數額龐大及涉及估計，按公平值列帳的金融資產及金 融負債的估值屬關鍵審計事項。\n\n就按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值，審計程序包括：\n- 了解不同類別金融資產及金融負債的估值程序，包括相關監控措施；\n- 評價及測試監控措施，包括電腦系統的相關應用程式監控措施；\n- 就金融資產及金融負債的估值、存在、權利與責任及完整性取得函證；\n- 若使用市場報價，根據獨立來源核實價格；\n- 若所用估值方法的參數是以可觀察市場數據為基礎，評價估值方法是否適合及有關假設是否合理，以及根據獨立來源核實參數；及\n- 若所用估值方法的參數並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎，評價估值方法是否適合，以及有關假設與參數是否合理。\n\n# 未來基金存款\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.6、2.16.1、4(b)、23及28。\n\n在以往年度，財政儲備的絕大部分存款均須於要求時償還，並按每年參考投資組合過去的投資回報釐定的固定息率計算利息。\n\n政府於2016年1月1日在財政儲備內設立未來基金。未來基金存款包含來自土地基金結餘的首筆資金（為數2,197.30億港元），以及從政府一般收入帳目轉撥的恆常注資（金額由財政司司長指示）。未來基金存款的利息按綜合息率計算，而該綜合息率是參考上文提及與投資組合的表現掛鈎的固定息率及與長期增長組合（持有私募股權及房地產投資）的表現掛鈎的年度回報率，每年在加權平均基礎上釐定。除財政司司長另有指示外，未來基金的存款連同所賺取的利息應在2025年12月31日償還。\n\n於2016年12月31日，未來基金的存款共2,245.30億港元。有關存款的累計利息為100.71億港元。由於涉及數額龐大及存款條件有重大改變，需要格外關注有關存款及所賺取的利息的計量、列報方式及披露資料。\n\n就未來基金存款，審計程序包括：\n- 評價計量有關存款及所賺取的利息所用的會計政策是否恰當；\n- 審視與長期增長組合的表現掛鈎的年度回報率的計算方法；\n- 核實參考投資組合以往的表現釐定的固定息率、與長期增長組合的表現掛鈎的年度回報率及參考該兩項息率釐定的綜合息率的計算；\n- 核實以綜合息率計算的應計利息數額；及\n- 審視有關存款及所賺取的利息在財務報表中的列報方式及披露資料。\n\n# 按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.12、17及18。\n\n集團的投資物業按公平值列帳，於2016年12月31日共值227.23億港元。集團亦於3間聯營公司及14間合營公司擁有權益，該等公司主要業務為持有海外投資物業，有關權益共值320.83億港元。不論是由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有，該等投資物業的公平值均主要根據獨立專業估值師的估值釐定。該等估值涉及重大判斷及估計，包括所用的估值方法及假設。\n\n就按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值，審計程序包括：\n- 獲取及審視由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有的投資物業的估值報告，並核實公平值是根據有關估值報告所列的估值釐定；\n- 評估估值師的獨立性及資歷；及\n- 評價估值方法是否適合，以及有關假設與參數是否合理。\n\n# 其他資料\n\n金融管理專員須對其他資料負責。其他資料包括金融管理局2016年年報內的所有資料，但不包括財務報表及我的審計師報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見並不涵蓋其他資料，我亦不對其他資料發表任何形式的鑒證結論。\n\n就財務報表審計而言，我有責任閱讀其他資料，從而考慮其他資料是否與財務報表或我在審計過程中得悉的情況有重大矛盾，或者似乎存有重大錯誤陳述。基於我已執行的工作，如果我認為其他資料存有重大錯誤陳述，我需要報告該事實。在這方面，我沒有任何報告。\n\n# 金融管理專員及外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會就財務報表而須承擔的責任\n\n金融管理專員須負責按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》及行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示擬備真實而公平的財務報表，及落實其認為必要的內部控制，使財務報表不存有因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在擬備財務報表時，金融管理專員須負責評估集團持續經營的能力， 以及在適用情況下披露與持續經營有關的事項，並以持續經營作為會計基礎。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會負責監督集團的財務報告過程。\n\n# 審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任\n\n我的目標是就整體財務報表是否不存有任何因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述取得合理保證，並發出包括我意見的審計師報告。合理保證是高水平的保證，但不能確保按審計署審計準則進行的審計定能發現所存有的任何重大錯誤陳述。錯誤陳述可以由欺詐或錯誤引起，如果合理預期它們個別或滙總起來可能影響財務報表使用者所作出的經濟決定，則會被視作重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在根據審計署審計準則進行審計的過程中，我會運用專業判斷並秉持專業懷疑態度。我亦會：\n- 識別和評估因欺詐或錯誤而導致財務報表存有重大錯誤陳述的風險；設計及執行審計程序以應對這些風險；以及取得充足和適當的審計憑證，作為我意見的基礎。由於欺詐可能涉及串謀、偽造、蓄意遺漏、虛假陳述，或凌駕內部控制的情況，因此未能發現因欺詐而導致重大錯誤陳述的風險，較未能發現因錯誤而導致者為高；\n- 了解與審計相關的內部控制，以設計適當的審計程序。然而，此舉並非旨在對集團內部控制的有效性發表意見；\n- 評價金融管理專員所採用的會計政策是否恰當，以及其作出的會計估計和相關資料披露是否合理；\n- 判定金融管理專員以持續經營作為會計基礎的做法是否恰當，並根據所得的審計憑證，判定是否存在與事件或情況有關，而且可能對集團持續經營的能力構成重大疑慮的重大不確定性。如果我認為存在重大不確定性，則有必要在審計師報告中請使用者留意財務報表中的相關資料披露。假若所披露的相關資料不足，我便須發出非無保留意見的審計師報告。我的結論是基於截至審計師報告日止所取得的審計憑證。然而，未來事件或情況可能導致集團不能繼續持續經營；\n- 評價財務報表的整體列報方式、結構和內容，包括披露資料，以及財務報表是否公允反映交易和事項；及\n- 就集團中實體或業務活動的財務資料獲取充足和適當的審計憑證，以對財務報表發表意見。我負責指導、監督和執行集團審計。我對我的審計意見承擔全部責任。\n\n我會與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通計劃的審計範圍和時間以及重大審計發現等事項，包括我在審計期間識別出內部控制的任何重大缺陷。\n","terms":{"10年Plus同心展關懷標誌":["10 years plus Caring

Independent Auditor’s Report to the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) set out on pages 149 to 237, which comprise the Group’s balance sheet as at 31 December 2016, and the income and expenditure account, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and cash flow statement for the year then ended, together with the notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements present a true and fair view of the financial position of the Exchange Fund and the Group as at 31 December 2016, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants. They have also been properly prepared in accordance with the directions given by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directions given by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the auditing standards of the Audit Commission. My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the “Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements” section of my report. I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities under those standards. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2016. These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit (continued)\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nHow I addressed these matters in my audit\n\n# Valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.5, 2.6 and 36.1 to the financial statements.\n\nAs at 31 December 2016, the Group’s financial assets measured at fair value totalled HK$31,989.75 billion, and its financial liabilities totalled HK$9,639.77 billion.\n\nThe fair values of 95% of these financial assets and all of these financial liabilities were based on quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets (level 1 inputs), or were estimated using valuation techniques where the inputs were based on observable market data (level 2 inputs).\n\nThe fair values of the remaining 5% of these financial assets were estimated using valuation techniques where the inputs were not based on observable market data (level 3 inputs). These financial assets totalled HK$1,758.86 billion and mainly comprised unlisted investment funds.\n\nThe valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value was a key audit matter given the significant amounts involved and the estimation required.\n\nMy audit procedures in relation to the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value included:\n- Understanding the valuation processes for different categories of financial assets and financial liabilities, including related monitoring controls;\n- Evaluating and testing monitoring controls, including relevant application controls in computer systems;\n- Obtaining external confirmations on the valuation, existence, rights and obligations, and completeness of financial assets and financial liabilities;\n- Verifying prices against independent sources when market quotations were used;\n- When valuation techniques used inputs based on observable market data, evaluating whether the valuation techniques were appropriate and the assumptions used were reasonable, and verifying the inputs against independent sources; and\n- When valuation techniques used inputs not based on observable market data, evaluating whether the valuation techniques were appropriate and the assumptions and inputs used were reasonable.\n\n# Future Fund deposits\n\nRefer to notes 2.6, 2.16.1, 4(b), 23 and 28 to the financial statements.\n\nIn previous years, most deposits in the fiscal reserves were repayable on demand and bore interest at a fixed rate determined annually by reference to the past investment returns of the investment portfolio.\n\nThe Government established the Future Fund within the fiscal reserves on 1 January 2016. The Future Fund deposits comprised an initial sum from the Land Fund balance (amounting to HK$2,197.30 billion) and regular injections transferred from the Government’s General Revenue Account (the amount of which was directed by the Financial Secretary). Interest on the Future Fund deposits was calculated at a composite rate, which was determined annually on a weighted average basis by reference to the fixed rate linked to the investment portfolio’s performance mentioned above and the annual rate of return linked to the performance of the long-term Growth Portfolio (which held private equity and real estate investments). Unless otherwise directed by the Financial Secretary, the Future Fund deposits together with interest earned were to be repaid on 31 December 2025.\n\nAs at 31 December 2016, the Future Fund deposits totalled HK$2,245.30 billion. The accumulated interest on these deposits was HK$100.71 billion. Given the significant amounts involved and the major changes in the terms of the deposits, extra attention was required regarding the measurement, presentation and disclosure of information relating to these deposits and the interest earned.\n\nMy audit procedures in relation to the Future Fund deposits included:\n- Evaluating whether the accounting policies used to measure the deposits and interest earned were appropriate;\n- Reviewing the calculation methodology of the annual rate of return linked to the performance of the long-term Growth Portfolio;\n- Verifying the calculation of the fixed rate determined by reference to the past performance of the investment portfolio, the annual rate of return linked to the performance of the long-term Growth Portfolio, and the composite rate determined by reference to these two rates;\n- Verifying the amount of interest accrued calculated at the composite rate; and\n- Reviewing the presentation and disclosure of information relating to these deposits and interest earned in the financial statements.\n\n# Valuation of investment properties measured at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.12, 17 and 18 to the financial statements.\n\nThe Group’s investment properties were measured at fair value and totalled HK$227.23 billion as at 31 December 2016. The Group also held interests in three associates and 14 joint ventures whose principal activities were holding overseas investment properties, with interests totalling HK$320.83 billion. Regardless of whether they were held directly by the Group or by associates or joint ventures, the fair values of these investment properties were primarily determined based on valuations by independent professional valuers. These valuations involved significant judgement and estimation, including the valuation techniques and assumptions used.\n\nMy audit procedures in relation to the valuation of investment properties measured at fair value included:\n- Obtaining and reviewing valuation reports for investment properties held directly by the Group or by associates or joint ventures, and verifying that the fair values were determined based on the valuations stated in those reports;\n- Assessing the independence and qualifications of the valuers; and\n- Evaluating whether the valuation techniques were appropriate and the assumptions and parameters used were reasonable.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises all information in the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s 2016 Annual Report, but does not include the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information, and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, I am responsible for reading the other information and considering whether it is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained during the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for preparing financial statements that present a true and fair view in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the directions given by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for implementing such internal control as it determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in conformity with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. I also:\n- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. However, this is not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.\n- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the Monetary Authority and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority.\n- Conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- Obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. I bear sole responsibility for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit."}

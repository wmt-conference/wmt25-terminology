{"en":"# Highlights of 2015\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nEconomic growth in Hong Kong moderates, reflecting weaker domestic demand and subdued export performance. Local stock market sees large swings amid heightened volatility in global financial markets. The residential property market starts to soften after the announcement of the seventh round of prudential measures in February.\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector remains resilient. Locally incorporated authorized institutions (AIs) are well capitalised, and the liquidity positions of AIs continue to be sound. The asset quality of retail banks deteriorates slightly, but stays at healthy levels.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchang rate remains broadly stable against the US dollar, with the strong-side Convertibility Undertaking triggered repeatedly in April, September and October. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate market continues to operate in an orderly manner despite turbulent global financial market conditions, reflecting resilience of the Linked Exchange Rate System to external shocks.\n\nThe money market continues to function normally with ample interbank liquidity. Following the decision of the US Federal Reserve to raise the target range for the Federal Funds Rate, the Base Rate in Hong Kong is adjusted upwards by 25 basis points to 0.75% in December.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nSupervisory efforts on AIs’ risk governance, including credit and liquidity risk management systems, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing controls, and selling practices for investment and insurance products, have been stepped up.\n\nThe HKMA announces a countercyclical capital buffer for Hong Kong and designates five authorized institutions as domestic systemically important banks. Legislative proposals to establish a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong and enhance the Deposit Protection Scheme by achieving faster payouts are respectively introduced into the Legislative Council.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\nThe HKMA continues to actively participate in international and regional forums while sparing no effort in raising Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre. Legislative proposal to improve the tax environment for promoting Hong Kong as a hub for corporate treasury centres is introduced into the Legislative Council in December.\n\nHong Kong remains the global offshore renminbi business hub with a market of considerable depth and breadth. The Mainland-Hong Kong Mutual Recognition of Funds initiative is implemented in July, further expanding Hong Kong’s renminbi product offering.\n\nHong Kong’s financial infrastructure is further enhanced by the successful launch of the e-Cheque service in December, allowing customers to issue and deposit cheques online. A new regulatory regime which provides for licensing of multipurpose stored value facilities and designation of important retail payment systems commences operation in November.\n\n# Reserves Management\nAmid the challenging and difficult investment environment, the Exchange Fund records an overall investment return of -0.6%. Total assets of the Fund reach HK$3,422.9 billion at the end of 2015.\n\nthe HKMA quickens the pace of investment diversification, especially through investments under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). At the end of 2015, the market value of investments under the LTGP totals HK$142.1 billion, made up of HK$91.3 billion in private equity and HK$50.8 billion in real estate, with outstanding investment commitments amounting to HK$122.4 billion.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communications with the community and the market through the media, public education programmes, and various other channels to facilitate understanding of its policies and operations. Corporate governance is further improved by supporting professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline, enhancing it security, and realigning duties among senior management to help cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives and the increasing complexity of work.","terms":{"reach":["達"],"promoting":["以助發展"],"introduced":["提交"],"work":["工作"],"weaker":["轉弱"],"stays":["處於"],"HK":["本港"],"’":["的"],"capitalised":["資本充裕"],"swings":["大幅上落"],"enhance":["優化"],"raise":["上調"],"142.1":["1,421"],"supporting":["推動"],"instituting":["嚴格控制"],"stepped":["加強"],"improved":["優化"],"various":["各種"],"announcement":["公布"],"realigning":["重整"],"amounting":["為"],"3,422.9":["34,229"],"october":["10

{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nThe Hong Kong economy experienced slower growth in 2015 reflecting weaker domestic demand and poor export performance. Economic growth for 2016 is expected to remain soft amid stiff external headwinds and fragile financial market conditions.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Overview\n\nEconomic growth in Hong Kong moderated during the year, with real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth slowing to 2.4% from 2.6% in 2014 (Table 1). This reflected milder expansion in domestic demand, although net exports reverted to a positive contributor to GDP growth as total imports declined faster than total exports (Chart 1). Despite the modest economic performance, the labour market held broadly stable, with the unemployment rate staying low at about 3.3%. Inflation eased further due to subsiding pressures on domestic costs and import prices. Local stock prices saw large swings amid heightened volatility in global financial markets. The residential property market started to soften after the announcement of the seventh round of prudential measures in February, with housing prices showing further signs of consolidation towards the end of the year.\n\nChart 1 Real GDP growth by contribution\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\nTable 1 Real GDP growth by expenditure component (period-over-period)\n\nNote: The seasonally-adjusted quarter-on-quarter rates of change in the gross domestic fixed capital formation are not available.\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nOn the monetary front, exchange-rate stability was maintained in 2015, with the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate hovering near 7.75 against the US dollar. The strong-side Convertibility Undertaking was triggered in April due to equity-related inflows, and again in September and October reflecting conversions of the offshore renminbi into Hong Kong dollars and some commercial demand for Hong Kong dollars. With the enlarged Aggregate Balance, local interest rates continued to stay low, while the HKMA Base Rate was adjusted upwards from 0.5% to 0.75% following the US interest rate lift-off in mid-December. Because of softer credit demand, total loan growth in the banking sector slowed further to 3.5% in 2015 from 12.7% in 2014. The banking industry's overall loan quality weakened slightly, but the classified loan ratios remained at low levels.\n\n# Domestic demand\n\nDomestic demand grew at a slower pace in 2015. While broadly stable job and income conditions continued to provide support, weak consumer confidence and corrections in asset prices weighed on private consumption growth in the second half of the year. However, due to the relatively strong growth momentum in the first half, the full-year growth in private consumption increased to 4.8% from 3.3% in 2014. Government consumption increased slightly faster by 3.4%. In fact, the slower growth in domestic demand was mainly due to the 2.2% decline in gross domestic fixed capital formation (Chart 2). Private-sector machinery and equipment acquisition contracted for the second consecutive year amid deteriorating business sentiment, and building and construction activities also showed weaker growth momentum alongside slower progress in public projects.\n\n# External demand\n\nHong Kong’s export performance deteriorated in 2015 (Chart 3). Exports of goods recorded a broad-based 1.7% decline, the first time since 2009. Exports to Japan and the European Union declined, while those to the US recorded little growth. The feeble final demand from these advanced markets also weighed on regional industrial activities and intra-regional trade. As a result, Hong Kong’s exports to Mainland China, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan also decreased amid weak intermediate and final demand from these economies. Hong Kong’s exports of services continued to moderate from a high growth path in earlier years, which culminated in a 0.6% decline in 2015, mainly due to the slowdown in inbound tourism. Imports of goods also fell back alongside weaker domestic and export-induced demand. In contrast, growth in imports of services accelerated due to strong travel interest among local residents. On a net basis, the overall trade surplus improved slightly in 2015, leading to a modest positive contribution to GDP growth.\n\nChart 2 Domestic demand\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Inflation\n\nUnderlying inflation eased further in 2015 amid moderated domestic cost pressures and reduced import price inflation. After netting out the effects of the Government's one-off relief measures, the underlying inflation rate dropped to 2.5% from 3.5% in 2014 (Chart 4). With subdued economic activity, labour cost pressures remained steady, while commercial and industrial rental cost pressures eased, particularly in the second half. Thanks to softened global commodity prices and the strong Hong Kong dollar, import price pressures abated, while food inflation also stayed low. As the feed-through of fresh-letting housing rentals in earlier quarters had been moderate, the rental component of inflation remained contained.\n\nChart 3 Exports of goods and services\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\nChart 4 Underlying consumer price inflation\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\n# Labour market\n\nLabour market conditions remained stable in 2015. Labour demand held up, with the decline in employment in trade and tourism-related sectors being largely offset by the steady pace of hiring in other business sectors, resulting in an increase in total employment of 1.3% from a year earlier. With labour supply also picking up by 1.3%, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate stayed at around 3.3% throughout the year (Chart 5). Given the still-tight labour market, labour earnings in nominal terms rose by 4.7% in the first three quarters of the year, compared with 4.3% in 2014. With inflationary pressures easing, real labour earnings increased by 1.3% in the first three quarters, compared with a decline of 0.1% in 2014.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe Hong Kong stock market experienced a volatile year due to drastic changes in the external environment. After a flat first quarter, the local stock market was buoyant in the second quarter amid the bullish sentiment in the Mainland A-share market and capital inflows. The Hang Seng Index surged to a seven-year high in April, with the Southbound Daily Quota under the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect being exhausted for the first time since its inception in November 2014 (Chart 6). However, the local market reversed course starting from late June, with the Hang Seng Index plunging 28% to a year-low in September amid the sell-offs in the Mainland A-share market and global stock markets, the heightened volatility in the global foreign exchange market, and weaknesses in international commodity prices. The Hong Kong stock market recovered some ground in the last quarter as global and Mainland financial markets stabilised. For 2015 as a whole, the Hang Seng index recorded a decline of 7.2%, the worst performance since 2011, while the average daily turnover rose to HK$105.6 billion from HK$69.5 billion in 2014. Although fund-raising activities moderated in the second half, the overall equity funds raised from the local stock market increased to HK$1,115.6 billion from HK$942.7 billion a year earlier.\n\n# Property market\n\nSigns of consolidation emerged in the residential property market. After experiencing a buoyant period in early 2015, the residential property market softened following the announcement of the seventh round of prudential measures in February. With housing prices picking up at a slower pace before declining in the last quarter, the cumulative increase in housing prices in 2015 was 2.5%, smaller than the 13.5% increase in 2014 (Chart 6). Meanwhile, the transaction volume decreased by 12.3% from a year ago to 55,982 units as trading activities in the secondary market fell noticeably in the second half. Speculative transactions, including confirmor transactions and short-term flipping trades, continued to stay low. Despite this, household affordability remained stretched, with the price-to-income ratio reaching 15.7 and the income-gearing ratio remaining far above its long-term average. The commercial and industrial property markets were buoyant in the first half, but trading activities then softened, with both prices and rents registering declines in the last quarter. Rental yields remained broadly the same from a year earlier and stayed near their historical lows.\n\nChart 6 Asset prices\nSources: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nHong Kong’s economic growth for 2016 is expected to remain soft. Private-sector analysts project the economy to expand at a slower average rate of 1.7% while the Government forecasts growth in the range of 1–2%. More specifically, the lacklustre global growth prospects, sustained weakness in inbound tourism, and the negative spillovers from turbulent global financial market conditions will continue to restrain the performance of Hong Kong’s exports. Domestically, private consumption is anticipated to grow moderately, as labour market conditions will likely face some pressures amid weaker economic momentum, and local asset price adjustments may dent consumer confidence and induce negative wealth effects. Building and construction activities may hold up, but weak business sentiment and interest rate rises will weigh on private capital investment.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nInflationary pressures are expected to remain contained in 2016. Import price pressures will likely stay soft, while domestic cost pressures are expected to be modest amid moderate economic growth momentum. The rental component of inflation may also ease due to diminishing pressures in fresh-letting housing rentals towards the end of 2015. Market consensus predicts the headline inflation rate at 2.5% in 2016, while the Government projects the underlying inflation rate at 2.0%. The labour market may also soften somewhat due to the slowdown in inbound tourism and continued sluggishness in the export sector. Private-sector analysts now expect the unemployment rate to increase to 3.5% in 2016.\n\n# Uncertainties and risks\n\nThe economic outlook for 2016 is subject to a number of uncertainties and risks. In particular, the pace of further US interest rate rises, the global growth prospects and commodity price movements will continue to be the major sources of uncertainty. Any significant adverse developments could heighten volatilities in global financial markets and international capital flows, thereby tightening domestic monetary and financial conditions and casting a shadow over Hong Kong's growth prospects. The resulting impact of these external factors on the domestic economy will depend crucially on their impact on the property market through the wealth and balance-sheet effects. While the property market is facing increasing downside risks stemming from weakening sentiment in the global and domestic financial markets, the normalisation of US interest rates, and a narrowing housing demand-supply gap, more time is needed to establish whether the property market has entered a down-cycle. Although an abrupt adjustment in the property market could pose significant headwinds to the broader economy, the introduction of counter-cyclical macroprudential measures and other supervisory measures over the past few years has significantly enhanced the resilience of Hong Kong's banking system.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector remained resilient during the year, notwithstanding a further divergence in the monetary policies of advanced economies and the build-up of vulnerabilities in emerging market economies. The liquidity positions of authorized institutions (AIs) continued to be sound, and locally incorporated AIs were well capitalised. The asset quality of retail banks deteriorated slightly, but stayed at a healthy level.\n\n# Interest rate trends\n\nIn line with the US dollar interest rates, Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates were low throughout the year. The Hong Kong dollar funding cost of retail banks declined in the first half of the year as indicated by a downward trend in the composite interest rate, and remained stable in the second half (Chart 7).\n\nChart 7 HIBOR fixings, composite rate and best lending rate (BLR)\nNotes:\n1. HiBoR fixings refer to the Hong Kong Dollar interest Settlement Rates released by the Hong Kong Association of Banks and are monthly averages.\n\n2. BlR refers to the best lending rate quoted by the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (monthly averages).\n\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe profitability of the banking sector moderated in 2015. The aggregate pre-tax operating profits of retail banks' Hong Kong offices declined by 2.8%, as growth in fee and commission income (up 9.7%), foreign exchange and derivatives operation income (up 22.4%), and net interest income (up 1.3%) was offset by an 8.8% increase in operating expenses and a 76% increase in loan impairment charges. However, the post-tax profit of retail banks increased by 14.7%, mainly due to gains from disposals of strategic investments. The post-tax return on average assets of retail banks improved to 1.05% from 0.99% in 2014 (Chart 8).\n","terms":{"reach":["達"],"promoting":["以助發展"],"introduced":["提交"],"work":["工作"],"weaker":["轉弱"],"stays":["處於"],"HK":["本港"],"’":["的"],"capitalised":["資本充裕"],"swings":["大幅上落"],"enhance":["優化"],"raise":["上調"],"142.1":["1,421"],"supporting":["推動"],"instituting":["嚴格控制"],"stepped":["加強"],"improved":["優化"],"various":["各種"],"announcement":["公布"],"realigning":["重整"],"amounting":["為"],"3,422.9":["34,229"],"october":["10

經濟及金融環境\n\n香港經濟在2015年出現增長放緩，主因是本地需求轉弱及出口表現欠佳。預期2016年的經濟增長將持續緩和，因為外部環境嚴峻，加上金融市場情況脆弱。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 概述\n\n香港本年的經濟增長有所放緩，本地生產總值（GDP）的實際增幅由2014年的2.6%下降至2.4%（表1）。這反映了內需擴張的幅度較為溫和，儘管淨出口因進口總額下降速度快於出口總額而重新成為GDP增長的正向貢獻因素（圖1）。儘管經濟表現溫和，但勞動市場大致保持穩定，失業率維持在約3.3%的低水平。由於國內成本和進口價格壓力減退，通脹進一步緩和。在全球金融市場波動加劇的背景下，本地股價出現大幅波動。在2月公布第七輪審慎監管措施後，住宅物業市場開始轉弱，房價於年底進一步呈現整固跡象。\n\n圖表 1 按貢獻劃分的實質 GDP 成長率\n資料來源：人口普查及統計署\n\n表 1 按支出項目劃分的實質 GDP 成長（同期比較）\n\n註：經季節調整後的國內固定資本形成總額季度環比變動率無法取得。\n資料來源：人口普查及統計署。\n\n# 經濟及金融環境\n\n在貨幣方面，2015年匯率保持穩定，港元匯率在對美元7.75左右的水平徘徊。由於與股票相關的資金流入，強方兌換保證在4月被觸發，而在9月和10月再次被觸發，這反映了離岸人民幣兌換成港元，以及對港元的某些商業需求。隨著總結餘的擴大，本地利率繼續保持低水平，而美國在12月中加息後，香港金管局的基本利率亦從0.5%上調至0.75%。由於信貸需求轉弱，銀行業的總貸款增長在2015年進一步放緩至3.5%，而2014年則為12.7%。銀行業的整體貸款質素略為轉弱，但分類貸款比率仍保持在低水平。\n\n# 內需\n\n2015年，國內需求的增長步伐放緩。儘管就業和收入情況大致穩定，持續提供支撐，但消費者信心疲弱及資產價格調整，拖累了下半年的私人消費增長。然而，由於上半年增長動能相對強勁，全年私人消費增長由2014年的3.3%上升至4.8%。政府消費則略有加快，增長3.4%。事實上，國內需求增長放緩的主要原因是國內固定資本形成總額下跌了2.2%（圖2）。在商業情緒轉差的情況下，私人企業的機械及設備投資已連續第二年收縮，而建築活動的增長動能亦轉弱，公共工程進度亦放緩。\n\n# 外部需求\n\n香港的出口表現於2015年轉差（圖3）。商品出口錄得1.7%的廣泛性下跌，是自2009年以來首次出現此情況。對日本及歐盟的出口下跌，而對美國的出口則僅錄得少量增長。這些先進市場的最終需求呆滯，亦拖累了區域工業活動及區內貿易。因此，在這些經濟體的中間及最終需求疲弱下，香港對內地、新加坡、南韓及台灣的出口亦告下跌。香港服務輸出早年的高增長勢頭繼續放緩，最終在2015年錄得0.6%的下跌，主要是由於入境旅遊業放緩。隨著本地需求及出口帶動的需求轉弱，商品入口亦告回落。相反，由於本地居民的旅遊意欲強勁，服務入口的增長加快。在淨額基礎上，整體貿易順差在2015年略有改善，對本地生產總值增長有輕微的正面貢獻。\n\n**圖表 2 國內需求**\n資料來源：人口普查及統計署。\n\n# 通貨膨脹\n\n2015年，由於國內成本壓力放緩及進口商品價格通脹減弱，基本通脹進一步回落。在扣除政府一次性紓困措施的影響後，基本通脹率由2014年的3.5%下降至2.5%（圖4）。由於經濟活動欠佳，勞工成本壓力維持平穩，而工商舖租金成本壓力則有所緩和，尤其是在下半年。全球商品價格回軟，加上港元匯率強勁，進口商品價格壓力減退，食品通脹亦維持低水平。由於早前季度新訂住宅租金的影響力度適度，通脹中的租金成份仍然受到遏抑。\n\n圖表

勞動市場\n\n2015年，勞動市場狀況維持穩定。勞動需求保持強勁，貿易及旅遊相關行業的就業下跌情況，在很大程度上被其他行業穩定的招聘步伐所抵銷，令總就業人數較前一年上升1.3%。由於勞動供應亦上升了1.3%，經季節性調整的失業率在全年維持於約3.3%的水平（圖表5）。鑑於勞動市場仍然偏緊，首三季以名義值計算的勞動收益上升了4.7%，而2014年則為4.3%。隨著通脹壓力減弱，首三季的實際勞動收益上升了1.3%，而2014年則為下跌0.1%。\n\n# 股票市場\n\n由於外部環境劇烈變化，香港股市在過去一年出現大幅波動。首季表現平淡，但受惠於內地A股市場的樂觀情緒及資金流入，本地股市在第二季表現活躍。恒生指數在4月升至七年高位，而滬港通下的南向每日額度自2014年11月推出以來首次被用盡（圖6）。然而，本地市場自6月下旬起轉趨下跌，恒生指數在9月跌至全年低位，跌幅達28%，主因是內地A股市場及全球股市出現拋售潮、全球外匯市場波動加劇，以及國際商品價格疲弱。隨著全球及內地金融市場回穩，香港股市在最後一季有所反彈。整體而言，2015年恒生指數下跌7.2%，是自2011年以來的最差表現，但日均成交額則由2014年的695億港元上升至1,056億港元。儘管下半年集資活動放緩，但本地股市籌集的股本資金總額由去年的9,427億港元增至11,156億港元。\n\n# 房地產市場\n\n住宅房地產市場出現整合跡象。2015年初，住宅房地產市場曾一度繁榮，但在2月公布第七輪審慎措施後，市場轉趨疲軟。房價在最後一個季度前升勢放緩，隨後下跌，導致2015年房價累計上升2.5%，低於2014年的13.5%增幅（圖6）。同時，由於二手市場交易活動在下半年顯著下降，交易量比去年同期減少12.3%，至55,982宗。投機性交易（包括確認交易和短期炒作交易）仍維持低水平。儘管如此，家庭負擔能力仍面臨壓力，房價與收入比率升至15.7，而收入負債比率亦遠高於長期平均水平。商業及工業物業市場在上半年表現活躍，但隨後交易活動回軟，價格及租金在最後一個季度均錄得下跌。租金收益與去年大致持平，並維持在歷史低位附近。\n\n圖

經濟環境\n\n預期香港2016年的經濟增長將維持緩和態勢。民間分析師預估，經濟增長速度將放緩至平均1.7%，而政府則預測增長率介於1%至2%之間。具體而言，全球經濟增長前景欠佳、入境旅遊持續疲弱，以及動盪的全球金融市場所帶來的負面影響，將繼續抑制香港出口表現。在本地方面，預期私人消費將溫和增長，因為在經濟動力減弱的情況下，勞動市場可能面臨壓力，而本地資產價格調整也可能削弱消費者信心，並引發負面的財富效應。建築活動可能保持穩定，但疲弱的商業情緒和利率上升將對私人資本投資造成壓力。\n\n# 通貨膨脹與就業市場\n\n預期2016年的通脹壓力將保持受控。進口價格壓力可能維持緩和，而本地成本壓力在溫和的經濟增長勢頭下預期亦會保持輕微。由於新訂房屋租賃的壓力在2015年底有所減弱，通脹中的租金部分亦可能有所緩和。市場共識預期2016年的整體通脹率為2.5%，而政府則預期基本通脹率為2.0%。由於入境旅遊放緩及出口部門持續疲弱，勞工市場亦可能稍為轉弱。私人機構分析師現時預期2016年的失業率將上升至3.5%。\n\n# 不確定性與風險\n\n2016 年的經濟展望面臨多項不明朗因素及風險，尤其是美國進一步升息的步伐、全球經濟增長前景，以及商品價格波動，將繼續成為主要的不確定性來源。任何重大的不利發展都可能加劇全球金融市場及國際資本流動的波動，進而收緊本地的貨幣及金融環境，並為香港的經濟增長前景蒙上陰影。這些外部因素對本地經濟的影響，很大程度取決於它們透過財富及資產負債表效應對房地產市場所造成之衝擊。儘管房地產市場面臨日益增加的下行風險，包括全球及本地金融市場情緒轉弱、美國利率正常化，以及房屋供需差距縮小等因素，但需要更多時間才能確定房地產市場是否已進入下行周期。雖然房地產市場若出現突然調整，可能會對整體經濟造成重大衝擊，但過去幾年所採取的逆周期宏觀審慎措施及其他監管措施，已顯著提升了香港銀行體系的韌性。\n\n# 銀行業表現\n\n香港銀行業在過去一年中保持穩健，儘管先進經濟體的貨幣政策進一步分歧，且新興市場經濟體的風險與不穩定因素累積。認可機構的流動性狀況持續良好，本地註冊的認可機構資本亦充裕。零售銀行的資產品質輕微轉差，但仍維持在健康水平。\n\n# 利率走勢\n\n與美元利率接軌，港元銀行同業拆息在全年均處於低水平。綜合利率的下降趨勢顯示，零售銀行的港元融資成本在上半年有所下降，並在下半年保持穩定（圖 7）。\n\n圖表 7 香港銀行同業拆息定盤價、綜合利率及最優惠貸款利率（BLR）\n註解：\n1. 香港銀行同業拆息定盤價是指香港銀行公會每月公布的香港元利率結算價之平均值。\n\n2. 最優惠貸款利率（BlR）指香港上海滙豐銀行有限公司所報的最優惠貸款利率之每月平均值。\n\n# 獲利能力趨勢\n\n銀行業的盈利能力在2015年有所放緩。零售銀行香港辦事處的稅前營業利潤總額下跌了2.8%，儘管手續費及佣金收入（上升9.7%）、外匯及衍生工具業務收入（上升22.4%）及淨利息收入（上升1.3%）均有所增長，但營運開支上升8.8%及貸款減值損失增加76%抵銷了上述增長。然而，零售銀行的稅後利潤上升了14.7%，主要由於出售策略性投資錄得收益。零售銀行的稅後平均資產回報率由2014年的0.99%改善至1.05%（圖8）。"}
{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained broadly stable throughout 2015 despite turbulent financial market conditions and the US interest rate lift-off in December. The money market also continued to function normally with ample interbank liquidity. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability over the past few decades, the Linked Exchange Rate System continued to be hiqhly resilient to external shocks.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong's monetary policy is currency stability. This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong's currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75 - 7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises\n\n* Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks\n* Government-issued notes and coins in circulation \n* the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of clearing account balances of banks kept with the HKMA \n* Exchange Fund Bills and Notes issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs). When the demand for Hong Kong dollars is greater than the supply and the market exchange rate strengthens to the strong-side CU of HK$7.75 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to sell Hong Kong dollars to banks for US dollars. The Aggregate Balance will then expand to push down Hong Kong dollar interest rates, creating monetary conditions that move the Hong Kong dollar away from the strong-side limit to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if the supply of Hong Kong dollars is greater than demand and the market exchange rate weakens to the weak-side CU of HK$7.85 to one US dollar, the HKMA will buy Hong Kong dollars from banks. The Aggregate Balance will then contract to drive Hong Kong dollar interest rates up, pushing the Hong Kong dollar away from the weak-side limit to stay within the Convertibility Zone.\n\nThe Certificates of Indebtedness and the government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation shown here are stated at Hong Kong dollar face values. The corresponding items shown in the balance sheet of the Exchange Fund in this Annual Report are in Hong Kong dollars equivalent to the US dollar amounts required for their redemption at the prevailing exchange rates on the balance sheet date. This arrangement is in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong.\n\nThe amount of EFBN shown here is different from that in the balance sheet of the Exchange Fund in this Annual Report. In accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong, the EFBN held by the HKMA on behalf of the Exchange Fund in relation to its trading of the EFBN in the secondary market are offset against the EFBN issued, and the net amount is recorded in the balance sheet.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\n# REVIEW OF 2015\n\n# Exchange-rate stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained broadly stable in 2015, trading within a narrow range of 7.7500 to 7.7657 against the US dollar (Chart 1). In the early part of 2015, the Hong Kong dollar was under slight weakening pressures amid market concerns about the US interest rate lift-off. However, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate strengthened close to 7.75 during the second quarter, with the strong-side CU being triggered repeatedly in April mainly due to a surge in equity-related demand for the Hong Kong dollar amid buoyant stock market activities. Moving into the second half of the year, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate continued to hover close to 7.75 against the US dollar in August, despite the notable sell-off in Hong Kong and Mainland’s equity markets, and increased volatilities in the global currency markets (including the renminbi). Driven by conversions of the offshore renminbi into the Hong Kong dollar, the strong-side CU was triggered again in September and October. While the US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) raised the target range for the Federal Funds Rate by 25 basis points in mid-December, the Hong Kong dollar continued to move within a tight range against the US dollar without notable outflow pressures. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market operated in an orderly manner throughout 2015, despite the turbulent global financial market conditions.\n\nChart 1 Market exchange rate in 2015\n\nAs the strong-side CU was repeatedly triggered in April, September and October, the HKMA passively purchased a total of US$29.3 billion from banks in exchange for HK$227.2 billion, in accordance with the Currency Board principles. This led to a corresponding expansion in the Aggregate Balance, with part of the expansion being offset by additional issuance of Exchange Fund Bills in response to banks’ strong demand for liquidity management (Chart 2). The additional issuance of Exchange Fund paper is consistent with Currency Board principles, as it represents a change in the composition of the Monetary Base with the Monetary Base fully backed by foreign exchange reserves. The total of Aggregate Balance and outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and notes increased to HK$1,221.0 billion at the end of 2015 from HK$992.5 billion a year earlier.\n\nChart 2 Aggregate Balance and outstanding Exchange Fund paper in 2015\n\n# Money market\n\nWith ample liquidity in the banking system, Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained low throughout 2015. As the target range for the US Federal Funds Rate was adjusted upwards from 0–0.25% to 0.25–0.5% on 16 December (US time), the Base Rate was also adjusted upwards from 0.5% to 0.75% on 17 December according to the pre-set formula. For 2015 as a whole, interbank interest rates for tenors from overnight to three months stayed below the Base Rate (Chart 3), with moderate fluctuations driven by banks’ seasonal liquidity needs and tightened liquidity amid volatile financial market conditions in August. Broadly tracking the spreads between the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) and the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), the Hong Kong dollar forward points turned to notable premiums in August amid tightened market liquidity, and then subsequently dipped into discounts towards the end of the year due to the broad-based increases in the US dollar interest rates (Chart 4). Overall, the money market continued to function normally. Discount Window borrowing was not active, amounting to only HK$2.8 billion in 2015.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nChart 3 Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates in 2015\n\nChart 4 Hong Kong dollar forward points in 2015\n\n# Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nSince its establishment in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has continued to function smoothly and contributed significantly to Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability over the past few decades. Given Hong Kong's small and open economy and its role as an international financial hub, the LERS remains the most suitable exchange rate regime for Hong Kong. The Hong Kong SAR Government is firmly committed to maintaining the LERS. Indeed, stability in the foreign exchange and money markets further reinforces the credibility of the Government's commitment, and the public continues to have strong confidence in the Hong Kong dollar as a means of payment and storage of value. In its 2015 Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) continued to endorse the LERS as the best monetary arrangement for Hong Kong, citing Hong Kong's robust institutional, legal and policy framework, ample fiscal reserves, flexible markets, and sound financial system as key factors supporting the smooth functioning of the LERS.\n\nGiven that a robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS, the HKMA continued to closely monitor banks' management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and stepped up its supervisory efforts on banks' corporate and property-related lending to enhance the resilience of the banking sector. In view of the rise in US interest rates, the HKMA reminded the public to make necessary preparations in managing risks, noting that any triggering of the weak-side CU and outflow of Hong Kong dollars are a natural and necessary step in the process of the normalisation of the Hong Kong dollar interest rates.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) moved within a narrow range of 106.3-107.5% during 2015, without touching the Upper or Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 106.3% on 31 December (Chart 5). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. The large amount of financial resources of the Fund provides a powerful backstop to protect Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability in the event of abrupt shocks.\n\nChart 5 Daily movement of the Backing Ratio in 2015\n\n# Other activities\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) Currency Board Sub-Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong. In 2015, the Sub-Committee considered issues including the supply of international US dollar loans by global banks, the international use of macro-prudential measures, the implications of US interest rate hikes for Hong Kong's property market, the formula for the determination of the Base Rate, macroeconomic implications of the Hong Kong dollar real effective exchange rate rise, and the sovereign risk of emerging market economies. Records of the Sub-Committee’s discussions and the reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the Sub-Committee are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research (HKIMR) continued to sponsor research in the fields of monetary policy, banking and finance. In 2015, the Institute hosted 16 research fellows and published 27 working papers.\n\nThe Institute organised five international conferences and workshops. The main ones included:\n\n* The Sixth Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy in January, under the title \"Leverage and Financial System Efficiency and Stability: Chinese and International Experiences\". 11 high quality research papers were presented at the conference, covering an extensive range of issues such as corporate leverage in China, China's credit boom and business cycle, banking competition and financial stability, as well as banking regulation and credit supply.\n* The HKIMR and the University of Hong Kong joint conference entitled \"HKIMR-HKU International Conference on Finance, Institutions and Economic Growth\" in May. The conference covered many different economic issues, including banking and monetary policy, international financing and cross border mergers and acquisitions, design of financial regulation, as well as macroeconomic environment and capital markets.\n* The HKIMR, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas joint conference in October on \"Diverging Monetary Policies, Global Capital Flows and Financial Stability\". The conference examined a wide range of issues including the relationship between monetary policies, international capital flows and exchange rates, divergent monetary policies and their implications for global financial stability, spillover of major central bank policies to other parts of the world, and the costs and benefits of global policy co-ordination.\n\nThe Institute also hosted its 13th HKIMR Summer Workshop in August, and the 13th HKIMR Conference on the Mainland Economy in September, addressing issues on fiscal reform and local government financing in Mainland China. The conferences and workshops were attended by participants from academia, the financial services industry and global central banks. In addition, the Institute held 24 public seminars during the year covering a broad range of economic, monetary and financial issues.\n\n# Notes and coins\n\nAt the end of 2015, the total value of banknotes in circulation was HK$360.2 billion, an increase of 5.3% from a year earlier (Charts 6, 7 and 8). The total value of government-issued notes and coins in circulation amounted to HK$11.2 billion, up 2.9% (Charts 9 and 10). The value of government-issued HK$10 notes in circulation was HK$4.0 billion, of which 85% were polymer notes.\n","terms":{"reach":["達"],"promoting":["以助發展"],"introduced":["提交"],"work":["工作"],"weaker":["轉弱"],"stays":["處於"],"HK":["本港"],"’":["的"],"capitalised":["資本充裕"],"swings":["大幅上落"],"enhance":["優化"],"raise":["上調"],"142.1":["1,421"],"supporting":["推動"],"instituting":["嚴格控制"],"stepped":["加強"],"improved":["優化"],"various":["各種"],"announcement":["公布"],"realigning":["重整"],"amounting":["為"],"3,422.9":["34,229"],"october":["10

貨幣穩定性\n\n2015 年全年，儘管金融市場動盪，且美國於 12 月升息，但港元匯率仍大致保持穩定。貨幣市場亦繼續正常運作，銀行同業流動性充裕。聯繫匯率制度是香港過去數十年貨幣及金融穩定的基石，繼續展現出極強的抵禦外部衝擊能力。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的首要目標是維持貨幣穩定。這是指香港貨幣在對外匯市場上的匯率以港元 7.75 至 7.85 的區間兌 1 美元的水平保持穩定。貨幣制度的架構以貨幣管理局制度為特色，規定貨幣基礎至少要有 100% 由外匯基金持有的美元儲備支持，而貨幣基礎的變動亦須由相應的美元儲備變動全面配合。\n\n貨幣基礎（表 1）包括以下項目：\n\n* 負債證明書，為三家發鈔銀行發行的鈔票提供十足支持。\n* 政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣。\n* 總結餘，即銀行在金管局所持有的清算賬戶結餘總和。\n* 金管局代表政府發行的外匯基金票據及債券。\n\n港元匯率的穩定，是透過自動利率調整機制，以及金管局堅定承諾履行兌換保證來維持。當港元需求高於供應，市場匯率升至兌換保證的強方水平（即港元 7.75 兌 1 美元）時，金管局會準備向銀行買入美元、沽出港元。屆時，總結餘將會增加，促使港元利率下降，創造貨幣環境，使港元匯率由強方匯率上限回落至兌換區間（7.75 至 7.85）之內。相反，當港元供應高於需求，市場匯率跌至兌換保證的弱方水平（即港元 7.85 兌 1 美元）時，金管局會向銀行買入港元、沽出美元。屆時，總結餘將會減少，促使港元利率上升，使港元匯率由弱方匯率上限回升至兌換區間之內。\n\n此處所列的負債證明書及政府發行的流通貨幣紙幣和硬幣，均以港元面值列示。本年報外匯基金資產負債表內所列的相應項目，則為按資產負債表日期的現行匯率換算為港元的兌換所需美元金額。此安排符合香港一般公認的會計原則。\n\n此處所列的 EFBN 金額與本年報外匯基金資產負債表內所列的金額不同。根據香港一般公認的會計原則，金管局代表外匯基金持有與 EFBN 在二手市場交易相關的 EFBN，須與已發行的 EFBN 抵銷，而淨額則記錄在資產負債表內。\n\n# 貨幣穩定性\n\n# 2015 年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定性\n\n2015 年，港元匯率大致保持穩定，兌美元匯率在 7.7500 至 7.7657 的狹窄區間內波動（圖 1）。2015 年初，市場憂慮美國升息，港元匯率承受輕微下跌壓力。然而，在第二季，港元匯率回升至接近 7.75 的水平，強方兌換保證在 4 月被多次觸發，主要原因是股市活躍，與股票相關的港元需求急增。踏入下半年，儘管香港和內地股市出現顯著拋售，全球貨幣市場（包括人民幣）波動性增加，但港元匯率在 8 月仍繼續維持在接近 7.75 的水平兌美元。受離岸人民幣兌換為港元的推動，強方兌換保證在 9 月和 10 月再次被觸發。雖然美國聯邦公開市場委員會（FOMC）在 12 月中把聯邦基金利率目標區間上調 25 個基點，但港元兌美元匯率繼續在狹窄範圍內波動，並無顯著流出壓力。整體而言，儘管全球金融市場動盪，2015 年全年港元匯率市場運作有序。\n\n圖 1：2015 年市場匯率\n\n由於強方兌換保證在 4 月、9 月及 10 月被多次觸發，金管局根據貨幣發行局原則，被動地向銀行購入總值 293 億美元的美元，沽出 2,272 億港元。這導致總結餘相應增加，而部分增加額則被因應銀行對流動性管理的強勁需求而增發的外匯基金票據所抵銷（圖 2）。增發外匯基金票據符合貨幣發行局原則，因為這代表貨幣基礎的組成出現變動，而貨幣基礎則由外匯儲備全面支持。總結餘及未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額由 2014 年底的 9,925 億港元增至 2015 年底的 12,210 億港元。\n\n圖 2：2015 年總結餘及未償還外匯基金票據情況\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n由於銀行體系流動性充裕，2015 年全年港元銀行同業利率維持在低水平。由於美國聯邦基金利率目標區間在 12 月 16 日（美國時間）由 0 至 0.25% 上調至 0.25 至 0.5%，基準利率亦根據預設公式在 12 月 17 日由 0.5% 上調至 0.75%。2015 年全年，隔夜至三個月港元銀行同業利率維持在基準利率之下（圖 3），波動輕微，主要受銀行季節性流動性需求及 8 月金融市場動盪導致流動性收緊所影響。港元遠期點子大致跟隨香港銀行同業拆息（HIBOR）與倫敦銀行同業拆息（LIBOR）之間的息差變動，在 8 月市場流動性收緊時轉為顯著溢價，其後因美元利率普遍上升而在年底前回落至貼水水平（圖 4）。整體而言，貨幣市場繼續正常運作。貼現窗借貸並不活躍，2015 年金額僅為 28 億港元。\n\n# 貨幣穩定性\n\n圖 3：2015 年港元銀行同業利率\n\n圖 4：2015 年港元遠期點子\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n聯繫匯率制度自 1983 年成立以來，一直運作暢順，對香港過去數十年的貨幣及金融穩定作出重大貢獻。鑑於香港經濟規模細小及對外開放，並擔當國際金融中心的角色，聯繫匯率制度仍然是適合香港的匯率制度。香港特區政府堅決致力維持聯繫匯率制度。事實上，外匯市場及貨幣市場的穩定，進一步強化了政府承諾的可信性，而市民亦繼續對港元作為支付及儲值工具充滿信心。國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）在 2015 年與香港進行第四條款磋商時，繼續認同聯繫匯率制度是香港最佳的貨幣安排，並指出香港穩健的體制、法律及政策框架、充裕的財政儲備、靈活的市場及健全的金融體系，是支持聯繫匯率制度暢順運作的關鍵因素。\n\n鑑於穩健的銀行體系對聯繫匯率制度的正常運作至為重要，金管局繼續密切監察銀行的信貸、流動性和利率風險管理及壓力測試結果，並加強對銀行企業及物業貸款的監管，以提升銀行業的穩健性。鑑於美國利率上升，金管局提醒市民要為風險管理作出必要的準備，並指出弱方兌換保證被觸發及港元流出是港元利率正常化過程中的自然及必要步驟。\n\n為提高貨幣發行局賬目的透明度，自 1998 年 10 月起，外匯基金資產中已劃出特定部分作為支持貨幣基礎的用途。支持比率（定義為支持資產除以貨幣基礎）在 2015 年期間維持在 106.3% 至 107.5% 的狹窄範圍內，沒有觸及上限或下限觸發水平。該比率在 12 月 31 日收市時為 106.3%（圖 5）。在聯繫匯率制度下，雖然已指定特定外匯基金資產作為支持組合，但所有外匯基金資產均可用於支持港元匯率。基金擁有大量金融資源，可提供強大的後盾，在出現突如其來的衝擊時保護香港的貨幣及金融穩定。\n\n圖 5：2015 年支持比率每日變動情況\n\n# 其他活動\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會貨幣發行局小組委員會監察及檢討與香港貨幣及金融穩定有關的議題。2015 年，小組委員會考慮了多項議題，包括環球銀行提供國際美元貸款的情況、宏觀審慎措施的國際應用、美國升息對香港物業市場的影響、基準利率的釐定方法、港元實際有效匯率上升的宏觀經濟影響，以及新興市場經濟體的主權風險。小組委員會的討論記錄及提交小組委員會的貨幣發行局運作報告，均載於金管局網站。\n\n# 貨幣穩定性\n\n香港金融研究中心繼續贊助貨幣政策、銀行及金融領域的研究。2015 年，該中心接待了 16 名研究人員，並發表了 27 份工作論文。\n\n該中心舉辦了五場國際會議及工作坊。主要會議包括：\n\n* 一月舉行第六屆中國經濟國際會議，主題為「槓桿與金融體系效率及穩定性：中國與國際經驗」。會議上發表了 11 篇高質素的研究論文，涵蓋廣泛議題，包括中國企業槓桿、中國信貸增長與商業周期、銀行競爭與金融穩定，以及銀行監管與信貸供應。\n* 香港金融研究中心與香港大學在五月合辦題為「香港金融研究中心 - 香港大學金融、制度與經濟增長國際會議」的會議。會議涵蓋多項不同的經濟議題，包括銀行及貨幣政策、國際融資及跨境併購、金融監管設計，以及宏觀經濟環境與資本市場。\n* 香港金融研究中心、美國聯邦儲備系統理事會、歐洲中央銀行及達拉斯聯邦儲備銀行在十月合辦會議，主題為「分歧的貨幣政策、全球資本流動與金融穩定」。會議探討多項議題，包括貨幣政策、國際資本流動與匯率之間的關係、分歧的貨幣政策及其對全球金融穩定的影響、主要央行政策對世界其他地區的溢出效應，以及全球政策協調的成本與效益。\n\n該中心亦在八月舉辦第十三屆香港金融研究中心暑期工作坊，並在九月舉辦第十三屆香港金融研究中心內地經濟會議，探討內地財政改革及地方政府融資議題。這些會議及工作坊的參加者來自學術界、金融服務業界及全球央行。此外，該中心在年內舉辦了 24 場公開研討會，涵蓋廣泛的經濟、貨幣及金融議題。\n\n# 紙幣及硬幣\n\n2015 年底，流通紙幣總值為 3,602 億港元，較前一年增加 5.3%（圖 6、7 及 8）。政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣總值為 112 億港元，上升 2.9%（圖 9 及 10）。政府發行的 10 港元紙幣流通總值為 40 億港元，其中 85% 為膠質鈔票。"}
{"en":"# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA focused its supervisory efforts on authorized institutions risk governance, including credit and liquidity risk management systems, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing controls, and selling practices for investment and insurance products. With the build-up of systemic risks, the HKMA announced a 0.625% jurisdictional Countercyclical Capital Buffer for Hong Kong from 1 January 2016 (and 1.25% from 1 January 2017). Five authorized institutions were designated as Domestic Systemically Important Banks which will be subject to a Higher Loss Absorbency capital buffer. Significant progress was made on reforms for recovery and resolution with the introduction of the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Bill into the Legislative Council. The HKMA also stepped up its work with the banking industry on enhancing access to basic banking services, consumer education, and the skills and knowledge development of bank directors and financial practitioners.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2015\n\n# Overview\n\nAmid signs of a divergence in monetary policy stances among the major developed economies, emerging markets faced a higher risk of capital outflows and slower economic growth in 2015. In order to maintain the resilience of the banking sector against a possible abrupt deterioration in the macroeconomic environment, the HKMA continued to closely monitor the effectiveness of authorized institutions’ (AIs) risk governance and their systems for management of credit and liquidity risks.\n\n# Operational supervision\n\nIn 2015, the HKMA continued to adopt the supervisory approach where regular on-site examinations were supplemented by an increased number of thematic reviews. Thematic reviews are in-depth off-site reviews focusing on particular risk areas or specific activities of groups of selected AIs. This approach has allowed the HKMA to prioritise its supervisory resources to focus on emerging and more significant risks of AIs.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA performed a total of 193 on-site examinations. More in-depth thematic on-site examinations on credit risk management and asset quality were conducted, in view of the emerging signs of deterioration in the asset quality of AIs' loan portfolio. The HKMA increased the number of examinations on treasury related activities given market uncertainty amid the divergence of monetary policies in major advanced economies. On-site examinations were also conducted on Mainland-related business, stress testing and liquidity risk management, operational and technology risk management, capital planning, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML\/CFT) controls and internal ratings-based (IRB) models of AIs. AIs' activities in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses were also subject to on-site examinations by specialist teams during the year.\n\nFurthermore, a total of 152 thematic off-site reviews were conducted covering similar areas as the thematic on-site examinations. Table 1 contains details of the operational supervision work.\n\nIn 2015, 196 off-site reviews were conducted to assess AIs’ corporate governance, financial position and business operations. Supervisory attention focused on risk governance, capital planning, corporate sector credit and monitoring of implementation of Basel III standards. The supervisory teams maintained frequent contact with the boards of directors and external auditors of selected AIs. 20 tripartite meetings were held with the senior management and external auditors of AIs, while 23 meetings were held with the full board or board-level committees of selected AIs.\n\nThe Banking Supervision Review Committee considered four cases, all concerning the authorization of AIs.\n\nTo better utilise its supervisory resources to deal with competing priorities, the HKMA continued to invoke powers under section 59(2) of the Banking Ordinance to require AIs to appoint external auditors to follow up on potentially material supervisory issues. The HKMA commissioned six reports under this provision in 2015. Two of the reports covered AML\/CFT controls and another two of the reports covered private banking business, while the remaining were related to areas including securities related activities and loans classification system.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nNo AI breached the requirements of the Banking Ordinance relating to capital adequacy or liquidity ratio in 2015. There were 84 breaches under various sections of the Ordinance, but none affected the interests of depositors and they were rectified promptly by the AIs.\n\nTable 1 Operational supervision\n\n# Powers under section 52 of the Banking Ordinance\n\nMelli Bank Plc continues to be subject to the exercise of powers under section 52 of the Banking Ordinance. The directions imposed by the Monetary Authority on 25 June 2008 under section 52(1)(A) of the Banking Ordinance on the affairs, business and property of the Hong Kong Branch of Melli Bank Plc remained in force during the year. The HKMA will continue to communicate regularly with the relevant authorities to monitor developments related to the branch and its head office in the UK, and will keep in view the supervisory measures taken to protect the interests of the AI’s depositors.\n\n# CAMEL rating review\n\nThe CAMEL Approval Committee reviewed and determined the composite CAMEL ratings of AIs. The AIs were notified of the ratings and given the opportunity to request a review. There was no request for a review during the year.\n\n# Specialised supervisory work\n\n# Supervision of operational and technology risks\n\nThe HKMA continued to issue new or updated guidance on operational and technology risk management in the light of emerging risks and industry developments. In particular, the HKMA completed the revision of the Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module in relation to electronic banking (e-banking), which allows AIs more flexibility in offering new e-banking services. In addition, a circular was issued on cyber security, reiterating the importance for the boards and senior management of AIs to have oversight of effective cyber security risk management. The HKMA also published periodic issues of its “Operational Incidents Watch” highlighting the modus operandi of selected fraud cases or operational incidents and the control weaknesses identified.\n\nThe HKMA conducted risk-based thematic on-site and off-site supervisory reviews to evaluate selected AIs' operational and technology risk management at the enterprise level or in specific business lines. These covered selected areas in relation to AIs' operational risk management framework, cyber security risk management, controls for guarding against rogue trading activities, oversight of important outsourcing service providers, fraud risk management and technology controls for anti-money laundering. These supervisory reviews were supplemented by the annual independent compliance exercises covering operational risk management framework, technology risk management (including protection of customer data) and business continuity planning, where selected AIs were required to appoint independent and qualified assessors to examine the adequacy of their relevant controls and then rectify the weaknesses identified. The HKMA also identified and analysed the trend and key supervisory focus of AIs' operational and technology risks, with particular reference to the AIs that play an important role in the stability and effective functioning of Hong Kong's monetary and banking systems.\n\nThe HKMA monitored the final phase of the banking industry's implementation of the chip-based ATM technology through which AIs completed the card replacement process of pure credit cards by the end of 2015. The HKMA also required card issuing AIs to implement authentication controls to further improve the security over \"card-not-present\" credit card transactions. Separately, after receiving reports that the names of cardholders stored in some contactless credit cards could be accessed stealthily, the HKMA required the AIs concerned to take prompt action to notify and protect the affected cardholders. The HKMA devoted resources to publicise and explain the scale and implications of the incident to address public concern and to monitor AIs' remedial efforts, including the prompt replacement of affected cards.\n\nThe HKMA collaborated with the industry and other stakeholders on a number of initiatives, including public awareness programme on e-banking security precautions, establishing a platform for sharing cyber security intelligence, and providing support and advice to a crisis management exercise organised by the Hong Kong Financial Services Business Continuity Management Forum that involved AIs and other financial firms.\n\n# Supervision of wealth management and MPF-related businesses\n\nThe HKMA co-operated closely with other financial regulators in Hong Kong in providing guidance and supervising AIs’ selling of securities, investment products, insurance products and MPF schemes. Regular contact was maintained with the regulators through bilateral and multilateral meetings, as well as under the auspices of the Council of Financial Regulators. These meetings covered various issues involving financial groups or regulated entities with close business relationships across different sectors in the financial services industry to ensure more co-ordinated and effective supervisory action.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA conducted 25 on-site and offsite thematic examinations and 15 off-site surveillance of AIs. These covered the selling of investment products, handling the settlement of securities transactions and safe custody of client securities, and the selling of non-linked long term insurance (NLTI) products and MPF-related products involving retail, private banking and corporate banking customers.\n\nIn August, the HKMA issued a circular to AIs to provide guidance on suitability assessment and product information disclosure in the selling of NLTI products to customers. The guidance aimed to assist AIs in complying with regulatory standards, including relevant requirements issued in July by the Office of the Commissioner of Insurance and the Hong Kong Federation of Insurers.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA continued to work closely with the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB) in the legislative process for the Insurance Companies (Amendment) Bill 2014, to establish an independent Insurance Authority and a statutory licensing regime for insurance intermediaries. In July, the Insurance Companies (Amendment) ordinance 2015 was enacted by the Legislative Council, which provides, among other things, for the inspection and investigation powers, in respect of AIs’ insurance intermediary activities, of the Monetary Authority through delegation.\n\nThe HKMA processed six applications to become Registered Institutions (RIs) and one application from RIs to engage in additional regulated activities. It granted consent to 204 executive officers responsible for supervising the securities activities of RIs, and conducted background checks on 9,697 individuals whose information was submitted by RIs for inclusion in the register maintained by the HKMA.\n\n# Supervision of treasury activities\n\nAIs’ liquidity risk management remained one of the HKMA’s priority supervisory focuses, particularly in light of the anticipated normalisation of interest rates in the US and the potential subsequent reversal of fund flows that could have an impact on AIs’ liquidity positions. Throughout 2015, the HKMA continued to implement the enhanced Stable Funding Requirement for AIs to maintain sufficient stable funds to support their lending business. Since the implementation of the Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) from 1 January 2015, the HKMA has been monitoring the level and trend of LCRs of category 1 institutions, which generally maintained LCRs close to or over 100%, well above the statutory minimum of 60% for 2015 under the phase-in arrangement.\n\nSeparately, the HKMA conducted thematic on-site examinations on selected AIs’ control framework for managing the risks associated with the anticipated interest rate normalisation. Amid the market volatility, the HKMA also paid close attention to abrupt market changes and their impact on the banking sector as well as individual AIs, and undertook appropriate follow-up action.\n\n# Supervisor-driven stress testing programme\n\nThe HKMA continued to conduct the bottom-up supervisor-driven stress testing programme to better understand the resilience of locally incorporated retail banks under extreme and adverse economic conditions, and to encourage them to develop plans to address potential problems in times of stress. A number of improvements were introduced during the year to collect more granular information to gain a greater insight into the risk dynamics of selected areas. The HKMA analysed the results submitted by the participating AIs and discussed with them how their stress-testing processes could be further improved.\n\n# Credit risk management and asset quality\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nThe strong credit growth trend observed in previous years has subsided since the second half of 2015. For the year as a whole, the banking sector’s total lending increased by 3.5%, compared with 12.7% in 2014 (table 2). As customer deposits grew faster than bank lending, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio decreased to 70.1% at the end of 2015 from 72.2% a year ago.","terms":{"reach":["達"],"promoting":["以助發展"],"introduced":["提交"],"work":["工作"],"weaker":["轉弱"],"stays":["處於"],"HK":["本港"],"’":["的"],"capitalised":["資本充裕"],"swings":["大幅上落"],"enhance":["優化"],"raise":["上調"],"142.1":["1,421"],"supporting":["推動"],"instituting":["嚴格控制"],"stepped":["加強"],"improved":["優化"],"various":["各種"],"announcement":["公布"],"realigning":["重整"],"amounting":["為"],"3,422.9":["34,229"],"october":["10

銀行穩定性\n\n香港金管局將監督重點放在認可機構的風險治理上，包括信用及流動性風險管理系統、反洗錢及反恐融資監控措施，以及投資和保險產品的銷售實務。隨著系統性風險的累積，香港金管局宣布自2016年1月1日起，香港的反周期資本緩衝比率為0.625%（自2017年1月1日起為1.25%）。有5家認可機構被指定為國內系統性重要銀行，將受更高損失吸收能力資本緩衝的約束。隨著《金融機構（決議）條例》提交立法會，復甦和解決方案的改革取得了重大進展。香港金管局還加強了與銀行業的合作，以改善基本銀行服務的取得、消費者教育，以及銀行董事和金融從業人員的技能和知識發展。\n\n# 2015年回顧\n\n# 概述\n\n在主要已開發經濟體的貨幣政策立場出現分歧的跡象下，新興市場在2015年面臨更高的資本外流風險和更緩慢的經濟增長。為了維持銀行業在宏觀經濟環境可能突然惡化時的韌性，香港金管局繼續密切監察認可機構（AIs）的風險治理成效及其信用和流動性風險管理系統。\n\n# 業務監督\n\n在2015年，香港金管局繼續採用監督方法，以定期的現場檢查輔以更多主題式審查。主題式審查是深入的場外審查，專注於特定風險領域或部分認可機構的特定活動。這種方法使香港金管局能夠優先分配監督資源，專注於認可機構的新興和更重大風險。\n\n在該年度，香港金管局共進行了193次現場檢查。鑑於認可機構貸款組合的資產品質出現惡化跡象，香港金管局進行了更深入的信用風險管理和資產品質主題式現場檢查。鑑於主要已開發經濟體貨幣政策分歧導致市場不確定性，香港金管局增加了對國庫相關活動的檢查次數。現場檢查還涉及內地相關業務、壓力測試和流動性風險管理、營運和技術風險管理、資本規劃、反洗錢和反恐融資（AML\/CFT）監控措施，以及認可機構的內部評級法（IRB）模型。在該年度，認可機構在證券、投資產品、保險和強積金（MPF）相關業務方面的活動也受到專業團隊的現場檢查。\n\n此外，共進行了152次主題式場外審查，涵蓋了與主題式現場檢查類似的領域。表1包含業務監督工作的詳細資訊。\n\n在2015年，共進行了196次場外審查，以評估認可機構的公司治理、財務狀況和業務營運。監督重點關注風險治理、資本規劃、企業部門信貸和《巴塞爾協議III》標準的實施監控。監督團隊與部分認可機構的董事會和外部審計師保持頻繁聯繫。與認可機構的高層管理人員和外部審計師舉行了20次三方會議，與部分認可機構的整個董事會或董事會級委員會舉行了23次會議。\n\n銀行業監督檢討委員會審理了四宗個案，均涉及認可機構的授權事宜。\n\n為了更好地運用監督資源以應對競逐的優先事項，香港金管局繼續依據《銀行條例》第59(2)條的權力，要求認可機構委任外部審計師跟進可能重大的監督事宜。香港金管局在2015年依據此條款委任了六份報告。其中兩份報告涉及AML\/CFT監控措施，另外兩份涉及私人銀行業務，其餘則與證券相關活動和貸款分類系統等領域有關。\n\n# 銀行穩定性\n\n在2015年，沒有認可機構違反《銀行條例》有關資本充足率或流動性比率的規定。有84宗違反《條例》各條款的個案，但均未影響存款人的利益，且已被認可機構迅速糾正。\n\n表1 業務監督\n\n# 《銀行條例》第52條的權力\n\nMelli Bank Plc 繼續受《銀行條例》第52條規定的權力約束。貨幣管理局於2008年6月25日依據《銀行條例》第52(1)(A)條對Melli Bank Plc 香港分行的事務、業務和財產發出的指示，在該年度內仍然有效。香港金管局將繼續與相關當局定期溝通，監控該分行及其英國總部的發展情況，並持續關注為保護認可機構存款人利益而採取的監督措施。\n\n# CAMEL評級檢討\n\nCAMEL審批委員會檢討及確定了認可機構的綜合CAMEL評級。認可機構已獲通知評級結果，並有機會要求進行覆核。在該年度內，沒有收到任何覆核要求。\n\n# 專項監督工作\n\n# 營運及科技風險的監督\n\n香港金管局繼續根據新興風險和行業發展，發出有關營運及科技風險管理的新指引或更新指引。尤其是，香港金管局完成了《監督政策手冊》（SPM）中有關電子銀行模組的修訂，讓認可機構在提供新電子銀行服務方面有更大靈活性。此外，香港金管局發出了一份關於網路安全的通告，重申認可機構的董事會和高層管理人員必須監督有效的網路安全風險管理。香港金管局還定期出版《營運事故觀察》，重點介紹部分詐騙案件或營運事故的作案手法及所發現的控制弱點。\n\n香港金管局進行以風險為基礎的主題式現場及場外監督審查，以評估部分認可機構在企業層面或特定業務線上的營運及科技風險管理情況。這些審查涵蓋了認可機構營運風險管理框架、網路安全風險管理、防範不當交易活動的監控措施、重要外包服務供應商的監督、詐騙風險管理及反洗錢技術控制等特定領域。這些監督審查輔以年度獨立合規演習，涵蓋營運風險管理框架、科技風險管理（包括客戶資料保護）及業務持續性規劃，其中要求部分認可機構委任獨立及合格評估員，檢視其相關監控措施的充分性，並糾正所發現的弱點。香港金管局還識別及分析了認可機構營運及科技風險的趨勢和主要監督重點，特別關注在維持香港貨幣及銀行體系穩定和有效運作方面發揮重要作用的認可機構。\n\n香港金管局監控了銀行業實施晶片式自動櫃員機技術的最後階段，認可機構通過此技術在2015年底前完成了純信用卡的換卡流程。香港金管局還要求發卡認可機構實施認證監控措施，以進一步提升「無卡交易」信用卡交易的安全性。另外，在接到報告稱部分非接觸式信用卡中儲存的持卡人姓名可被竊取後，香港金管局要求相關認可機構迅速採取行動，通知及保護受影響的持卡人。香港金管局投入資源，宣傳及解釋該事件的規模及影響，以回應公眾關注，並監控認可機構的補救工作，包括迅速更換受影響的卡片。\n\n香港金管局與業界及其他利害關係人合作，推行多項措施，包括提高公眾對電子銀行安全防範措施的認識、建立網路安全情報共享平台，以及為香港金融服務業業務持續管理論壇舉辦的危機管理演習提供支援及建議，該演習涉及認可機構及其他金融公司。\n\n# 對財富管理及強積金相關業務的監督\n\n香港金管局與香港其他金融監管機構緊密合作，為認可機構銷售證券、投資產品、保險產品及強積金計畫提供指引及進行監管。透過雙邊及多邊會議，以及在金融監管機構理事會的主持下，與監管機構保持定期聯絡。這些會議涵蓋了涉及金融集團或受監管實體在金融服務行業不同板塊中具有密切業務關係的各種議題，以確保更協調及有效的監管行動。\n\n在該年度，香港金管局對認可機構進行了25次現場及場外主題式檢查，以及15次場外監控。這些檢查涵蓋了投資產品的銷售、證券交易結算的處理及客戶證券的安全保管，以及非掛鉤長期保險（NLTI）產品及強積金相關產品的銷售，涉及零售、私人銀行及企業銀行客戶。\n\n在8月，香港金管局向認可機構發出通告，就向客戶銷售NLTI產品時的適當性評估及產品資訊披露提供指引。該指引旨在協助認可機構遵守監管標準，包括保險業監理專員辦事處及香港保險業聯會於7月發出的相關要求。\n\n# 銀行穩定性\n\n香港金管局繼續與金融服務及庫務局（FSTB）在《2014年保險公司（修訂）條例》的立法程序中緊密合作，以設立一個獨立的保險管理局及為保險中介人建立法定發牌制度。在7月，立法會通過了《2015年保險公司（修訂）條例》，其中除其他外，賦予貨幣管理局透過委派方式，對認可機構的保險中介活動進行檢查及調查的權力。\n\n香港金管局處理了六宗成為註冊機構（RIs）的申請，以及一宗註冊機構從事額外受監管活動的申請。它批准了204名負責監督註冊機構證券活動的行政人員，並對9,697名人士進行了背景審查，這些人士的資料由註冊機構提交，以納入香港金管局維持的登記冊中。\n\n# 對國庫活動的監督\n\n認可機構的流動性風險管理仍然是金管局監督工作的優先重點之一，尤其是鑑於預期美國利率將正常化，以及隨後資金流向可能逆轉，這可能會影響認可機構的流動性狀況。在2015全年，金管局繼續落實強化後的穩定資金要求，以確保認可機構維持足夠的穩定資金，支持其貸款業務。自2015年1月1日起實施《巴塞爾協議III》流動性覆蓋比率（LCR）以來，金管局一直監控第1類機構的LCR水平和趨勢，這些機構的LCR普遍維持在接近或超過100%的水平，遠高於2015年在分階段安排下的法定最低水平60%。\n\n另外，金管局對部分認可機構的管控框架進行了主題式現場檢查，以管理與預期利率正常化相關的風險。在市場波動期間，金管局亦密切關注市場的突發變化及其對銀行業和個別認可機構的影響，並採取適當的跟進行動。\n\n# 由監管機構主導的壓力測試計畫\n\n金管局繼續進行由監管機構主導的自下而上的壓力測試計畫，以更好地了解本地註冊零售銀行在極端和不利經濟條件下的韌性，並鼓勵它們制定計畫，以應對壓力時期的潛在問題。在該年度，引入了多項改進措施，以收集更詳細的資訊，以更深入地了解特定領域的風險動態。金管局分析了參與認可機構提交的結果，並與它們討論如何進一步改進其壓力測試流程。\n\n# 信用風險管理與資產品質\n\n# 信用成長與資產品質\n\n自2015年下半年以來，前幾年觀察到的強勁信用成長趨勢已有所緩和。全年銀行業總貸款成長了3.5%，而2014年則為12.7%（表2）。由於客戶存款成長速度快於銀行貸款，整體貸存比率從去年的72.2%下降至2015年底的70.1%。"}
{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nThe global economic and financial environment was fraught with challenges in 2015, calling for closer international collaboration and communication to maintain stability. During the year, the HKMA continued to actively participate in international and regional forums while sparing no effort in raising Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre, including enhancing our financial infrastructure, optimising the regulatory and tax regime, and capitalising on the internationalisation of the renminbi to further develop offshore renminbi business. Hong Kong’s strong economic fundamentals and robust fiscal performance continued to be recognised by credit rating agencies with Standard & Poor’s maintaining its top-rated AAA rating for Hong Kong.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nThe HKMA actively contributes to international discussions on issues of significance to global and regional financial stability. In July, it assumed co-chairmanship of the Financial Stability Board Regional Consultative Group for Asia (FSB RCG(A)) for a two-year period. The group’s aim is to promote interaction between FSB members and nonmembers on policy initiatives, encourage implementation of financial reforms and facilitate the exchange of views on financial stability issues. The HKMA continued to work closely with the ASEAN+3 authorities to strengthen the operations of the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO) — which has been upgraded to an international organisation — to monitor and analyse regional economies and support decision-making of the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralisation (CMIM).\n\nDuring the year, Hong Kong’s offshore renminbi pool and bond issuance experienced some contraction due to a number of market factors. However the market continued to function orderly, and renminbi trade settlement, bank lending and foreign exchange turnover maintained steady growth. In addition, the growing renminbi business conducted in and through Hong Kong contributed to the recognition of the renminbi by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as a freely usable currency. The iMF’s decision to include it in the Special Drawing Right (SDR) currency basket will add impetus to the internationalisation of the renminbi as well as the further development of the offshore market in Hong Kong.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong's financial infrastructure and its continued development play a significant role in reinforcing the competitive edge of Hong Kong as an international financial centre and the global offshore renminbi business hub. The turnover of the renminbi payment system in Hong Kong hit new highs in 2015, while the trade repository for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives continued to support entities to report their OTC derivatives transactions as required under the new OTC derivatives market regulatory regime, which was introduced in July.\n\nHong Kong's financial infrastructure was further enhanced by the HKMA in 2015 with new components and services, including the successful launch of the e-Cheque service in December, which means that over 150 banks are now capable of receiving and processing e-Cheques from their customers through the Internet and mobile channels. The electronic bill presentment and payment (EBPP) service, which was launched in 2013, continued to see growth in merchant participation in 2015. In July, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMu) launched a service under its Fund Order Routing Service to support the implementation of the Mainland - Hong Kong Mutual Recognition of Funds (MRF). And, the regulatory framework for retail payment products and services was improved with the commencement in November of the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO). Under the PSSVFO, the HKMA is empowered to implement a mandatory licensing regime for multi-purpose stored value facilities and perform relevant supervision and enforcement functions, as well as designating important retail payment systems to ensure their safe and efficient operation under prudential regulation.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\n# REVIEW OF 2015\n\n# International and regional co-operation\n\nWith increased connections among global financial markets, the HKMA proactively fosters co-operation with other jurisdictions in promoting sustainable economic growth and financial system stability through international and regional forums including the FSB, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC). The HKMA also continues to implement global financial regulatory reforms, including the recommendations of the G20, to help strengthen the resilience of the global financial system.\n\nThe HKMA became a co-chair of the FSB RCG(A) in July and hosted its ninth meeting in Hong Kong in October. The RCG(A) serves as an important platform for FSB members and non-FSB members to communicate and co-operate on financial stability issues. Senior representatives from finance ministries, central banks and financial regulators of 16 Asian jurisdictions attended the meeting to discuss risks facing the region, the implications of increasing asset management activities, misconduct risk and experience with deposit insurance schemes. The HKMA also co-chaired a workshop on macroprudential policies in Hong Kong in August. The workshop was organised by the Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS), and attended by representatives from 18 central banks from around the world. Participants shared their experiences in macroprudential policies, focusing on the calibration and evaluation of tools, their interaction with monetary policy, and possible spillover effects. The HKMA also co-hosted a conference with the Bank of England and the IMF, featuring discussions on the challenges that central banks and other policymakers face in choosing the optimal mix of monetary, macroprudential and microprudential policies. The conference was attended by over a hundred participants, including representatives from academia, central banks and international financial institutions.\n\n# Promoting monetary and financial stability in Asia\n\nThe HKMA maintained its commitment to regional cooperative initiatives to promote financial stability in Asia and to harness the region's collective voice in international financial affairs. As a co-ordinator of the macro-surveillance work for the Monetary and Financial Stability Committee established under the Executives' Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP), the HKMA continued to prepare the Committee’s half-yearly Macro-Monitoring Report to assess the region’s risks and vulnerabilities and the policy implications. As Chair of the EMEAP Working Group on Payment and Settlement Systems, the HKMA worked closely with the Deputy Chair to co-ordinate the Group’s effort in sharing experiences and exchanging information on risk management, oversight, standards and best practices, and developments in domestic and cross-border payment and settlement systems. It also led the Working Group’s sub-group on cross-border co-operation and development. The HKMA hosted meetings of the EMEAP\/BIS Forum on Foreign Exchange Markets and the EMEAP Working Group on Financial Markets (WGFM) in Hong Kong in June. Attended by representatives from 17 authorities from the region and major economies, the meetings reviewed the latest developments in financial markets and financial regulatory reforms.\n\nFollowing the signing of the AMRO Agreement by Hong Kong and the ASEAN+3 authorities last year, AMRO was upgraded to an international organisation in February 2016 to support its pivotal role under the enhanced CMIM.\n\n# Hong Kong’s credit ratings\n\nThe HKMA continued to maintain close dialogue with international credit rating agencies to present a balanced assessment of Hong Kong's economic performance and fiscal strength. These efforts contributed to the affirmation of Hong Kong's credit ratings by all major credit rating agencies in 2015. Standard & Poor's affirmed its highest AAA rating for Hong Kong, reflecting the agency’s recognition of Hong Kong’s above-average growth prospects for a high-income economy, sizable fiscal reserves, consistently healthy fiscal performance and strong net external asset position. Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings also maintained Hong Kong’s ratings at Aa1 and AA+ respectively, just one notch below triple-A.\n\n# Development of Hong Kong as the offshore renminbi business centre\n\nIn 2015, market factors had an impact on Hong Kong's renminbi pool. At the end of the year, outstanding renminbi customer deposits and certificates of deposit stood at RMB 1,010 billion, as compared with RMB 1,158 billion a year ago (Chart 1). Offshore renminbi bond issuance moderated amid declining interest rates in the onshore market. As a result, issuance of renminbi bonds in Hong Kong dropped to RMB 75 billion. On the other hand, renminbi trade settlement transactions handled by banks in Hong Kong expanded by 9% to RMB 6,833 billion. The outstanding amount of renminbi bank loans also increased by 58% year-on-year to RMB 297 billion (Chart 2). Average daily turnover in the renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system increased to RMB 947 billion, up 29% from 2014. At the same time, the offshore renminbi foreign exchange market saw further growth in Hong Kong, with survey results indicating a daily turnover of some US$ 93 billion equivalent at the end of April 2015, an increase of 88% from April 2013 when the last BIS Triennial Survey was conducted. Hong Kong remained the largest offshore renminbi business hub with a market of considerable depth and breadth. Another significant development reinforcing this position was the implementation of the MRF initiative in July, which has expanded Hong Kong’s renminbi product offering.\n\nThe HKMA's policy initiative to expand channels for crossborder renminbi fund flows and its joint efforts with the industry to enhance Hong Kong's renminbi financial platform continued to bear fruit. In June, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) announced that offshore renminbi business clearing banks and participating banks would be allowed to conduct repo transactions in the onshore interbank bond market and remit proceeds offshore, to facilitate renminbi liquidity management by banks in the offshore market. In September, the PBoC relaxed the rules on cross-border renminbi cash pooling, enabling more multinational corporations to conduct intra-group cash transfers under streamlined arrangements. The Mainland authorities also granted foreign central banks, international financial institutions and sovereign wealth funds wider access to the onshore interbank bond market in July. They further opened up the Mainland’s foreign exchange market to these institutions in September.\n\nOn 30 november, the IMF announced its decision to include the renminbi in the SDR currency basket with effect from 1 October 2016. The decision affirms the renminbi’s status as a freely usable currency, and further promotes confidence in the use of the renminbi for global transactions. As an international financial centre and the global offshore renminbi business hub, Hong Kong will benefit from new business opportunities arising from the further internationalisation of the renminbi and the Mainland’s enhanced connection with the global economic and financial systems.\n\nHong Kong continued to reinforce its collaboration on renminbi business with other jurisdictions throughout the year. The HKMA co-hosted the third RMB Trade and Investment Dialogue with Australia and the fifth RMB Business Forum with London, and worked with Malaysia and Thailand for the second time in facilitating private sector discussions on renminbi business. Through these initiatives, banks in Hong Kong strengthened their renminbi business flows and linkages with other markets, which will bring more renminbi business to Hong Kong. The HKMA also stepped up its marketing efforts to promote the wider use of renminbi in trade, investment and financing among corporations and institutions through participation in industry events in Hong Kong and in overseas markets including Canada, Japan and Africa.\n\nDeputy Chief Executive of the HKMA, Mr Eddie Yue, speaks at a seminar during the fifth meeting of Hong Kong–London RMB Forum on 11 December 2015.\n\n# CEPA\n\nA new agreement to achieve basic liberalisation of trade in services between Mainland China and Hong Kong was signed in November under the framework of the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA). The agreement extends most of the pilot liberalisation measures introduced in Guangdong in 2014 nationwide. By according national treatment, in principle, to Hong Kong banks, the new agreement is expected to provide these banks with more policy certainty and greater flexibility when conducting business in Mainland China.\n\n# Training\n\nThe HKMA continued to provide training programmes for officials from the PBoC, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange and the China Banking Regulatory Commission. In addition to programmes dealing with central banking and general risk management, topics included consumer protection, credit reference, monetary and collateral management, financial soundness indicators analysis, and systemic risk monitoring. Ad hoc training sessions were also conducted for delegations from overseas banking and law enforcement agencies.\n\n# Government Bond Programme\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA arranged eight tenders of institutional government bonds amounting to HK$ 20.4 billion. By the end of 2015, the total amount of outstanding institutional bonds was HK$ 68.9 billion.\n","terms":{"reach":["達"],"promoting":["以助發展"],"introduced":["提交"],"work":["工作"],"weaker":["轉弱"],"stays":["處於"],"HK":["本港"],"’":["的"],"capitalised":["資本充裕"],"swings":["大幅上落"],"enhance":["優化"],"raise":["上調"],"142.1":["1,421"],"supporting":["推動"],"instituting":["嚴格控制"],"stepped":["加強"],"improved":["優化"],"various":["各種"],"announcement":["公布"],"realigning":["重整"],"amounting":["為"],"3,422.9":["34,229"],"october":["10

國際金融中心\n\n2015 年，全球經濟和金融環境面臨諸多挑戰，需要更緊密的國際合作與溝通，以維持穩定。在該年度，香港金管局持續積極參與國際及區域會議，並努力提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力，包括強化本港金融基礎建設、優化監管及稅務制度，以及把握人民幣國際化的契機，進一步發展離岸人民幣業務。香港穩健的經濟基礎和優異的財政表現，持續獲得信貸評級機構的肯定，標準普爾維持香港最高的「AAA」信貸評級。\n\n# 概述\n\n香港金管局積極參與國際社會針對全球及區域金融穩定的重要議題進行的討論。7 月，金管局擔任金融穩定委員會亞洲區域諮詢小組（FSB RCG(A)）的聯合主席，任期為兩年。該小組的目標是促進 FSB 成員與非成員在政策倡議上的互動，鼓勵落實金融改革，並促進就金融穩定議題交換意見。金管局持續與東盟加三（ASEAN+3）的監管機構緊密合作，以強化東盟加三宏觀經濟研究辦公室（AMRO）的運作——該辦公室已升格為國際組織——以監控及分析區域經濟，並支持清邁倡議多邊化（CMIM）的決策工作。\n\n在該年度，由於多項市場因素，香港離岸人民幣資金池和債券發行量有所萎縮。然而，市場持續有序運作，人民幣貿易結算、銀行貸款及外匯交易額維持穩定成長。此外，在香港進行及透過香港進行的人民幣業務日益成長，促使國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）認可人民幣為可自由使用的貨幣。IMF 決定將人民幣納入特別提款權（SDR）貨幣籃子，這將進一步推動人民幣國際化，以及香港離岸市場的進一步發展。\n\n香港金融基礎建設的安全及高效運作，及其持續發展，對鞏固香港作為國際金融中心及全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的競爭優勢，發揮了重要作用。2015 年，香港人民幣支付系統的交易額創下新高，而場外衍生工具交易資料庫則持續支援實體按照 7 月實施的新場外衍生工具市場監管制度的要求，呈報其場外衍生工具交易。\n\n香港金管局在 2015 年透過新增組件及服務，進一步優化了香港的金融基礎建設，包括在 12 月成功推出電子支票服務，使超過 150 家銀行現可透過網際網路及行動渠道接收及處理客戶發出的電子支票。2013 年推出的電子帳單及繳費服務（EBPP）在 2015 年持續錄得商戶參與量的成長。7 月，中央貨幣市場單位（CMU）在其基金訂購路由服務下推出了一項服務，以支援內地與香港基金互認計畫（MRF）的落實。此外，零售支付產品及服務的監管框架亦得到優化，《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（PSSVFO）於 11 月生效。根據 PSSVFO，金管局獲賦權對多用途儲值支付工具實施強制發牌制度，並履行相關的監管及執法職能，以及指定重要的零售支付系統，以確保其在審慎監管下安全及高效地運作。\n\n# 國際金融中心\n\n# 2015 年回顧\n\n# 國際及區域合作\n\n隨著全球金融市場之間的聯繫日益緊密，香港金管局積極透過國際及區域會議（包括 FSB、國際清算銀行（BIS）及亞太經濟合作組織（APEC））與其他司法管轄區合作，以促進永續的經濟成長及金融體系穩定。金管局亦持續落實全球金融監管改革，包括二十國集團（G20）的建議，以協助強化全球金融體系的韌性。\n\n香港金管局在 7 月成為 FSB RCG(A) 的聯合主席，並於 10 月在本港主辦了第九次會議。RCG(A) 為 FSB 成員及非 FSB 成員就金融穩定議題進行溝通及合作提供了一個重要平台。來自 16 個亞洲司法管轄區的財政部、中央銀行及金融監管機構的資深代表出席了會議，討論該區域面臨的風險、資產管理活動日益增加的影響、不當行為風險及存款保險計畫的經驗。金管局亦於 8 月在本港聯合主持了一場關於宏觀審慎政策的研討會。該研討會由全球金融體系委員會（CGFS）主辦，來自全球 18 家中央銀行的代表出席了會議。與會者分享了他們在宏觀審慎政策方面的經驗，重點討論了工具的校準及評估、與貨幣政策的互動，以及可能的溢出效應。香港金管局亦與英倫銀行及 IMF 聯合主辦了一場會議，討論中央銀行及其他決策者在選擇貨幣政策、宏觀審慎政策及微觀審慎政策的最佳組合時面臨的挑戰。該會議有超過一百名與會者出席，包括來自學術界、中央銀行及國際金融機構的代表。\n\n# 促進亞洲的貨幣及金融穩定\n\n香港金管局持續致力於區域合作倡議，以促進亞洲的金融穩定，並凝聚該區域在國際金融事務上的集體聲音。作為東亞洲及太平洋中央銀行行政首長會議（EMEAP）下設立的貨幣及金融穩定委員會宏觀監控工作的協調機構，金管局持續編製該委員會每半年的《宏觀監控報告》，以評估該區域的風險及脆弱性，以及政策影響。作為 EMEAP 支付及結算系統工作小組的主席，金管局與副主席緊密合作，協調該小組在風險管理、監控、標準及最佳實務，以及國內及跨境支付及結算系統發展方面的經驗分享及資訊交流工作。金管局亦領導了該工作小組的跨境合作及發展分小組。金管局於 6 月在本港主辦了 EMEAP\/BIS 外匯市場論壇及 EMEAP 金融市場工作小組（WGFM）的會議。來自該區域及主要經濟體的 17 個監管機構的代表出席了會議，檢討了金融市場及金融監管改革的最新發展。\n\n繼去年香港與東盟加三監管機構簽訂 AMRO 協議後，AMRO 於 2016 年 2 月升格為國際組織，以支持其在強化後的 CMIM 下所擔當的重要角色。\n\n# 香港的信貸評級\n\n香港金管局持續與國際信貸評級機構保持緊密對話，以平衡地評估香港的經濟表現及財政實力。這些努力促使所有主要信貸評級機構在 2015 年確認了香港的信貸評級。標準普爾確認了香港最高的「AAA」信貸評級，反映該機構認同香港作為高收入經濟體具有高於平均的成長前景、龐大的財政儲備、一貫良好的財政表現及強勁的對外淨資產狀況。穆迪投資者服務公司及惠譽評級亦分別維持香港「Aa1」及「AA+」的評級，僅次於「AAA」級。\n\n# 香港發展成為離岸人民幣業務中心的情況\n\n2015 年，市場因素對香港人民幣資金池構成影響。於年底，未償還人民幣客戶存款及存款證餘額為 1 兆 100 億元人民幣，較一年前的 1 兆 1,580 億元人民幣減少（圖 1）。由於內地市場利率下跌，離岸人民幣債券發行量有所放緩，使香港人民幣債券發行量下降至 750 億元人民幣。另一方面，香港銀行處理的人民幣貿易結算交易額則增加 9% 至 6 兆 8,330 億元人民幣。未償還人民幣銀行貸款額亦較去年同期上升 58% 至 2,970 億元人民幣（圖 2）。人民幣實時總額結算（RTGS）系統的平均每日交易額增加至 9,470 億元人民幣，較 2014 年上升 29%。同時，香港離岸人民幣外匯市場進一步成長，調查結果顯示，2015 年 4 月底的日均交易額約為 930 億美元等值，較 2013 年 4 月進行上次 BIS 三年期調查時增加 88%。香港仍然是最大的離岸人民幣業務樞紐，市場具有相當的深度及廣度。另一項強化香港此地位的重要發展是 7 月落實的 MRF 倡議，該倡議擴大了香港的人民幣產品種類。\n\n香港金管局擴闊跨境人民幣資金流通渠道的政策措施，以及與業界攜手優化香港人民幣金融平台的努力，持續取得成果。6 月，中國人民銀行（PBoC）宣布，離岸人民幣業務清算行及參與行將獲准在內地銀行間債券市場進行回購交易，並將交易收益匯回離岸，以促進銀行在離岸市場管理人民幣流動性。9 月，中國人民銀行放寬了跨境人民幣資金池業務的規定，使更多跨國企業可在簡化的安排下進行集團內資金調撥。內地監管機構亦在 7 月授予外資央行、國際金融機構及主權財富基金更廣泛的內地銀行間債券市場准入權。他們在 9 月進一步向這些機構開放內地外匯市場。\n\n11 月 30 日，IMF 宣布決定自 2016 年 10 月 1 日開始將人民幣納入 SDR 貨幣籃子。該決定肯定了人民幣作為可自由使用貨幣的地位，並進一步促進了對使用人民幣進行全球交易的信心。作為國際金融中心及全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐，香港將受惠於人民幣進一步國際化及內地與全球經濟和金融體系更緊密聯繫所帶來的新的業務機會。\n\n香港在全年持續強化與其它司法管轄區在人民幣業務上的合作。香港金管局與澳洲聯合主辦了第三次人民幣貿易及投資對話，與倫敦聯合主辦了第五次人民幣業務論壇，並第二次與馬來西亞及泰國合作，促進私人企業就人民幣業務進行討論。透過這些措施，香港銀行強化了人民幣業務流量及其與其它市場的聯繫，這將為香港帶來更多人民幣業務。香港金管局亦加強了推廣工作，透過參與本港及海外市場（包括加拿大、日本及非洲）的業界活動，促進企業及機構更廣泛地使用人民幣進行貿易、投資及融資。\n\n香港金管局副總裁余偉文先生在 2015 年 12 月 11 日香港與倫敦人民幣論壇第五次會議期間的研討會上發言。\n\n# CEPA\n\n在《更緊密經貿關係安排》（CEPA）框架下，內地與香港在 11 月簽訂了一項新協議，以實現服務貿易的基本自由化。該協議將 2014 年在廣東推出的試點自由化措施大部分擴展至全國。新協議原則上給予香港銀行國民待遇，預期將為這些銀行在內地經營業務提供更大的政策確定性及靈活性。\n\n# 培訓\n\n香港金管局持續為中國人民銀行、國家外匯管理局及中國銀行業監督管理委員會的官員提供培訓課程。除了涉及中央銀行業務及一般風險管理的課程外，主題亦包括消費者保護、信用資料、貨幣及抵押品管理、金融穩健性指標分析，以及系統性風險監控。金管局亦為海外銀行及執法機構的代表團舉辦了專題培訓課程。\n\n# 政府債券計畫\n\n在該年度，香港金管局安排了八次機構政府債券招標，總額為 204 億港元。截至 2015 年底，未償還機構債券總額為 689 億港元。"}
{"en":"# Reserves Management\n\n2015 was a turbulent year for the global financial markets, presenting unprecedented challenges to investment funds. Amid such challenging and difficult investment environment, the Exchange Fund recorded an overall investment return of -0.6% in 2015, but its loss was relatively mild as compared with major market indices and comparable investment funds, thanks to a series of defensive moves deployed by the HKMA over the past years which have enhanced the resilience of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary and may be invested in any securities or other assets he considers appropriate, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC).\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nEFAC has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(a) to preserve capital;\n(b) to ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, will be fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(c) to ensure that sufficient liquidity will be available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) subject to (a) — (c), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund.\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios — the Backing Portfolio and the Investment Portfolio. The Backing Portfolio holds highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of the assets. The long-term target bond-to-equity mix for the two portfolios as a whole is 72:28. In terms of target currency mix, 81% of the assets are allocated to the US dollar and the Hong Kong dollar, and the remaining 19% to other currencies.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA has been diversifying part of the Exchange Fund’s investment, in a prudent and incremental manner, into a greater variety of asset classes, including emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity and overseas investment properties. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the Investment Portfolio while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The cap for the net asset value of the HKMA’s investments under the LTGP is maintained at one-third of the Accumulated Surplus of the Exchange Fund. At the end of 2015, the market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$142.1 billion, made up of HK$91.3 billion in private equity and HK$50.8 billion in real estate, with outstanding investment commitments amounted to HK$122.4 billion.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007 to hold shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that were acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes, is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of the unique nature of this Portfolio.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation — the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation. The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents the long-term optimal asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This often means the actual allocation is different from the benchmark, or strategic, allocation. The differences between the actual and the benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and the limits for tactical deviations are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with EFAC, tactical decisions are made by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the limits allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may take positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nHKMA staff in the Reserves Management Department directly manage the investment of about 76% of the Exchange Fund, which includes the entire Backing Portfolio and part of the Investment Portfolio. This part of the Investment Portfolio includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers based in a number of international financial centres to manage about 24% of the Exchange Fund's assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised assets. The purpose of appointing external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to capture a diverse mix of investment styles, and transfer knowledge and information from the market to in-house professionals.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is primarily determined by market factors, and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe high volatility of the financial markets in recent years has highlighted the importance of risk management. Stringent controls and investment guidelines have been established for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and compliance with guidelines and regulations is closely monitored. Risk-control tools are deployed to assess market risks under both normal and adverse market conditions. The HKMA also conducts detailed performance attribution analyses to make the best use of the investment skills of both internal and external managers.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2015\n\nThe global financial markets were highly volatile in 2015. The equity markets, in particular, encountered exceptional turbulence. Major equity markets reached new highs in the first half of the year. However, market sentiment worsened drastically in the third quarter, arising from Mainland China growth concerns, with major equity markets reversing their year-to-date gains and registering significant quarterly losses. Global equity markets recovered somewhat along with improving market sentiment thereafter, but they worsened again towards the end of the year. With their close linkage with the Mainland economy, Hong Kong equities underperformed other major equity markets in 2015.\n\nOn sovereign bond markets, longer-term US Treasury yields rose moderately in 2015 despite expectation of US interest rate normalisation and the start of the US interest rate up-cycle, as positive sentiment was checked by concerns over global economic growth, lingering global disinflationary pressures and intensified geopolitical tensions. On the other hand, short-term European government bond yields declined and some even slipped into negative territory on the back of the European Central Bank’s aggressive monetary easing policy.\n\nOn currency markets, the US dollar continued to strengthen in 2015 with the US dollar index surging by almost 10%, amid expectation of the commencement of the US policy rate normalisation. The euro weakened significantly in the first quarter, posting the biggest single-quarter fall in the history of the euro since 1999, as the European Central Bank announced quantitative easing measures in January. On the other hand, the yen stayed largely flat against the US dollar in 2015.\n\nThe performance of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2015 is shown in Table 1.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nAgainst the backdrop of exceptionally volatile financial markets and difficult investment environment, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment loss of HK$15.8 billion in 2015, comprising gains of HK$7.1 billion on overseas equities, losses of HK$5 billion on Hong Kong equities, gains of HK$15.9 billion on bonds, a negative currency translation effect of HK$44.9 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets and gains of HK$11.1 billion on other investments held by the investment holding subsidiaries of the Fund. The negative currency translation effect was unavoidable when translating the Exchange Fund’s non-US dollar investments into Hong Kong dollar amid the sharp strengthening of the US dollar last year. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$2.2 billion.\n\nThe total assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$3,422.9 billion at the end of 2015. The investment return of the Exchange Fund (excluding the Strategic Portfolio) in 2015 was -0.6%. That notwithstanding, the Exchange Fund’s loss could be considered mild when compared with the underperforming major market indices and the investment fund community in general. In anticipation of a worsening investment environment, the HKMA has deployed a series of defensive moves over the past years, which include shortening the duration of bond portfolios, increasing cash holdings, and significantly reducing non-US dollar assets. We have also quickened the pace of investment diversification, especially through investments under the LTGP. These moves have enhanced the resilience of the Exchange Fund and helped mitigate some potential losses.\n\nThe annual return of the Fund from 1994 to 2015 is set out in Chart 1. Table 2 shows the 2015 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over a number of different time horizons. The average return was 1.2% over the past three years, 1.8% over the past five years, 3.3% over the past 10 years and 5.0% since 1994. Table 3 shows the currency mix of the Fund's assets on 31 December 2015.\n\nChart 1 Investment return of the Exchange Fund (1994 – 2015) \n1 investment return calculation excludes the holdings in the Strategic Portfolio. \n2 Composite Consumer price index is calculated based on the 2009\/2010-based series.\n","terms":{"reach":["達"],"promoting":["以助發展"],"introduced":["提交"],"work":["工作"],"weaker":["轉弱"],"stays":["處於"],"HK":["本港"],"’":["的"],"capitalised":["資本充裕"],"swings":["大幅上落"],"enhance":["優化"],"raise":["上調"],"142.1":["1,421"],"supporting":["推動"],"instituting":["嚴格控制"],"stepped":["加強"],"improved":["優化"],"various":["各種"],"announcement":["公布"],"realigning":["重整"],"amounting":["為"],"3,422.9":["34,229"],"october":["10

儲備管理\n\n2015 年是全球金融市場動盪的一年，為投資基金帶來前所未有的挑戰。在如此艱鉅的投資環境下，外匯基金於 2015 年的整體投資回報錄得負 0.6%，但與主要市場指數及同類投資基金比較，其虧損相對溫和，這有賴金管局過去幾年採取的一系列防禦措施，這些措施強化了外匯基金的抗風險能力。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n《外匯基金條例》訂明，外匯基金的主要目的是直接或間接影響香港貨幣的匯率。基金亦可用以維持香港貨幣及金融制度的穩定和健全，以協助維持香港作為國際金融中心。外匯基金由財政司司長管理，經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會（外咨會）後，可投資於他認為適當的任何證券或其他資產。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標及投資組合結構\n\n外咨會為外匯基金訂立了以下投資目標：\n\n(a) 保障本金；\n(b) 確保貨幣基礎在任何時候均獲十足的高度流通美元資產支持；\n(c) 確保有足夠的流動資金，以維持貨幣及金融穩定；及\n(d) 在符合 (a) 至 (c) 項的前提下，爭取達致有助保持基金長遠購買力的投資回報。\n\n這些目標充分考慮了外匯基金的法定目的，並已納入基金的投資組合結構及目標資產配置中。\n\n大致而言，外匯基金有兩大投資組合：支持投資組合及投資組合。支持投資組合持有高度流通的美元資產，以根據聯繫匯率制度的規定，為貨幣基礎提供十足支持。投資組合則主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債券及股票市場，以保持資產的價值及長遠購買力。兩大投資組合的整體長期目標債券與股票比例為 72:28。在目標貨幣配置方面，81% 的資產為美元及港元，其餘 19% 為其他貨幣。\n\n為更好地管理風險及優化中長期回報，金管局一直以審慎及循序漸進的方式，將外匯基金部分投資分散至更多元化的資產類別，包括新興市場及內地債券和股票、私募股權及海外物業投資等。新興市場及內地債券和股票歸入投資組合持有，而私募股權及房地產投資則歸入長期增長組合（LTGP）持有。金管局在 LTGP 下的投資，其淨資產值上限維持於外匯基金累積盈餘的三分之一。於 2015 年底，LTGP 下的投資市值總額為 14,210 億港元，其中私募股權為 9,130 億港元，房地產為 5,080 億港元，尚未履行的投資承諾金額為 12,240 億港元。\n\n策略性投資組合於 2007 年成立，目的是持有政府為外匯基金策略性目的而收購的香港交易所股份有限公司的股份。鑑於該投資組合的獨特性質，其表現不包括在外匯基金的投資表現評估內。\n\n# 儲備管理\n\n# 投資流程\n\n外匯基金的投資流程以兩種資產配置決定為基礎：策略性資產配置及戰術性資產配置。策略性資產配置反映於投資基準中，顯示出根據外匯基金的投資目標所達致的最佳長遠資產配置。在策略性配置的指引下，資產會以戰術性方式配置，以爭取達致超越基準的回報。這往往意味著實際配置與基準或策略性配置有所不同。實際配置與基準配置之間的差異稱為「戰術性偏離」。基準及戰術性偏離的限度由財政司司長與外咨會商定，而戰術性決定則由金管局在獲授權下作出。在容許的戰術性偏離限度內，投資組合經理可採取投資部署，以把握短期市場走勢。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n儲備管理部的同事直接管理外匯基金約 76% 的投資，包括整個支持投資組合及部分投資組合。這部分投資組合包括一系列投資於全球固定收益市場的投資組合，以及多項採用宏觀風險管理策略的衍生工具疊加組合，為基金進行風險管理。\n\n# 聘用外部經理\n\n除了內部管理資產外，金管局亦聘用位於多個國際金融中心的外部基金經理，管理外匯基金約 24% 的資產，包括所有上市股票投資組合及其他專業資產。委任外部經理的目的，是運用市場上最佳的專業投資技術，捕捉多元化的投資形式，並將市場知識及資訊轉移給內部專業人員。\n\n與聘用外部經理相關的開支包括基金管理費、托管費、交易費用、預扣稅及其他稅項，主要受市場因素影響，並可能每年有所波動。\n\n# 風險管理及合規\n\n近年金融市場波動劇烈，突顯了風險管理的重要性。金管局為內部及外部管理的投資組合制定了嚴格的監控措施及投資指引，並密切監察對指引及規定的遵守情況。金管局運用風險控制工具，在正常及不利市場情況下評估市場風險。此外，金管局亦進行詳盡的績效歸因分析，以充分運用內部及外部經理的投資技巧。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2015 年的金融市場\n\n2015 年全球金融市場波動劇烈，股票市場尤其動盪。主要股票市場在上半年創下新高，但市場氣氛在第三季急轉直下，因憂慮內地經濟增長放緩，主要股票市場回吐了自年初以來的升幅，並錄得顯著的季度虧損。其後，隨着市場氣氛改善，全球股票市場有所回升，但到年底又再度轉差。由於香港股票市場與內地經濟關係密切，2015 年的表現遜於其他主要股票市場。\n\n在主權債券市場方面，儘管預期美國利率將正常化及開始加息周期，但 2015 年美國長期國庫債券收益率僅錄得輕微上升，因為正面情緒受到全球經濟增長憂慮、持續的全球通縮壓力及地緣政治緊張局勢加劇所遏抑。另一方面，受歐洲央行大力推行貨幣寬鬆政策影響，短期歐洲政府債券收益率下跌，部分更跌至負數水平。\n\n在貨幣市場方面，2015 年美元繼續走強，美元指數上升近 10%，原因是預期美國政策利率將開始正常化。歐元在第一季顯著轉弱，錄得自 1999 年歐元面世以來最大單季跌幅，原因是歐洲央行在 1 月宣布量化寬鬆措施。另一方面，日圓在 2015 年對美元大致平穩。\n\n2015 年主要貨幣、債券及股票市場的表現載於表 1。\n\n# 儲備管理\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n在金融市場極度波動及投資環境艱鉅的情況下，外匯基金於 2015 年錄得投資虧損 158 億港元，其中包括海外股票收益 71 億港元、香港股票虧損 50 億港元、債券收益 159 億港元、非港元資產負面貨幣兌換影響 449 億港元，以及基金投資控股附屬公司所持其他投資收益 111 億港元。在美元去年急升的情況下，將外匯基金的非美元投資兌換成港元時出現負面貨幣兌換影響是無可避免的。另一方面，策略性投資組合錄得估值收益 22 億港元。\n\n外匯基金的資產總額於 2015 年底達 34,229 億港元。外匯基金（不包括策略性投資組合）於 2015 年的投資回報為負 0.6%。儘管如此，與表現較遜色的主要市場指數及整體投資基金社會比較，外匯基金的虧損可視為輕微。預期投資環境會進一步惡化，金管局過去幾年已採取一系列防禦措施，包括縮短債券投資組合的年期、增加現金持有量及大幅減少非美元資產。我們亦加快了投資多元化的步伐，尤其是透過 LTGP 下的投資。這些措施強化了外匯基金的抗風險能力，並有助減輕部分潛在虧損。\n\n基金由 1994 年至 2015 年的年度回報載於圖 1。表 2 顯示基金於 2015 年的投資回報，以及基金在不同時間跨度下的平均投資回報。過去三年的平均回報為 1.2%，過去五年為 1.8%，過去十年為 3.3%，而自 1994 年以來則為 5.0%。表 3 顯示基金於 2015 年 12 月 31 日的資產貨幣配置。\n\n圖 1 外匯基金的投資回報（1994 年至 2015 年）\n1

{"en":"# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communications with the community and the market through the media, public education programmes, and various other channels to facilitate understanding of its policies and operations. In 2015, the HKMA improved corporate governance by supporting professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline, enhancing IT security, and realigning duties among senior management to help cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new programmes and systems and the increasing complexity of work.\n\n# ENGAGING THE COMMUNITY CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT\n\n# Media relations\n\nThe HKMA works closely with the media to improve transparency and promote public understanding of its policies and work. In 2015, 59 open media events were held, comprising 14 news conferences, 14 stand-up interviews and 31 other public functions. A further 43 media interviews were arranged, 325 bilingual press releases were issued and a substantial number of media enquiries were handled daily.\n\nIn addition, to enhance public understanding of the HKMA's key functions, two media tours were organised to the Hong Kong Note Printing Limited and Hong Kong Interbank Clearing Limited (HKICL) respectively to showcase Hong Kong's world-class note printing technologies and financial infrastructure. Educational workshops were conducted on the Currency Board system, renminbi business and the Exchange Fund for a more in-depth briefing for the media on these important subjects.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan (centre), and Executive Director (Monetary Management), Mr Howard Lee (right), inspect security features on banknotes during a media visit to the Hong Kong Note Printing Limited.\n\nAn automated cheque sorting demonstration during a media tour to HKICL. In the middle of the photo (from left to right) are HKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan; Executive Director (Financial Infrastructure), Mr Esmond Lee; and HKICL Chief Executive Officer, Ms Haster Tang.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\n# Public enquiries\n\nThe Public Enquiry Service provides an effective means for people to obtain information from the HKMA, enabling them to get a greater understanding of the organisation's key functions. The Service handled 9,078 enquiries in 2015. About half of these related to banking policies and regulations, notes and coins, and consumer banking issues. Notable examples included prudential measures for property mortgage loans, banking products and services, prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing, and the coin collection programme.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received since 2012 and Chart 2 provides a breakdown by nature of the enquiries in 2015.\n\nChart 1 Total number of public enquiries\n\n# Publications\n\nApart from the HKMA Annual Report, the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report, 4 issues of the Quarterly Bulletin, and released regular updates of the Monthly Statistical Bulletin over the past year to provide up-to-date and thematic information and analyses on monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. In addition, senior management of the HKMA published 14 inSight articles covering various topical and timely policy issues.\n\nThe HKMA Annual Report 2014 received a Bronze award in the “non-profit Making and Charitable Organisations” category in the Hong Kong Management Association’s 2015 Best Annual Reports Awards.\n\n# The HKMA website\n\nThe HKMA corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk), with over 50,000 pages in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, is the public access gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It also contains the Register of Securities Staff of Authorized Institutions (AIs) and the Register of AIs and Local Representative Offices, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance. With the implementation of the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, the website will also contain the register of stored value facility licensees under the Ordinance. Dedicated webpage and eye-catching short-cut links have been provided to draw the public's attention to important and timely information on issues such as reminders on the need to remain vigilant against bogus phone calls and the location of the coin carts in the coin collection programme.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\n# Public education programme\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre on the 55th Floor of Two International Finance Centre is an important resource for introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters. The Centre consists of the Exhibition Area and the Library, and is open to the public six days a week. The Exhibition Area introduces the work of the HKMA and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong. It includes reading materials and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong's monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nGuided tours of the Information Centre are organised for visitors. During the year, the Centre received more than 48,300 visitors and hosted over 630 quided tours for schools and other groups (Chart 3). Over 530,400 people have visited the Information Centre since it opened in December 2003.\n\nThe Library, situated next to the Exhibition Area, houses more than 23,000 books, journals and other publications for the detailed study of Hong Kong's monetary, banking and financial affairs and central banking topics. It also maintains an electronic register of AIs in Hong Kong as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nIn its ongoing programme to reach out to the community, the HKMA continued to organise public education seminars. In 2015, three seminars were held for some 2,300 secondary school students and teachers. Topics included the Linked Exchange Rate System, banknotes in Hong Kong, the smart use of credit cards and the Deposit Protection Scheme. More than 54,700 people have participated in the programme since its launch in 1998.\n\nChart 3 Types of group visits to the Information Centre\n\nYoung visitors learn about the development of money and banking in Hong Kong during a guided tour of the Information Centre.\n\nSecondary school students and teachers participate in a public education seminar.\n\n# HUMAN RESOURCES\n\nThe HKMA recruits, develops and maintains a highly professional workforce to support its policy objectives and respond flexibly to changing work priorities. While the HKMA is an integral part of the Government, it is able to employ staff on terms different from those of the civil service to attract personnel with the right experience and expertise. As a public organisation, the HKMA aims to maintain a lean and flexible structure and to redeploy staff resources to undertake new initiatives and meet increased workload.\n\n# Organisational changes\n\nFollowing the enactment of the payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, a new Retail Payment Oversight Division was formed under the Monetary Management Department (MMD) in December 2015 to carry out the HKMA’s new statutory duties in the licensing and day-to-day supervision of stored value facilities and other retail payment systems. To enhance synergy amongst departments and reprioritise staff resources in coping with the challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives as well as increasing workload and complexity of work, reshuffling of duties among a number of departments was planned in 2015 for implementation in early 2016. Details are as follows:\n\nThe Financial Infrastructure Department (FID) took over the administration of the Deposit Protection Scheme and the settlement function from the Enforcement Department (ENFD) and the Currency Division from MMD. It also took over from the Banking Departments certain banking-related work such as consumer education, directors’ development and enhanced competency framework for bank practitioners;\n\nThe External Department took over the market development function of MMD, while the latter will continue with its work relating to the Treasury Markets Association and financial benchmarks; and\n\nENFD took over the Anti-Money laundering (AML) and Financial Crime Risk Division from the Banking Supervision Department, and was retitled as Enforcement and AML Department.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\n# Staffing\n\nThe establishment of the HKMA in 2015 was 841. This is increased by 34 to 875 in 2016 (an increase of 4%) to ensure that sufficient resources are provided to cope with (i) the implementation of new legislation and initiatives, (ii) continuation of pilot projects proven necessary on an on-going basis, and (ii) the increasing complexity and volume of existing work. The new posts are deployed to the following functions:\n\nEnhancing banking and financial stability, which includes:\n\nstrengthening banking supervision work including on-site examination of banks' stress testing process, implementation of international banking standards and peer review exercises;\n\nstrengthening the supervision of banks' liquidity risk and cyber security risk management;\n\nimplementing the supervisory framework regarding over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives conducted through banks and approved money brokers under the newly effective OTC derivatives reporting and record-keeping rules;\n\nstrengthening supervisory and enforcement efforts in anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing;\n\ngearing up the planning and preparatory work for the implementation of the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Bill, which applies international standards to address the \"too big to fail\" problem of the financial industry;\n\npromoting capacity building in the banking sector through the development of a director empowerment programme for independent non-executive directors of banks to further improve the governance of banks and collaboration with the industry to promote enhanced competency frameworks for banking practitioners engaged in core areas of banking operations;\n\nstepping up the banking conduct policy and research capability in new banking, securities and insurance products;\n\nenhancing consumer protection and consumer education efforts; and\n\nstepping up the monitoring and analysis of developments in the onshore renminbi market and in the CNH market with a view to supporting the orderly operation of Hong Kong’s offshore renminbi market.\n\nStrengthening investment, risk management and legal support to the expanding investment activities associated with the establishment of the Future Fund and further diversification of the Exchange Fund’s investment products, and enhancing strategic asset allocation and investment processes in the light of an increasingly challenging investment environment.\n\nImplementing the new statutory regime which empowers the HKMA to regulate stored value facilities and retail payment systems under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance.\n\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nTemporary resources are deployed to meet other work demands. The HKMA transfers staff on secondment to other international or local organisations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Services Development Council to assist in activities or policy initiatives in which Hong Kong or the HKMA has an interest. Some staff members are deployed on a full-time or part-time basis to provide operational support to the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board and the Treasury Markets Association.\n\n# Remuneration policies and pay review mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary (FS) determines the pay and conditions of service for HKMA staff on the advice of the Governance Sub-Committee (GSC) through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC), taking into account the prevailing market rates and practices. Remuneration comprises a total cash package and a provident fund scheme, with minimal benefits in kind. The cash package consists of monthly fixed pay (or basic pay) and variable pay, which may be awarded to individual staff members as a lump sum once a year depending on performance.\n\nPay for HKMA staff is reviewed annually by the FS in the light of recommendations made to him by the GSC through EFAC, taking into account the GSC's assessment of the performance of the HKMA in the preceding year, the pay-survey findings of the financial sector conducted by independent human resources consultants and any other relevant factors. Special pay adjustments may be made from time to time for individual meritorious staff to maintain their pay competitiveness.\n\nAny approved annual adjustments to the fixed pay or any variable pay awards for the HKMA are distributed to individual staff based on their performance. Investment professionals in the HKMA are subject to a variable pay system that seeks to strengthen the linkage between their investment performance and remuneration award. The pay adjustments or awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Executive Director or above are approved by the FS on the advice of the GSC. The staff members concerned are not present at the meetings when their pay is discussed. The pay adjustments or awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Division Head and below are determined by the Chief Executive of the HKMA under delegated authority from the FS and within the approved overall pay awards.\n","terms":{"reach":["達"],"promoting":["以助發展"],"introduced":["提交"],"work":["工作"],"weaker":["轉弱"],"stays":["處於"],"HK":["本港"],"’":["的"],"capitalised":["資本充裕"],"swings":["大幅上落"],"enhance":["優化"],"raise":["上調"],"142.1":["1,421"],"supporting":["推動"],"instituting":["嚴格控制"],"stepped":["加強"],"improved":["優化"],"various":["各種"],"announcement":["公布"],"realigning":["重整"],"amounting":["為"],"3,422.9":["34,229"],"october":["10

公司職能\n\n香港金融管理局透過媒體、公眾教育計畫及其他管道，與社會及市場保持有效溝通，以增進社會對該局政策及運作的了解。2015年，金管局透過支持員工的專業發展、實行嚴格的財務紀律、強化資訊科技安全，以及重新調整高層管理人員的職責，以應對推行新計畫及系統所帶來的挑戰和日益繁重的工作，進而優化公司治理。\n\n# 推動企業與社會的聯繫發展\n\n# 媒體關係\n\n金管局與媒體緊密合作，以提高透明度及促進公眾對該局政策及工作的了解。2015年，共舉辦了59場公開媒體活動，包括14場記者會、14場站立式訪問及31場其他公開活動。此外，還安排了43場媒體訪問，發出了325份雙語新聞稿，並每日處理大量媒體查詢。\n\n此外，為加深公眾對金管局主要職能的認識，該局分別舉辦了兩次媒體參訪活動，分別前往香港印鈔有限公司及香港銀行同業結算有限公司（HKICL），展示香港世界級的印鈔技術及金融基礎建設。該局亦就聯繫匯率制度、人民幣業務及外匯基金等重要議題舉辦教育工作坊，為媒體提供更深入的簡介。\n\n金管局總裁陳德霖先生（中）及執行董事（貨幣管理）李達志先生（右）在香港印鈔有限公司的媒體參訪活動中，檢查鈔票的防偽功能。\n\n在HKICL的媒體參訪活動中，進行了一次自動化支票分類演示。照片中間（由左至右）為金管局總裁陳德霖先生、執行董事（金融基礎建設）李子森先生及HKICL行政總裁鄧喜蓓女士。\n\n# 公司職能\n\n# 公眾查詢\n\n公眾查詢服務為民眾提供一個有效途徑，以取得金管局的資訊，進而加深對該局主要職能的認識。2015年，該服務共處理了9,078宗查詢，其中約一半與銀行政策及規章、紙幣及硬幣，以及消費者銀行服務事宜有關。顯著的例子包括不動產按揭貸款的審慎措施、銀行產品及服務、預防洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集，以及硬幣收集計畫。\n\n圖1顯示自2012年以來的公眾查詢件數，而圖2則按2015年查詢性質作出分類。\n\n圖1 公眾查詢總件數\n\n# 出版物\n\n除《金管局年報》外，金管局在過去一年發表了兩期《半年度貨幣及金融穩定報告》、四期《季刊》，並定期更新《每月統計報告》，提供有關香港貨幣、銀行及經濟議題的最新及專題資訊和分析。此外，金管局高層管理人員發表了14篇《inSight》文章，涵蓋各種熱門及及時的政策議題。\n\n金管局《2014年年報》在香港管理協會「2015年度最佳年報獎」中，獲頒「非營利及慈善團體」組別的銅獎。\n\n# 金管局網站\n\n金管局企業網站（www.hkma.gov.hk）以英文及繁簡體中文提供超過五萬頁的內容，是公眾獲取金管局最新資訊的入口。網站亦載有《認可機構證券業務從業人員登記冊》及《認可機構及本地代表處登記冊》，兩者均依據《銀行業條例》第20條規定而備存。隨著《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》的實施，網站亦將載有該條例下的儲值支付工具發牌人登記冊。網站設有專頁及醒目的快捷連結，以吸引公眾注意重要及及時的資訊，例如提醒民眾提防假冒來電，以及硬幣收集計畫中硬幣收集車的位置。\n\n# 公司職能\n\n# 公眾教育計畫\n\n金管局資訊中心位於國際金融中心二期55樓，是向社會介紹金管局工作及推廣貨幣及銀行知識的重要資源。中心設有展覽區及圖書館，每週六天開放予公眾。展覽區介紹金管局的工作及香港貨幣及銀行業的發展，並設有閱讀材料及展品，供民眾研究香港的貨幣、銀行及金融事務。\n\n資訊中心為訪客提供導覽服務。在過去一年，中心共接待了超過48,300名訪客，並為學校及其他團體舉辦了超過630場導覽活動（圖3）。自2003年12月啟用以來，資訊中心已接待超過530,400名訪客。\n\n圖書館位於展覽區旁，收藏超過23,000本書籍、期刊及其他出版物，供民眾詳細研究香港的貨幣、銀行及金融事務，以及中央銀行議題。圖書館亦依據《銀行業條例》第20條規定，備存香港認可機構的電子登記冊。\n\n金管局持續推行社區外展計畫，繼續舉辦公眾教育講座。2015年，該局為約2,300名中學師生舉辦了三場講座，主題包括聯繫匯率制度、香港紙幣、智慧使用信用卡及存款保障計畫。自1998年推出以來，該計畫已吸引超過54,700人參與。\n\n圖3 資訊中心團體參訪的種類\n\n年輕訪客在資訊中心的導覽活動中，了解香港貨幣及銀行業的發展。\n\n中學師生參與公眾教育講座。\n\n# 人力資源\n\n金管局招聘、培育及保留一支高度專業的工作團隊，以支持其政策目標，並靈活應對不斷變化的工作優先順序。雖然金管局是政府的一部分，但它能夠以與公務員制度不同的條款聘用員工，以吸引具備相關經驗及專業知識的人才。作為一間公共機構，金管局致力維持精簡及靈活的架構，並調配人力資源以推行新措施及應付日益增加的工作量。\n\n# 組織架構變動\n\n隨著《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》的實施，貨幣管理部於2015年12月成立了一個新的零售支付監管處，以履行金管局在發牌及日常監管儲值支付工具及其他零售支付系統方面的新法定職責。為強化部門之間的協同效應，以及重新調配人力資源以應付推行新措施所帶來的挑戰，以及日益增加的工作量及工作複雜性，金管局於2015年計畫重整多個部門的職責，並於2016年初實施。詳情如下：\n\n金融基礎建設部接管了存款保障計畫及結算職能（由執法部轉交）及貨幣處（由貨幣管理部轉交）的行政工作。該部亦從銀行部門接管了若干與銀行業相關的職能，例如消費者教育、董事發展及強化銀行從業人員的專業能力框架；\n\n對外事務部接管了貨幣管理部的市場發展職能，而後者則繼續進行與財庫市場公會及金融基準有關的工作；及\n\n執法部接管了銀行監理部的反洗錢及金融犯罪風險處，並更名為執法及反洗錢部。\n\n# 公司職能\n\n# 人力編制\n\n金管局2015年的編制為841人。2016年，編制增加34人至875人（增幅4%），以確保有足夠資源應付（一）新法例及措施的實施，（二）持續推行經證明為必要的先導計畫，以及（三）現有工作日益增加的複雜性和工作量。新增職位將調配至以下職能：\n\n強化銀行及金融穩定性，包括：\n\n加強銀行監管工作，包括銀行壓力測試程序的現場檢查、國際銀行標準的實施及同業評審活動；\n\n強化對銀行流動性風險及網路安全風險管理的監管；\n\n依據新生效的場外衍生工具報告及記錄保存規則，落實監管透過銀行及獲批准的貨幣經紀商進行的場外衍生工具的監管框架；\n\n強化反洗錢及反恐怖分子資金籌集的監管及執法工作；\n\n為《金融機構（決議）條例》的實施進行規劃及準備工作，該條例適用國際標準以解決金融業「大到不能倒」的問題；\n\n透過為銀行的獨立非執行董事制定董事賦權計畫，促進銀行業的能力建構，以進一步改善銀行治理，並與業界合作，促進強化銀行從業人員在銀行業務核心領域的專業能力框架；\n\n強化新銀行、證券及保險產品的銀行操守政策及研究能力；\n\n強化消費者保障及消費者教育工作；及\n\n強化監控及分析在岸人民幣市場及CNH市場的發展，以支持香港離岸人民幣市場的有序運作。\n\n強化與成立未來基金及進一步多元化外匯基金投資產品相關的投資活動的投資、風險管理及法律支援，並鑑於投資環境日益嚴峻，優化策略性資產配置及投資流程。\n\n落實新的法定制度，賦權金管局依據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》監管儲值支付工具及零售支付系統。\n\n# 公司職能\n\n為應付其他工作需求，金管局調配臨時人力。金管局將員工借調至其他國際或本地組織，例如國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）及金融服務發展局，以協助進行香港或金管局有興趣的活動或政策措施。部分員工以全職或兼職形式，為香港存款保障委員會及財庫市場公會提供運作支援。\n\n# 薪酬政策及薪酬檢討機制\n\n財政司司長依據管治委員會的建議，透過外匯基金諮詢委員會，並考慮現行市場薪酬水平及慣例，釐定金管局員工的薪酬及服務條件。薪酬包括總現金報酬及公積金計畫，並提供少量實物福利。現金報酬包括每月固定薪金（或基本薪金）及浮動薪金，浮動薪金可按表現以一次性形式每年發放予個別員工。\n\n金管局員工的薪酬由財政司司長每年依據管治委員會透過外匯基金諮詢委員會提出的建議進行檢討，並考慮管治委員會對金管局上年度表現的評估、由獨立人力資源顧問進行的金融界薪酬調查結果，以及其他相關因素。為維持薪酬競爭力，金管局可不時為表現優異的個別員工作出特別薪酬調整。\n\n金管局任何經批准的固定薪金年度調整或浮動薪金獎勵，均會依據員工表現發放予個別員工。金管局的投資專業人員受浮動薪金制度規限，該制度旨在強化投資表現與薪酬獎勵之間的關連。執行董事或以上職級的個別員工的薪酬調整或獎勵，由財政司司長依據管治委員會的建議批准。有關員工不會出席討論其薪酬的會議。部門主管或以下職級的個別員工的薪酬調整或獎勵，由金管局總裁依據財政司司長授予的權力，在經批准的整體薪酬獎勵範圍內釐定。"}

{"en":"# The Exchange Fund\n\nReport of the Director of Audit \nExchange Fund Financial Statements\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit\n\n# Audit Commission \n# The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region\n\n# Independent Audit Report\n\n# To the Financial Secretary\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (\"the Group\") set out on pages 134 to 222, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2015, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.\n\n# Monetary Authority’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66) and Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\n# Auditor’s Responsibility\n\nMy responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on my audit. I conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards. Those standards require that I comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.\n\nAn audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the Monetary Authority, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.\n\nI believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit (continued)\n\n# Opinion\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2015, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance.\n\nDavid Sun \nDirector of Audit\n\n7 April 2016\n\nAudit Commission \n26th Floor \nImmigration Tower \n7 Gloucester Road \nWanchai, Hong Kong\n\n# Contents\n\nINCOME AND EXPENDITURE ACCOUNT\nSTATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nBALANCE SHEET\nATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY\nATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:\n\n1.

The principal activities of the Fund are safeguarding the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong and maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong's monetary and financial systems.\n\nThe assets of the Fund are managed as four portfolios: the Backing Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio and the Strategic Portolio. The assets of the Backing Portolio fully match the Monetary Base, under Hong Kong's Currency Board system. The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The Long-Term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments. The Strategic Portfolio holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited acquired by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) for the account of the Fund for strategic purposes. Operating segment information is set out in note 31.\n\n# 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n# 2.1 Statement of compliance\n\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with all applicable Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRSs), which is a collective term that includes all applicable individual Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, Hong Kong Accounting Standards (HKASs) and Interpretations issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), and accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong. A summary of the significant accounting policies adopted by the Fund and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) is set out below.\n\nThe HKICPA has issued certain new and revised HKFRSs that are first effective or available for early adoption for the current accounting period. Note 3 provides information on the changes, if any, in accounting policies resulting from initial adoption of these developments to the extent that they are relevant to the Group for the current and prior accounting periods reflected in these financial statements.\n\n# Exchange Fund – Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)\n\n(Amounts expressed in millions of Hong Kong dollars, unless otherwise stated.)\n\n# 2.2 Basis of preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe Group financial statements include the financial statements of the Group as well as the Group's interests in associates and joint ventures. The principal activities of the principal subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are shown in notes 16 and 17.\n\nThe measurement basis used in the preparation of the financial statements is historical cost except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair values as explained in the accounting policies set out below:\n\ntrading financial instruments (note 2.6.2.1);\nfinancial assets and financial liabilities designated at fair value (note 2.6.2.2); available-for-sale securities (note 2.6.2.5);\ngold (note 2.11); and\ninvestment properties (note 2.12).\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with HKFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nNote 18 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of investment properties. Note 37 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of financial instruments. There are no critical accounting judgements involved in the application of the Group's accounting policies except for the valuation of certain financial instruments as set out in note 2.5.\n\n# 2.3 Subsidiaries and non-controlling interests\n\nA subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. When assessing whether the Group has power, only substantive rights (held by the Group and other parties) are considered.\n\n# Exchange Fund – Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)\n\n(Amounts expressed in millions of Hong Kong dollars, unless otherwise stated.)\n\nAn investment in a subsidiary is consolidated into the Group financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.\n\nIntra-group balances, transactions and cash flows and any unrealised profits and losses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in full in preparing the Group financial statements.\n\nNon-controlling interests represent the equity in a subsidiary not attributable directly or indirectly to the Fund, and in respect of which the Group has not agreed any additional terms with the holders of those interests which would result in the Group as a whole having a contractual obligation in respect of those interests that meets the definition of a financial liability. Non-controlling interests are presented in the Group balance sheet within equity, separately from equity attributable to the owner of the Fund. Non-controlling interests in the results of the Group are presented on the face of the Group income and expenditure account and the Group statement of comprehensive income as an allocation of the surplus or deficit and total comprehensive income or loss for the year between non-controlling interests and the owner of the Fund.\n\nIn the balance sheet of the Fund, its investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less impairment losses, if any (note 2.14).\n\n# 2.4 Associates and joint ventures\n\nAn associate is an entity in which the Group has significant influence, but not control or joint control, over its management, through its power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions.\n","terms":{"reach":["達"],"promoting":["以助發展"],"introduced":["提交"],"work":["工作"],"weaker":["轉弱"],"stays":["處於"],"HK":["本港"],"’":["的"],"capitalised":["資本充裕"],"swings":["大幅上落"],"enhance":["優化"],"raise":["上調"],"142.1":["1,421"],"supporting":["推動"],"instituting":["嚴格控制"],"stepped":["加強"],"improved":["優化"],"various":["各種"],"announcement":["公布"],"realigning":["重整"],"amounting":["為"],"3,422.9":["34,229"],"october":["10

外匯基金\n\n審計署署長的報告\n外匯基金財務報表\n\n# 審計署署長的報告\n\n# 審計委員會\n# 香港特別行政區政府\n\n# 獨立審計報告\n\n# 致財政司司長：\n\n我已審核了外匯基金及其附屬公司（簡稱「該集團」）的財務報表，該報表載於第134至222頁，包括外匯基金及該集團截至2015年12月31日的資產負債表，以及該年度的收支帳目、全面收益表、權益變動表和現金流量表，另加重要會計政策概要及其他解釋性資料。\n\n# 金融管理局對財務報表的責任\n\n金融管理局負責按照行政長官根據《外匯基金條例》（第66章）第7條發出的指示及《香港財務報告準則》編製財務報表，以真實及公平地反映情況，並負責制定金融管理局認為必要的內部監控措施，使所編製的財務報表不會出現因欺詐或失誤而導致的重大錯報。\n\n# 審計師的責任\n\n我的責任是根據我的審核結果，對這些財務報表發表意見。我按照行政長官根據《外匯基金條例》第7條發出的指示及審計委員會的審計準則進行審核。這些準則要求我遵守道德規範，並策劃及進行審核，以取得合理的保證，確定財務報表是否沒有重大錯報。\n\n審核工作包括執行程序，以取得有關財務報表內數額及披露事項的審計證據。所選取的程序是根據審計師的判斷而定，包括評估財務報表因欺詐或失誤而出現重大錯報的風險。在進行這些風險評估時，審計師考慮與該實體編製真實及公平的財務報表相關的內部監控，以設計符合當時情況的審計程序，但並非為對該實體內部監控的成效發表意見。審核工作亦包括評估所採用的會計政策是否適當，金融管理局作出的會計估計是否合理，以及評估財務報表的整體呈報方式。\n\n我相信我所取得的審計證據充足及適當，為我發表審計意見提供了基礎。\n\n# 審計署署長的報告（續）\n\n# 意見\n\n我認為，該財務報表按照《香港財務報告準則》，真實及公平地反映了外匯基金及該集團截至2015年12月31日的財務狀況，以及該年度的財務表現和現金流量，並已按照行政長官根據《外匯基金條例》第7條發出的指示妥為編製。\n\n戴維遜\n審計署署長\n\n2016年4月7日\n\n審計委員會\n26樓\n入境事務大樓\n香港灣仔告士打道7號\n\n#

財務報表附註\n\n（除另有說明外，金額均以百萬港元列示。）\n\n# 1 主要業務\n\n金融管理局根據財政司司長作為外匯基金（簡稱「基金」）管理人的授權，按照《外匯基金條例》（第66章）的規定管理基金。基金的主要業務是保障香港貨幣的匯率穩定，以及維持香港貨幣及金融制度的穩健和健全。\n\n基金的資產分為四個投資組合管理：支持組合、投資組合、長期增長組合及策略組合。根據香港的貨幣發行局制度，支持組合的資產與貨幣基礎完全匹配。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債券及股票市場。長期增長組合持有私募股權及房地產投資。策略組合持有香港交易所股份有限公司的股份，該等股份由香港特別行政區（香港特區）政府為基金的策略性目的而收購。營運分部資料載於附註31。\n\n# 2 重要會計政策\n\n# 2.1 合規聲明\n\n這些財務報表已按照所有適用的《香港財務報告準則》編製，該術語包括所有適用的個別《香港財務報告準則》、《香港會計準則》及香港會計師公會頒佈的詮釋，以及香港普遍接受的會計原則。基金及其附屬公司（統稱「該集團」）所採納的重要會計政策概要載列如下。\n\n香港會計師公會已頒佈若干新的及經修訂的香港財務報告準則，這些準則首次生效或可供提早採用於本會計期間。附註3載列有關因首次採用這些發展而對會計政策作出的變動（如有）的資料，但以與該集團在本財務報表所反映的本會計期間及先前會計期間相關的範圍為限。\n\n# 外匯基金 – 財務報表附註（續）\n\n（除另有說明外，金額均以百萬港元列示。）\n\n# 2.2 編製財務報表的基準\n\n集團財務報表包括集團的財務報表以及集團於聯營公司及合營企業的權益。主要附屬公司、聯營公司及合營企業的主要業務載於附註16及17。\n\n編製財務報表所採用的計量基準為歷史成本，但下列資產及負債則按其公允價值列示，詳情見下文所載的會計政策：\n\n交易性金融工具（附註2.6.2.1）；\n按公允價值計量的金融資產及金融負債（附註2.6.2.2）；可供出售證券（附註2.6.2.5）；\n黃金（附註2.11）；及\n投資物業（附註2.12）。\n\n按照香港財務報告準則編製財務報表，要求管理層作出判斷、估計及假設，以影響政策的適用及所列報的資產、負債、收入及支出金額。估計及相關假設是基於經驗及其他因素，而這些因素在當時情況下被認為是合理的，其結果構成就資產及負債的賬面金額作出判斷的基礎，而這些賬面金額從其他來源並不易於取得。實際結果可能與這些估計有所不同。\n\n估計及基本假設是持續受到檢討的。對會計估計的修訂，於修訂估計的期間內確認，若修訂只影響該期間，或於修訂期間及未來期間確認，若修訂同時影響當前期間及未來期間。\n\n附註18載列有關投資物業公允價值估計的假設資料。附註37載列有關金融工具公允價值估計的假設資料。除附註2.5所述若干金融工具的估值外，在應用集團的會計政策時並無涉及任何重大會計判斷。\n\n# 2.3 附屬公司及非控制性權益\n\n附屬公司是指受集團控制的實體。集團控制一實體，若因與該實體之關聯而承受或享有浮動回報，且有能力利用對該實體之權力影響該等回報。在評估集團是否擁有權力時，只考慮集團及其他方所持有的實質性權利。\n\n# 外匯基金 – 財務報表附註（續）\n\n（除另有說明外，金額均以百萬港元列示。）\n\n對附屬公司的投資自集團取得控制權之日起至失去控制權之日止，併入集團財務報表。\n\n集團內部的餘額、交易及現金流量，以及集團內部交易產生的任何未實現利潤或虧損，在編製集團財務報表時均被完全抵銷。\n\n非控制性權益指於附屬公司的權益中，並非直接或間接歸屬於基金的部分，且集團並未與該等權益的持有人協議任何額外條款，致使集團整體就該等權益負有符合金融負債定義的合約責任。非控制性權益於集團資產負債表中於權益項下呈報，與歸屬於基金持有人的權益分開列示。非控制性權益於集團的收益及支出帳目及集團全面收益表中呈報為集團年度盈餘或虧損及全面收益或虧損總額在非控制性權益與基金持有人之間的分配。\n\n在基金的資產負債表中，其於附屬公司的投資按成本列示，減去任何減值虧損（附註2.14）。\n\n# 2.4 聯營公司及合營企業\n\n聯營公司是指集團於其管理層具有重大影響力但非控制或共同控制權的實體，此種影響力是透過集團參與該實體之財務及經營政策決定的權力而產生。"}

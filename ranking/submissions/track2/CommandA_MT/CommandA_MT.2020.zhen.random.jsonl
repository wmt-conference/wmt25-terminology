{"zh":"# 總裁報告\n\n2020年可謂是超乎想像的一年。\n\n新冠病毒疫情肆虐全球，令人措手不及，世界各地的經濟活動幾乎陷於停頓。在疫情的打擊下，香港經濟繼2019年後連續第二年收縮，本地生產總值錄得有紀錄以來的最大跌幅。失業率飆升至16年高位，部分行業尤其受到重創。\n\n然而，困境往往是展現我們實力的時候。儘管面對重重挑戰，香港的貨幣及銀行體系再次成功抵禦衝擊。這一切絕非偶然，而是我們多年來一直奉行審慎政策的成果。\n\n復甦前路難望平坦。即使各地央行及政府都全力支持經濟，但前景仍充滿不確定性，包括央行的貨幣政策立場、疫苗接種計劃的進展，以及長期低息環境的潛在影響。另一方面，地緣政治緊張局勢變化不斷，令宏觀形勢更添變數。\n\n縱使面對如此不明朗的形勢，金管局會繼續緊守崗位，維持貨幣及金融穩定，締造有利經濟復甦的環境。與此同時，在不斷演變的銀行及金融業大環境下，我們亦會致力把握機會，提升香港作為全球金融樞紐的競爭力。\n\n# 貨幣及金融穩定：堅穩如昔\n\n聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）在2020年繼續暢順有序地運作。聯匯制度自1983年實施至今，渡過一次又一次的難關，充分展現出抵禦衝擊的能力。儘管面對疫情及波動的宏觀經濟環境，年內港元匯率一直保持平穩。強方兌換保證合共被觸發85次，累計資金流入約3,835億港元。\n\n聯匯制度得以維持穩健，全賴多年來所建立的穩固根基。正如國際貨幣基金組織在其《2020年對外部門報告》中的總結指出，聯匯制度的公信力建基於具高透明度的運作規則、充裕的財政及外匯儲備、穩健的金融監管、靈活的經濟及審慎的財政制度。同時，金管局透過與業界緊密聯繫，以及透過傳統及社交媒體與公眾有效溝通，迅速澄清謠言，並適時提供有關事實與數據的最新資訊。金管局亦利用最新的科技與數據分析技術，繼續提升監察能力，以靈活應對最新市況及新出現的風險。\n\n雖然疫情對經濟造成沉重壓力，但銀行體系維持穩健，資本及流動資金充裕。於2020年底，本地銀行的資本充足比率為20.7%，遠高於國際最低要求的8%。大型銀行的平均流動性覆蓋比率亦遠高於法定最低要求的100%，於2020年第4季達到155.1%。受疫情影響，銀行的資產質素略為轉差，特定分類貸款比率於2020年底上升至0.9%，但仍屬穩健並遠低於自2000年以來的長期平均水平1.8%。\n\n# 銀行體系：經濟命脈\n\n銀行體系在經濟與社會中扮演重要的金融中介角色。年內金管局一方面繼續重點監管銀行的信用及流動性風險，另一方面亦密切留意疫情對銀行營運的影響，並採取多項措施，確保銀行體系能繼續提供基本服務，以及提供貸款支持經濟。金管局在3月下調逆周期緩衝資本比率100基點至1%，又在4月調低監管儲備水平。這些措施為銀行體系合共釋放約1萬億港元的借貸空間。\n\n我們深知中小企在當前的經濟環境下或會面對資金周轉壓力。因此，金管局聯同我們在2019年成立的銀行業中小企貸款協調機制推出多輪紓困措施，包括「預先批核還息不還本」計劃，將合資格企業的所有貸款本金還款延期6個月。截至2020年底，銀行共批出超過58,000宗貸款展期及其他支援措施的個案，涉資超過7,400億港元。鑑於疫情反覆，金管局因應情況將「預先批核還息不還本」計劃展期，並於2021年3月將計劃延長至2021年10月底。香港按揭證券有限公司亦在其中小企融資擔保計劃下推出「百分百擔保特惠貸款」，以紓緩中小企支付僱員薪金及租金的負擔。截至2020年底，共批出超過25,000宗申請，涉資約400億港元。該計劃在2021年第1季作出優化，申請期限亦延長至2021年12月31日。年內銀行亦批出超過28,000宗紓困措施申請，協助個人客戶的資金周轉，涉資440億港元。銀行業同心協力，支持企業及個人客戶，共渡時艱，實在令人鼓舞。\n\n與此同時，金管局繼續推動銀行業加強普及金融與實踐「以客為本」的文化。我們進一步鼓勵銀行格外留意有需要的客戶，並與銀行分享多方面的良好做法，包括為智障人士提供銀行服務，以及提供更多無障礙及方便易用的銀行服務。\n\n隨着科技長足發展，銀行業的經營環境亦急速轉變。因此，金管局的工作不僅限於應對當前的挑戰，亦要放眼未來，擴大人才庫，以配合銀行業的日後發展。我們與香港銀行公會及香港銀行學會聯合展開「提升未來銀行業人才的專業能力」研究計劃，評估銀行業未來幾年的潛在人才缺口，並為銀行規劃清晰的路線圖，以期未雨綢繆，改善人才供應的情況。我們又推出「銀行業人才起動計劃」，為本地大學的應屆畢業生提供為期6個月的實習機會及銀行業相關的特定培訓，藉以為業界培育人才。在本港勞工市場的嚴峻時期推出此計劃，亦正好為有志加入銀行業的年青人提供機會。\n\n# 國際金融中心地位：無懼挑戰\n\n為履行金管局其中一項重要職責，協助鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位，我們的未來規劃涵蓋銀行體系以至整個金融體系，旨在讓香港在不斷演變的金融環境中能夠保持作為國際金融中心的競爭力。在疫情期間，我們仍然穩步推進這些工作，並在幾個重點範疇積極開拓新機遇，以充分把握新趨勢及轉變的契機。\n\n# 推動綠色金融，締造更可持續的未來\n\n第一個範疇是推動綠色及可持續金融。自2019年5月推出分三階段進行的措施以來，相關工作已取得理想進展。我們在2020年完成對47間銀行的「綠色基準」評估，發表白皮書及發出通告，就銀行管理氣候風險提供指引及分享經驗。我們亦全力推進第二階段的工作，制定銀行業管理氣候風險的監管架構。此外，我們會致力在2025年或之前按照氣候相關財務披露工作小組的建議，要求銀行就氣候相關資料作出披露。這將使香港成為亞洲區內首個作出相關具體要求的地區。\n\n金管局作為全球最大的儲備管理人之一，我們積極將環境、社會及管治(ESG)因素納入甄選、委任及監察外聘投資經理的程序。我們亦身體力行作出ESG投資，包括投資於綠色、社會及可持續債券和低碳項目。\n\n為進一步發展香港的綠色金融生態圈，金管局一直協助政府發行綠色債券，而最近發行的第二批政府綠色債券更大受國際投資者歡迎。乘着這個發展趨勢，財政司司長在《2021至22年度財政預算案》中宣布政府會擴大「政府綠色債券計劃」的規模，將借款上限提升一倍至2,000億港元，並會增加日後發行的綠色債券的種類與發行渠道。\n\n為鞏固香港作為區內綠色及可持續金融樞紐，我們整體策略的其中一環，是與本地其他監管機構及國際社會合作，推進綠色金融議程。在本地方面，金管局聯同其他監管機構成立綠色和可持續金融跨機構督導小組，協調金融業的相關措施。該小組已經制定策略性計劃，促進香港的綠色及可持續金融的發展。在國際方面，金管局應國際金融公司的邀請，成為亞洲區域創始成員及首個區域執行理事，與其合力推動「綠色商業銀行聯盟」。聯盟旨在於全球金融市場推動綠色銀行業，並由亞洲開始，逐步擴展至其他地區。\n\n我們期望上述工作有助減低金融業面對的氣候風險，以及促進本港銀行發揮優勢，滿足區內綠色投資的龐大資金需求。\n\n# 金融科技方便市民，裨益經濟\n\n推動金融業增長的另一個主要引擎是金融科技，而在新冠病毒疫情下，這方面的步伐更見加速。\n\n過去一年清楚顯示，金融科技能夠擴展我們的「工具箱」，以應對突如其來的衝擊。面對新冠病毒疫情，電子支付渠道發揮了前所未見的作用。自2018年9月推出快速支付系統「轉數快」至2020年底期間，「轉數快」已錄得690萬個登記賬戶。即使在社交距離措施的限制下，公眾仍能利用「轉數快」這個安全快捷及穩妥的方式收付及轉撥資金，令「轉數快」的平均每日交易量在2020年急增2.3倍。我們亦一直與政府合作，將「轉數快」的應用範圍擴大至繳付更多種政府及公共服務帳單。\n\n此外，金融科技亦有助銀行提供更多元化及便利的銀行客戶服務。獲金管局發牌的所有8間虛擬銀行年內已經全數在香港開業。截至2020年底，在虛擬銀行開設的帳戶共有420,000個，總計客戶存款150億港元。其中部分虛擬銀行已經率先使用新類型數據進行信貸評估，以開拓新的客戶群及促進普及金融。金管局繼續推動在香港發展更具規模及更多元化的合規科技生態圈，作為「銀行易」措施的一部分，從而精簡監管規定，提升客戶體驗。除透過刊發通訊系列，以提高業界對合規科技應用的認知外，金管局亦發表白皮書，載述加快銀行業採用合規科技的兩年計劃。另外，金管局又展開「商業數據通」項目，以便中小企利用自身的數碼足跡更便捷地獲取銀行融資。\n\n金融科技面貌日新月異，科技應用亦日趨普及，金管局需繼續秉持嚴謹的監管。為此，我們推出「網絡防衛計劃2.0」，以提高銀行的網絡防衛能力。我們亦加強對科技風險管理的現場審查，並制定監管框架，評估運用創新信用風險評估方法的個人貸款產品的信用風險。金管局亦展開監管科技應用的三年計劃，以提升監管流程的成效及前瞻性。我們現正進行的有關工作包括更有效地利用數據及科技來加強反洗錢方面的監管。\n","terms":{"月":["month"],"暢順":["smooth"],"前":["ahead"],"幣作":["currency"],"銀行":["bank","banking","banks","bank(s)","banking

COVID-19 pandemic caught the world off guard, bringing economic activity around the globe to a near standstill. Under the impact of the pandemic, Hong Kong’s economy contracted for the second consecutive year after 2019, with gross domestic product recording its largest decline on record. The unemployment rate soared to a 16-year high, with some sectors being particularly hard hit.\n\nHowever, adversity often presents an opportunity to demonstrate our strength. Despite the challenges, Hong Kong’s monetary and banking systems have once again successfully withstood the shocks. This is by no means a coincidence, but a result of our adherence to prudent policies over the years.\n\nThe road to recovery is unlikely to be smooth. Even though central banks and governments around the world have gone to great lengths to support the economy, the outlook remains highly uncertain, including the monetary policy stance of central banks, the progress of vaccination programmes, and the potential impact of a prolonged low interest rate environment. On the other hand, geopolitical tensions continue to evolve, adding more uncertainties to the macroeconomic situation.\n\nDespite such an uncertain outlook, the HKMA will continue to stand firm, maintain monetary and financial stability, and create a conducive environment for economic recovery. At the same time, in the face of an evolving banking and financial landscape, we will strive to seize opportunities to enhance Hong Kong’s competitiveness as a global financial hub.\n\n# Monetary and financial stability: as solid as ever\n\nThe Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) continued to operate smoothly and in an orderly manner in 2020. Since its introduction in 1983, the LERS has weathered numerous challenges, demonstrating its resilience to shocks. Despite the pandemic and a volatile macroeconomic environment, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained stable throughout the year. The strong-side Convertibility Undertakings were triggered 85 times in total, resulting in aggregate inflows of about HK$383.5 billion.\n\nThe robustness of the LERS is underpinned by the solid foundation built over the years. As summarised by the International Monetary Fund in its 2020 External Sector Report, the credibility of the LERS is based on its highly transparent operating rules, ample fiscal and foreign exchange reserves, robust financial supervision, a flexible economy and a prudent fiscal regime. At the same time, the HKMA maintains close contact with the industry and communicates effectively with the public through traditional and social media to quickly dispel rumours and provide timely updates on facts and data. The HKMA also continues to enhance its monitoring capabilities by leveraging the latest technology and data analytics to respond flexibly to the latest market conditions and emerging risks.\n\nAlthough the pandemic has put significant pressure on the economy, the banking system remains robust, with ample capital and liquidity. At the end of 2020, the capital adequacy ratio of local banks was 20.7%, well above the international minimum requirement of 8%. The average liquidity coverage ratio of large banks also far exceeded the statutory minimum requirement of 100%, reaching 155.1% in the fourth quarter of 2020. Affected by the pandemic, banks’ asset quality deteriorated slightly, with the ratio of classified loans rising to 0.9% at the end of 2020, but this remains healthy and well below the long-term average of 1.8% since 2000.\n\n# Banking system: the lifeblood of the economy\n\nThe banking system plays an important role as a financial intermediary in the economy and society. During the year, the HKMA continued to focus on supervising banks’ credit and liquidity risks, while closely monitoring the impact of the pandemic on banks’ operations. It also took a number of measures to ensure that the banking system could continue to provide basic services and loans to support the economy. In March, the HKMA lowered the countercyclical capital buffer ratio by 100 basis points to 1%, and in April it lowered the regulatory reserve requirement. These measures released about HK$1 trillion of lending capacity for the banking system as a whole.\n\nWe are well aware that SMEs may face funding pressures in the current economic environment. Therefore, the HKMA, together with the banking sector SME loan coordination mechanism established in 2019, launched several rounds of relief measures, including a ‘pre-approved principal payment holiday’ scheme, which deferred all principal repayments of eligible enterprises’ loans for six months. By the end of 2020, banks had approved over 58,000 cases of loan extensions and other support measures, involving over HK$740 billion. In view of the recurring pandemic, the HKMA extended the ‘pre-approved principal payment holiday’ scheme in response to the situation, and in March 2021 further extended the scheme until the end of October 2021. The Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation Limited also launched a ‘100% Guaranteed Special Loan’ under its SME Financing Guarantee Scheme to alleviate the burden of SMEs in paying employees’ salaries and rents. By the end of 2020, over 25,000 applications had been approved, involving about HK$40 billion. The scheme was enhanced in the first quarter of 2021, and the application period was extended to 31 December 2021. During the year, banks also approved over 28,000 applications for relief measures to help individual customers with their cash flow, involving HK$44 billion. It is encouraging that the banking sector has come together to support corporate and individual customers in weathering the difficulties.\n\nAt the same time, the HKMA continues to promote financial inclusion and a customer-centric culture in the banking sector. We further encourage banks to pay special attention to customers in need, and share good practices with banks in various areas, including banking services for people with intellectual disabilities, and more barrier-free and user-friendly banking services.\n\nAs technology advances rapidly, the operating environment of the banking sector is also changing rapidly. Therefore, the HKMA’s work is not limited to addressing current challenges, but also to looking ahead and expanding the talent pool to meet the future development of the banking sector. We have jointly launched a research project with the Hong Kong Association of Banks and the Hong Kong Institute of Bankers to ‘Enhance the Professional Competencies of Future Banking Talent’, which assesses the potential talent gap in the banking sector over the next few years and develops a clear roadmap for banks to improve the talent supply situation in a forward-looking manner. We have also launched the ‘Banking Talent Programme’, which provides local university graduates with a six-month internship opportunity and specific training related to the banking sector, with a view to nurturing talent for the industry. The launch of this programme during a challenging period in Hong Kong’s labour market also provides an opportunity for young people who aspire to join the banking sector.\n\n# International financial centre status: undaunted by challenges\n\nTo fulfil one of the HKMA’s important responsibilities, which is to help consolidate Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre, our future plans cover the banking system and the financial system as a whole, with the aim of enabling Hong Kong to maintain its competitiveness as an international financial centre in an evolving financial environment. During the pandemic, we have continued to steadily advance this work and actively explore new opportunities in several key areas to fully capture the opportunities presented by new trends and changes.\n\n# Promoting green finance to create a more sustainable future\n\nThe first area is the promotion of green and sustainable finance. Since the launch of the three-phase measures in May 2019, good progress has been made. In 2020, we completed the ‘green baseline’ assessment of 47 banks, published a white paper and issued a circular to provide guidance and share experience on banks’ management of climate risks. We are also pressing ahead with the second phase of work to develop a regulatory framework for banks’ management of climate risks. In addition, we will strive to require banks to disclose climate-related information in accordance with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures by 2025 or earlier. This will make Hong Kong the first jurisdiction in Asia to make such specific requirements.\n\nAs one of the world’s largest reserve managers, the HKMA actively incorporates environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into the process of selecting, appointing and monitoring external investment managers. We also practise ESG investment ourselves, including investing in green, social and sustainability bonds and low-carbon projects.\n\nTo further develop Hong Kong’s green finance ecosystem, the HKMA has been assisting the Government in issuing green bonds, and the second batch of government green bonds issued recently was well received by international investors. Building on this trend, the Financial Secretary announced in the 2021-22 Budget that the Government would expand the scale of the Government Green Bond Programme by doubling the borrowing ceiling to HK$200 billion and increasing the diversity and issuance channels of green bonds in the future.\n\nAs part of our overall strategy to consolidate Hong Kong’s position as a regional green and sustainable finance hub, we are working with other local regulators and the international community to advance the green finance agenda. Locally, the HKMA has joined forces with other regulators to establish a cross-agency steering group on green and sustainable finance to coordinate related measures in the financial sector. The group has already developed a strategic plan to promote the development of green and sustainable finance in Hong Kong. Internationally, the HKMA has been invited by the International Finance Corporation to become a founding member of the Asia region and its first regional executive director, and to work together to promote the ‘Green Banking Alliance’. The Alliance aims to promote green banking in global financial markets, starting from Asia and gradually expanding to other regions.\n\nWe expect the above work to help reduce the climate risks faced by the financial sector and enable Hong Kong banks to leverage their strengths to meet the huge funding demand for green investment in the region.\n\n# Fintech benefits citizens and the economy\n\nAnother major engine driving the growth of the financial sector is fintech, and the pace of development in this area has accelerated further under the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe past year has clearly shown that fintech can expand our ‘toolbox’ to cope with unexpected shocks. In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, electronic payment channels have played an unprecedented role. From the launch of the Faster Payment System (FPS) in September 2018 to the end of 2020, FPS recorded 6.9 million registered accounts. Even under social distancing restrictions, the public could use FPS as a safe, fast and reliable way to receive, pay and transfer funds, resulting in a 2.3-fold increase in FPS’ average daily transaction volume in 2020. We have also been working with the Government to expand the application of FPS to cover more types of government and public service bill payments.\n\nIn addition, fintech helps banks to provide more diversified and convenient customer services. All eight virtual banks licensed by the HKMA commenced operations in Hong Kong during the year. As at the end of 2020, a total of 420,000 accounts had been opened in virtual banks, with total customer deposits of HK$15 billion. Some virtual banks have already started using new types of data for credit assessment to tap into new customer segments and promote financial inclusion. The HKMA continues to promote the development of a larger and more diversified regulatory technology ecosystem in Hong Kong as part of the ‘Bank Easy’ initiative, so as to streamline regulatory requirements and enhance customer experience. In addition to publishing a series of communications to raise industry awareness of the application of regulatory technology, the HKMA has also issued a white paper setting out a two-year plan to accelerate the adoption of regulatory technology in the banking sector. Furthermore, the HKMA has launched the ‘Commercial Data Platform’ project to enable SMEs to obtain bank financing more conveniently by using their own digital footprints.\n\nAs fintech continues to evolve and technology applications become more widespread, the HKMA needs to maintain rigorous supervision. To this end, we have launched the ‘Cyber Security Fortification Initiative 2.0’ to enhance banks’ cyber defence capabilities. We have also strengthened on-site inspections of technology risk management and developed a regulatory framework to assess the credit risk of personal loan products that use innovative credit risk assessment methods. The HKMA has also launched a three-year plan for the application of regulatory technology to enhance the effectiveness and forward-looking nature of the regulatory process. The work we are currently undertaking in this area includes making more effective use of data and technology to strengthen anti-money laundering supervision."}

2020, Hong Kong’s economy experienced its largest contraction on record as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, with consumption and tourism-related sectors being particularly hard hit. The labour market deteriorated rapidly, while inflation eased. In response to the challenging economic environment, the government and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) introduced relief measures to support the economy.\n\nDespite significant challenges, Hong Kong’s banking system remained robust, with sound financial conditions and continued deposit growth. Capital and liquidity remained ample, and asset quality stayed at a healthy level.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nDespite the increased uncertainty caused by the pandemic, Hong Kong’s foreign exchange and monetary markets operated smoothly and in an orderly manner, reflecting the robustness of its monetary system. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate was strong for most of 2020, with the strong-side Convertibility Undertaking being triggered multiple times. This fully demonstrated the strength of the Linked Exchange Rate System and market confidence in the system.\n\n# Stability of the Banking System\n\nWhile closely monitoring the impact of the pandemic on bank operations, the HKMA continued to focus on supervising banks’ credit and liquidity risk management. In light of the increasing cyber risks and the accelerated adoption of technology in the industry, the HKMA strengthened its oversight of banks’ technology risk management and operational resilience, as well as consumer protection in digital financial services.\n\nThe HKMA provided banks with flexibility to enable them to continue serving customers during the pandemic. The HKMA also worked with other relevant authorities to develop implementation details for the pilot scheme of the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect, and provided guidance on family office and wealth management businesses.\n\nIn the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing, the HKMA took swift action, clarifying how a risk-based approach and technology could help banks respond more effectively to situations related to the COVID-19 pandemic, while also prudently managing the impact of escalating geopolitical tensions on the banking system. The HKMA also continued to promote information sharing between public and private partners and to support the adoption of compliance technology in the banking industry.\n\nSeveral new rules and regulations were introduced during the year to strengthen the regulatory regime for the banking system, in line with the latest international standards. In the area of green and sustainable banking, the HKMA has entered the second of three phases and is developing relevant regulatory requirements. The HKMA is also committed to developing resolution standards, conducting resolution planning, and building resolution execution capabilities to ensure that Hong Kong has a credible bank resolution mechanism.\n\n# Hong Kong’s Status as an International Financial Centre\n\nThe HKMA continued to promote the development of the fintech ecosystem, with banks and payment service providers increasingly adopting financial technology. Transaction volumes on the Faster Payment System surged. The HKMA actively participated in cross-border cooperation in areas such as central bank digital currencies.\n\nHong Kong’s position as a global offshore renminbi business hub remained solid, and it continued to serve as a key gateway to mainland China. Hong Kong’s financial links with the mainland continued to strengthen through its world-class market infrastructure and connectivity mechanisms. Good progress was also made in the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area during the year.\n\nThe HKMA actively explored new opportunities to further enhance Hong Kong’s financial platform, including the competitiveness of its asset and wealth management industry treasury centres, as well as green and sustainable finance.\n\n# Reserve Management\n\nDespite a complex and volatile investment environment, the Exchange Fund recorded investment income of HK$235.8 billion in 2020, with a return of 5.3%, and all five major investment categories recorded positive returns.\n\nThe HKMA continued to promote responsible investment and asset diversification. The Long-Term Growth Portfolio has achieved an annualised internal rate of return of 13.7% since it began investing in 2009.\n\n# Institutional Functions and Social Responsibility\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA continued to maintain effective communication with society and the market through various channels, enhancing public understanding of its policies and operations. In performing its duties, the HKMA upheld high standards of corporate governance, supported staff in enhancing their professional capabilities, maintained strict financial discipline, and strengthened information technology capabilities and security to address new challenges and projects, as well as increasingly heavy workloads.\n\nAt the same time, the HKMA remained committed to fulfilling its corporate social responsibility and striving to be a responsible and sustainable institution. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the HKMA made special work arrangements to ensure that critical functions continued to operate normally, while also safeguarding employee health. The HKMA also introduced a number of measures to support individuals and businesses in need, in order to mitigate the adverse effects of the pandemic."}

{"zh":"# 經濟及金融環境\n\n面對新冠病毒疫情，香港經濟在2020 年連續第二年收縮，並錄得歷年來最嚴重的跌幅。消費及旅遊相關行業尤其受到重創，其收縮幅度較整體經濟更大。與此同時，勞工市場急速惡化，通脹有所緩和。政府及金管局為應對嚴峻的經濟環境，推出歷來最大規模的紓困措施以支持經濟。新冠病毒疫苗接種可望使經濟活動回復正常，預期2021年經濟會恢復增長，然而經濟復甦的力度及步伐仍受疫情發展以及疫苗供應、覆蓋範圍和成效等眾多不明朗因素影響。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 實體經濟活動\n\n受新冠病毒疫情打擊，香港經濟在2020年收縮6.1%，是連續第二年收縮，亦是有紀錄以來最嚴重的年度跌幅（表1）。經濟活動急跌主要是本地需求急劇收縮所致（圖1）。疫情爆發及相應的社交距離措施令本地消費活動受到重創。由於營商環境轉差，整體投資支出亦明顯減少。對外方面，儘管疫情導致供應鏈受干擾及全球需求萎縮，但部分受惠於中國內地迅速恢復生產和經濟活動，全年合計香港貨物出口僅略為下降。相比之下，由於封城、關閉邊境及旅客流量限制令全球旅遊業陷入停頓，所以香港服務輸出嚴重受挫。本地及轉口帶動的需求疲弱，亦令貨物進口及服務輸入轉差。由於進口總額下跌步伐較出口快，淨出口（貿易順差）為本地生產總值帶來支持（圖1）。按經濟行業分析，消費及旅遊相關行業，例如零售、住宿及膳食服務業受到的打擊尤其嚴重，收縮情況較整體經濟更差，而金融業則溫和增長。\n\n表 1 按開支項目計的實質本地生產總值增長（比對上期）\n\n# 經濟及金融環境\n\n圖 1 組成部分對實質本地生產總值增長的貢獻\n\n政府為應對疫情，透過2020至21年度《財政預算案》迅速推出歷來最大規模的紓困措施，並從「防疫抗疫基金」發放4輪補助，合共超過3,000億港元。這些措施包括向合資格居民發放一筆過10,000港元現金、透過「保就業」計劃提供工資補貼，以及為受疫情重創的行業提供一筆過資助、寬減租金及豁免收費。金管局則採取三管齊下的方式支持銀行業，從而支撐實體經濟。有關措施包括與銀行業積極協調，減輕企業及家庭的資金周轉壓力，釋放緩衝以提高銀行的借貸能力，並確保銀行有足夠流動性支持本地經濟活動。\n\n# 通脹\n\n通脹壓力在2020年明顯減弱。剔除政府一次性紓困措施的影響，基本通脹率放緩至1.3%，是2009年全球金融危機以來最小的升幅。基本食品（尤其新鮮豬肉）的價格壓力明顯減退；而自行烹煮以外，由於飲食業提供大幅度折扣，所以外出用膳的價格在下半年亦有所下降。隨着早前新簽訂的私人住宅租金回落，消費物價指數租金項目的增長亦回軟（圖2）。更廣泛而言，由於名義工資增長減慢及商業樓宇租金偏軟，本地營商成本壓力減少；而在疲弱的全球經濟狀況下，進口價格通脹有所緩和。\n\n圖 2 基本消費物價通脹\n\n# 勞工市場\n\n勞工市場在2020年急速惡化。經季節性調整的失業率年內由3.3%飆升至6.6%，為16年的高位（圖3），其中零售、住宿及膳食服務等受疫情重創行業的失業率達到10%以上。就業不足率亦於8月升至3.8%，為沙士疫情後的高位。部分由於經濟狀況急速惡化造成的周期性反應，勞動人口參與率輕微減少。總就業人數（圖3）及私營機構職位空缺急跌，反映整體勞工需求進一步收縮。名義工資及收入增長進一步放緩。政府推出「保就業」計劃，為僱主提供有時限的財政支援以保留僱員，使勞工市場獲得一定程度的支持。\n\n圖 3 勞工市場狀況\n\n# 股市\n\n隨着新冠病毒疫情爆發，恒生指數在首季急跌至3年低位。繼各國中央銀行及政府推出大型支持措施後，股市在第2季及第3季略為回穩（圖4）。由於新冠病毒疫苗研發出現突破，股市於接近年底時重拾一些上升動力。恒生指數於年底收報27,231點，全年計錄得3.4%跌幅。受惠於內地企業在香港的第二上市活動，2020年本港首次公開招股集資總額約4,000億港元，以集資額計全球排名第二。\n\n圖 4 資產價格\n\n# 物業市場\n\n部分受到超低利率所支持，住宅物業市場在2020年大致平穩（圖4）。整體樓價及成交量較前一年均無大變動。然而，由於家庭住戶入息減少，置業負擔能力更為偏緊。另一方面，非住宅物業市場進一步轉弱，物業價格錄得不同程度跌幅，成交量亦見底。受經濟下滑及空置率上升的影響，寫字樓及零售物業租金大幅下跌。鑑於2019年以來非住宅物業市場已出現大幅調整，並預期會持續受壓，加上考慮到經濟基調及外圍環境等其他因素，金管局於8月調整非住宅物業的逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施。政府因應市場需求回落，亦於11月撤銷購置非住宅物業的雙倍從價印花稅這項需求管理措施。\n\n# 經濟前景\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n新冠病毒疫苗接種可望使經濟活動回復正常，預期香港經濟在2021年（全年合計）重拾正增長，然而經濟復甦的力度及步伐仍受疫情發展及疫苗供應、覆蓋範圍和成效等眾多不明朗因素影響。具體而言，疫苗廣泛接種需時，因此本地經濟在2021年早段仍面對相當程度的挑戰。對外方面，預計內地經濟會進一步增強，並為香港貨物及服務輸出帶來支持，然而其他主要經濟體的復甦步伐將取決於其大規模接種疫苗計劃的成效。政府預測2021年實質本地生產總值增長率介乎3.5至5.5%之間，與國際組織及私營機構分析員對香港最新的增長預測平均4.4%相符。\n\n# 通脹及勞工市場\n\n鑑於環球及本地經濟狀況仍具挑戰，預期2021年的通脹壓力將維持輕微。此外，早前新簽訂私人住宅租金回落的傳遞效應，將繼續令本地通脹受到抑制。市場共識預測2021年整體通脹率為1.5%，而政府預期整體及基本通脹率分別為1.6%及1%。由於經濟前景在2021年早段仍具挑戰，加上私營機構分析員預計2021年全年失業率仍會在約5.9%的偏高水平，因此短期內勞工市場將繼續受壓。\n\n# 銀行體系表現\n\n香港銀行體系在2020年保持穩健，銀行財務狀況良好。儘管新冠病毒疫情帶來挑戰，銀行資產負債表繼續擴大，存款資金增加。銀行體系資本及流動性狀況維持充裕，資產質素輕微轉差，但仍處穩健水平。\n\n# 資產負債表走勢\n\n2020年銀行體系資產負債表擴大5.7%。由於經濟下滑，年內貸款增長減慢至1.2%，相比2019年的增幅為6.7%；其中在香港使用的貸款增加2.2%，在香港境外使用的貸款微增0.1%，貿易融資減少6.2%。2020年中國內地相關貸款微跌0.2%，相比2019年錄得7.4%的增長。\n\n銀行資產負債表的負債方面，存款總額在2020年增加5.4%，相比2019年的增幅為2.9%。由於存款總額增長較貸款總額快，整體貸存比率由2019年底的75.3% 降至 2020 年底的 72.3%（圖 5）。\n\n圖 5 銀行體系的貸款及存款\n\n# 資本充足水平\n\n2020年銀行體系資本狀況維持穩健，為抵禦潛在衝擊提供強大的緩衝。2020年底本地註冊認可機構的綜合總資本比率與2019年底相比維持穩定，為20.7%。一級資本比率於同期由18.5%微升至18.7%（圖 6）。\n\n2020年底《巴塞爾協定三》槓桿比率與2019年底相比維持穩定，仍為8.2%，遠高於3%的法定最低要求（圖 7）。\n\n圖 6 本地註冊認可機構的綜合資本比率\n\n圖 7 本地註冊認可機構的綜合槓桿比率\n\n# 流動性狀況\n\n銀行體系的流動性狀況維持穩健，有能力抵禦受壓時的流動性衝擊。第1類機構的季度平均流動性覆蓋比率在第4季為155.1%，遠高於100%的法定最低要求。第2類機構的季度平均流動性維持比率為57.9%，亦遠高於25%的法定最低要求（圖 8）。\n\n圖 8 指定認可機構的流動性比率\n\n銀行體系的資金來源維持穩定。於2020年底，第1類機構的穩定資金淨額比率為138.6%，遠高於100%的法定最低要求。第2A類機構的核心資金比率為139.5%，亦遠高於75%的法定最低要求（圖 9）。\n\n圖 9 指定認可機構的資金比率\n\n# 資產質素\n\n新冠病毒疫情影響下，年內銀行體系資產質素略為下降，但以歷史及國際標準計仍然維持良好。特定分類貸款比率由2019年底的0.57%上升至2020年底的0.90%，逾期及經重組貸款比率於同期由0.34%上升至0.57%（圖10）。中國內地相關貸款的特定分類貸款比率由 2019 年底的 0.75% 上升至 2020 年底的 0.96%。住宅按揭貸款及信用卡貸款的拖欠比率仍然處於低位，分別為0.04%及0.27%（圖11）。\n\n圖 10 銀行體系的資產質素\n\n圖 11 住宅按揭貸款及信用卡貸款的拖欠比率\n\n# 盈利走勢\n\n低息環境加上資產質素略為下降，令銀行體系盈利受壓。零售銀行的整體除稅前經營溢利在2020年下降29.4%（圖12），主要是淨利息收入減少（-21.9%）及貸款減值撥備增加（+61.3%）所致。淨息差由2019年的1.63% 收窄至 2020 年的 1.18%（圖 13）。\n\n由於收入減少，零售銀行的成本與收入比率由2019年的39.5%，上升至2020年的46.8%（圖 14）。\n\n圖 12 零售銀行的表現\n\n圖 13 零售銀行淨息差\n\n圖 14 零售銀行成本與收入比率\n","terms":{"月":["month"],"暢順":["smooth"],"前":["ahead"],"幣作":["currency"],"銀行":["bank","banking","banks","bank(s)","banking

contracted for a second consecutive year in 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, recording its sharpest decline ever. Consumption and tourism-related sectors were particularly hard hit, with a greater contraction than the overall economy. Meanwhile, the labour market deteriorated rapidly, and inflation eased. To address the challenging economic environment, the government and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) introduced the largest relief measures in history to support the economy. COVID-19 vaccinations are expected to enable a return to normal economic activity, and the economy is forecast to resume growth in 2021. However, the strength and pace of economic recovery remain subject to many uncertainties, including the development of the pandemic and the availability, coverage, and effectiveness of vaccines.\n\n# Economic Review\n\n# Real Economic Activity\n\nHong Kong’s economy contracted by 6.1% in 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, marking the second consecutive year of contraction and the most severe annual decline on record (Table 1). The sharp drop in economic activity was mainly due to a dramatic contraction in domestic demand (Chart 1). The outbreak of the pandemic and the corresponding social distancing measures severely impacted local consumption activities. Overall investment expenditure also declined significantly due to a deterioration in the business environment. Externally, despite supply chain disruptions and a decline in global demand caused by the pandemic, Hong Kong’s total goods exports fell only slightly, partly benefiting from the rapid resumption of production and economic activities in mainland China. In contrast, Hong Kong’s service exports were severely affected as global tourism came to a standstill due to city lockdowns, border closures, and travel restrictions. Weak demand driven by local consumption and re-exports also led to a deterioration in goods imports and service imports. As the decline in total imports outpaced that of exports, net exports (trade surplus) provided support to gross domestic product (GDP) (Chart 1). By economic sector, consumption and tourism-related industries, such as retail, accommodation, and food services, were particularly hard hit, contracting more than the overall economy, while the financial sector grew moderately.\n\nTable 1 Real GDP growth by expenditure component (compared with the previous period)\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nChart 1 Contribution of components to real GDP growth\n\nTo tackle the pandemic, the government swiftly introduced the largest relief measures in history through the 2020–21 Budget and disbursed four rounds of subsidies totalling over HK$300 billion from the Anti-epidemic Fund. These measures included a one-off cash payout of HK$10,000 to eligible residents, wage subsidies through the Employment Support Scheme, and one-off subsidies, rent concessions, and fee waivers for industries severely affected by the pandemic. The HKMA adopted a three-pronged approach to support the banking sector and, in turn, the real economy. These measures included active coordination with the banking sector to ease liquidity pressures on enterprises and households, releasing buffers to enhance banks’ lending capacity, and ensuring banks had sufficient liquidity to support local economic activities.\n\n# Inflation\n\nInflationary pressures eased significantly in 2020. Excluding the impact of the government’s one-off relief measures, underlying inflation slowed to 1.3%, the smallest increase since the global financial crisis in 2009. Price pressures on basic foodstuffs, especially fresh pork, eased significantly. Dining-out prices also fell in the second half of the year as the catering sector offered substantial discounts, apart from self-cooked meals. As newly signed private residential rents fell earlier, the growth of the rental component of the Consumer Price Index also softened (Chart 2). More broadly, local business cost pressures eased due to slower growth in nominal wages and softer commercial rents, while import price inflation moderated amid weak global economic conditions.\n\nChart 2 Underlying consumer price inflation\n\n# Labour Market\n\nThe labour market deteriorated rapidly in 2020. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate soared from 3.3% to 6.6% during the year, a 16-year high (Chart 3), with the unemployment rate in hard-hit sectors such as retail, accommodation, and food services exceeding 10%. The underemployment rate also rose to 3.8% in August, the highest since the SARS epidemic. The labour force participation rate declined slightly, partly due to the cyclical response to the rapid deterioration in economic conditions. Total employment (Chart 3) and private sector job vacancies fell sharply, reflecting a further contraction in overall labour demand. Growth in nominal wages and income slowed further. The government launched the Employment Support Scheme to provide employers with time-limited financial support to retain employees, which provided some support to the labour market.\n\nChart 3 Labour market conditions\n\n# Stock Market\n\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic broke out, the Hang Seng Index fell sharply in the first quarter to a three-year low. Following large-scale support measures introduced by central banks and governments worldwide, the stock market stabilised slightly in the second and third quarters (Chart 4). As a breakthrough was made in the development of COVID-19 vaccines, the stock market regained some upward momentum towards the end of the year. The Hang Seng Index closed at 27,231 at the end of the year, recording a 3.4% decline for the whole year. Benefiting from the secondary listings of mainland enterprises in Hong Kong, the total funds raised through initial public offerings in Hong Kong reached about HK$400 billion in 2020, ranking second globally in terms of funds raised.\n\nChart 4 Asset prices\n\n# Property Market\n\nPartly supported by ultra-low interest rates, the residential property market was broadly stable in 2020 (Chart 4). Overall property prices and transaction volumes did not change significantly from the previous year. However, as household incomes declined, affordability for home purchases tightened further. On the other hand, the non-residential property market weakened further, with property prices falling to varying degrees and transaction volumes hitting bottom. Office and retail property rents fell sharply due to the economic downturn and rising vacancy rates. Given that the non-residential property market had undergone a significant adjustment since 2019 and was expected to remain under pressure, coupled with other factors such as the economic fundamentals and external environment, the HKMA adjusted the countercyclical macroprudential regulatory measures for non-residential properties in August. In response to the decline in market demand, the government also withdrew the demand management measure of double ad valorem stamp duty on non-residential property purchases in November.\n\n# Economic Outlook\n\n# Economic Environment\n\nCOVID-19 vaccinations are expected to enable a return to normal economic activity, and Hong Kong’s economy is forecast to resume positive growth in 2021 (for the year as a whole). However, the strength and pace of economic recovery remain subject to many uncertainties, including the development of the pandemic and the availability, coverage, and effectiveness of vaccines. Specifically, as widespread vaccination will take time, the local economy will still face considerable challenges in the early part of 2021. Externally, the mainland economy is expected to strengthen further, providing support to Hong Kong’s exports of goods and services, but the recovery pace of other major economies will depend on the effectiveness of their large-scale vaccination programmes. The government forecasts that real GDP growth in 2021 will range between 3.5% and 5.5%, in line with the latest growth forecast of 4.4% for Hong Kong by international organisations and private-sector analysts.\n\n# Inflation and Labour Market\n\nGiven that global and local economic conditions remain challenging, inflationary pressures are expected to remain mild in 2021. In addition, the feed-through effect of the earlier decline in newly signed private residential rents will continue to suppress local inflation. Market consensus predicts that overall inflation in 2021 will be 1.5%, while the government expects overall and underlying inflation rates of 1.6% and 1% respectively. As the economic outlook remains challenging in the early part of 2021, and private-sector analysts expect the unemployment rate to remain at a high level of around 5.9% for the whole of 2021, the labour market will continue to be under pressure in the near term.\n\n# Banking Sector Performance\n\nHong Kong’s banking sector remained robust in 2020, with banks in a healthy financial position. Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, banks’ balance sheets continued to expand, and deposit funds increased. The banking sector’s capital and liquidity positions remained strong, with asset quality deteriorating slightly but remaining at a healthy level.\n\n# Balance Sheet Trends\n\nThe banking sector’s balance sheet expanded by 5.7% in 2020. As the economy weakened, loan growth slowed to 1.2% during the year, compared with 6.7% in 2019; of which loans used in Hong Kong increased by 2.2%, loans used outside Hong Kong grew marginally by 0.1%, and trade finance decreased by 6.2%. Loans related to mainland China fell slightly by 0.2% in 2020, compared with a 7.4% increase in 2019.\n\nOn the liability side of banks’ balance sheets, total deposits increased by 5.4% in 2020, compared with a 2.9% increase in 2019. As deposit growth outpaced loan growth, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio fell from 75.3% at the end of 2019 to 72.3% at the end of 2020 (Chart 5).\n\nChart 5 Loans and deposits of the banking sector\n\n# Capital Adequacy\n\nThe banking sector’s capital position remained robust in 2020, providing a strong buffer against potential shocks. The composite total capital ratio of locally incorporated authorised institutions remained stable at 20.7% at the end of 2020, compared with the end of 2019. The Tier 1 capital ratio rose slightly from 18.5% to 18.7% over the same period (Chart 6).\n\nThe Basel III leverage ratio remained stable at 8.2% at the end of 2020, compared with the end of 2019, well above the statutory minimum requirement of 3% (Chart 7).\n\nChart 6 Composite capital ratios of locally incorporated authorised institutions\n\nChart 7 Composite leverage ratios of locally incorporated authorised institutions\n\n# Liquidity Position\n\nThe banking sector’s liquidity position remained robust, with the ability to withstand liquidity shocks under stress. The quarterly average liquidity coverage ratio of Category 1 institutions was 155.1% in the fourth quarter, well above the statutory minimum requirement of 100%. The quarterly average liquidity maintenance ratio of Category 2 institutions was 57.9%, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 25% (Chart 8).\n\nChart 8 Liquidity ratios of designated authorised institutions\n\nThe banking sector’s funding sources remained stable. At the end of 2020, the net stable funding ratio of Category 1 institutions was 138.6%, well above the statutory minimum requirement of 100%. The core funding ratio of Category 2A institutions was 139.5%, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 75% (Chart 9).\n\nChart 9 Funding ratios of designated authorised institutions\n\n# Asset Quality\n\nAmid the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, asset quality of the banking sector deteriorated slightly during the year, but remained sound by historical and international standards. The specific classification loan ratio rose from 0.57% at the end of 2019 to 0.90% at the end of 2020, while the ratio of overdue and restructured loans increased from 0.34% to 0.57% over the same period (Chart 10). The specific classification loan ratio of mainland-related loans rose from 0.75% at the end of 2019 to 0.96% at the end of 2020. The delinquency ratios of residential mortgage loans and credit card loans remained low at 0.04% and 0.27% respectively (Chart 11).\n\nChart 10 Asset quality of the banking sector\n\nChart 11 Delinquency ratios of residential mortgage loans and credit card loans\n\n# Profitability Trends\n\nAmid the low interest rate environment and a slight deterioration in asset quality, the banking sector’s profitability came under pressure. Retail banks’ overall pre-tax operating profit fell by 29.4% in 2020 (Chart 12), mainly due to a decline in net interest income (–21.9%) and an increase in loan impairment provisions (+61.3%). The net interest margin narrowed from 1.63% in 2019 to 1.18% in 2020 (Chart 13).\n\nAs income declined, retail banks’ cost-to-income ratio rose from 39.5% in 2019 to 46.8% in 2020 (Chart 14).\n\nChart 12 Performance of retail banks\n\nChart 13 Net interest margin of retail banks\n\nChart 14 Cost-to-income ratio of retail banks"}
{"zh":"# 貨幣穩定\n\n儘管新冠病毒疫情增加不確定因素，港元外匯及貨幣市場運作暢順有序。受到大量股票相關的資金流入所支持，港元匯率於2020 年內大部分時間偏強，而強方兌換保證多次被觸發。聯繫匯率制度是香港金融體系的基石，充分展現強大的抵禦衝擊的能力。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的主要目標是維持貨幣穩定，即確保港元匯價穩定，使港元在外匯市場兌美元的匯率保持在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的區間內。該貨幣體制主要採用貨幣發行局制度，規定由外匯基金所持的美元儲備向貨幣基礎提供最少百分之百的支持；貨幣基礎若有變動，美元儲備亦必須作出相應增減，與貨幣基礎的變動百分之百配合。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n- 負債證明書（為3間發鈔銀行發行的銀行紙幣提供十足支持）\n- 政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣\n- 設於金管局的結算戶口結餘總額（即總結餘）\n- 金管局代表政府發行的外匯基金票據及債券。\n\n表 1 貨幣基礎\n\n金管局透過自動利率調節機制及履行兌換保證的堅決承諾來維持港元匯率的穩定。當強方（或弱方）兌換保證被觸發，金管局會應銀行要求，按每美元兌7.75港元向銀行沽出港元、買入美元（或按7.85港元買入港元、沽出美元），使總結餘增加（或減少），令港元利率下跌（或上升），從而促使港元匯率回復到7.75至7.85 的兌換範圍。\n\n# 2020年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n隨着3月全球爆發新冠病毒疫情，避險情緒下環球投資者增持美元，令美元資金狀況明顯收緊。在聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）下，由於港元利率受同期美元利率影響，美元流動性緊張令香港貨幣狀況收緊。儘管其後美國聯邦儲備局實施流動資金計劃，美元資金壓力有所紓緩，但由於股票相關需求及季結效應，令香港貨幣狀況仍維持偏緊。而港元需求殷切，加上港元與美元的正息差刺激套息交易活動，促使港元匯率偏向強方兌換保證匯率（圖1），強方兌換保證最終於4月被觸發。其後新股集資活動暢旺，以及「滬港通」與「深港通」下的南向資金帶動股票相關資金流入，令港元一直維持接近7.75水平，並導致強方兌換保證在2020年內多次被觸發。強方兌換保證在4月21日至10月28日期間合共被觸發85次，累計資金流入3,835億港元。整體而言，港元外匯市場在2020年全年運作正常。\n\n圖 1 2020年市場匯率\n\n總結餘（進行貼現窗活動前）與未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額由2019年底的11,330億港元，增加至2020年底的15,266億港元（圖2）。隨着強方兌換保證被觸發，金管局應銀行要求合共沽出3,835億港元。新冠病毒疫情引致環球宏觀環境波動，金管局為了提供額外港元流動性，亦於4月底及5月初逐步減發總計200億港元外匯基金票據。由於強方兌換保證被觸發及外匯基金票據發行量減少，總結餘（進行貼現窗活動前）由2019年底的543億港元，增加至2020年底的4,575億港元。年內未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額由10,787億港元，稍降至10,692億港元，反映外匯基金票據發行量減少，這抵銷了按一貫做法以新發行的外匯基金票據及債券來吸納未償還外匯基金票據及債券的利息。整體貨幣基礎仍然由外匯儲備提供十足支持。\n\n圖 2 2020年總結餘（進行貼現窗活動前）及未償還外匯基金票據及債券\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n隨着農曆新年假期後流動性需求減退，香港銀行同業拆息在2月普遍下降（圖3）。踏入3月，由於美元資金壓力，連同新股集資相關及季結資金需求等本地因素，香港銀行同業拆息一度上升。其後由於強方兌換保證被觸發及外匯基金票據發行量減少，令總結餘增加，港元流動性狀況逐步紓緩。\n\n因應美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍於3月兩度下調，以及反映年內隔夜與1個月香港銀行同業拆息變動，基本利率由年初的2.73厘下降至年底收報0.50厘。在零售層面，儘管美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍調低，銀行仍維持最優惠貸款利率不變。整體而言，香港貨幣市場繼續正常運作。貼現窗借貸由2019年的383億港元降至2020年的91億港元。\n\n圖 3 2020 年香港銀行同業拆息\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n過去30多年來，聯匯制度一直是香港金融體系的重要支柱，歷經考驗均能展現強大的抵禦衝擊的能力。儘管2020年面對挑戰，港元外匯及貨幣市場保持正常運作，一再證明聯匯制度穩健有效。年內面對一些毫無根據的謠言，質疑聯匯制度以至香港的金融穩定，金管局迅速向公眾重申香港會繼續實施聯匯制度，同時資金自由流動及港幣自由兌換受到《基本法》第112條保障。金管局另又發表多篇文章，闡明逆境下香港金融體系繼續展現強大抵禦衝擊能力的事實。政府亦堅決維持聯匯制度。香港的金融市場有序運作，以及港元繼續如常作為支付及保值貨幣，反映上述措施有效維持公眾對聯匯制度的信心。國際貨幣基金組織在《2020年對外部門報告》重申香港擁有具透明度的規則、充裕的財政及外匯儲備、穩健的金融規管與監管、靈活的經濟，以及審慎的財政架構，確保聯匯制度具公信力。\n\n穩健的銀行體系對聯匯制度的正常運作具關鍵作用。儘管新冠病毒疫情構成負面影響，香港銀行體系繼續運作暢順，流動性及資本水平以國際標準而言均非常充裕。為確保銀行體系具備承受衝擊的能力，金管局一直密切監察銀行的信用、流動性及利率風險管理，以及壓力測試結果，並維持對銀行貸款的監管。與此同時，金管局亦為銀行體系提供更多流動性，維持貨幣及金融穩定。除減發外匯基金票據以增加港元流動性外，金管局為銀行設立一系列流動資金安排。此外，金管局與銀行保持聯繫，確保它們在緊張情況時利用這些流動資金安排。因應新冠病毒疫情為環球金融市場帶來波動及不確定因素，金管局推出臨時性美元流動資金安排，為持牌銀行提供美元流動性支援，有助紓緩環球美元銀行拆借市場流動性緊絀的情況。\n\n為提高貨幣發行局帳目的透明度，自1998年10月起，外匯基金已有部分資產被指定用作支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（即支持資產相對貨幣基礎的比率）於2020年在109.8至112.1%之間上落，並無觸及上限或下限。該比率於12月31日收報109.9%（圖4）。在聯匯制度下，雖然已指定某些外匯基金資產作為支持組合，但外匯基金的全部資產均可用作支持港元匯率。外匯基金的龐大財政資源，加上香港穩健的銀行體系，為保障香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供強而有力的後盾。\n\n圖 4 2020年支持比率每日變動\n\n# 其他事務\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的貨幣發行委員會負責監察及探討與香港貨幣及金融穩定有關的課題。在2020年，貨幣發行委員會探討的課題包括香港經濟的情景分析、香港物業市場的評估、了解跨境資金流的概念架構，以及了解香港銀行同業市場。貨幣發行委員會會議紀錄及金管局向其呈交的貨幣發行局制度運作報告，均載於金管局網站。\n\n# 貨幣研究\n\n疫情持續下，香港貨幣及金融研究中心（研究中心）在2020年仍能維持一定數量的研究成果。在2020年，研究中心合共發表20篇研究論文，涵蓋貨幣政策、銀行體系穩定、市場微觀結構和金融科技發展等廣泛議題，部份論文已獲接納或正被評審在專業期刊中刊登。在疫情下由於要實施社交距離及旅遊限制，研究中心舉辦的研討會、講座及到訪研究計劃等主要活動需要押後，待日後公共衛生和旅遊條件回復正常後，研究中心將會復辦上述活動。\n\n# 紙幣及硬幣\n\n截至2020年底，流通銀行紙幣（指發鈔銀行發行的紙幣）總值5,595億港元，較上年增加8.3%（圖5、6及7）。政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣總值127億港元，較上年減少0.6%（圖8及9）。在政府發行的紙幣及硬幣中，10港元流通紙幣總值46億港元，其中塑質鈔票佔79%。\n\n圖 5 2020年底按發鈔銀行分析的銀行紙幣流通金額\n\n圖 6 2020年底流通銀行紙幣分布情況\n\n圖 7 2020 年底銀行紙幣流通金額\n\n圖 8 2020年底政府發行紙幣及硬幣流通金額\n\n圖 9 2020年底政府發行流通紙幣及硬幣分析\n\n# 香港鈔票\n\n繼於2020年1月推出20港元及50港元面額新鈔，2018年新鈔系列所有5款面額鈔票已在市面流通。該系列鈔票具備更強固及應用方便的防偽特徵，廣受市民歡迎，並逐漸取代舊版鈔票。\n\n年內金管局繼續舉辦講座，介紹香港鈔票的設計及防偽特徵。金管局舉辦8場講座(包括網上形式)，增進公眾對香港鈔票的認識，吸引2,000多名人士參加，包括銀行櫃位職員、商戶及學生等。\n\n# 硬幣收集計劃\n\n硬幣收集計劃於2014年10月推出，年內繼續廣受大眾歡迎。這是全球首個有系統的流動硬幣收集計劃，設有兩部收銀車輪流停駐全港18區。每部收銀車均裝設兩部高速硬幣點算機，市民可選擇將硬幣轉換成鈔票或用作八達通卡或電子錢包等儲值支付工具增值，亦可將款項放入車內的公益金捐款箱。此外，金管局與香港社會服務聯會合作，在非政府組織賣旗日派出收銀車收集硬幣。收銀車亦到訪學校，增進學生對硬幣收集計劃的認識。過去多年硬幣收集計劃曾獲頒多個本港及國際獎項，對其創新及環保的處理方法予以肯定。\n","terms":{"月":["month"],"暢順":["smooth"],"前":["ahead"],"幣作":["currency"],"銀行":["bank","banking","banks","bank(s)","banking

the COVID-19 pandemic, the operations of Hong Kong’s foreign exchange and monetary markets remained smooth and orderly. Supported by substantial stock-related capital inflows, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained strong for most of 2020, with the strong-side Convertibility Undertaking being triggered multiple times. The Linked Exchange Rate System is the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s financial system, demonstrating its strong ability to withstand shocks.\n\n# Objectives\n\nThe primary objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is to maintain monetary stability, i.e. to ensure the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, keeping it within the range of 7.75 to 7.85 Hong Kong dollars per US dollar in the foreign exchange market. The monetary system primarily adopts a Currency Board System, which stipulates that the US dollar reserves held by the Exchange Fund must provide at least 100% backing to the monetary base. If the monetary base changes, the US dollar reserves must also be adjusted accordingly, matching the changes in the monetary base by 100%.\n\nThe monetary base (Table 1) includes:\n- Certificates of Indebtedness (which fully back the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks)\n- Banknotes and coins in circulation issued by the government\n- The total balance of settlement accounts at the HKMA (i.e. the Aggregate Balance)\n- Exchange Fund Bills and Notes issued by the HKMA on behalf of the government.\n\nTable 1 Monetary base\n\nThe HKMA maintains the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and a firm commitment to fulfilling the exchange guarantee. When the strong-side (or weak-side) Convertibility Undertaking is triggered, the HKMA, upon request from banks, sells Hong Kong dollars to banks at a rate of HK$7.75 per US dollar and buys US dollars (or buys Hong Kong dollars at HK$7.85 and sells US dollars), causing the Aggregate Balance to increase (or decrease), leading to a drop (or rise) in Hong Kong dollar interest rates, thereby prompting the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate to return to the range of 7.75 to 7.85.\n\n# Review of 2020\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic spread globally in March, risk-averse sentiment led international investors to increase their holdings of US dollars, tightening US dollar funding conditions significantly. Under the Linked Exchange Rate System, as Hong Kong dollar interest rates are influenced by US dollar interest rates of the same tenor, the tight US dollar liquidity caused a tightening of monetary conditions in Hong Kong. Although the US Federal Reserve subsequently implemented liquidity programmes, easing US dollar funding pressures, Hong Kong’s monetary conditions remained tight due to stock-related demand and quarter-end effects. Strong demand for the Hong Kong dollar, coupled with a positive interest rate differential between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar that stimulated carry trade activities, pushed the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate towards the strong-side Convertibility Undertaking level (Chart 1). The strong-side Convertibility Undertaking was eventually triggered in April. Subsequently, robust new share issuance activities and southbound fund flows under Stock Connect programmes drove stock-related capital inflows, keeping the Hong Kong dollar close to the 7.75 level and leading to multiple triggers of the strong-side Convertibility Undertaking in 2020. The strong-side Convertibility Undertaking was triggered 85 times between 21 April and 28 October, with cumulative capital inflows totalling HK$383.5 billion. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar foreign exchange market operated normally throughout 2020.\n\nChart 1 Market exchange rates in 2020\n\nThe Aggregate Balance (before discount window operations) and the total outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and Notes increased from HK$11,330 billion at the end of 2019 to HK$15,266 billion at the end of 2020 (Chart 2). As the strong-side Convertibility Undertaking was triggered, the HKMA sold a total of HK$383.5 billion in Hong Kong dollars upon banks’ requests. To provide additional Hong Kong dollar liquidity amid the volatile global macroeconomic environment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the HKMA also gradually reduced the issuance of Exchange Fund Bills by a total of HK$20 billion at the end of April and the beginning of May. Due to the triggering of the strong-side Convertibility Undertaking and the reduction in the issuance of Exchange Fund Bills, the Aggregate Balance (before discount window operations) increased from HK$54.3 billion at the end of 2019 to HK$4,575 billion at the end of 2020. The total outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and Notes for the year decreased slightly from HK$10,787 billion to HK$10,692 billion, reflecting the reduced issuance of Exchange Fund Bills, which offset the absorption of interest on outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and Notes through the issuance of new Exchange Fund Bills and Notes, in line with established practice. The overall monetary base continued to be fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\nChart 2 Aggregate Balance (before discount window operations) and outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and Notes in 2020\n\n# Money market\n\nAs liquidity demand declined after the Lunar New Year holiday, Hong Kong interbank interest rates generally fell in February (Chart 3). In March, due to US dollar funding pressures, coupled with local factors such as new share issuance-related and quarter-end funding demands, Hong Kong interbank interest rates rose temporarily. Subsequently, as the strong-side Convertibility Undertaking was triggered and the issuance of Exchange Fund Bills decreased, the Aggregate Balance increased, gradually easing Hong Kong dollar liquidity conditions.\n\nIn response to the two downward adjustments of the US federal funds rate target range in March, and reflecting the changes in overnight and one-month Hong Kong interbank interest rates during the year, the Base Rate fell from 2.73% at the beginning of the year to 0.50% at the end of the year. At the retail level, despite the lowering of the US federal funds rate target range, banks kept their best lending rates unchanged. Overall, the Hong Kong money market continued to operate normally. Discount window lending decreased from HK$38.3 billion in 2019 to HK$9.1 billion in 2020.\n\nChart 3 Hong Kong interbank interest rates in 2020\n\n# Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nOver the past 30 years, the Linked Exchange Rate System has been a vital pillar of Hong Kong’s financial system, demonstrating its strong ability to withstand shocks through various tests. Despite the challenges faced in 2020, the Hong Kong dollar foreign exchange and monetary markets continued to operate normally, once again proving the robustness and effectiveness of the Linked Exchange Rate System. Amid unfounded rumours questioning the Linked Exchange Rate System and Hong Kong’s financial stability during the year, the HKMA swiftly reassured the public that Hong Kong would continue to implement the Linked Exchange Rate System, with the free flow of funds and the free convertibility of the Hong Kong dollar being guaranteed under Article 112 of the Basic Law. The HKMA also published several articles explaining how Hong Kong’s financial system continued to demonstrate its strong resilience in the face of adversity. The government also remained firmly committed to maintaining the Linked Exchange Rate System. The orderly operation of Hong Kong’s financial markets and the continued normal use of the Hong Kong dollar as a medium of payment and a store of value reflected the effectiveness of these measures in maintaining public confidence in the Linked Exchange Rate System. In its 2020 External Sector Report, the International Monetary Fund reaffirmed that Hong Kong has transparent rules, ample fiscal and foreign exchange reserves, robust financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy, and a prudent fiscal framework, ensuring the credibility of the Linked Exchange Rate System.\n\nA robust banking system is crucial to the normal operation of the Linked Exchange Rate System. Despite the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, Hong Kong’s banking system continued to operate smoothly, with liquidity and capital levels remaining very strong by international standards. To ensure the banking system’s ability to withstand shocks, the HKMA closely monitored banks’ credit, liquidity, and interest rate risk management, as well as stress test results, and maintained supervision over bank lending. At the same time, the HKMA provided more liquidity to the banking system to maintain monetary and financial stability. In addition to reducing the issuance of Exchange Fund Bills to increase Hong Kong dollar liquidity, the HKMA established a series of liquidity facilities for banks. Furthermore, the HKMA maintained communication with banks to ensure they utilised these liquidity facilities during times of stress. In response to the volatility and uncertainty in global financial markets caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the HKMA introduced a temporary US dollar liquidity facility to provide US dollar liquidity support to licensed banks, helping to alleviate the tight liquidity conditions in the global US dollar interbank lending market.\n\nTo enhance the transparency of the Currency Board’s accounts, since October 1998, a portion of the Exchange Fund’s assets has been designated to back the monetary base. The backing ratio (i.e. the ratio of backing assets to the monetary base) fluctuated between 109.8% and 112.1% in 2020, without reaching the upper or lower limits. The ratio closed at 109.9% on 31 December (Chart 4). Under the Linked Exchange Rate System, although certain Exchange Fund assets have been designated as backing assets, all Exchange Fund assets can be used to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. The substantial financial resources of the Exchange Fund, combined with Hong Kong’s robust banking system, provide a strong safeguard for Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nChart 4 Daily changes in the backing ratio in 2020\n\n# Other matters\n\nThe Currency Board Committee, under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, is responsible for monitoring and discussing issues related to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. In 2020, the Currency Board Committee discussed topics including scenario analysis of Hong Kong’s economy, assessment of Hong Kong’s property market, understanding the conceptual framework of cross-border capital flows, and understanding Hong Kong’s interbank market. The meeting minutes of the Currency Board Committee and the reports on the operation of the Currency Board System submitted by the HKMA to the Committee are available on the HKMA’s website.\n\n# Monetary research\n\nDespite the ongoing pandemic, the Hong Kong Monetary and Financial Research Institute (the Institute) maintained a certain level of research output in 2020. In 2020, the Institute published a total of 20 research papers covering a wide range of topics, including monetary policy, banking system stability, market microstructure, and financial technology development. Some of these papers have been accepted or are under review for publication in professional journals. Due to social distancing and travel restrictions imposed during the pandemic, major activities organised by the Institute, such as seminars, lectures, and visiting research programmes, had to be postponed. These activities will resume once public health and travel conditions return to normal.\n\n# Banknotes and coins\n\nAs of the end of 2020, the total value of banknotes in circulation issued by note-issuing banks was HK$5,595 billion, an increase of 8.3% compared to the previous year (Charts 5, 6 and 7). The total value of banknotes and coins in circulation issued by the government was HK$12.7 billion, a decrease of 0.6% compared to the previous year (Charts 8 and 9). Among the banknotes and coins issued by the government, the total value of HK$10 banknotes in circulation was HK$4.6 billion, of which polymer banknotes accounted for 79%.\n\nChart 5 Analysis of banknotes in circulation by note-issuing bank at end-2020\n\nChart 6 Distribution of banknotes in circulation at end-2020\n\nChart 7 Amount of banknotes in circulation at end-2020\n\nChart 8 Amount of banknotes and coins issued by the Government in circulation at end-2020\n\nChart 9 Analysis of banknotes and coins issued by the Government in circulation at end-2020\n\n# Hong Kong banknotes\n\nFollowing the launch of the new HK$20 and HK$50 banknotes in January 2020, all five denominations of the 2018 series of banknotes are now in circulation. These banknotes feature stronger and more user-friendly anti-counterfeiting features, are well-received by the public, and are gradually replacing the old versions.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA continued to organise talks to introduce the design and anti-counterfeiting features of Hong Kong banknotes. The HKMA organised eight talks (including online sessions) to enhance public understanding of Hong Kong banknotes, attracting over 2,000 participants, including bank counter staff, merchants, and students.\n\n# Coin collection programme\n\nThe Coin Collection Programme, launched in October 2014, continued to be popular with the public during the year. It is the world’s first systematic mobile coin collection programme, with two cash collection vehicles rotating across all 18 districts in Hong Kong. Each vehicle is equipped with two high-speed coin counters, allowing citizens to exchange coins for banknotes or use them to top up stored-value payment tools such as Octopus cards or e-wallets. They can also donate the funds to the Community Chest box inside the vehicle. In addition, the HKMA collaborated with the Hong Kong Council of Social Service to dispatch cash collection vehicles to collect coins during flag-selling days organised by non-governmental organisations. The vehicles also visited schools to enhance students’ understanding of the Coin Collection Programme. Over the years, the Coin Collection Programme has received multiple local and international awards in recognition of its innovative and environmentally friendly approach."}

銀行體系穩定\n\n儘管新冠病毒疫情爆發為經濟帶來重大挑戰，香港銀行體系於2020年維持穩健。年內金管局除密切留意疫情對銀行營運及監管活動的影響並靈活應變外，繼續將監管重點放在認可機構的信用及流動性風險管理上。鑑於網絡威脅持續增加及銀行業使用金融科技的上升趨勢，金管局加強對認可機構科技風險管理及運作穩健性的監管。金管局亦與銀行及國際組織緊密合作，促進業界過渡至備用參考利率。\n\n在操守監管方面，金管局給予認可機構在遵守監管規定上彈性處理的空間以及提供指引，以便一方面協助銀行在疫情下的業務運作及繼續為客戶提供服務，另一方面則繼續確保投資者及消費者得到保障。金管局聯同有關當局制定「跨境理財通」業務試點的建議實施細則，並諮詢業界。金管局與證券及期貨事務監察委員會合作，就精簡有關家族辦公室及擁有高資產淨值並精於財務事宜的投資者的銷售程序提供指引。此外，金管局加強對數碼金融服務消費者的保障，並繼續推動以客為本的企業文化。\n\n在打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集方面，金管局迅速採取行動，不但釐清風險為本方法及科技如何協助認可機構更有效應對與新冠病毒疫情相關的情況，並同時審慎應對持續升溫的地緣政治緊張局勢對銀行體系造成的影響。金管局繼續支持有關提升打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集工作的成效與效率的措施，包括增加參與公私營夥伴共享訊息的認可機構數目，以及支持銀行業採用合規科技。金管局又順應科技及數據運用的國際發展趨勢，展開進一步加強打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集監察能力的計劃。\n\n與此同時，金管局與銀行業緊密合作，優化監管政策與程序，以及推行提升人才專業能力的措施。香港在實施國際監管標準方面取得理想進展，包括資本充足標準和披露標準。在促進綠色及可持續銀行業的發展方面，金管局已進入三個階段中的第二階段，正制定相關監管規定。金管局亦繼續致力確保香港備有具公信力的認可機構處置機制，包括制定新處置標準及實施吸收虧損能力規定的規則，以提升認可機構的處置可行性。\n\n# 目標\n\n金管局的整體目標之一是促進銀行體系的安全及穩定。要達致這個目標，實有賴建立及維持具高度應對能力且能為香港經濟提供所需關鍵金融服務的金融體系。\n\n銀行可能因營運方式，甚或在極端情況下因失序地倒閉而影響銀行體系的穩定。作為監管當局，金融管理專員在保障金融穩定方面擔當重要角色，確保銀行有能力抵禦衝擊、應對危機及自危機中恢復常態，以最終有助防止出現倒閉。金融管理專員負責對銀行進行審慎監管，以及認可香港的持牌銀行、有限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司（統稱「認可機構」）。金融管理專員亦負責某些金融市場基建的指定及監管。\n\n然而，金融管理專員不能確保金融體系全無風險，香港的審慎監管制度亦並非為確保「零風險」而設。作為其中一個處置機制當局，金融管理專員力求確保一旦有認可機構不再可持續經營，能有秩序地處理其倒閉。為此，香港已設立金融機構處置機制，金融管理專員在該機制下為認可機構（以及其他類型機構）的處置機制當局。為落實香港的處置機制，必須制定處置規則及政策標準、進行處置規劃以排除認可機構處置可行性的障礙，以及建立金管局處置瀕臨倒閉認可機構的運作能力。為有效執行上述工作，金管局採納與國際一致及協調的方法。\n\n# 2020年回顧\n\n# 監管工作概覽\n\n金管局在2020年共進行186次非現場審查，涵蓋範圍甚廣，包括認可機構的CAMEL評估、企業管治、風險管理及金融科技策略。為繼續加強認可機構的風險管治水平，金管局與認可機構董事局、獨立非執行董事或董事局轄下委員會共舉行30次會議，並與認可機構及其外聘核數師共舉行30次三方聯席會議。\n\n除了非現場審查工作外，金管局亦進行定期現場審查，並以專題評估作為配合，以審視被評估屬較高風險的範疇。金管局於年內共進行610次現場審查及專題評估，並繼續以信用風險管理作為審查及評估的主要重點之一。另一個重點是在新冠病毒疫情下的業務操作風險及科技風險管理。此外，金管局又增加針對流動性及市場風險管理的現場審查及專題評估次數。同時，專項審查小組亦對認可機構的證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（強積金）相關業務進行現場審查及專題評估。\n\n儘管面對疫情，金管局維持監管力度，並作出彈性安排，靈活有效地履行監管職責，包括在提交申報表及進行現場審查方面給予彈性處理的空間；加強數據收集以補足現場審查，以及利用網上會議平台。\n\n表1載有金管局於2020年的監管工作概要。\n\n表 1 監管工作概要\n\n# 信用風險的監管\n\n# 信貸增長及資產質素\n\n2020年貸款總額增加1.2%，2019年的增幅為6.7%。表2列載各類貸款及墊款的增長情況。\n\n表 2 貸款及墊款的增長\n\n於2020年，內地相關貸款總額略為減少0.2%至45,530億港元（表3）。\n\n表 3 內地相關貸款增長\n\n受到新冠病毒疫情影響，認可機構的資產質素略為轉差。年內銀行業的特定分類貸款比率由0.57%上升至0.90%，仍維持在穩健水平，遠低於2000年以來的長期平均水平1.8%。內地相關貸款方面，相關比率亦由一年前的0.75%上升至0.96%。\n\n鑑於與新冠病毒疫情相關的不明朗因素為經濟帶來重大挑戰，金管局深入檢視認可機構資產質素，以評估資產質素轉差的趨勢。尤其金管局透過收集有關銀行在行業及借款人層面的信用風險承擔數據，加強對大額借款人及在目前的經濟環境下較易受影響行業的監察。金管局進行的特別壓力測試分析顯示，銀行有能力抵禦新冠病毒疫情帶來的經濟壓力。\n\n年內金管局進行專題評估，檢視認可機構對內地相關貸款、同業貸款，以及對私人銀行及財富管理客戶的有抵押貸款等不同範疇的信用風險管理方法。\n\n# 紓緩客戶資金周轉壓力的措施\n\n因應新冠病毒疫情爆發，金管局於2019年10月成立的銀行業中小企貸款協調機制（協調機制）推出多輪協助企業及個人客戶的紓緩措施，鼓勵銀行在審慎風險管理原則容許下繼續支持借款人的融資需要。其中最主要的是協調機制於5月推出的「預先批核還息不還本」計劃。計劃下合資格的企業客戶的所有貸款本金還款可延期6個月。該計劃在11月延長6個月後，在2021年3月再度延長6個月至10月底。該計劃約有100間銀行參與，覆蓋12萬合資格企業客戶。截至12月底，銀行共批出58,000多宗企業客戶貸款展期及其他支援措施的個案，涉及金額超過7,400億港元。個人客戶方面，銀行亦推出住宅按揭「還息不還本」計劃，「居者有其屋計劃」下資助房屋的相關按揭亦涵蓋在內。此外，銀行亦提供應急貸款予從事受疫情嚴重打擊行業的客戶、延長個人貸款期限，以及下調各種個人信貸的收費。截至12月底，銀行共批出28,000多宗住宅按揭「還息不還本」及其他個人應急貸款的個案，涉及金額超過440億港元。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n金管局自2009年起先後推出多輪逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施，已經加強銀行的風險管理及香港銀行體系應對本港樓市一旦突然逆轉的抵禦能力。新批出住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數於2020年12月為57%，而有關按揭成數於2009年9月推出首輪逆周期措施前為64%。2020年新批出住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數有所上升，主要由於當中涉及按揭保險的貸款的佔比有所增加，而這類貸款的按揭成數一般較高。新批出按揭的平均供款與入息比率亦維持在低水平，於12月為37%，而在2010年8月首度推出有關比率上限時為41%（圖1）。\n\n考慮到非住宅物業的價格走勢與交投量、經濟基調及外圍環境等因素，金管局在8月放寬非住宅物業按揭貸款的逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施，將這類貸款的適用按揭成數上限上調10個百分點，一般個案的上限由四成上調至五成。\n\n圖

業務操作及科技風險的監管\n\n因應2020年初爆發新冠病毒疫情，金管局採取連串措施減低疫情對銀行業務運作的影響。有關措施包括要求認可機構檢討其持續業務運作計劃，並採取適當的預防措施，以保障員工與客戶的健康，以及維持重要銀行服務。此外，金管局提醒認可機構加強與員工及客戶的溝通，就其處所可能出現確診個案的情況作好準備，以及制定應對較為嚴峻但可能發生的風險情境的持續業務運作計劃。金管局與業界保持緊密聯繫，又要求認可機構保持警覺，並因應疫情的最新發展及政府的社交距離措施，不時審視其持續業務運作計劃。\n\n金管局完成對「網絡防衛計劃」的全面檢討及廣泛的業界諮詢後，於11月推出「網絡防衛計劃2.0」，因應海外網絡風險管理的最新做法，進一步提升「網絡防衛計劃」。當中「網絡防衛評估框架」加入了有關網絡事故應對及恢復的最新國際穩健做法。「網絡防衛計劃」下的「專業培訓計劃」方面，資歷認證清單的範圍有所擴大，納入主要海外地區的同等資歷。金管局又向香港銀行公會（銀行公會）提出多項建議，令「網絡風險資訊共享平台」更易於使用。「網絡防衛計劃2.0」於2021年1月1日生效。\n\n# 智慧銀行\n\n經過在「金融科技監管沙盒」進行嚴謹的測試與試行後，所有在2019年獲發銀行牌照的8間虛擬銀行都已經於年內開業。虛擬銀行運用創新科技，提供全新的客戶體驗，例如利用大數據分析進行中小企貸款的信貸評估，以加快貸款批核程序。為加強客戶參與及建立客戶對品牌的忠誠，部分虛擬銀行更在其定期存款及獎賞計劃等服務中加入遊戲元素。\n\n# 流動性及市場風險的監管\n\n金管局在4月推出一系列措施，確保銀行同業市場及銀行體系在疫情下繼續暢順運作。這些措施包括釐清「金管局流動資金安排」的操作細則及推出臨時美元流動資金安排，並重申在監管架構下認可機構可使用流動性緩衝的彈性。金管局又與認可機構進行演習，確保認可機構已經作好準備，能夠在有需要時運用這些措施。\n","terms":{"月":["month"],"暢順":["smooth"],"前":["ahead"],"幣作":["currency"],"銀行":["bank","banking","banks","bank(s)","banking

challenges posed to the economy by the COVID-19 outbreak, Hong Kong’s banking system remained robust in 2020. Throughout the year, in addition to closely monitoring the impact of the pandemic on banking operations and regulatory activities and responding flexibly, the HKMA continued to focus its regulatory efforts on credit and liquidity risk management at authorised institutions. Given the increasing cyber threats and the growing adoption of financial technology in the banking sector, the HKMA strengthened its oversight of technology risk management and operational resilience at authorised institutions. The HKMA also worked closely with banks and international organisations to facilitate the industry’s transition to alternative reference rates.\n\nIn terms of conduct regulation, the HKMA provided authorised institutions with flexibility in complying with regulatory requirements and offered guidance to help banks maintain their operations and continue serving customers during the pandemic, while ensuring that investors and consumers remained protected. Together with relevant authorities, the HKMA formulated proposed implementation details for the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect pilot scheme and consulted the industry. The HKMA collaborated with the Securities and Futures Commission to provide guidance on streamlining sales procedures for family offices and high-net-worth, financially sophisticated investors. Additionally, the HKMA enhanced consumer protection in digital financial services and continued to promote a customer-centric corporate culture.\n\nIn the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing, the HKMA took swift action, clarifying how a risk-based approach and technology could help authorised institutions respond more effectively to situations related to the COVID-19 pandemic, while also prudently addressing the impact of escalating geopolitical tensions on the banking system. The HKMA continued to support measures aimed at enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing efforts. These included increasing the number of authorised institutions participating in public-private partnerships for information sharing and supporting the banking sector’s adoption of compliance technology. The HKMA also launched a programme to further strengthen its monitoring capabilities in anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing, in line with international developments in technology and data usage.\n\nMeanwhile, the HKMA worked closely with the banking sector to optimise regulatory policies and procedures and implement measures to enhance talent professionalism. Hong Kong made good progress in implementing international regulatory standards, including capital adequacy and disclosure standards. In promoting the development of green and sustainable banking, the HKMA has entered the second of three phases and is formulating relevant regulatory requirements. The HKMA also continued to ensure that Hong Kong has a credible resolution regime for authorised institutions, including by developing new resolution standards and implementing rules on loss-absorbing capacity to enhance the resolvability of authorised institutions.\n\n# Objectives\n\nOne of the HKMA’s overall objectives is to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this objective relies on building and maintaining a financial system that is highly resilient and capable of providing critical financial services needed by the Hong Kong economy.\n\nBanks may affect the stability of the banking system due to their mode of operation, or even, in extreme cases, due to disorderly failure. As a regulator, the Chief Executive of the Financial Management Authority plays a crucial role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring that banks are able to withstand shocks, manage crises and recover from crises, ultimately helping to prevent failures. The Chief Executive of the Financial Management Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks and the authorisation of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong (collectively referred to as \"authorised institutions\"). The Chief Executive of the Financial Management Authority is also responsible for the designation and supervision of certain financial market infrastructures.\n\nHowever, the Chief Executive of the Financial Management Authority cannot guarantee that the financial system is risk-free, and Hong Kong’s prudential regulatory regime is not designed to ensure \"zero risk\". As one of the resolution authorities, the Chief Executive of the Financial Management Authority strives to ensure that, should an authorised institution become unsustainable, its failure can be handled in an orderly manner. To this end, Hong Kong has established a financial institution resolution regime, under which the Chief Executive of the Financial Management Authority is the resolution authority for authorised institutions (and other types of institutions). To implement Hong Kong’s resolution regime, it is necessary to develop resolution rules and policy standards, conduct resolution planning to remove obstacles to the resolvability of authorised institutions, and build the HKMA’s operational capability to resolve authorised institutions that are on the verge of failure. To effectively carry out the above work, the HKMA adopts an internationally consistent and coordinated approach.\n\n# Review of 2020\n\n# Overview of regulatory work\n\nIn 2020, the HKMA conducted 186 off-site inspections covering a wide range of areas, including CAMEL assessments, corporate governance, risk management and fintech strategies at authorised institutions. To further enhance the risk governance level at authorised institutions, the HKMA held 30 meetings with the boards of authorised institutions, independent non-executive directors or board committees, and 30 tripartite meetings with authorised institutions and their external auditors.\n\nIn addition to off-site inspections, the HKMA conducted regular on-site inspections and thematic assessments to review areas deemed to be of higher risk. During the year, the HKMA conducted 610 on-site inspections and thematic assessments, continuing to focus primarily on credit risk management. Another focus was operational risk and technology risk management in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The HKMA also increased the number of on-site inspections and thematic assessments on liquidity and market risk management. Meanwhile, the Special Inspection Team conducted on-site inspections and thematic assessments of authorised institutions’ securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses.\n\nDespite the pandemic, the HKMA maintained its regulatory intensity and made flexible arrangements to discharge its regulatory responsibilities effectively. These included providing flexibility in the submission of returns and the conduct of on-site inspections; enhancing data collection to supplement on-site inspections; and using online meeting platforms.\n\nTable 1 provides an overview of the HKMA’s regulatory work in 2020.\n\nTable 1: Overview of regulatory work\n\n# Supervision of credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nTotal loans increased by 1.2% in 2020, compared with an increase of 6.7% in 2019. Table 2 shows the growth of various types of loans and advances.\n\nTable 2: Growth of loans and advances\n\nIn 2020, total mainland-related loans decreased slightly by 0.2% to HK$4,553 billion (Table 3).\n\nTable 3: Growth of mainland-related loans\n\nAffected by the COVID-19 pandemic, the asset quality of authorised institutions deteriorated slightly. During the year, the specific classified loan ratio of the banking sector increased from 0.57% to 0.90%, which remained at a healthy level, far below the long-term average of 1.8% since 2000. For mainland-related loans, the relevant ratio also increased from 0.75% a year ago to 0.96%.\n\nGiven the significant challenges posed to the economy by the uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the HKMA conducted an in-depth review of the asset quality of authorised institutions to assess the trend of asset quality deterioration. In particular, the HKMA strengthened its monitoring of large borrowers and industries more vulnerable in the current economic environment by collecting data on banks’ credit risk exposure at the industry and borrower levels. The special stress test analysis conducted by the HKMA showed that banks were capable of withstanding the economic pressure brought by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA conducted thematic assessments to review authorised institutions’ credit risk management approaches in different areas, including mainland-related loans, interbank loans, and mortgage loans to private banking and wealth management customers.\n\n# Measures to relieve customers’ cash flow pressure\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 outbreak, the Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism (Coordination Mechanism) established by the HKMA in October 2019 launched multiple rounds of relief measures to assist corporate and individual customers, encouraging banks to continue supporting borrowers’ financing needs under prudent risk management principles. The most significant of these was the “pre-approved principal payment holiday” scheme launched by the Coordination Mechanism in May. Under the scheme, all principal repayments of eligible corporate customers’ loans could be deferred for six months. After being extended for six months in November, the scheme was further extended for another six months to end-October 2021 in March 2021. Around 100 banks participated in the scheme, covering 120,000 eligible corporate customers. As at end-December, banks had approved over 58,000 cases of loan extensions and other support measures for corporate customers, involving an amount of over HK$740 billion. For individual customers, banks also launched a residential mortgage “principal payment holiday” scheme, which also covered mortgages for subsidised housing under the Home Ownership Scheme. In addition, banks provided emergency loans to customers in industries severely affected by the pandemic, extended personal loan tenors, and reduced fees for various personal credit products. As at end-December, banks had approved over 28,000 cases of residential mortgage “principal payment holiday” and other personal emergency loans, involving an amount of over HK$44 billion.\n\n# Property mortgage loans\n\nSince 2009, the HKMA has introduced a series of countercyclical macroprudential regulatory measures to strengthen banks’ risk management and the resilience of the Hong Kong banking system to a sudden downturn in the local property market. The average loan-to-value ratio of newly approved residential mortgage loans was 57% in December 2020, compared with 64% before the introduction of the first round of countercyclical measures in September 2009. The average loan-to-value ratio of newly approved residential mortgage loans increased in 2020, mainly due to the higher proportion of loans involving mortgage insurance, which generally have a higher loan-to-value ratio. The average debt-to-income ratio of newly approved mortgages also remained at a low level, at 37% in December, compared with 41% when the cap on the ratio was first introduced in August 2010 (Chart 1).\n\nConsidering the price trend and trading volume of non-residential properties, economic fundamentals and external environment, the HKMA relaxed the countercyclical macroprudential regulatory measures for non-residential property mortgage loans in August, raising the applicable loan-to-value ratio cap for such loans by 10 percentage points, with the general case cap increased from 40% to 50%.\n\nChart 1: Average loan-to-value ratio and debt-to-income ratio of newly approved residential mortgage loans\n\n# Supervision of operational and technology risks\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 outbreak in early 2020, the HKMA took a series of measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on banking operations. These measures included requiring authorised institutions to review their business continuity plans and take appropriate preventive measures to protect the health of employees and customers and maintain critical banking services. The HKMA also reminded authorised institutions to strengthen communication with employees and customers, prepare for possible confirmed cases in their premises, and formulate business continuity plans to cope with more severe but possible risk scenarios. The HKMA maintained close contact with the industry and required authorised institutions to remain vigilant and review their business continuity plans from time to time in light of the latest developments of the pandemic and the government’s social distancing measures.\n\nAfter completing a comprehensive review of the “Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework” and extensive industry consultation, the HKMA launched the “Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0” in November to further enhance the framework in line with the latest overseas practices in cyber risk management. The updated framework incorporated the latest international sound practices on cyber incident response and recovery. Under the “Professional Training Programme” of the framework, the scope of the qualifications recognition list was expanded to include equivalent qualifications from major overseas regions. The HKMA also made several suggestions to the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB) to make the “Cyber Risk Information Sharing Platform” more user-friendly. The “Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0” came into effect on 1 January 2021.\n\n# Smart banking\n\nAfter rigorous testing and trial in the “Fintech Regulatory Sandbox”, all eight virtual banks that were granted banking licences in 2019 commenced operations during the year. Virtual banks leverage innovative technologies to provide a new customer experience, such as using big data analytics for credit assessment of SME loans to speed up the loan approval process. To enhance customer engagement and build brand loyalty, some virtual banks have also incorporated gaming elements into their services, such as time deposits and reward programmes.\n\n# Supervision of liquidity and market risks\n\nIn April, the HKMA introduced a series of measures to ensure that the interbank market and the banking system continued to operate smoothly during the pandemic. These measures included clarifying the operational details of the “HKMA Liquidity Facility” and introducing a temporary US dollar liquidity facility, as well as reiterating the flexibility for authorised institutions to use liquidity buffers under the regulatory framework. The HKMA also conducted drills with authorised institutions to ensure that they were prepared to use these measures when needed."}
{"zh":"# 香港的國際金融中心地位\n\n香港繼續是具全球競爭力的國際金融中心。年內金管局採取多項措施，促進銀行及支付行業開發與應用金融科技。在新冠病毒疫情下年內快速支付系統「轉數快」交易量急增。\n\n香港位處內地金融市場對外開放的要衝，能充分把握開放過程中的契機。憑藉世界級的市場基建以及「滬港通」、「深港通」與「債券通」，香港既是深受內地企業垂青的集資平台，亦是國際投資者進入增長迅速的內地市場的窗口。年內在促進粵港澳大灣區金融合作，尤其便利香港居民在大灣區內使用金融及銀行服務方面取得良好進展。\n\n與此同時，金管局積極開拓新機遇，提升香港金融平台，包括資產及財富管理、企業財資中心，以及可持續金融範疇的競爭力。金管局亦加強市場推廣，向海外及內地持份者推廣香港的金融服務。在環球層面，金管局在多個區內及國際委員會擔當領導角色，充分凸顯香港在相關國際工作的專業知識及承擔。\n\n# 概覽\n\n為鞏固香港的亞洲金融科技樞紐地位，金管局繼續致力實施各項措施，促進銀行及支付行業開發與應用科技。年內的主要進展包括：\n- 推動更廣泛使用快速支付系統「轉數快」；\n- 促進銀行業實施開放應用程式介面（開放API）；\n- 連接貿易融資平台「貿易聯動」與中國人民銀行（人民銀行）轄下的貿易金融區塊鏈平台，促進貿易融資數碼化；\n- 研究央行數碼貨幣於跨境支付的應用；\n- 探討「商業數據通」的技術可行性及研究新類型信貸評分模型，以助中小型企業（中小企）獲取融資；\n- 公布旨在發展更具規模及更多元的合規科技生態圈的兩年計劃，進一步推動合規科技的應用；\n- 加強培育人才；及\n- 推進跨境金融科技合作。\n\n金管局金融科技促進辦公室(FFO)與金管局各銀行部門聯手，在推動上述措施中發揮關鍵作用。\n\n隨着主要金融市場指數開始加入內地在岸證券或增加其權重，流入人民幣資產的資金繼續加快步伐。香港得天獨厚，憑藉連繫內地資本市場的「滬港通」、「深港通」及「債券通」，在促進國際投資者增加人民幣資產配置方面發揮關鍵的作用。在2020年，「債券通」平均每日交易額增加82%，至約193億元人民幣。為完善「債券通」運作，金管局推出新措施，包括新設特別結算周期服務、延長交易時間及引入新安排，讓投資者在選擇銀行進行貨幣兌換與外幣對沖方面有較多彈性。繼「債券通」北向通取得成功，金管局又與人民銀行組成工作小組研究南向通的框架。\n\n金管局亦繼續致力加強香港與粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）內地城市之間的金融配套措施。內地當局公布一系列政策措施，支持區內金融發展。於6月，人民銀行、金管局與澳門金融管理局（澳門金管局）聯合宣布決定實施跨境「理財通」。金管局一直與內地和本地當局以及業界緊密合作，制定有關實施細則。金管局亦就其他措施與內地當局保持聯繫，尋求為香港銀行擴大政策空間拓展更廣闊的跨境業務範疇。年內，香港繼續保持作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位。香港的人民幣即時支付結算(RTGS)系統平均每日交易額創出1.2萬億元人民幣的新高。\n\n金管局積極開拓新機遇，提升香港金融平台競爭力。為促進香港基金業務的發展，金管局與政府及業界緊密合作，為基金在本地落戶締造更有利的稅務及監管環境。金管局亦投入大量工作，繼續提升香港作為區內綠色及可持續金融樞紐的地位。與此同時，金管局加強市場推廣，向海外及內地持份者推廣香港的金融服務。\n\n在中央銀行領域，金管局在多個區內及國際委員會擔當領導角色。例如，金管局為巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（巴塞爾委員會）轄下政策及標準小組，以及東亞及太平洋地區中央銀行會議(EMEAP)轄下金融市場工作小組主席。金管局亦擔任金融穩定理事會轄下非銀行監察專家小組及金融創新網絡聯席主席，並領導探討基準過渡相關監管事項的小組。\n\n香港金融基建的安全及有效運作，為香港的國際金融中心地位奠定穩固基礎。處理銀行同業交易的4個RTGS系統、債務工具中央結算系統（CMU系統）及香港交易資料儲存庫（香港儲存庫）在2020年達到100%的系統可供使用率，高於99.95%的目標水平。透過於內地兩個中央證券託管機構的帳戶，CMU系統繼續協助結算「債券通」北向通交易，以及替相關CMU系統成員持有內地債務證券。\n\n轉數快使用量在2020年繼續增長。截至2020年底合共錄得690萬個登記，全年交易量較2019年上升兩倍。政府接受以轉數快繳費及更多商戶採用，是轉數快在個人對個人支付穩步增長以外，交易額錄得顯著增長的主要原因。\n\n為確保本地零售支付業的整體安全及效率，金管局根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（《支付條例》）指定及監察6個零售支付系統。金管局亦繼續監管18個儲值支付工具持牌人。\n\n# 2020年回顧\n\n# 香港的亞洲金融科技樞紐地位\n\n# 轉數快\n\n自2018年9月轉數快推出以來，已有35間銀行及12間儲值支付工具營運商加入，其中在2020年增加了5間銀行及1間儲值支付工具營運商。轉數快使用量亦穩步增長。截至12月31日，轉數快共錄得690萬個登記（圖1）。為方便市民收取由機構發出的款項，轉數快於12月6日起新增以香港身份證號碼作帳戶識別代號。引入這項功能後不足1個月已錄得超過110,000個登記。這項新功能並非用於個人對個人轉帳，只供已有收款人身份證號碼的機構發放款項（例如發放薪酬）之用。由於每名市民的身份證號碼都是獨一無二，市民利用香港身份證號碼作為帳戶識別代號，即使不提供銀行帳戶號碼都能夠確保準確收取款項。\n\n圖 1 轉數快帳戶登記數目\n\n新冠病毒疫情及保持社交距離措施為使用電子支付服務帶來新動力。年內轉數快交易量增長尤其迅速（圖2），於2020年12月的平均每日交易量達505,000宗即時交易（涉及52億港元及9,500萬元人民幣），相當於2019年12月168,000宗的3倍，更是2018年10月轉數快推出首月的10倍。轉數快使用量增加，亦受惠於應用範圍逐步擴大，由最初主要用作個人對個人支付，逐步擴展至繳付帳單（包括政府帳單）、零售及商業支付。\n\n圖 2 港元即時支付平均每日交易數字\n\n金管局與多個政府部門及銀行業一直合作，將轉數快的應用範圍由個人對個人支付，擴展至繳付帳單及其他商戶支付。政府於2019年11月起接受以轉數快繳付帳單，以推廣使用轉數快及便利市民。市民以支援轉數快的手機銀行或電子錢包掃描印於帳單上的二維碼，即可輕鬆繳付稅款、差餉及地租、水費及政府發出的一般繳費單。截至2020年12月經轉數快繳付政府帳單的交易達180萬宗，涉及22億港元。繼繳付政府帳單服務成功推出後，再有4個政府部門由2020年12月21日起接受在指定繳費櫃枱及自助服務機以轉數快二維碼繳費。政府亦正在探討於網上採用轉數快付款的安排。\n\n另一正面的發展是越來越多大小商戶採用轉數快以加強業務營運。支付商戶的交易在2020年12月急增至平均每日100,000宗，較2019年12月增加38倍轉數快普遍用作繳付帳單、應用程式內直接扣帳，以及進行其他網上購物。電子錢包日益普及，亦帶動了以轉數快為帳戶增值的交易量顯著增長。2020年12月平均每日增值的交易量，是2019年12月的7倍。\n\n為加強市民對轉數快的認識，金管局製作各類教育及宣傳資料，包括電視廣告及在社交媒體平台提供一系列精明使用錦囊。金管局亦舉辦中學生Whatsapp Stickers設計比賽，增加他們對電子支付的認識。此外，金管局向多個慈善團體及街市營運商推廣使用轉數快收付款項。多間參與轉數快的銀行及儲值支付工具營運商亦推出宣傳活動，包括提供優惠，吸引客戶登記及利用轉數快轉帳及支付帳單。在2020年的成果上，金管局在2021年初與銀行及儲值支付工具營運商合作，推廣透過轉數快以電子方式派利是。一方面金管局推出宣傳活動，另一方面銀行及儲值支付工具營運商則提供優惠，鼓勵客戶以電子方式派利是，既環保又有助抗疫。\n\n# 開放應用程式介面\n\n金管局繼續促進銀行業按照開放API框架研發及提供開放API。該框架分4個階段實施，銀行已推出第一及第二階段開放API，並以這些開放API與第三方服務提供者合作，開拓各項創新服務，提升客戶體驗。另一方面，金管局就實施第三及第四階段開放API進行調查研究，並於11月刊發小冊子，刊載調查結果。\n\n# 貿易聯動\n\n為使進出口商獲得更方便的貿易融資服務，金管局於年內展開概念驗證研究，探討連接「貿易聯動」與人民銀行轄下的貿易金融區塊鏈平台。該研究的首階段於年內第4季完成，並隨後開始試行。香港和內地銀行已用該連接成功完成多項跨境貿易融資交易。\n\n# 跨境支付\n\n央行數碼貨幣方面，金管局與泰國中央銀行繼續進行聯合研究，探討央行數碼貨幣於跨境支付的應用藉此促進香港與泰國兩地銀行之間港元和泰銖的外匯交易同步交收。雙方完成第一階段研究，並於1月發表聯合報告闡述主要研究結果；另亦開發以區塊鏈為基礎的跨境走廊網絡原型，致力提高跨境支付的效率及降低成本。項目第二階段已展開，旨在探討跨境貿易結算及資本市場交易的商業應用案例。其他央行亦對項目深感興趣。國際結算銀行、阿拉伯聯合酋長國中央銀行和人民銀行數字貨幣研究所於2021年初宣布參與項目。\n","terms":{"月":["month"],"暢順":["smooth"],"前":["ahead"],"幣作":["currency"],"銀行":["bank","banking","banks","bank(s)","banking

Kong remains a globally competitive international financial centre. During the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) implemented a number of measures to promote the development and application of fintech by the banking and payment industries. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, transaction volumes under the Faster Payment System (FPS) surged during the year.\n\nHong Kong is strategically located at the forefront of the opening up of mainland China’s financial market, and is able to fully capitalise on the opportunities arising from the process. Leveraging its world-class market infrastructure and the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect, Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect and Bond Connect programmes, Hong Kong is both a fundraising platform favoured by mainland enterprises and a gateway for international investors to access the rapidly growing mainland market. Good progress was made during the year in promoting financial cooperation in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), particularly in facilitating Hong Kong residents’ use of financial and banking services within the GBA.\n\nAt the same time, the HKMA actively explored new opportunities to enhance Hong Kong’s financial platform, including the competitiveness of asset and wealth management, corporate treasury centres, and sustainable finance. The HKMA also stepped up market promotion to promote Hong Kong’s financial services to overseas and mainland stakeholders. At the global level, the HKMA played a leading role in a number of regional and international committees, fully demonstrating Hong Kong’s expertise and commitment in related international work.\n\n# Overview\n\nTo consolidate Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia, the HKMA continued to implement various measures to promote the development and application of technology by the banking and payment industries. Key developments during the year included:\n- Promoting wider use of the Faster Payment System (FPS).\n- Encouraging the banking sector to implement open application programming interfaces (open APIs).\n- Connecting the trade finance platform eTradeConnect with the trade finance blockchain platform under the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) to promote the digitalisation of trade finance.\n- Studying the application of central bank digital currency in cross-border payments.\n- Exploring the technical feasibility of Commercial Data Interchange and studying new types of credit scoring models to help small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) obtain financing.\n- Announcing a two-year plan aimed at developing a more extensive and diversified Regtech ecosystem to further promote the application of Regtech.\n- Strengthening talent development.\n- Advancing cross-border fintech cooperation.\n\nThe HKMA’s Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO) and various banking departments of the HKMA worked together to play a key role in promoting the above measures.\n\nAs major financial market indices began to include mainland China’s onshore securities or increase their weightings, the inflow of funds into renminbi assets continued to accelerate. Hong Kong is uniquely positioned to play a key role in encouraging international investors to increase their allocation of renminbi assets, leveraging the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect, Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect and Bond Connect programmes that link it to mainland China’s capital market. In 2020, the average daily trading volume of Bond Connect increased by 82% to about RMB19.3 billion. To improve the operation of Bond Connect, the HKMA introduced new measures, including a new special settlement cycle service, extended trading hours and new arrangements to give investors more flexibility in choosing banks for currency exchange and foreign currency hedging. Following the success of the northbound trading of Bond Connect, the HKMA and the PBoC formed a working group to study the framework for southbound trading.\n\nThe HKMA also continued to work to strengthen financial infrastructure between Hong Kong and the mainland cities in the GBA. The mainland authorities announced a series of policy measures to support financial development in the region. In June, the PBoC, the HKMA and the Monetary Authority of Macao (AMCM) jointly announced the decision to implement the cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect. The HKMA has been working closely with the mainland and local authorities and the industry to formulate the implementation details. The HKMA also maintained contact with the mainland authorities on other measures to seek to expand the policy space for Hong Kong banks to expand their cross-border business scope more broadly. During the year, Hong Kong maintained its position as a global offshore renminbi business hub. The average daily transaction volume of Hong Kong’s Renminbi Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system reached a new high of RMB1.2 trillion.\n\nThe HKMA actively explored new opportunities to enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. To promote the development of Hong Kong’s fund industry, the HKMA worked closely with the government and the industry to create a more favourable tax and regulatory environment for funds to establish a presence locally. The HKMA also devoted a lot of effort to continue to enhance Hong Kong’s position as a regional green and sustainable finance hub. At the same time, the HKMA stepped up market promotion to promote Hong Kong’s financial services to overseas and mainland stakeholders.\n\nIn the area of central banking, the HKMA played a leading role in a number of regional and international committees. For example, the HKMA chaired the Policy and Standards Sub-group under the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) and the Financial Markets Working Group under the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia and Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP). The HKMA also co-chaired the Non-Bank Supervision Expert Group and the Financial Innovation Network under the Financial Stability Board, and led a group to discuss regulatory issues related to benchmark transition.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure provides a solid foundation for Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre. The four RTGS systems for processing interbank transactions, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) system for debt instruments and the Hong Kong Trade Repository achieved a system availability rate of 100% in 2020, exceeding the target level of 99.95%. Through accounts with two central securities depositories in mainland China, the CMU system continued to assist in the settlement of northbound Bond Connect transactions and to hold mainland debt securities for relevant CMU system members.\n\nThe usage of FPS continued to grow in 2020. As at the end of 2020, a total of 6.9 million registrations had been recorded, with transaction volumes for the year doubling compared with 2019. The government’s acceptance of FPS for payments and the increased adoption by merchants were the main reasons for the significant growth in transaction volumes, in addition to the steady growth in person-to-person payments using FPS.\n\nTo ensure the overall safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA designated and monitored six retail payment systems under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (the Payment Ordinance). The HKMA also continued to supervise 18 licensees of stored value payment instruments.\n\n# Review of 2020\n\n# Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia\n\n# Faster Payment System (FPS)\n\nSince the launch of FPS in September 2018, 35 banks and 12 stored value payment instrument operators have joined, with five banks and one stored value payment instrument operator added in 2020. The usage of FPS also grew steadily. As at 31 December, FPS recorded a total of 6.9 million registrations (Chart 1). To facilitate citizens in receiving payments issued by organisations, FPS added the use of Hong Kong identity card numbers as account proxies on 6 December. Within less than one month after the introduction of this function, over 110,000 registrations were recorded. This new function is not for person-to-person transfers, but only for organisations that already have the payee’s identity card number to issue payments (e.g. salary payments). As each citizen’s identity card number is unique, citizens can use their Hong Kong identity card number as an account proxy to ensure accurate receipt of payments even without providing a bank account number.\n\nChart 1 Number of FPS account registrations\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing measures provided new impetus for the use of electronic payment services. FPS transaction volumes grew particularly rapidly during the year (Chart 2), with an average daily transaction volume of 505,000 immediate transactions in December 2020 (involving HK$5.2 billion and RMB95 million), equivalent to three times the 168,000 transactions in December 2019, and 10 times the first month after the launch of FPS in October 2018. The increase in FPS usage also benefited from the gradual expansion of its application scope, from initially being used mainly for person-to-person payments to bill payments (including government bills), retail and commercial payments.\n\nChart 2 Average daily transaction figures for HK dollar immediate payments\n\nThe HKMA has been working with various government departments and the banking sector to expand the application scope of FPS from person-to-person payments to bill payments and other merchant payments. Since November 2019, the government has accepted FPS for bill payments to promote the use of FPS and facilitate citizens. Citizens can use their FPS-supported mobile banking or e-wallets to scan the QR code printed on the bill to easily pay taxes, rates and rent, water charges and general payment orders issued by the government. As at December 2020, 1.8 million government bill payments had been made through FPS, involving HK$2.2 billion. Following the successful launch of the government bill payment service, four more government departments began accepting FPS QR code payments at designated payment counters and self-service machines from 21 December 2020. The government is also exploring arrangements for online FPS payments.\n\nAnother positive development is that more and more merchants, large and small, are adopting FPS to enhance their business operations. Merchant payment transactions surged to an average of 100,000 per day in December 2020, a 38-fold increase compared with December 2019. FPS is commonly used for bill payments, in-app direct debits, and other online shopping. The growing popularity of e-wallets has also driven a significant increase in the volume of transactions using FPS for account top-ups. The average daily top-up transaction volume in December 2020 was seven times that of December 2019.\n\nTo enhance public awareness of FPS, the HKMA produced various educational and promotional materials, including TV advertisements and a series of smart usage tips on social media platforms. The HKMA also organised a WhatsApp Stickers design competition for secondary school students to increase their knowledge of electronic payments. In addition, the HKMA promoted the use of FPS for receiving and making payments to a number of charitable organisations and market operators. A number of banks and stored value payment instrument operators participating in FPS also launched promotional activities, including offering incentives to encourage customers to register and use FPS for transfers and bill payments. Building on the achievements of 2020, the HKMA worked with banks and stored value payment instrument operators in early 2021 to promote the use of FPS for electronic red packet distribution. While the HKMA launched a promotional campaign, banks and stored value payment instrument operators offered incentives to encourage customers to distribute red packets electronically, which is both environmentally friendly and helpful in fighting the pandemic.\n\n# Open application programming interface\n\nThe HKMA continued to encourage the banking sector to develop and provide open APIs in accordance with the open API framework. The framework is implemented in four phases, and banks have launched the first and second phases of open APIs, and have used these open APIs to cooperate with third-party service providers to develop various innovative services and enhance customer experience. On the other hand, the HKMA conducted research on the implementation of the third and fourth phases of open APIs, and published a booklet containing the research findings in November.\n\n# eTradeConnect\n\nTo enable importers and exporters to access more convenient trade finance services, the HKMA conducted a proof-of-concept study during the year to explore the connection of eTradeConnect with the trade finance blockchain platform under the PBoC. The first phase of the study was completed in the fourth quarter of the year, and a pilot run was subsequently launched. Banks in Hong Kong and mainland China have successfully completed a number of cross-border trade finance transactions using the connection.\n\n# Cross-border payments\n\nIn terms of central bank digital currency, the HKMA and the Bank of Thailand continued their joint research on the application of central bank digital currency in cross-border payments to promote synchronous foreign exchange settlement of HK dollars and Thai baht between banks in Hong Kong and Thailand. The two sides completed the first phase of the study and published a joint report outlining the main research findings in January; they also developed a blockchain-based cross-border corridor network prototype to improve the efficiency of cross-border payments and reduce costs. The second phase of the project has begun, with the aim of exploring commercial use cases for cross-border trade settlement and capital market transactions. Other central banks are also very interested in the project. The Bank for International Settlements, the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates and the Digital Currency Research Institute of the PBoC announced their participation in the project in early 2021."}
{"zh":"# 儲備管理\n\n2020年是峰迴路轉的一年，新冠病毒疫情為全球經濟帶來前所未有的挑戰。資產市場於第1 季經歷了大幅調整和震盪後，在主要央行推出超寬鬆的貨幣政策及各地政府實施大規模的財政紓困措施帶動下，得以迅速反彈。由於主要央行大幅下調基準利率並重啟量化寬鬆措施，令國債收益率顯著下跌、債券價格上升。在此投資環境下，外匯基金在2020 年錄得2,358 億港元的投資收入，回報率為5.3%。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》，外匯基金的首要目的是直接或間接影響港元匯價，亦可運用於保持香港貨幣及金融體系穩定健全，藉此保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。金管局根據財政司司長轉授的權力及轉授權力的條款，就外匯基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標及組合架構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會為外匯基金制定下列投資目標：\n(a) 保障資本；\n(b) 確保整體貨幣基礎在任何時候都由流通性極高的美元資產提供十足支持；\n(c) 確保流動資金足以維持貨幣及金融穩定；以及\n(d) 在符合上述(a)至(c)項的前提下盡量爭取投資回報，以保障基金的長期購買力。\n\n以上目標全面顧及外匯基金的法定目的，並已於外匯基金的組合結構及目標資產配置中反映。\n\n外匯基金大致上分成兩個主要組合：支持組合及投資組合。支持組合持有流通性極高的美元資產，按照貨幣發行局制度的規定為貨幣基礎提供十足支持。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債市及股市，以保障資產的價值及長期購買力。\n\n為能更妥善管理風險及提高中長期回報，金管局以審慎及循序漸進方式將外匯基金的部分資產配置於較多元化的資產類別，包括新興巿場及內地債券與股票、私募股權（包括基建）及房地產。新興巿場及內地債券與股票由投資組合持有，私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合持有。長期增長組合的市值上限為外匯基金累計盈餘的三分之一，以及未來基金存款與外匯基金附屬公司存款中與長期增長組合掛鈎部分的總和。\n\n策略性資產組合於2007年設立，一直持有政府基於策略性目的而為外匯基金帳目購入的香港交易及結算所有限公司股份。由於這個組合性質獨特，因此外匯基金的投資表現評估並無將其包括在內。\n\n# 於外匯基金的存款\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定組織的存款，利率一般與投資組合的表現掛鈎，但未來基金屬主要個別例子。未來基金存款的利率與投資組合及長期增長組合的表現掛鈎，實際利率視乎組合比重而定。未來基金在投資組合與長期增長組合的比重約為40：60。\n\n# 投資程序\n\n外匯基金的投資程序分別以策略性資產配置及戰略性資產配置作基礎。策略性資產配置，會以投資基準方式反映，亦即外匯基金為達到投資目標而可作出的長線資產配置。外匯基金以策略性配置作為指引，透過戰略性的資產配置，以爭取超越基準的回報。因此，實際配置往往會與基準配置（亦即策略性配置）有所偏離，而實際與基準配置之間的差距稱為「戰略性偏離」。財政司司長經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後制定投資基準及循跡誤差限額，金管局獲授權決定戰略性資產配置及定出戰略性偏離的容許範圍。投資組合經理可在戰略性偏離的容許範圍內管理倉盤，從短期市場變化中獲利。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局的外匯基金投資辦公室專責投資及相關風險管理職能。該辦公室職員負責直接管理外匯基金約72%的投資，包括整個支持組合及部分投資組合。該部分投資組合包括不同的環球定息市場投資，並透過衍生工具執行外匯基金的宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 外聘投資經理\n\n除透過內部職員管理資產外，金管局亦僱用外聘投資經理負責管理外匯基金約28%的資產，包括所有上市股票組合及其他特別資產。僱用外聘投資經理的目的是要運用市場上最佳的專業投資專才為外匯基金投資，獲取可持續回報，並讓外匯基金受惠於多元化及互補的投資方式，以及汲取市場心得與專門的投資知識。\n\n僱用外聘投資經理的相關支出包括基金管理與託管費、交易費、預扣稅及其他稅項。這些支出主要受市場因素影響而每年不同。\n\n# 風險管理及監察\n\n投資環境越趨複雜，風險管理的重要性不言而喻。金管局為內部及外聘投資經理所管理的投資組合均訂下嚴格管控措施及投資指引，並設立嚴謹的風險監察及合規制度。金管局為投資相關活動設有三重防線以確保有效的風險管理及監察。金管局亦定期監察主要投資風險類別（包括信用、市場、流動性及業務操作風險），並已加強風險管理程序以配合外匯基金的多元化投資。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n金管局支持負責任投資，將環境、社會及管治(ESG)因素併入外匯基金的公開市場及私募市場的投資管理過程。\n\n金管局訂有一套原則，以評估外匯基金投資項目的ESG風險與機會。就外聘投資經理所管理的資產組合而言，金管局透過獲委任的投資經理執行負責任投資。在甄選、委任及監察外聘投資經理的過程中，金管局會評估其落實ESG的不同範疇，包括ESG管治方面的組織架構、ESG標準及政策、將ESG因素併入投資程序中的情況，以及管理督導的業務活動，即代理投票和與投資組合公司的溝通（例如與投資組合公司管理層商討ESG的事宜）。為彰顯對負責任投資的重視，金管局透過外聘投資經理在管理督導方面扮演的角色，推動更完善的ESG做法。負責管理金管局的香港股票組合及中國內地股票主動投資管理組合的外聘投資經理，須承諾遵守證券及期貨事務監察委員會頒布的《負責任的擁有權原則》，若未能遵守則須作出解釋。至於負責管理已發展市場股票組合的外聘投資經理則需恪守國際公認的ESG標準。此外，金管局又展開聘任後監察計劃，以審視外聘投資經理的代理投票及與投資組合公司溝通的落實概況。\n\n由金管局內部人員負責管理的定息投資組合，亦將ESG因素融入債券投資的信用風險分析中。藉著擴大ESG數據來源以及在量化評估中提高ESG因素的權重，加強相關的分析。\n\n至於在公開市場的ESG投資，金管局自2015年起投資於綠色、社會責任及可持續債券（ESG債券），是這個市場的早期投資者之一。此外，金管局亦參與國際金融公司的「聯合貸款組合管理計劃」，而其投資對象聚焦於新興市場的可持續發展項目。在2020年，適逢市場供應增加，金管局增加ESG債券的投資。展望未來，金管局將繼續透過直接投資或持有ESG債券基金等方式，壯大其ESG債券組合。此外，金管局將透過採納ESG股票指數作為被動投資組合的投資基準，推動外聘投資經理建立以ESG為主題的股票投資方針。金管局在未來幾年將會繼續留意以ESG為主題的投資機會，例如主動式的ESG投資組合及低碳為題的投資工具。\n\n私募市場投資方面，金管局在盡職審查過程中檢視專責合夥人的ESG政策及具體措施。金管局的長期增長組合積極投資於具備可持續特點的項目，包括可再生能源基建，而在房地產投資組合亦有吸納具有綠色及可持續特點的倉庫及其他建築物。金管局將在未來繼續物色具備可持續特點的項目，並在房地產投資方面將綠色認證列入為重要考慮因素。金管局與專責合夥人舉行年度ESG工作坊，就良好的ESG作業手法交流意見及經驗。在11月舉行的ESG工作坊上，一眾專責合夥人就新冠病毒疫情對其投資組合公司及ESG投資發展所造成的影響交換意見。為提高私募市場投資的ESG透明度，金管局已要求專責合夥人提供有關其投資項目的ESG資訊，例如氣候變化風險等，以便監察。\n\n金管局往後仍會密切觀察ESG標準的發展，評估如何將有關標準進一步融入投資程序，當中包括與理念相近的投資者及國際組織互動合作。金管局作為聯合國支持的《負責任投資原則》的簽署人之一，肩負作為全球倡導者的責任，日後將會參與制定ESG最佳作業手法，並推動其他投資者採納負責任的投資方法。金管局亦是非牟利機構 FCLTGlobal 的成員，該機構旨在透過舉辦工作坊及研究，鼓勵以長遠目標為本的業務及投資決策。金管局亦有參與「氣候相關財務資訊披露工作小組」，並為「央行與監管機構綠色金融網絡」的成員。此外，金管局籌辦講座及積極參與投資業界舉辦的活動，分享及推廣有關ESG投資的理念。\n\n有關金管局的負責任投資政策架構，詳見「機構社會責任」一章。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2020年的金融市場\n\n因應受新冠病毒疫情為全球經濟帶來的重大挑戰而推出的寬鬆貨幣及財政政策支持下，環球金融市場在年底時升至高位。環球股票市場於第1季經歷了大幅調整和震盪後迅速反彈，主要市場更錄得雙位數字的增長。美國標準普爾500指數上升16%，是2020年表現最佳的七大工業國股票指數。\n\n債市方面，主要已發展國家的債券收益率在第1季顯著下跌後繼續受壓。10年期美國國債收益率由年初的1.9%下跌約100基點，至年底的0.9%。由於主要國債價格急升，2020年從債市錄得非常可觀的估值收益。\n\n貨幣市場方面，美國息率向下令息差收窄，促使美元兌主要貨幣轉弱，而2020年下半年情況更為顯著，其中歐元及人民幣兌美元分別升值約9.0%及6.5%。\n\n表1列載主要貨幣、債巿及股市在2020年的表現。\n\n表 1 2020年市場回報\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n外匯基金在2020年錄得2,358億港元的投資收入，其中包括債券投資收益927億港元、香港股票投資收益40億港元、其他股票投資收益699億港元、非港元資產外匯估值上調96億港元，以及外匯基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資收益596億港元。另一方面，策略性資產組合錄得140億港元估值收益。\n","terms":{"月":["month"],"暢順":["smooth"],"前":["ahead"],"幣作":["currency"],"銀行":["bank","banking","banks","bank(s)","banking

upheaval, with the COVID-19 pandemic presenting unprecedented challenges to the global economy. After substantial adjustments and volatility in asset markets during the first quarter, a rapid recovery ensued, driven by the introduction of highly accommodative monetary policies by major central banks and large-scale fiscal relief measures implemented by governments worldwide. As major central banks significantly lowered benchmark interest rates and resumed quantitative easing, government bond yields fell sharply and bond prices rose. In this investment environment, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$235.8 billion in 2020, with a return of 5.3%.\n\n# Exchange Fund\n\nUnder the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the primary purpose of the Exchange Fund is to influence the Hong Kong dollar’s exchange rate directly or indirectly. It may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems, thereby preserving Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre. The HKMA is accountable to the Financial Secretary for the utilisation and investment management of the Exchange Fund, based on the powers delegated and sub-delegated by the Financial Secretary.\n\n# Management of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee has established the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n(a) to safeguard capital;\n(b) to ensure that the overall monetary base is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar assets at all times;\n(c) to ensure sufficient liquidity to maintain monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) to achieve investment returns, within the constraints of (a) to (c) above, to preserve the Fund’s long-term purchasing power.\n\nThese objectives fully reflect the statutory purpose of the Exchange Fund and are embodied in the Fund’s portfolio structure and target asset allocation.\n\nThe Exchange Fund is broadly divided into two main portfolios: the Backing Portfolio and the Investment Portfolio. The Backing Portfolio holds highly liquid US dollar assets to fully back the monetary base, in accordance with the requirements of the Currency Board System. The Investment Portfolio primarily invests in bond and equity markets of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development member countries to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance medium- to long-term returns, the HKMA has prudently and progressively allocated some of the Exchange Fund’s assets to more diversified asset classes, including emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure) and real estate. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held by the Investment Portfolio, while private equity and real estate investments are held by the Long-Term Growth Portfolio. The market value ceiling of the Long-Term Growth Portfolio is one-third of the Exchange Fund’s accumulated surplus, plus the sum of future fund deposits and deposits from Exchange Fund subsidiaries linked to the Long-Term Growth Portfolio.\n\nThe Strategic Assets Portfolio was established in 2007 and has been holding shares of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited purchased by the Government for strategic purposes on behalf of the Exchange Fund’s accounts. Due to its unique nature, this portfolio is excluded from the assessment of the Exchange Fund’s investment performance.\n\n# Deposits in the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund occasionally accepts deposits from fiscal reserves, government funds and statutory bodies, with interest rates generally linked to the performance of the investment portfolio, except for the Future Fund, which is a notable exception. The interest rate for Future Fund deposits is linked to the performance of the Investment Portfolio and the Long-Term Growth Portfolio, with the actual rate depending on the portfolio weighting. The Future Fund’s weighting in the Investment Portfolio and the Long-Term Growth Portfolio is approximately 40:60.\n\n# Investment process\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s investment process is based on both strategic and tactical asset allocation. Strategic asset allocation is reflected in investment benchmarks, which represent the long-term asset allocation that the Exchange Fund can make to achieve its investment objectives. The Exchange Fund uses strategic allocation as a guide and employs tactical asset allocation to achieve returns above the benchmark. As a result, actual allocations often deviate from the benchmark allocation (i.e., the strategic allocation), and the difference between the actual and benchmark allocations is called a “tactical deviation”. The Financial Secretary, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, sets the investment benchmarks and tracking error limits, and the HKMA is authorised to determine the tactical asset allocation and set the permissible range for tactical deviations. Portfolio managers can manage positions within the permissible range of tactical deviations to profit from short-term market changes.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nThe HKMA’s Exchange Fund Investment Office is responsible for investment and related risk management functions. The office’s staff directly manage about 72% of the Exchange Fund’s investments, including the entire Backing Portfolio and part of the Investment Portfolio. This part of the Investment Portfolio includes various global fixed-income market investments and uses derivatives to implement the Exchange Fund’s macro risk management strategy.\n\n# External investment managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets through internal staff, the HKMA also employs external investment managers to manage about 28% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all listed equity portfolios and other special assets. The purpose of employing external investment managers is to leverage the best professional investment talent in the market to invest the Exchange Fund’s assets, achieve sustainable returns, and enable the Exchange Fund to benefit from diversified and complementary investment approaches, as well as to gain market insights and specialised investment knowledge.\n\nThe costs associated with employing external investment managers include fund management and custody fees, transaction fees, withholding tax and other taxes. These costs vary from year to year, primarily due to market factors.\n\n# Risk management and monitoring\n\nAs the investment environment becomes increasingly complex, effective risk management is essential. The HKMA has established strict control measures and investment guidelines for portfolios managed by both internal and external investment managers, and has implemented a robust risk monitoring and compliance system. The HKMA has established a three-line defence for investment-related activities to ensure effective risk management and monitoring. The HKMA also regularly monitors major investment risk categories (including credit, market, liquidity and operational risks) and has strengthened risk management processes to accommodate the Exchange Fund’s diversified investments.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nThe HKMA supports responsible investment and has integrated environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into the investment management process of the Exchange Fund’s public and private markets.\n\nThe HKMA has established a set of principles to assess the ESG risks and opportunities of the Exchange Fund’s investment projects. For portfolios managed by external investment managers, the HKMA implements responsible investment through appointed investment managers. When selecting, appointing and monitoring external investment managers, the HKMA assesses their implementation of various ESG aspects, including ESG governance structure, ESG standards and policies, integration of ESG factors into investment processes, and oversight of business activities such as proxy voting and communication with portfolio companies (e.g., discussing ESG issues with portfolio company management). To demonstrate its commitment to responsible investment, the HKMA promotes better ESG practices through the role played by external investment managers in oversight. External investment managers responsible for managing the HKMA’s Hong Kong equity portfolio and Mainland China active equity portfolio are required to commit to complying with the Principles of Responsible Ownership issued by the Securities and Futures Commission, and must provide explanations if they fail to comply. External investment managers responsible for managing developed market equity portfolios are required to adhere to internationally recognised ESG standards. Additionally, the HKMA has launched a post-appointment monitoring programme to review external investment managers’ proxy voting and communication with portfolio companies.\n\nFor fixed-income portfolios managed by HKMA internal staff, ESG factors are integrated into credit risk analysis for bond investments. This analysis is strengthened by expanding ESG data sources and increasing the weight of ESG factors in quantitative assessments.\n\nAs for ESG investment in public markets, the HKMA has been investing in green, social and sustainability bonds (ESG bonds) since 2015, making it one of the early investors in this market. The HKMA also participates in the International Finance Corporation’s “Syndicated Loan Portfolio Management Programme”, which focuses on sustainable development projects in emerging markets. In 2020, as market supply increased, the HKMA increased its investment in ESG bonds. Looking ahead, the HKMA will continue to grow its ESG bond portfolio through direct investment or by holding ESG bond funds. Furthermore, the HKMA will promote the establishment of ESG-themed equity investment strategies by external investment managers by adopting ESG equity indices as investment benchmarks for passive portfolios. Over the next few years, the HKMA will continue to explore ESG-themed investment opportunities, such as active ESG portfolios and low-carbon investment instruments.\n\nIn private market investments, the HKMA reviews general partners’ ESG policies and specific measures during the due diligence process. The HKMA’s Long-Term Growth Portfolio actively invests in projects with sustainable characteristics, including renewable energy infrastructure, and its real estate portfolio includes warehouses and other buildings with green and sustainable features. Going forward, the HKMA will continue to identify projects with sustainable characteristics and will consider green certification as an important factor in real estate investment. The HKMA holds annual ESG workshops with general partners to exchange views and experiences on good ESG practices. At the ESG workshop held in November, general partners discussed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their portfolio companies and ESG investment developments. To enhance ESG transparency in private market investments, the HKMA has required general partners to provide ESG information about their investment projects, such as climate change risks, for monitoring purposes.\n\nThe HKMA will continue to closely monitor developments in ESG standards and assess how to further integrate these standards into investment processes, including collaborating with like-minded investors and international organisations. As a signatory to the UN-supported Principles for Responsible Investment, the HKMA has a responsibility as a global advocate and will participate in developing ESG best practices and encouraging other investors to adopt responsible investment methods. The HKMA is also a member of FCLTGlobal, a non-profit organisation that promotes long-term business and investment decision-making through workshops and research. Additionally, the HKMA participates in the Climate-related Financial Information Disclosure Task Force and is a member of the Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System. The HKMA also organises seminars and actively participates in investment industry events to share and promote ESG investment concepts.\n\nFor further details on the HKMA’s responsible investment policy framework, please refer to the “Corporate Social Responsibility” chapter.\n\n# Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Financial markets in 2020\n\nSupported by accommodative monetary and fiscal policies introduced in response to the significant challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic to the global economy, global financial markets reached highs by the end of the year. Global equity markets rebounded strongly after experiencing substantial adjustments and volatility in the first quarter, with major markets recording double-digit growth. The US S&P 500 index rose by 16%, making it the best-performing equity index among the Group of Seven countries in 2020.\n\nIn the bond market, yields on bonds issued by major developed countries continued to decline after falling significantly in the first quarter. The yield on 10-year US Treasury bonds fell by about 100 basis points from 1.9% at the beginning of the year to 0.9% at the end of the year. As major sovereign bond prices surged, substantial valuation gains were recorded in the bond market in 2020.\n\nIn the currency market, the narrowing of interest rate differentials as US interest rates fell caused the US dollar to weaken against major currencies, a trend that was more pronounced in the second half of 2020, with the euro and renminbi appreciating by about 9.0% and 6.5% against the US dollar, respectively.\n\nTable 1 shows the performance of major currencies, bond markets and stock markets in 2020.\n\nTable 1 Market returns in 2020\n\n# Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\nIn 2020, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$235.8 billion, comprising bond investment gains of HK$92.7 billion, Hong Kong equity investment gains of HK$4 billion, other equity investment gains of HK$69.9 billion, foreign exchange valuation gains on non-HK dollar assets of HK$9.6 billion, and other investment gains of HK$59.6 billion held by the Exchange Fund’s investment holding subsidiaries. Additionally, the Strategic Assets Portfolio recorded valuation gains of HK$14 billion."}

communication with society and the market through traditional and social media, websites, information centres and other channels to enhance public understanding of its policies and operations. Internally, the HKMA is also committed to strengthening institutional governance, including supporting staff to enhance their professional capabilities, exercising strict financial control, strengthening information technology security, and encouraging a culture of innovation to meet the challenges brought about by the implementation of new projects and increasingly heavy workloads.\n\n# Maintaining contact with the public\n\n# Media relations and social media\n\nThe HKMA maintains close contact with the media to enhance its transparency and promote public understanding of its policies and operations. In 2020, it organised a total of 93 physical and online events, including eight press conferences, five on-site interviews and 80 other public events, arranged 14 media interviews, and issued 552 bilingual press releases, while also handling a large number of media enquiries on a daily basis.\n\nTo enhance public understanding of its key functions, the HKMA organised media briefings and workshops for local and overseas media and influential opinion leaders, covering topics such as the Linked Exchange Rate System, fintech, green finance and macroprudential regulatory measures.\n\nMr Eddie Yue, Chief Executive of the HKMA, chaired an online panel discussion at Hong Kong FinTech Week 2020.\n\nMr Edmond Lau, Deputy Chief Executive of the HKMA (centre), chaired a media briefing to introduce the HKMA’s two-year plan to promote the application of RegTech.\n\nMr Vincent Zhou, Director of Fintech at the HKMA (left), was interviewed by Bloomberg.\n\nThe HKMA uses social media to enhance public understanding of its work and to strengthen communication with the public. It currently operates five social media pages, including Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter and YouTube. As at the end of December 2020, more than 66,500 users followed its social media pages. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the HKMA made good use of social media to continue engaging with the public and effectively dispel false rumours related to the stability of the financial and banking systems.\n\n# Public enquiries\n\nThe public enquiry service is an effective channel for enhancing public understanding of the HKMA’s key functions and operations. In 2020, a total of 9,514 enquiries were handled, about half of which were related to banking policies and regulations, banking consumer matters, banknotes and coins, financial infrastructure and bond market development, particularly coin collection programmes, banking products and services, banking-related guidelines and announcements, retail bond issuance programmes, and monetary and economic data.\n\nChart 1 shows the total number of public enquiries received each year since 2017, and Chart 2 shows the proportion of different types of enquiries received in 2020.\n\nChart 1 Total number of public enquiries\n\nChart 2 Breakdown of enquiries received in 2020 by nature\n\n# Publications\n\nIn addition to its Annual Report, the HKMA published two issues of the Semi-annual Report on Monetary and Financial Stability and four issues of the Quarterly Bulletin during the year, and regularly updated the data in the Monthly Bulletin of Financial Statistics to provide the latest and topical information and analysis on Hong Kong’s currency, banking and economic affairs. In addition, it published 18 Huisi articles to introduce its key measures and policies and to discuss issues of public concern.\n\nThe HKMA’s 2019 Annual Report won the Silver Award in the “Non-profit and Charitable Organisations” category at the Best Annual Report Awards 2020 organised by the Hong Kong Management Association.\n\n# HKMA website\n\nThe HKMA’s official website (www.hkma.gov.hk) provides more than 40,000 pages of information in English and traditional and simplified Chinese versions to facilitate public access to its latest information. The website also contains the “Register of Authorised Institutions and Local Representative Offices” and the “Register of Securities Employees of Authorised Institutions” maintained under Section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the “Register of Licensees of Stored Value Facilities” maintained under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance.\n\nSince 2018, the HKMA has been releasing financial data and important information on its website in phases through open application programming interfaces (open APIs). As at the end of 2020, it had launched a total of 144 sets of open APIs on its website as scheduled.\n\nThe HKMA actively supports the development and application of open APIs.\n\n# HKMA Information Centre\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre, located on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre, introduces the HKMA’s work to the public and enhances public understanding of monetary and banking matters. The Information Centre consists of an exhibition hall and a library. The exhibition hall introduces the HKMA’s work and the development of Hong Kong’s currency and banking system in an interactive manner, and provides materials and exhibits for research on Hong Kong’s currency, banking and financial affairs. Adjacent to the exhibition hall, the library houses more than 26,000 books, journals and other publications for research on Hong Kong’s currency, banking, finance and central banking. The library also maintains the “Register of Authorised Institutions and Local Representative Offices” and the “Register of Securities Employees of Authorised Institutions” as required under Section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre stood out among thousands of entries from around the world with its exquisite design and unique ambience, and was one of the winners of the Platinum Award in the Interior Design category at the 2020 MUSE DESIGN AWARDS.\n\nThe Information Centre took advantage of its closure in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic to upgrade the facilities in its “Policy” section. This section explains the HKMA’s work and introduces related financial concepts. The upgrade was made in response to visitor feedback to make the interactive facilities easier to use, more interesting and more durable, thus making the visit more enjoyable.\n\nThe upgrade of the interactive facilities in the Information Centre’s “Policy” section has been completed.\n\nThe exhibition hall of the Information Centre introduces the HKMA’s work and the development of Hong Kong’s currency and banking system.\n\nTo ensure that members of the public, regardless of race, can enjoy the facilities of the Information Centre on an equal basis, the Centre has established procedures to provide interpretation services to visitors in need and to people who call its hotline for enquiries.\n\nThe opening and service hours of the Information Centre were affected due to the continued pandemic. To safeguard public safety and maintain a high level of hygiene, the Centre implemented special opening arrangements and anti-epidemic measures during the year, and strengthened cleaning and disinfection, with facilities and exhibits being disinfected regularly with long-lasting antibacterial coatings.\n\n# Public and consumer education\n\nTo maintain contact with the community and enhance public understanding of its work, the HKMA organised an online public education seminar in 2020, which attracted more than 1,600 teachers and students from 61 secondary schools. The seminar covered an introduction to the HKMA’s work, the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, protection of personal digital keys and the Deposit Protection Scheme. The education seminar, which was launched in 1998, was held online for the first time, and has so far been attended by more than 61,000 teachers and students.\n\nMore than 1,600 teachers and students from 61 secondary schools attended the HKMA’s online public education seminar.\n\nThe HKMA educates the public to be savvy and responsible financial services consumers, and maintains contact with the public in this regard. One of its key education focuses continues to be “protecting personal digital keys”. During the year, it produced a series of videos calling on the public to safeguard their financial accounts and personal data at all times and places. In view of the increase in online scams during the COVID-19 pandemic, it reminded the public to be vigilant when shopping online or using personal authentication data to avoid falling victim to scams.\n\nTo increase young people’s interest in joining the HKMA, it launched a public education web drama series, STEPS, in 2020, and published a series of related posts on social media to introduce its work in areas such as currency, the Linked Exchange Rate System, fintech, financial inclusion, banking supervision and international cooperation.\n\nThe public education web drama series STEPS uses a light-hearted approach to introduce the HKMA’s key functions through the growth story of a young new recruit.\n\nThe HKMA widely promoted the message of protecting personal digital keys through digital platforms and outdoor media.\n\nThe HKMA also cooperated with different stakeholders through various community engagement activities, one of which was the online parent-child financial education activity Little Financial Planner, which taught kindergarten and primary school students basic concepts of money and finance, as well as basic knowledge about banking and payment services, through animated videos, online games, DIY toys, downloadable worksheets and colouring contests.\n\nAnimated videos featuring the mascot Dollar Pig and the Kam family conveyed messages on five topics.\n\nA demonstration of DIY toys made from environmentally friendly materials was also provided.\n\nOther youth education initiatives included an online financial quiz competition and online educational seminars for secondary school students and teachers, collaboration with a professional body to produce a comic book for primary school students and parents, and online seminars for tertiary students.\n\nThe HKMA supports the Investor and Financial Education Committee in enhancing Hong Kong citizens’ financial knowledge and capability, and will explore further cooperation with stakeholders to improve the effectiveness of community engagement.\n\n# HKMA staff\n\nThe HKMA is part of the government structure but employs staff on non-civil service terms to attract talent with appropriate experience and expertise. It recruits, trains and maintains a professional and excellent workforce to fulfil its policy objectives and respond flexibly to changes in work requirements.\n\nThe HKMA’s staffing establishment in 2020 was 1,005. During the year, it endeavoured to meet the needs of new projects and increasingly heavy workloads by flexibly redeploying existing resources, improving efficiency and streamlining work processes. Its staffing establishment in 2021 will remain at 1,005, and existing resources will be reallocated to meet the following new and expanded work requirements:\n\n# Stability of the banking and financial system\n- Support the policy development work of “Wealth Management Connect” and other Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (Greater Bay Area) and private wealth management initiatives, and continue to supervise “Wealth Management Connect” business\n- Handle licensing work under the Insurance Ordinance and the new over-the-counter derivatives regime, as well as conduct-related supervision of virtual banks\n- Implement new regulatory requirements on climate risk and strengthen prudential supervision of banks\n\n# Reserve management\n- Strengthen investment, risk management and other necessary support to meet the needs of the continued expansion and diversification of the Exchange Fund’s investment work\n\n# Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre\n- Provide support to strengthen participation in the Financial Stability Board and other international working groups\n- Administer the newly proposed tax concession regime for carried interest and verify funds that are eligible for tax concessions\n\nTable 1 shows the HKMA’s establishment and actual staff numbers by department.\n\nTable 1 HKMA establishment and actual staff numbers as at 1 January 2021\n\n# Remuneration and benefits policy and remuneration review mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary determines the remuneration and conditions of service of HKMA staff through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee after consulting its Governance Committee and taking into account market remuneration levels and practices. The remuneration package consists of cash remuneration and a provident fund, plus some basic benefits. Cash remuneration includes a monthly fixed remuneration (i.e. basic salary) and a floating remuneration paid once a year based on the employee’s work performance.\n\nWhen reviewing the remuneration of HKMA staff each year, the Financial Secretary consults the recommendations of the Governance Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee and takes into account the Governance Committee’s assessment of the HKMA’s performance in the previous year, the results of a salary survey of the financial industry conducted by an independent human resources consultancy, and other relevant factors. The remuneration of individual employees who perform well may also be specially adjusted as a reward and to maintain their remuneration competitiveness.\n\nThe HKMA allocates the funds approved for the adjustment of annual fixed and floating remuneration according to individual employees’ work performance; the floating remuneration system applicable to investment staff is designed to strengthen the link between their investment performance and remuneration. The fixed remuneration adjustment and floating remuneration payment for Assistant Presidents and above are approved by the Financial Secretary after consulting the Governance Committee, with the employees concerned absent from the meeting when their remuneration is discussed. The fixed remuneration adjustment and floating remuneration payment for managers and below are determined by the Chief Executive of the HKMA under the authority of the Financial Secretary, based on the lump sum approved for remuneration payment."}
{"zh":"# 機構社會責任\n\n金管局致力履行機構社會責任，以成為負責任及可持續發展的機構為目標。金管局在不同領域履行此承諾，包括推動可持續發展及具環保意識的市場、關懷廣大社會、保護環境及締造友善的工作環境。\n\n為應對新冠病毒疫情，金管局推出多項措施，支援有需要的個人及企業，從而協助香港經濟渡過難關。\n\n# 市場環境\n\n# 綠色及可持續金融\n\n氣候變化是影響人類福祉及全球經濟可持續性的主要風險之一，作為社會重要環節之一的金融體系，亦難免會受到影響；而銀行作為金融體系的一部分，應更積極管理氣候風險。有見及此，金管局致力探究應對這項挑戰的方法，並正落實多項於2019年5月宣布推出的措施，促進綠色金融在香港的發展。有關措施包括分三階段推動綠色及可持續銀行業的發展：\n\n# 第一階段\n\n與業界建立一個共同框架，評估銀行目前的「綠色基準」，以及與國際組織合作，為本港銀行提供技術支援；\n\n# 第二階段\n\n就綠色及可持續銀行業的監管期望及要求諮詢業界及其他持份者；以及\n\n# 第三階段\n\n集中落實、審視及評估銀行在這方面的進度。\n\n在國際層面，金管局參與多個國際組織，包括央行與監管機構綠色金融網絡、巴塞爾銀行監管委員會轄下的氣候相關財務風險高級別工作組、東亞及太平洋地區中央銀行會議轄下銀行監管工作小組之下的可持續金融關注組及國際可持續金融平台。透過參與這些國際組織，金管局有機會為中央銀行界及監管機構在應對氣候變化的工作上作出貢獻，並能在制定本地架構時借鑑其他地區的經驗與觀點。\n\n金管局亦參與央行與監管機構綠色金融網絡下的多個工作組，包括微觀審慎監管工作組、宏觀金融工作組及促進綠色金融工作組。此外，金管局亦加入了兩個新設的工作組：研究工作組及彌補數據缺口工作組。研究工作組負責相關研究工作，而彌補數據缺口工作組旨在制定監管當局及金融機構評估氣候相關風險與機遇所需、但目前卻並未掌握的數據項目詳盡清單。有關金管局年內在推動綠色及可持續銀行業發展方面的工作，詳見「銀行體系穩定」一章。\n\n金管局在11月與國際金融公司聯合推出綠色商業銀行聯盟，協助各新興市場的銀行制定應對氣候變化的方案。作為聯盟的創始成員及首個區域執行理事，金管局i)在全球金融市場推動發展綠色商業銀行；ii)為商業銀行提供互相學習平台，獲取所需知識、工具及商業資訊，以制定其本身的綠色金融路線圖，並轉型為具公信力的綠色銀行；iii)促進溝通，並探討前沿議題推動全球綠色議程；以及iv)協助聯盟的成員合作，以及把握國際金融公司所識別在未來10年估計高達23萬億美元的新興市場綠色及氣候相關投資機會。\n\n本地方面，金管局與其他金融監管機構合作，協調金融業針對氣候和環境風險的措施應對。除了協助政府落實政府綠色債券計劃的相關工作外，金管局亦與證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）共同發起成立了綠色和可持續金融跨機構督導小組（督導小組），處理跨行業的監管及市場發展事宜。有關金管局年內在發展香港成為綠色及可持續金融樞紐方面的工作，詳見「香港的國際金融中心地位」一章。\n\n# 綠色和可持續金融跨機構督導小組\n\n督導小組旨在協調金融業針對氣候及環境風險的措施應對、加快香港綠色及可持續金融的發展，以及支持政府的氣候策略。督導小組由金管局與證監會於5月共同發起成立，其他成員包括環境局、財經事務及庫務局、香港交易及結算所有限公司、保險業監管局及強制性公積金計劃管理局。\n\n自成立以來，督導小組設立了兩個技術工作專責團隊，分別負責研究及處理跨部門的監管事宜，以及協調跨機構的市場發展工作。\n\n督導小組在12月發布綠色及可持續金融策略，提出從六方面鞏固香港金融生態系統，長遠共建更綠色及更可持續的未來。督導小組亦宣布5個短期行動綱領，處理發展過程中一些最迫切的問題。\n\n金管局舉辦督導小組成立大會，金管局總裁余偉文先生（右三）為該小組的聯席主席。\n\n督導小組發布香港的綠色和可持續金融策略計劃及5個主要行動綱領。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n金管局支持負責任投資，即將環境、社會及管治(ESG)因素融入投資活動中。金管局作為規模龐大的資產擁有人，日益關注負責任投資，將對其基金經理如何進行投資活動產生影響。\n\n# 金管局的信念\n\n金管局相信透過適度強調負責任投資及考慮各項投資的可持續長期表現，將更有效達致外匯基金的投資目標，並且減低投資活動所涉及的ESG相關風險。\n\n# 金管局的原則\n\n按金管局採取的指導性原則，當ESG投資與其他投資項目的經風險調整長期收益相若時，一般會優先考慮ESG投資。作為負責任的長期投資者，金管局在投資管理過程中，會因應情況採納以下的負責任投資原則：\n\n# 融入\n\n金管局相信ESG因素會對投資項目的長期價值帶來重大影響，因此將ESG因素融入投資分析程序，以辨察風險及物色良機。金管局將ESG因素併入公開市場及私募市場的投資管理過程中。\n\n# 主動行使資產擁有權\n\n金管局就所持有的上市公司股票適當地行使股東權利，以維護投資的長期價值。金管局相信，顧及ESG因素的負責任企業行為，將有助創造長綫的股東利益。金管局期望外聘投資經理透過行使表決權及與獲投資公司溝通時，主動行使資產擁有權，藉以協助金管局履行對投資項目的擁有權責任。\n\n# 合作\n\n金管局致力與理念相近的投資者及監管機構合作，推動良好的長期投資管理手法，又出席公開活動並發表演講，分享更完善的ESG作業手法及鼓勵投資界採納負責任投資理念。\n\n有關金管局年內在負責任投資方面的工作，詳見「儲備管理」一章。\n\n# 金管局作為主動的負責任投資者，監察外聘投資經理的ESG作業手法\n\n# 金管局的期望\n\n金管局非常重視將ESG因素融入投資決定及主動行使資產擁有權等概念。為此，金管局在甄選聘任及監察外聘投資經理時，皆會考慮ESG因素。由於金管局認為就所持有的上市公司股票行使股東權利，是維護投資的長期價值的基本方針，因此會要求獲聘任的投資經理嚴肅對待主動行使資產擁有權一事。\n\n# 金管局的監察\n\n外聘投資經理須就其替金管局管理的上市股票組合的ESG表現接受評估。金管局透過溝通計劃，有系統地檢視外聘投資經理在不同範疇的ESG作業手法，例如其ESG評估架構、與獲投資公司的溝通，以及代理投票方面的工作。金管局在2020年選出若干外聘投資經理率先進行溝通計劃，當中不僅評估其ESG表現，亦檢視其有否代表金管局妥善行使資產擁有權。\n\n# 溝通成果\n\n金管局透過計劃識別出作業手法有問題的外聘投資經理，並採取跟進行動。下文列舉其中兩個例子。\n\n# 個案1\n\n金管局留意到股票投資經理A的ESG架構有改善空間，尤其應設立更有系統的方法去評估獲投資公司。金管局就此與A跟進，其後A進行全面的公司政策檢討，以實施一個更穩健的ESG架構。A更特別委任外聘顧問就ESG程序提供意見，反映加快落實改革的決心，並新設由高級管理層組成的ESG委員會，顯示對ESG的承擔及高級管理層對有關措施的支持。\n\n# 個案2\n\n金管局在檢視股票投資經理B的投票方法後，發現B的投票政策在多個範疇上都有不足之處，並要求其ESG主管作出審視。尤其B在過往的投票全數贊成管理層的建議，偏離其本身的代理投票指引。B其後承諾會加強公司的投票政策以符合期望，其中包括會提高ESG團隊成員的參與度，以及在遇上涉及重大管治問題時有可能對管理層投下反對票。\n\n在私募市場投資方面，金管局藉着其專責合夥人致力與相關投資組合公司在ESG事宜上合作，從而實現負責任投資。金管局留意到專責合夥人都貫徹對ESG的承擔，因他們認為此舉可有利創造投資組合公司的長期價值和確保回報的可持續性。下文列舉的兩個例子顯示可透過(i)設計改動及利用創新運作技術；以及(ii)在建造及營運綠色及可持續倉庫時融入減碳因素，以管理氣候變化風險。兩個例子都對環境產生顯著的正面影響，減少碳排放，避免有害物質，並同時透過降低成本及節省能源，提升運作效率。\n\n(i) 金管局有投資一間採用環保方案的害蟲防治公司。雖然傳統殺蟲劑及化學製品能有效殺滅害蟲，但若未能迅速清除或妥善棄置蟲屍，將會危害公共衛生。此外，化學成分的滲漏及棄置亦會造成環境問題。該公司採用的不含生物殺滅劑方案，透過設置捕蟲器以減少使用有害化學品。該公司亦利用與互聯網相連的動態感應器，遙距偵察是否已捕獲害蟲。藉着此項新技術，該公司能作出完善的路線規劃以收集捕獲的害蟲，減低出行里程，從而減少碳排放。該公司採用的方案令公司整體碳排的淨效應達到每美元淨銷售額0.36千克二氧化碳當量的低水平，接近法律服務及軟件出版等低碳行業的平均水平，實在令人鼓舞。\n\n(ii) 金管局有投資綠色及可持續倉庫。雖然建造業是碳排放的一大源頭，但有關的倉庫發展商在其整體倉庫建造與營運中，採用淨零碳排放程序，並制定衡量淨零碳排放基準的標準及指標，而建築計劃亦顧及所用材料與部件的可持續性。因此，所建造的倉庫減碳效率高，並具備可持續特點，包括太陽能加熱系統、電動車充電設施、自然採光及雨水收集等。\n\n根據獨立顧問的評估，按淨額計，有關倉庫建造的碳足跡較一般物流大廈的碳排放量低25.8%。為進一步抵銷建築工程所造成的碳排放，建造過程中更種植了32,799棵樹（以淨額計）。建成後倉庫的日常運作的碳排放量較一般倉庫少26.9%。\n","terms":{"月":["month"],"暢順":["smooth"],"前":["ahead"],"幣作":["currency"],"銀行":["bank","banking","banks","bank(s)","banking

Authority (HKMA) is committed to fulfilling its corporate social responsibility and aims to become a responsible and sustainable institution. It demonstrates this commitment across various areas, including promoting sustainable development and environmentally conscious markets, caring for society at large, protecting the environment, and fostering a friendly work environment.\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the HKMA introduced several measures to support individuals and businesses in need, thereby helping the Hong Kong economy to weather the crisis.\n\n# Market Environment\n\n# Green and Sustainable Finance\n\nClimate change poses one of the most significant risks to human well-being and the sustainability of the global economy. As a vital component of society, the financial system is also inevitably affected. Banks, being part of this system, should take a more proactive role in managing climate risks. Recognising this, the HKMA is dedicated to exploring solutions to this challenge and has been implementing measures announced in May 2019 to promote the development of green finance in Hong Kong. These measures include a three-phase strategy to advance green and sustainable banking:\n\n# Phase One\n\nEstablish a common framework with the industry to assess banks’ current \"green benchmarks\" and collaborate with international organisations to provide technical support to Hong Kong banks.\n\n# Phase Two\n\nConsult the industry and other stakeholders on regulatory expectations and requirements for green and sustainable banking.\n\n# Phase Three\n\nFocus on implementing, reviewing, and evaluating banks’ progress in this area.\n\nAt the international level, the HKMA participates in several organisations, including the Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System, the High-Level Working Group on Climate-Related Financial Risks under the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the Sustainable Finance Study Group under the Working Group on Banking Supervision of the East Asia and Pacific Central Banks Conference, and the International Platform on Sustainable Finance. Through these organisations, the HKMA contributes to central banks’ and regulators’ efforts to address climate change and draws on other regions’ experiences and perspectives when developing local frameworks.\n\nThe HKMA also participates in various working groups under the Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System, including the Microprudential Supervision Working Group, the Macrofinancial Working Group, and the Promoting Green Finance Working Group. In addition, the HKMA has joined two newly established working groups: the Research Working Group and the Data Gaps Working Group. The former is responsible for relevant research, while the latter aims to develop a detailed list of data items that regulators and financial institutions need but currently lack to assess climate-related risks and opportunities. For more details on the HKMA’s work in promoting green and sustainable banking this year, see the chapter on \"Banking System Stability\".\n\nIn November, the HKMA, in collaboration with the International Finance Corporation, launched the Green Banking Alliance to help banks in emerging markets develop strategies to address climate change. As a founding member and the first regional executive director of the Alliance, the HKMA aims to: i) promote the development of green commercial banking in global financial markets; ii) provide commercial banks with a platform for mutual learning, enabling them to acquire the knowledge, tools, and business information needed to develop their own green finance roadmaps and transform into credible green banks; iii) facilitate communication and explore cutting-edge issues to advance the global green agenda; and iv) assist Alliance members in collaborating and seizing the estimated USD 23 trillion in emerging market green and climate-related investment opportunities identified by the International Finance Corporation over the next 10 years.\n\nLocally, the HKMA works with other financial regulators to coordinate the financial industry’s response to climate and environmental risks. In addition to assisting the government in implementing the Green Bond Programme, the HKMA, together with the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), established the Green and Sustainable Finance Cross-Agency Steering Group (the Steering Group) to address cross-industry regulatory and market development issues. For more details on the HKMA’s work this year in developing Hong Kong into a green and sustainable finance hub, see the chapter on \"Hong Kong’s Status as an International Financial Centre\".\n\n# Green and Sustainable Finance Cross-Agency Steering Group\n\nThe Steering Group aims to coordinate the financial industry’s response to climate and environmental risks, accelerate the development of green and sustainable finance in Hong Kong, and support the government’s climate strategy. The Group was jointly established by the HKMA and the SFC in May, with other members including the Environment Bureau, the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, the Insurance Authority, and the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority.\n\nSince its establishment, the Steering Group has set up two technical working teams responsible for researching and addressing cross-departmental regulatory issues and coordinating cross-agency market development efforts, respectively.\n\nIn December, the Steering Group published a green and sustainable finance strategy, proposing six measures to strengthen Hong Kong’s financial ecosystem and collectively build a greener and more sustainable future in the long term. The Group also announced five short-term action plans to address some of the most pressing issues in the development process.\n\nThe HKMA organised the inaugural meeting of the Steering Group, with HKMA Chief Executive Mr Eddie Yue serving as its co-chair.\n\nThe Steering Group published Hong Kong’s green and sustainable finance strategy and five key action plans.\n\n# Responsible Investment\n\nThe HKMA supports responsible investment, which integrates environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors into investment activities. As a large asset owner, the HKMA is increasingly concerned about responsible investment, which will influence how its fund managers conduct investment activities.\n\n# The HKMA’s Belief\n\nThe HKMA believes that by appropriately emphasising responsible investment and considering the sustainable long-term performance of investments, it can more effectively achieve the investment goals of the Exchange Fund and reduce ESG-related risks associated with investment activities.\n\n# The HKMA’s Principles\n\nUnder the HKMA’s guiding principles, when ESG investments and other investment projects have similar risk-adjusted long-term returns, ESG investments are generally prioritised. As a responsible long-term investor, the HKMA adopts the following responsible investment principles in its investment management process, as appropriate:\n\n# Integration\n\nThe HKMA believes that ESG factors have a significant impact on the long-term value of investment projects. Therefore, it integrates ESG factors into its investment analysis process to identify risks and opportunities. The HKMA incorporates ESG factors into its investment management processes for both public and private markets.\n\n# Active Exercise of Ownership Rights\n\nThe HKMA appropriately exercises its shareholder rights in the listed companies it holds to safeguard the long-term value of its investments. It believes that responsible corporate behaviour that takes ESG factors into account contributes to creating long-term shareholder value. The HKMA expects external investment managers to actively exercise ownership rights by exercising voting rights and communicating with invested companies, thereby assisting the HKMA in fulfilling its ownership responsibilities for investment projects.\n\n# Collaboration\n\nThe HKMA is committed to collaborating with like-minded investors and regulators to promote good long-term investment management practices. It also attends public events and delivers speeches to share improved ESG practices and encourage the investment community to adopt responsible investment principles.\n\nFor more details on the HKMA’s work in responsible investment this year, see the chapter on \"Reserve Management\".\n\n# The HKMA, as an active responsible investor, monitors the ESG practices of external investment managers\n\n# The HKMA’s Expectations\n\nThe HKMA places great importance on integrating ESG factors into investment decisions and actively exercising ownership rights. Therefore, it considers ESG factors when selecting, appointing, and monitoring external investment managers. As the HKMA believes that exercising shareholder rights in listed companies it holds is essential for safeguarding the long-term value of investments, it requires appointed investment managers to take the active exercise of ownership rights seriously.\n\n# The HKMA’s Monitoring\n\nExternal investment managers are assessed on the ESG performance of the listed stock portfolios they manage for the HKMA. Through a communication programme, the HKMA systematically reviews external investment managers’ ESG practices in various areas, such as their ESG assessment frameworks, communication with invested companies, and proxy voting activities. In 2020, the HKMA selected several external investment managers to pilot the communication programme, assessing not only their ESG performance but also whether they had properly exercised ownership rights on behalf of the HKMA.\n\n# Communication Outcomes\n\nThrough the programme, the HKMA identified external investment managers with problematic practices and took follow-up actions. Two examples are provided below.\n\n# Case 1\n\nThe HKMA noted that Equity Investment Manager A’s ESG framework had room for improvement, particularly in establishing a more systematic method for assessing invested companies. After the HKMA followed up with A, the manager conducted a comprehensive review of its corporate policies to implement a more robust ESG framework. A also appointed an external consultant to advise on ESG procedures, demonstrating its commitment to accelerating reforms. Additionally, A established a new ESG committee composed of senior management, reflecting its commitment to ESG and senior management’s support for related measures.\n\n# Case 2\n\nAfter reviewing Equity Investment Manager B’s voting methods, the HKMA found that B’s voting policies were deficient in several areas and asked its ESG head to review them. Notably, B had consistently voted in favour of management’s proposals in the past, deviating from its own proxy voting guidelines. B subsequently pledged to strengthen its voting policies to meet expectations, including increasing the involvement of ESG team members and potentially voting against management on significant governance issues.\n\nIn private market investments, the HKMA, through its general partners, works with portfolio companies on ESG matters to achieve responsible investment. The HKMA has observed that general partners are committed to ESG, as they believe it contributes to creating long-term value for portfolio companies and ensuring the sustainability of returns. The two examples below illustrate how climate change risks can be managed through (i) design changes and the use of innovative operational technologies, and (ii) the integration of carbon reduction factors in the construction and operation of green and sustainable warehouses. Both examples have a significant positive impact on the environment, reducing carbon emissions, avoiding harmful substances, and improving operational efficiency by lowering costs and saving energy.\n\n(i) The HKMA has invested in a pest control company that uses an environmentally friendly approach. While traditional pesticides and chemicals are effective in killing pests, failure to promptly remove or properly dispose of dead pests can pose a risk to public health. Additionally, chemical leakage and disposal can cause environmental problems. The company uses a non-biocidal approach, employing traps to reduce the use of harmful chemicals. It also uses internet-connected dynamic sensors to remotely detect whether pests have been captured. With this new technology, the company can optimise its route planning for collecting captured pests, reducing travel distances and carbon emissions. The company’s approach has resulted in a net carbon effect of 0.36 kg CO2 equivalent per dollar of net sales, a low level close to the average for low-carbon industries such as legal services and software publishing, which is encouraging.\n\n(ii) The HKMA has invested in green and sustainable warehouses. Although the construction industry is a major source of carbon emissions, the warehouse developer has adopted a net-zero carbon emission process for its overall warehouse construction and operation, established standards and metrics for measuring net-zero carbon emissions, and considered the sustainability of materials and components used in the construction plan. As a result, the warehouses built have high carbon reduction efficiency and sustainable features, including solar heating systems, electric vehicle charging facilities, natural lighting, and rainwater collection.\n\nAccording to an assessment by an independent consultant, the carbon footprint of the warehouse construction, on a net basis, is 25.8% lower than that of a typical logistics building. To further offset the carbon emissions caused by the construction, 32,799 trees (on a net basis) were planted during the construction process. After completion, the daily operation of the warehouse has 26.9% lower carbon emissions than a typical warehouse."}
{"zh":"# 外匯基金\n\n# 審計署署長報告\n\n# 獨立審計師報告致財政司司長\n\n# 意見\n\n茲證明我已審計列載於第187至289頁外匯基金及其附屬公司（「集團」）的財務報表，該等財務報表包括外匯基金及集團於2020年12月31日的資產負債表與截至該日止年度的收支帳目、全面收益表、權益變動表和現金流量表，以及財務報表的附註，包括主要會計政策概要。\n\n我認為，該等財務報表已按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》真實而中肯地反映外匯基金及集團於2020年12月31日的財務狀況及截至該日止年度的財務表現和現金流量，並已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》（第66章）第7條下所發出的指示妥為擬備。\n\n# 意見的基礎\n\n我已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示及審計署的審計準則進行審計。我根據該等準則而須承擔的責任，詳載於本報告「審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任」部分。根據該等準則，我獨立於集團，並已按該等準則履行其他道德責任。我相信，我所獲得的審計憑證是充足和適當地為我的審計意見提供基礎。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項是根據我的專業判斷，對截至2020年12月31日止年度財務報表的審計最為重要的事項。我對整體財務報表進行審計及形成意見時處理了這些事項，而我不會對這些事項提供單獨的意見。\n\n# 其他資料\n\n金融管理專員須對其他資料負責。其他資料包括金融管理局2020年年報內的所有資料，但不包括財務報表及我的審計師報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見並不涵蓋其他資料，我亦不對其他資料發表任何形式的鑒證結論。\n\n就財務報表審計而言，我有責任閱讀其他資料，從而考慮其他資料是否與財務報表或我在審計過程中得悉的情況有重大矛盾，或者似乎存有重大錯誤陳述。基於我已執行的工作，如果我認為其他資料存有重大錯誤陳述，我需要報告該事實。在這方面，我沒有任何報告。\n\n# 金融管理專員及外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會就財務報表而須承擔的責任\n\n金融管理專員須負責按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》及行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示擬備真實而中肯的財務報表，及落實其認為必要的內部控制， 使財務報表不存有因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在擬備財務報表時，金融管理專員須負責評估集團持續經營的能力，以及在適用情況下披露與持續經營有關的事項，並以持續經營作為會計基礎。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會負責監督集團的財務報告過程。\n\n# 審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任\n\n我的目標是就整體財務報表是否不存有任何因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述取得合理保證，並發出包括我意見的審計師報告。合理保證是高水平的保證，但不能確保按審計署審計準則進行的審計定能發現所存有的任何重大錯誤陳述。錯誤陳述可以由欺詐或錯誤引起，如果合理預期它們個別或滙總起來可能影響財務報表使用者所作出的經濟決定，則會被視作重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在根據審計署審計準則進行審計的過程中，我會運用專業判斷並秉持專業懷疑態度。我亦會：\n- 識別和評估因欺詐或錯誤而導致財務報表存有重大錯誤陳述的風險；設計及執行審計程序以應對這些風險；以及取得充足和適當的審計憑證，作為我意見的基礎。由於欺詐可能涉及串謀、偽造、蓄意遺漏、虛假陳述，或凌駕內部控制的情況，因此未能發現因欺詐而導致重大錯誤陳述的風險，較未能發現因錯誤而導致者為高；\n- 了解與審計相關的內部控制，以設計適當的審計程序。然而，此舉並非旨在對集團內部控制的有效性發表意見；\n- 評價金融管理專員所採用的會計政策是否恰當，以及其作出的會計估計和相關資料披露是否合理；\n- 判定金融管理專員以持續經營作為會計基礎的做法是否恰當，並根據所得的審計憑證，判定是否存在與事件或情況有關，而且可能對集團持續經營的能力構成重大疑慮的重大不確定性。如果我認為存在重大不確定性，則有必要在審計師報告中請使用者留意財務報表中的相關資料披露。假若所披露的相關資料不足，我便須發出非無保留意見的審計師報告。我的結論是基於截至審計師報告日止所取得的審計憑證。然而，未來事件或情況可能導致集團不能繼續持續經營；\n- 評價財務報表的整體列報方式、結構和內容，包括披露資料，以及財務報表是否中肯反映交易和事項；及\n- 就集團中實體或業務活動的財務資料獲取充足和適當的審計憑證，以對財務報表發表意見。我負責指導、監督和執行集團審計。我對我的審計意見承擔全部責任。\n\n我會與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通計劃的審計範圍和時間以及重大審計發現等事項，包括我在審計期間識別出內部控制的任何重大缺陷。\n\n我亦會向外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會提交聲明，說明我已符合有關獨立性的相關道德要求，並與他們溝通所有被合理認為可能會影響我獨立性的關係和其他事項，以及在適用的情況下，相關的防範措施。\n\n從與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通的事項中，我會決定哪些事項對本期財務報表的審計最為重要，因而構成關鍵審計事項。我會在審計師報告中描述這些事項，除非法律法規不允許對某件事項作出公開披露，或在極端罕見的情況下，因為有合理預期在我報告中溝通某事項而造成的負面後果將會超過其產生的公眾利益而我決定不應在報告中溝通該事項。\n\n審計署署長\n朱乃璋\n\n2021年4月1日\n\n# 1 主要業務\n\n金融管理專員根據財政司司長以外匯基金（基金）管理人身分授予的權力，按照《外匯基金條例》（第66章）的條文管理基金。基金的主要業務為捍衛港元匯率及維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定健全。\n\n基金的資產分作四個不同的組合來管理：支持組合、投資組合、長期增長組合及策略性資產組合。根據香港的貨幣發行局制度，支持組合的資產與貨幣基礎完全相配。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債券及股票市場。長期增長組合持有私募股權及房地產投資。策略性資產組合持有香港特別行政區（香港特區）政府為策略目的而購入，並列入基金的帳目內的香港交易及結算所有限公司的股票。經營分部資料載於附註32。\n\n# 2 主要會計政策\n\n# 2.1 符合準則聲明\n\n本財務報表是按照香港財務報告準則（此乃綜合詞彙，包括香港會計師公會頒布的所有適用個別香港財務報告準則、香港會計準則及詮釋）及香港公認會計原則而編製。有關基金及其附屬公司（統稱為「集團」）所採納的主要會計政策摘要如下。\n\n香港會計師公會頒布了若干新增或經修訂的香港財務報告準則並於集團的本會計期首次生效或可供提前採納。集團因首次採納其中適用的準則而引致本會計期及前會計期的會計政策改變（如有）已反映在本財務報表，有關資料載於附註3。\n\n# 2.2 財務報表的編製基準\n\n集團財務報表包括集團的財務報表，以及集團於聯營公司及合營公司的權益。主要附屬公司、聯營公司及合營公司的主要業務載於附註17及18。\n\n本財務報表的編製基準是按原值成本法計量，惟下述按公平值計量的資產及負債除外：\n- 衍生金融工具（附註2.6）；\n- 按公平值計入收支帳目的金融資產及金融負債（附註2.6）；\n- 按公平值計入其他全面收益的金融資產（附註2.6）；\n- 黃金（附註2.10）；及\n- 投資物業（附註2.11）。\n\n編製符合香港財務報告準則的財務報表需要管理層作出判斷、估計及假設，而有關判斷、估計及假設會影響會計政策的採納及資產、負債、收入及支出的呈報數額。此等估計及相關的假設是根據以往經驗及其他在有關情況下認為合適的因素而制定。在欠缺其他現成數據的情況下，則採用此等估計及假設作為判斷有關資產及負債的帳面值的基準，估計結果與實際價值或有不同。\n\n此等估計及相關假設將不斷檢討修訂。如作出的修訂只影響本會計期，有關修訂會在該期間內確認，但如影響本期及未來的會計期，有關修訂便會在該期及未來期間內確認。\n\n管理層就採納香港財務報告準則所作出對財務報表有重大影響的判斷以及估計不確定性的主要來源於附註2.19披露。\n\n若干2019年的比較數字已重新分類，以配合本年度集團財務報表的呈報方式。\n\n# 2.3 附屬公司及非控股權益\n\n附屬公司指集團所控制的實體。如集團因其參與該實體的營運而承擔有關浮動回報的風險或享有有關權利，且有能力對該實體行使權力而影響該等回報時，即屬擁有該實體的控制權。在評估集團是否擁有權力時，只考慮由集團及其他方所持有的實質權利。\n","terms":{"月":["month"],"暢順":["smooth"],"前":["ahead"],"幣作":["currency"],"銀行":["bank","banking","banks","bank(s)","banking

Auditor’s Report to the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 187 to 289, which comprise the Group’s balance sheet as at 31 December 2020, and the income account, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and cash flow statement for the year then ended, together with the notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements present a true and fair view of the financial position of the Exchange Fund and the Group as at 31 December 2020, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants. They have also been properly prepared in accordance with the directions given by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Chapter 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directions given by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Department’s auditing standards. My responsibilities under those standards are described in the “Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements” section of my report. I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards and have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities under them. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2020. I addressed these matters in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Financial Commissioner is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises all the information in the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s Annual Report 2020, but does not include the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Financial Commissioner and the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee in relation to the financial statements\n\nThe Financial Commissioner is responsible for preparing financial statements that present a true and fair view in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the directions given by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance. He is also responsible for implementing such internal control as he considers necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Financial Commissioner is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Department’s auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Department’s auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. I also:\n- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.\n- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the Financial Commissioner and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by him.\n- Conclude on the appropriateness of the Financial Commissioner’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- Obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. I am solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide a statement to the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and the related safeguards, if applicable.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements for the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nDirector of Audit\nChu Nai-cheung\n\n1 April 2021\n\n# 1 Principal business\n\nThe Financial Commissioner manages the Exchange Fund (the Fund) under the authority delegated by the Financial Secretary as the Fund’s manager, in accordance with the provisions of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Chapter 66). The Fund’s principal business is to safeguard the Hong Kong dollar’s exchange rate and maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems.\n\nThe Fund’s assets are managed in four distinct portfolios: the Backing Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-term Growth Portfolio and the Strategic Assets Portfolio. Under Hong Kong’s Currency Board System, the assets in the Backing Portfolio fully match the monetary base. The Investment Portfolio primarily invests in bond and equity markets of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development member countries. The Long-term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments. The Strategic Assets Portfolio holds shares of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited purchased by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region for strategic purposes and recorded in the Fund’s accounts. Information on operating segments is set out in note 32.\n\n# 2 Principal accounting policies\n\n# 2.1 Compliance with standards statement\n\nThese financial statements are prepared in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (comprising all applicable individual Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, Hong Kong Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants) and the generally accepted accounting principles in Hong Kong. A summary of the principal accounting policies adopted by the Fund and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as “the Group”) is set out below.\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants has issued a number of new or amended Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards that are effective or available for early adoption for the first time in the Group’s current accounting period. Any changes in accounting policies resulting from the Group’s first-time adoption of the applicable standards for the current and prior accounting periods are reflected in these financial statements, and the information is set out in note 3.\n\n# 2.2 Basis of preparation of financial statements\n\nThe Group’s financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Group and the Group’s interests in associates and joint ventures. The principal businesses of the principal subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are set out in notes 17 and 18.\n\nThese financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the following assets and liabilities which are measured at fair value:\n- Derivative financial instruments (note 2.6);\n- Financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss (note 2.6);\n- Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (note 2.6);\n- Gold (note 2.10); and\n- Investment properties (note 2.11).\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. These estimates and related assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors considered appropriate in the circumstances. In the absence of other readily available data, these estimates and assumptions are used as a basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that may not be readily apparent from other sources, and the results may differ from actual values.\n\nThese estimates and related assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nThe significant judgments made by management in applying Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards that have the most significant effect on the financial statements and the main source of estimation uncertainty are disclosed in note 2.19.\n\nCertain comparative figures for 2019 have been reclassified to conform to the presentation adopted in the Group’s financial statements for the current year.\n\n# 2.3 Subsidiaries and non-controlling interests\n\nA subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. When assessing whether the Group has such power, only substantive rights held by the Group and other parties are considered."}

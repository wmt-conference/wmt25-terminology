{"en":"# Resilience in the face of adversity\n\nReverberations from slowing global economic growth amid a “high for longer” interest rate environment and intensifying geopolitical tensions — not just stemming from the RussiaUkraine war and China-US tensions but also the outbreak of conflict in the Middle East — were the key themes for the financial markets in 2023. The March banking turmoil in the US and Europe, the most significant system-wide banking stress since the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, weighed further on market sentiment. Major economies grappled with the harsh realities of tightened monetary conditions and greater uncertainty over the inflationary path and interest rate outlook. Adding to the uncertainty was the pace of Mainland China’s economic recovery, which was slower than general market expectations.\n\nWith volatility and unpredictability becoming the “new normal” in financial markets, Hong Kong has again demonstrated its well-known ability to adapt, showing remarkable resilience. Since the city’s full-fledged post-COVID reopening last year, much work has been done to attract people back to our dynamic city and reconnect them with Hong Kong. The HKMA has contributed by hosting a series of large-scale international events such as the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit and conferences with the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), which showcased our vibrant city and helped send the message worldwide that Hong Kong, as a major international financial centre (IFC), is open for business and remains the centre of action and innovation. There are clear signs of gradual recovery, driven by an encouraging revival of inbound tourism and improved private consumption, also supported by a resilient labour market and the various support measures rolled out by the Government. For 2023 as a whole, Hong Kong’s gross domestic product growth bounced back to 3.2% from negative territory in 2022.\n\nThe HKMA entered its fourth decade in 2023. The past 30 years have seen the dynamics of the economy and the financial markets change drastically, with technology driving advances beyond anyone’s wildest imagination. The invaluable experience and wisdom gained over the past three decades have enabled us to face the future with confidence. Despite macroeconomic headwinds and an uncertain external environment, the HKMA will continue to uphold its mandate of safeguarding monetary and banking stability in Hong Kong, and will actively pursue developmental opportunities to anchor that stability and cement the city’s status as a leading IFC.\n\nFormer and current Financial Secretaries of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Chief Executives of HKMA at a gathering to celebrate the HKMA’s 30th anniversary: (from left) Mr Joseph Yam, Mr Henry Tang, Mr Donald Tsang, Mr Paul Chan, Mr Eddie Yue, Mr Antony Leung, Mr John Tsang, and Mr Norman Chan\n\n# LERS — Weathering the storms\n\nLast year marked the 40th anniversary of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), a staunch pillar supporting Hong Kong’s strong and stable monetary and financial systems. Four decades of transparent and effective operation have nurtured confidence in the LERS and its credibility in the market. Throughout the year, the Hong Kong dollar stayed within the Convertibility Zone and the Hong Kong dollar market operated smoothly, reflecting the strong market confidence in the LERS, a confidence also shared and expressed by the International Monetary Fund and global market players.\n\nBehind this confidence lie the HKMA’s proactive efforts in public and market engagements, along with effective surveillance. We spared no effort during the year in communicating with key stakeholders to foster a clear understanding of the functioning of the LERS, which is all the more important in times of volatility, be it stemming from economic stress or political uncertainties. We also strengthened surveillance of our monetary system, leveraging the use of datasets from the trade repository and expanded granular data from banks, as well as advanced data analytics and artificial intelligence, to enhance our capability, enabling more timely and comprehensive analysis of financial stability and macro-prudential surveillance.\n\n# Banking system — A major source of stability\n\nDespite a multitude of challenges including the high-interestrate environment, persistent geopolitical tensions and a challenging credit landscape, Hong Kong’s banking system remained stable throughout the year, underpinned by strong capital and liquidity buffers.\n\nAs at the end of 2023, the consolidated total capital ratio of local banks stood at 21.1%, well above the international minimum requirement of 8%. The Liquidity Coverage Ratio of large banks edged up to 178.6% as of the fourth quarter of 2023, likewise well above the statutory minimum requirement of 100%. While the classified loan ratio increased slightly from 1.40% at the end of 2022 to 1.56% at the end of 2023, it remained below the long-term historical average of 2.0%. The increase was mainly driven by exposures to Mainland privately-owned enterprise (POE) property developers; but such exposure levels were generally well-contained as a result of banks’ prudent credit risk management over the years, and the overall asset quality of the banking sector remained sound.\n\nWhat caught most market players by surprise in 2023 was unquestionably the banking turmoil in the US spilling over to Europe, which created a level of system-wide banking stress unseen since the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. The HKMA remained on high alert as the situation unfolded and took a number of precautionary actions to limit any potential adverse spillover effects on confidence in the local banking and financial systems. This, coupled with the strong capital and liquidity buffers maintained by banks in Hong Kong, meant that our banking sector was largely unaffected by the turmoil, remaining resilient even as the global financial markets were roiled. In the aftermath of this episode, the HKMA conducted a comprehensive internal review with a view to drawing out lessons for the local banking sector and strengthening the HKMA’s supervisory effectiveness and agility to handle a banking crisis should one occur.\n\nWhile prudent credit risk management is important, we have always reiterated our supervisory expectation for banks to be mindful of the need to support the real economy. As the orderly exit from the banking sector’s Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme commenced in July 2023 with the economic effects of COVID-19 receding, the HKMA worked closely with banks to ensure a gradual and smooth transition to normal loan repayment with flexibility for those borrowers who continued to be under pressure. Earlier this year, recognising that some small and medium-sized enterprises are still facing challenges in their operations despite the end of the pandemic, nine new measures were rolled out to further assist them in obtaining financing from banks.\n\nHaving reviewed the risks associated with the local property market in the context of banks’ property lending, the HKMA announced in July 2023 the first relaxation of the countercyclical macroprudential measures for residential properties since their introduction in 2009. This relaxation increased the loan-to-value ratio cap for most residential mortgage loans as well as for financing for property development and investment. It was later followed by suspension of the interest rate stress testing requirement in early 2024.\n\nThe HKMA’s supervision of financial institutions has been moving with the times. With recent years having seen a sharp global increase in fraud cases, we have considerably stepped up our efforts to counter new fraud tactics by introducing a holistic set of measures to protect bank customers. These include enhancing information sharing between banks and with law enforcement agencies; strengthening the monitoring of suspicious transactions (including implementation of real-time fraud monitoring and tightened payment card authentication); empowering customers to have more controls on their payment cards; and educating customers and raising public awareness of frauds with the launch of the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter, as well as a pre-transaction alert mechanism which warns users if a higher-risk Faster Payment System (FPS) transaction is spotted.\n\nIn light of a proliferation of innovative and digital banking products and services, the HKMA has worked with the banking industry to step up consumer and investor protection more broadly and enhance the banks’ operational and cyber resilience, as well as their collective defences against systemic cyber events. At the same time, all major banks have considerably strengthened their capabilities to respond to, and recover from, destructive ransomware attacks. The HKMA together with the industry has also pursued various consumer data infrastructure projects, such as the “Credit Data Smart” pilot programme to enhance consumer credit reference services, and taken forward a cross-boundary credit reference initiative to facilitate crossboundary financing activities by corporates.\n\nFintech and digitalisation can bring about enormous opportunities when the risk is properly managed. Leveraging earlier success in facilitating the uptake of Regtech, the HKMA, with the support of the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Insurance Authority, published a new Fintech Promotion Roadmap in August 2023 to promote further development of fintech by financial institutions in five focus areas — Wealthtech, Insurtech, Greentech, artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology. We anticipate local regulators continuing to collaborate and work closely together with their industry sectors in the coming years in order for the Hong Kong financial industry as a whole to keep abreast and reap the benefits of dynamic fintech development.\n\n# Hong Kong as an IFC — The centre of action and innovation\n\nIn 2023, we fully emerged from the pandemic. Hong Kong was not only back in business but its position as one of the world’s leading IFCs was further underscored by the return of global investors and our strengthened global network. Domestically, we took the opportunity of the 30th anniversary of the HKMA’s establishment to host a series of large-scale, international events with top-level participation from the global financial and banking community to demonstrate Hong Kong’s vibrancy and to send a clear message that Hong Kong as an IFC remained relevant and indispensable to global investors and financial institutions seeking growth and innovation. Of particular note was the return of the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit, held in November, which attracted to our city more than 350 international and regional leaders from some 160 global financial institutions. Other high-powered events hosted in Hong Kong included a meeting of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) and two HKMA-BIS Conferences which were among the largest gatherings of central bank governors and banking supervisors of the year. These events attest to the global financial sector’s commitment to and confidence in Hong Kong.\n\nExternally, 2023 was also a year in which Hong Kong proactively reached out to strengthen its connections with traditional markets including the US and Europe, as well as new destinations such as those in the Middle East. We met with peer regulators and top management of global financial institutions in these markets to both apprise and update them on the opportunities in Hong Kong and the Mainland, while seeking out new collaboration opportunities for Hong Kong.\n\nTo complement these engagement efforts, we actively contributed to the work of international and regional forums by taking up certain leadership roles. During the year, I accepted invitations to chair the BIS Meeting of Governors from Major Emerging Market Economies and to co-chair the Financial Stability Board (FSB)’s Regional Consultative Group for Asia. My colleagues are also chairing or co-chairing a number of other important groupings under the Basel Committee, the Financial Action Task Force, and the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks, to name a few. The HKMA’s leadership at many regional and international forums is a recognition of Hong Kong’s expertise and contribution to international central banking and regulatory efforts in the pursuit of global monetary and financial stability, as well as Hong Kong’s importance as an IFC.\n\nTo build on the above accomplishments, we must position ourselves as a forward-looking IFC, staying ahead of the curve to ensure our ongoing competitiveness. We have identified three long-term trends in the coming years that will shape our future: namely the continued opening-up of the Mainland, the development of green and sustainable finance and the deployment of fintech. We will continue to support the development of our financial markets to capture the opportunities from these long-term trends while positioning our financial platform to provide leading services to attract more businesses to Hong Kong.

2023.\n","terms":{"signs":["跡象"],"added":["新增"],"later":["其後"],"took":["接任"],"auspices":["支持"],"closely":["緊密"],"stellar":["可觀"],"advanced":["先進"],"past":["過去"],"signed":["簽訂"],"work":["工作"],"abreast":["緊貼"],"leading":["領先"],"introducing":["推出"],"back":["回復"],"’":[""],"use":["使用"],"facilitate":["便利"],"21.1":["21.1%"],"successfully":["成功"],"focus":["重點"],"whole":["全年"],"shortly":["不久"],"Apart":["除了"],"particular":["尤其"],"conducted":["進行"],"thereby":["從而"],"expressed":["表示"],"slowing":["放緩"],"worked":["合作"],"appropriate":["適當"],"gradual":["逐步"],"People":["人民"],"message":["信息"],"spotted":["識別"],"Progress":["進展"],"dotted":["比比皆是"],"Taking":["鑑於"],"relaxation":["放寬"],"range":["種類"],"—":["—"],"number":["數字"],"city":["城市"],"general":["普遍"],"unpredictability":["難以預測"],"third":["第三"],"challenging":["充滿挑戰"],"effort":["工作"],"Moreover":["此外"],"since":["自"],"bracing":["迎來"],"introduction":["推出"],"revival":["復甦"],"confidence":["信心"],"matter":["問題"],"fronts":["範疇"],"wisdom":["智慧"],"update":["介紹"],"similarly":["同樣"],"launched":["推出"],"celebrate":["慶祝"],"colleagues":["同事"],"Despite":["儘管"],"stood":["維持"],"opportunity":["機遇"],"deepen":["深化"],"Details":["詳情"],"significant":["重大"],"Shenzhen":["深圳市"],"strong":["雄厚"],"high-powered":["高級別"],"obtain":["取得"],"departments":["部門"],"opening-up":["開放"],"continue":["繼續"],"timely":["及時"],"attracted":["吸引"],"expansion":["擴展"],"million":["百萬"],"shown":["體現"],"launch":["推出"],"expectations":["預期"],"Mr":["先生"],"success":["成功"],"towards":["朝"],"pace":["步伐"],"awareness":["意識"],"handle":["處理"],"able":["能夠"],"despite":["儘管"],"subsequent":["隨後"],"efforts":["努力"],"2024":["2024年"],"reap":["把握"],"much":["多項"],"high":["高"],"cement":["鞏固"],"broad-based":["全面"],"increased":["上升"],"topping":["增值"],"counter":["櫃台"],"aim":["目標"],"protect":["保障"],"2021":["2021年"],"credibility":["可信性"],"last":["去年"],"enriched":["豐富"],"issuing":["發行"],"smoothly":["暢順"],"within":["內"],"themes":["主題"],"IFCs":["國際金融中心"],"maintained":["維持"],"providing":["提供"],"anniversary":["周年"],"arise":["出現"],"rapidly":["迅速"],"forums":["組織"],"players":["參與者"],"exceeding":["超過"],"establish":["建立"],"existing":["現有"],"nine":["9"],"40th":["40周年"],"gatherings":["聚會"],"30":["30"],"strengthen":["加強"],"receding":["減退"],"proliferation":["快速增長"],"regards":["方面"],"year":["年"],"leaders":["領導人"],"covered":["涵蓋"],"breakthrough":["突破"],"Externally":["對外"],"foster":["促進"],"geopolitical":["地緣政治"],"team":["團隊"],"along":["連同"],"decades":["十年"],"always":["一直"],"potential":["潛在"],"Secretaries":["司司長"],"shocks":["震盪"],"opening":["重新連繫"],"implement":["推行"],"need":["需要"],"facilitative":["便利"],"may":["可能"],"years":["年"],"law":["法例"],"turbulence":["波動"],"commenced":["開始"],"overshadow":["蒙上陰影"],"introduced":["推出"],"forward-looking":["長遠"],"Leveraging":["藉"],"became":["成為"],"billion":["億"],"series":["一連串"],"progressing":["推進"],"1.56":["1.56%"],"pillar":["支柱"],"currencies":["貨幣"],"experience":["經驗"],"offering":["提供"],"pursuit":["推動"],"say":["說"],"30th":["三十週年"],"digitising":["數碼化"],"enabling":["讓"],"residents":["居民"],"increase":["增加"],"bounce":["反彈"],"milestones":["里程碑"],"August":["8月"],"pave":["鋪路"],"step":["步驟"],"name":["名稱"],"end":["年底"],"consecutive":["連續"],"actions":["行動"],"ability":["能力"],"Zone":["範圍"],"negotiating":["磋商"],"tightened":["收緊"],"reconnect":["重新連繫"],"relevant":["相關"],"contribution":["貢獻"],"obtaining":["取得"],"implementation":["執行"],"cities":["城市"],"pursue":["推動"],"position":["地位"],"sure":["相信"],"expanded":["拓展"],"improve":["改善"],"supporting":["支持"],"proactively":["積極"],"cases":["情況"],"linkage":["對接"],"episode":["事件"],"one":["一個"],"include":["包括"],"fourth":["第四"],"impetus":["推動力"],"sound":["健康"],"expand":["擴大"],"five":["五"],"base":["基地"],"driven":["推動"],"operation":["運作"],"announced":["宣布"],"representing":["標誌著"],"coming":["未來"],"reached":["達到"],"greater":["更大"],"province":["省"],"enhance":["提升"],"January":["1月"],"expanding":["拓寬"],"underpinned":["支持"],"competitiveness":["競爭力"],"uphold":["維護"],"among":["之中"],"convenient":["便捷"],"face":["面對"],"Behind":["背後"],"slightly":["微升"],"way":["方式"],"positive":["正面"],"assisted":["協助"],"recently":["最近"],"gathering":["聚會"],"advantage":["優勢"],"high-interestrate":["高息"],"continuing":["繼續"],"estimated":["估計"],"Embracing":["擁抱"],"unfolded":["發展"],"conclusion":["舉行"],"adoption":["應用"],"enhanced":["提升"],"maintains":["維持"],"sophisticated":["高端"],"eight":["8"],"notable":["顯著"],"ensure":["確保"],"5.5":["5.5%"],"risk-based":["風險為本"],"multiple":["多個"],"fifth":["五周年"],"second":["第2屆"],"lessons":["經驗"],"demonstrates":["展現"],"makes":["取得"],"implementing":["實施"],"counterparts":["有關當局"],"parties":["第三方"],"strengthening":["加強"],"also":["亦"],"completing":["完成"],"demonstrating":["展現"],"widen":["擴大"],"successful":["順利"],"stable":["穩健"],"developing":["制定"],"alongside":["隨着"],"enters":["進入"],"functionalities":["功能"],"make":["取得"],"provided":["提供"],"intensified":["加強"],"ledger":["分類帳"],"Figures":["數字"],"cornerstone":["基石"],"views":["意見"],"build":["建立"],"works":["工作"],"made":["取得"],"Highlights":["摘要"],"mostly":["大部分時間"],"usage":["使用率"],"introduce

在逆境中展現韌性\n\n2023 年金融市場的主要議題是，在全球經濟成長放緩、利率環境「高企時間更長」以及地緣政治緊張局勢加劇（不僅源於俄烏戰爭和中美緊張局勢，還包括中東衝突的爆發）的背景下，其影響持續發酵。美國和歐洲在 3 月發生的銀行業動盪，是自 2008 年全球金融危機以來最嚴重的全系統性銀行業壓力事件，進一步打擊了市場情緒。主要經濟體面臨貨幣政策收緊的嚴峻現實，以及通膨路徑和利率前景的更大不確定性。此外，中國大陸經濟復甦的步伐慢於市場普遍預期，也加劇了不確定性。\n\n在金融市場波動和不可預測性成為「新常態」的情況下，香港再次展現了其著名的適應能力，表現出顯著的韌性。自去年城市全面恢復後疫情運作以來，我們已做了大量工作，以吸引人們回到我們這個充滿活力的城市，並重新與香港建立聯繫。金管局作出了貢獻，舉辦了一系列大型國際活動，如全球金融領袖投資峰會，以及與國際清算銀行（BIS）的會議，展示了我們城市的活力，並向全球傳達了訊息：香港作為一個主要國際金融中心（IFC），已開放營業，並仍然是行動和創新的中心。有明顯跡象表明，在入境旅遊的令人鼓舞的復甦和私人消費改善的推動下，經濟正逐步復甦，同時還得到穩健的勞動力市場和政府推出的各種支持措施的支撐。就 2023 年全年而言，香港國內生產總值增長從 2022 年的負值反彈至 3.2%。\n\n2023 年，金管局進入了其第四個十年。在過去的 30 年裡，經濟和金融市場的動態發生了巨大變化，技術推動的進步超出了任何人的想像。在過去三十年間所獲得的寶貴經驗和智慧，使我們能夠充滿信心地面對未來。儘管面臨宏觀經濟逆風和外部環境的不確定性，金管局將繼續履行其使命，維護香港的貨幣和銀行業穩定，並積極尋求發展機遇，以鞏固這一穩定性，並強化香港作為領先國際金融中心的地位。\n\n香港特別行政區政府歷任及現任財政司司長及金管局歷任總裁出席金管局三十周年慶祝活動：(左起)

的強大信心，國際貨幣基金組織和全球市場參與者也表達了同樣的信心。\n\n這種信心的背後，是金管局在公眾和市場參與方面的積極努力，以及有效的監管。在過去一年中，我們不遺餘力地與主要利益相關者溝通，以促進對 LERS 運作的清晰理解，這在波動時期尤為重要，無論波動源於經濟壓力還是政治不確定性。我們還加強了對貨幣體系的監管，利用交易存管庫的數據集和銀行提供的更詳細數據，以及先進的數據分析和人工智慧，以提高我們的能力，實現對金融穩定性和宏觀審慎監管的更及時和全面的分析。\n\n# 銀行體系 — 穩定的主要來源\n\n儘管面臨高利率環境、持續的地緣政治緊張局勢和充滿挑戰的信貸環境等多項挑戰，但香港銀行體系在全年保持穩定，得益於強大的資本和流動性緩衝。\n\n截至 2023 年底，本地銀行的綜合總資本比率為 21.1%，遠高於國際最低要求的 8%。截至 2023 年第四季度，大型銀行的流動性覆蓋比率略升至 178.6%，同樣高於法定最低要求的 100%。雖然分類貸款比率從 2022 年底的 1.40% 略升至 2023 年底的 1.56%，但仍低於 2.0% 的長期歷史平均水平。增加的主要原因是對內地民營企業（POE）物業開發商的風險敞口；但由於銀行多年來審慎的信貸風險管理，這種風險敞口水平總體上得到有效控制，銀行業的整體資產品質保持健康。\n\n2023 年，讓大多數市場參與者感到意外的無疑是美國銀行業動盪蔓延至歐洲，這造成了自 2008 年全球金融危機以來前所未有的全系統性銀行業壓力。隨著局勢的發展，金管局保持高度警惕，並採取了多項預防措施，以限制任何潛在的不利溢出效應對本地銀行和金融體系信心的影響。這，加上香港銀行維持的強大資本和流動性緩衝，意味著我們的銀行業在很大程度上未受動盪影響，即使在全球金融市場動盪時仍保持韌性。在這一事件之後，金管局進行了一次全面的內部審查，以期為本地銀行業汲取教訓，並加強金管局的監管有效性和應對銀行危機的靈活性，以防萬一發生危機。\n\n雖然審慎的信貸風險管理很重要，但我們一直重申對銀行的監管期望，即銀行應注意支持實體經濟的需要。隨著 2023 年 7 月銀行業有序退出預先批准的本金還款假期計劃，以及 COVID-19 的經濟影響減退，金管局與銀行緊密合作，確保逐步和順利過渡到正常的貸款還款，並為那些仍面臨壓力的借款人提供靈活性。今年早些時候，認識到一些中小企業在疫情結束后仍面臨營運挑戰，我們推出了九項新措施，以進一步協助它們從銀行獲得融資。\n\n在檢討了與銀行物業貸款相關的本地物業市場風險後，金管局於 2023 年 7 月宣布，自 2009 年推出逆周期宏觀審慎措施以來，首次放寬住宅物業的相關措施。此項放寬提高了大部分住宅按揭貸款以及物業發展及投資融資的按揭成數上限。其後，於 2024 年初暫停利率壓力測試的要求。\n\n金管局對金融機構的監管與時俱進。近年來，全球詐騙案件激增，我們大幅加強了打擊新詐騙手法的工作，推出了一系列全面措施以保障銀行客戶。這些措施包括：加強銀行之間的資訊共享及與執法機構的合作；強化對可疑交易的監控（包括實施實時詐騙監控及收緊支付卡認證）；賦予客戶更多控制其支付卡的能力；以及透過推出《反騙案消費者保障約章》及交易前提示機制（當系統識別到高風險的快速支付系統（FPS）交易時，會向用戶發出警告），教育客戶及提高公眾對詐騙的警覺性。\n\n鑑於創新及數位銀行產品及服務的快速增長，金管局與銀行業合作，更廣泛地加強對消費者和投資者的保障，提升銀行的營運和網路韌性，以及它們抵禦系統性網路事件的集體防禦能力。同時，所有主要銀行都大幅強化了應對和從具破壞性的勒索軟體攻擊中復原的能力。金管局與業界亦推行了多項消費者數據基礎建設專案，例如「信用資料智」試驗計畫，以提升消費者信貸參考服務，並推進跨境信貸參考措施，以促進企業的跨境融資活動。\n\n金融科技和數位化在妥善管理風險的情況下，可帶來巨大的機遇。金管局憑藉早前在促進監管科技應用方面的成功經驗，在證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）及保險業監管局的支援下，於 2023 年 8 月發表了新的《金融科技推廣規劃路徑》，以促進金融機構在五個重點領域進一步發展金融科技，包括財富科技、保險科技、綠色科技、人工智慧及分布式分類帳技術。我們預期本地監管機構將在未來數年繼續與業界緊密合作，令香港金融業界整體能夠緊貼金融科技的動態發展並從中受惠。\n\n# 香港作為國際金融中心 — 行動與創新的中心\n\n2023 年，我們完全走出了疫情。香港不僅恢復了業務，而且隨著全球投資者的回歸和我們全球網絡的強化，其作為世界領先國際金融中心之一的地位得到了進一步強調。在國內，我們藉金管局成立 30 周年的機會，舉辦了一系列大型國際活動，全球金融和銀行界的頂級人士參加了這些活動，以展示香港的活力，並傳達一個明確的訊息：香港作為國際金融中心，對尋求成長和創新的全球投資者和金融機構仍然具有重要性和不可或缺性。特別值得一提的是，全球金融領袖投資峰會於 11 月回歸，吸引了來自約 160 家全球金融機構的 350 多名國際和區域領袖前來我們的城市。在香港舉辦的其他高級別活動包括巴塞爾銀行監理委員會（巴塞爾委員會）會議和兩場金管局-BIS 會議，這些會議是當年央行行長和銀行監管機構最大規模的聚會之一。這些活動證明了全球金融界對香港的承諾和信心。\n\n在對外方面，2023 年也是香港主動出擊的一年，以強化與美國和歐洲等傳統市場的聯繫，以及與中東等新目的地的聯繫。我們與這些市場的同行監管機構和全球金融機構的高層管理人員會面，向他們介紹和更新香港和內地機遇的最新情況，同時為香港尋找新的合作機會。\n\n為配合這些聯繫工作，我們積極參與國際和區域論壇的工作，承擔了某些領導角色。在過去一年中，我接受了邀請，擔任 BIS 主要新興市場經濟體總督會議的主席，並擔任金融穩定委員會（FSB）亞洲區域諮詢小組的聯合主席。我的同事們也在巴塞爾委員會、金融行動特別工作組和東亞及太平洋中央銀行行政首長會議等其他重要組織中擔任主席或聯合主席。金管局在許多區域和國際論壇中的領導地位，是對香港在國際中央銀行和監管工作中的專業知識和貢獻的認可，這些工作旨在實現全球貨幣和金融穩定，並強調了香港作為國際金融中心的重要性。\n\n為鞏固上述成就，我們必須將自己定位為一個前瞻性的國際金融中心，保持領先地位，以確保我們的持續競爭力。我們已確定了未來幾年將塑造我們未來的三個長期趨勢：即內地持續開放、綠色和永續金融的發展，以及金融科技的應用。我們將繼續支持金融市場的發展，以抓住這些長期趨勢帶來的機遇，同時定位我們的金融平台，提供領先的服務，以吸引更多企業到香港。有關我們在綠色和永續金融方面的工作的詳細資訊，讀者可參閱我們的《2023 年永續發展報告》。"}
{"en":"# Highlights of 2023\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nDespite a challenging external environment, the Hong Kong economy stages a positive growth in 2023, driven by revivals in inbound tourism and domestic demand. The labour market continues to improve alongside the economic recovery, while inflation remains moderate. Economic activities for 2024 are expected to recover further at a moderate pace, although the outlook is clouded by multiple external uncertainties.\n\nThe banking sector in Hong Kong remains sound in 2023, supported by strong capital and liquidity buffers. Asset quality remains at a healthy level.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nAmid market expectations of a “high for longer” US policy rate, the Hong Kong dollar mostly trades on the weak side of the Convertibility Zone in 2023, with the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking being triggered eight times between mid-February and early May. The Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets remain stable, and continue to trade in a smooth and orderly manner.\n\n2023 marks the 40th anniversary of the Linked Exchange Rate System. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, the Linked Exchange Rate System has helped Hong Kong weather a succession of shocks and crises in the past four decades, demonstrating the system’s resilience and robustness.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA responds swiftly to the March banking turmoil in the US and Europe — from managing the ripple effects to completing an internal review drawing lessons for the local banking sector, while maintaining its focus on the credit, liquidity and market risk management of banks. In light of escalating cyber threats and increasing use of technology services provided by third parties, the HKMA also works closely with banks to enhance their operational and cyber resilience.\n\nThe HKMA enhances consumer protection on payment cards, and through further revision of the Code of Banking Practice as well as the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter. The HKMA works with fellow regulators on a balanced regulatory regime for virtual asset-related activities, streamlines the selling process for sophisticated professional investors, introduces enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Pilot Scheme, and commences supervision of trust business. A pilot programme on consumer credit reference services under “Credit Data Smart” is also launched.\n\nThe HKMA’s efforts in anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism reflect a commitment to targeting the highest threats under a risk-based approach. To address increasing digital fraud, the HKMA has strengthened ecosystem collaboration through the launch of real-time fraud monitoring, enhanced information sharing between banks and with law enforcement agencies, intensified public education, and launched a new pre-transaction alert mechanism when using the Faster Payment System. In parallel, supervisory technology capabilities have been advanced through the Macro Analytics pilot scheme.\n\nThe HKMA makes good progress on implementing international supervisory standards locally, including those on capital adequacy and disclosure, and makes notable efforts in enhancing capacity building in the banking sector.\n\nThe HKMA also advances its work to ensure a credible resolution regime, including developing a new resolution standard on accessing critical financial market infrastructures, and completing a review on the implementation of loss-absorbing capacity policy standards.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\nThe successful conclusion of the second Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit and the HKMA-BIS High-Level Conference demonstrates the global financial sector’s commitment to and confidence in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA works closely with its Mainland and Hong Kong counterparts to deepen and widen the mutual access between the Hong Kong and Mainland financial markets. This includes enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Scheme, designation of additional market makers for Southbound Trading under Bond Connect, the successful launch of Northbound Trading of Swap Connect, and the roll-out of the HKD-RMB Dual Counter Model and the Dual Counter Market Making Programme, all of which are effective in solidifying Hong Kong’s status as a global hub for offshore renminbi business.\n\nOn strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, notable progress is made in areas including bond issuance, asset and wealth management, green and sustainable finance, and corporate treasury centres.\n\nThe HKMA continues to make significant progress on various fronts of the “Fintech 2025” strategy. Project mBridge enters the Minimum Viable Product development phase, Phase 1 of the e-HKD Pilot Programme is completed, and Commercial Data Interchange sees increasing usage and the successful linkage with Government data source. Moreover, a new Fintech Promotion Roadmap is announced to further develop Wealthtech, Insurtech, Greentech, artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology in the banking sector. Meanwhile, the Faster Payment System marks its fifth anniversary and continues to see expanded adoption and enhancements including new functionalities like the linkage with Thailand’s PromptPay for cross-border QR payment. Significant progress is also made in relation to developing a regulatory regime for stablecoin issuers, with a public consultation paper published for gathering views on the legislative proposal.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\nDespite a volatile and challenging investment environment, the Exchange Fund manages to achieve a decent investment income of HK$226.0 billion, representing an investment return of 5.5%.\n\nThe HKMA continues its efforts on asset diversification and responsible investing. Meanwhile, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio records an annualised internal rate of return of 11.8% since its inception in 2009.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains active communication with the community and the market through different channels to promote public understanding about its policies and operations.\n\nInternally, the HKMA strives to build an agile and professional workforce, maintain rigorous financial discipline and upgrade its digital capabilities to adapt to changes and ensure effective implementation of its policies and

2023 年摘要\n\n# 經濟及金融環境\n\n儘管外部環境充滿挑戰，香港經濟在 2023 年仍錄得正面增長，主要受入境旅遊和本地需求復甦所推動。隨着經濟復甦，勞動市場持續改善，而通膨則保持溫和。預期 2024 年的經濟活動將以溫和步伐進一步復甦，但前景受到多項外部不確定因素影響。\n\n香港銀行業在 2023 年保持穩健，得益於雄厚的資本和流動性緩衝。資產品質維持在健康水平。\n\n# 貨幣穩定\n\n在市場預期美國政策利率將維持在高檔較長時間的情況下，港元在 2023 年大部分時間在兌換區間的弱方交易，弱方兌換保證在 2 月中至 5 月初期間共被觸發 8 次。港元匯率及貨幣市場保持穩定，並繼續有序及順暢地運作。\n\n2023 年是聯繫匯率制度 40 週年。作為香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石，聯繫匯率制度在過去四十年中幫助香港抵禦了一連串的衝擊和危機，展現了該制度的韌性及穩健性。\n\n# 銀行業穩定\n\n金管局迅速應對 3 月份美國及歐洲的銀行業動盪——從管理連鎖效應到完成內部檢討，為本地銀行業汲取經驗，同時繼續專注於銀行的信貸、流動性和市場風險管理。鑑於網路威脅日益增加，以及對第三方提供的科技服務的使用日益普及，金管局亦與銀行緊密合作，以提升其營運及網路韌性。\n\n金管局透過進一步修訂《銀行業操守守則》及《反詐騙消費者保護約章》，加強對支付卡的消費者保障。金管局與同行監管機構合作，為與虛擬資產相關的活動建立平衡的監管制度，簡化高端專業投資者的銷售流程，引入跨境理財通試點計畫的提升措施，並開始監管信託業務。此外，亦推出「信用數據智能」下的消費者信貸資料參照服務試點計畫。\n\n金管局在反洗錢和反恐融資方面的努力，反映了其以風險為本的方法應對最高威脅的承諾。為應對日益增加的數位詐騙，金管局透過推出即時詐騙監測、加強銀行間及與執法機構的資訊共享、強化公眾教育，以及在使用快速支付系統時推出新的交易前警示機制，以加強生態系統合作。與此同時，透過巨量分析試點計畫，監管科技能力亦得到提升。\n\n金管局在本地實施國際監管標準方面取得良好進展，包括資本充足率和資訊披露標準，並在加強銀行業能力建設方面作出顯著努力。\n\n金管局亦推進其工作，以確保一個可信的處置制度，包括制定一個新的標準，以評估關鍵金融市場基礎設施的可用性，並完成對虧損吸收能力政策標準實施情況的檢討。\n\n# 國際金融中心\n\n第二屆全球金融領袖投資峰會及金管局與 BIS 的高層會議的成功舉行，展現了全球金融界對香港的承諾和信心。\n\n金管局與內地及香港有關當局緊密合作，深化及擴大香港與內地金融市場的互聯互通。這包括優化跨境理財通計畫、指定更多南向交易的債券通做市商、順利啟動北向交易的互換通，以及推出港元-人民幣雙櫃台模式及雙櫃台做市商計畫，這些措施均有效鞏固香港作為離岸人民幣業務全球樞紐的地位。\n\n在加強香港金融平台的競爭力方面，債券發行、資產及財富管理、綠色及永續金融，以及企業財資中心等領域均取得顯著進展。\n\n金管局在「金融科技 2025」策略的不同領域繼續取得重大進展。mBridge 計畫進入最小可行產品開發階段，電子港元試點計畫第一階段完成，商業數據交換平台的使用率上升並成功與政府數據源對接。此外，公佈了一項新的金融科技推廣路線圖，以進一步發展銀行業的財富科技、保險科技、綠色科技、人工智慧及分布式分類帳技術。與此同時，快速支付系統迎來五週年，並繼續拓展應用範圍及提升功能，包括新增與泰國 PromptPay 的跨境 QR 碼支付對接功能。在制定穩定幣發行人的監管制度方面亦取得重大進展，並發表了公眾諮詢文件，以收集對立法建議的意見。\n\n# 儲備管理\n\n儘管投資環境動盪且充滿挑戰，外匯基金仍錄得良好的投資收入，達 2,260 億港元，相當於 5.5% 的投資回報。\n\n金管局繼續努力進行資產多元化及負責任投資。同時，自 2009 年開展投資以來，長期增長組合的年化內部回報率為 11.8%。\n\n# 機構職能\n\n金管局透過不同渠道與社會及市場保持積極聯繫，以促進公眾對其政策及運作的了解。\n\n在內部，金管局致力建立一支靈活應變及專業的團隊，維持嚴格的財務紀律，並提升其數位能力，以適應變化並確保其政策及措施的有效執行。"}

{"en":"# Priorities for 2024 and Beyond\n\nEntering 2024, the Hong Kong economy is expected to continue to recover at a moderate pace, riding on the ongoing revival of inbound tourism, public infrastructure projects and stable private consumption. However, the external environment is fraught with risks and uncertainties, especially those relating to the future US policy rate path, the global growth prospects, and the evolving geopolitical tensions. That said, Hong Kong’s financial system remains well-positioned to weather adverse shocks given its resilience and ample buffers built up over the years.\n\nThe HKMA attaches great importance to safeguarding Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. Looking ahead, we will stay vigilant in the face of the uncertain macroeconomic environment, seeking to promptly identify emerging risks and respond to them in an agile manner. At the same time, we will seek opportunities and create policy headroom to help further enhance Hong Kong’s status as a leading international financial centre. In managing the Exchange Fund in this challenging investment environment, we will continue to invest prudently, while remaining flexible, taking defensive measures as appropriate, and maintaining a high degree of liquidity.\n\n# Stability and integrity of the financial system\n\nThe global economic uncertainties of recent years look set to continue in 2024. The HKMA will keep abreast of latest developments and stay vigilant against potential risks, with the aim of upholding the resilience and stability of the financial system, which are essential for the ongoing provision of critical financial services that support the functioning of the Hong Kong economy.\n\n# Staying vigilant against potential risks\n\nLooking into 2024, global financial markets could experience volatility as a result of uncertainties surrounding the US monetary policy outlook, evolving geopolitical risks, and an uneven global economic recovery. 2024 is also a key election year as many major elections are scheduled to be held across the world. The outcome of these elections could further increase market uncertainties. Nevertheless, Hong Kong’s financial system is well-positioned to withstand adverse shocks given its resilience and buffers built up over the years. The HKMA also has the capability, the resources and the commitment to safeguard Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nThe HKMA will continue its efforts to closely monitor any risks and vulnerabilities arising in the domestic and external environments, and will deploy appropriate measures where necessary to maintain Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. We will also conduct research into issues affecting the Hong Kong economy, assessing and addressing any potential risks associated with these issues.\n\n# Maintaining banking stability\n\nIn 2023, new geopolitical tensions across the world broke out while others remained unresolved, contributing to political uncertainty and instability that looks set to continue into 2024. Economic pressures in the form of high interest rates were a feature of the global landscape, and rates remain high entering 2024. Within the banking sector, the continued drive towards digitalisation and the implementation of new technology, including artificial intelligence, have brought many advantages but are also posing new operational and cyber security risks as well as supervisory challenges. In such a volatile political, economic and technological landscape, the HKMA strives to ensure banks’ ability to withstand shocks through its ongoing supervisory efforts. At the same time, we will continue to enhance and refine our banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account technological developments, changes in customer expectations, as well as international standards and best practices.\n\n# A risk-based supervisory focus\n\n# Credit, liquidity and market risks\n\nIn light of the increasingly challenging macroeconomic landscape, a special focus of the HKMA will be on monitoring the asset quality of authorized institutions (AIs) and assessing the effectiveness of their credit risk management and controls, particularly with respect to loan classification and provisioning practices and problem loans management. We will also maintain close dialogue with the banking and commercial sectors with a view to ensuring that AIs are striking an appropriate balance between undertaking prudent credit risk management and fulfilling their financial intermediation function throughout economic cycles. In particular, we will follow up with banks through the Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism on the nine new measures rolled out in March 2024 to assist small and medium-sized enterprises in obtaining financing from banks.\n\nUncertainties in the global economic outlook as well as elevated geopolitical tensions may increase the volatility of both asset prices and cross-border fund flows. The HKMA will make vigilance a priority, and will continue to effectively supervise the liquidity and market risk management of AIs.\n\n# Follow-up actions on lessons drawn from the 2023 banking turmoil\n\nThe HKMA will implement the follow-up actions identified in the internal review that it undertook in response to the 2023 banking turmoil in the US and Europe. These are actions that will further strengthen supervisory effectiveness and enhance its ability to handle a banking crisis should one arise. They include enhancing the risk capture of AIs’ interest rate risk in the banking book in the context of the HKMA’s supervisory review process, improving the preparedness of AIs for dealing with liquidity stresses given the continuing digitalisation of banking services, streamlining the HKMA’s crisis management processes, and further enhancing interagency and cross-border supervisory co-ordination.\n\n# Operational and technology risk\n\nThe HKMA will continue to monitor AIs’ progress towards achieving full compliance with the HKMA Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module OR-2 on “Operational Resilience”, and assess and benchmark banks’ tolerance limits for plausible disruptions, with a view to enhancing the overall resilience of the banking system. With respect to cyber risk, we will oversee a new round of self-assessments by AIs under the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 and monitor AIs’ implementation of a secure tertiary data backup to enhance their data recovery capabilities if faced with destructive cyber attacks.\n\nGiven the accelerating pace of digitalisation in banking operations, the HKMA will keep a close watch on emerging risks arising from the use of advanced technologies such as generative artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology. We will also collaborate with banks and other relevant stakeholders in operating an agile and pre-emptive mechanism to counter the growing trend of digital fraud.\n\n# Combatting money laundering and terrorist financing\n\nIn 2024, to uphold the integrity of the banking system and build customer confidence, the HKMA will target high-risk areas and prioritise risk-based regulatory updates, including issuing guidance to support an effective, risk-based implementation of changes to requirements for politically exposed persons, and supporting the implementation of the regulatory regime for stablecoin issuers. We will also issue guidance to help AIs optimise their transaction monitoring systems and to promote the responsible use of artificial intelligence, and focus on controls targeting high-end money laundering through our thematic work. To strengthen the ecosystem response to digital fraud and reduce losses to victims, we will further consult the public and the industry on a proposal to expand the scope of bank-to-bank information sharing from corporate accounts to personal accounts and, based on the feedback received, pursue necessary legislative amendments. We will move to a full build of Macro Analytics 3.0 by pooling data relevant to anti-money laundering across multiple banks and interfacing this with existing ecosystem fraud analysis. This will deliver more rapid cross-bank responses and further enhance our datadriven anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism supervision, enabling us to take quicker, more decisive action against systemic money laundering and terrorist financing risks.\n\n# Wealth management and Mandatory Provident Fundrelated businesses\n\nIn 2024, the HKMA will step up both its on-site examinations and off-site surveillance of AIs’ conduct in relation to wealth management and the selling of securities, investment products, and insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses. More specifically, we will focus on Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) business, digital distribution and advisory platforms, virtual asset (VA)-related products, long term insurance products and premium financing activities, taking into account the latest market developments as well as evolving international standards.\n\nThe HKMA will communicate closely with fellow regulators and the banking industry to provide guidance on regulatory standards in relation to the sale of investment, insurance and MPF products as appropriate. In particular, to support the sustainable and responsible development of the VA sector, we will continue to work with the Government and fellow regulators to ensure that the regulatory regime in place for the VA sector is robust, comprehensive and well-balanced.\n\nThe HKMA will facilitate and monitor the industry’s implementation of enhancements to Cross-boundary WMC, and continue to engage with the industry and relevant regulatory authorities in order to further enhance the scheme. We will also continue to work with fellow regulators and the industry to streamline the selling process for investment products, and will consolidate and clarify guidance, as appropriate, to facilitate industry compliance. In addition to trust business, we will also commence the supervision of new Type 13 regulated activity under the Securities and Futures Ordinance for AIs providing depositary services for collective investment schemes authorised by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), which will come into operation on 2 October 2024.\n\n# Oversight of financial market infrastructures\n\nThe HKMA aims to promote the safety and efficiency of the financial market infrastructures (FMIs) under its oversight in accordance with the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO), the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMI) and the various guidance issued by the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI). We will continue to participate in the CPMI-IOSCO1 PFMI implementation monitoring and assessment exercise, and in other international working groups to discuss the implementation of new and innovative FMI-related initiatives. We will also participate in the work of international standard-setting bodies, and will review and strengthen our oversight requirements as appropriate to reflect the latest international practices as well as market and technology developments.\n\n# Policy development\n\nThe HKMA will continue to strengthen and refine its banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account international standards and best practices.\n\n# Implementation of Basel standards in Hong Kong\n\nThe proposed amendments to the Banking (Capital) Rules (BCR) and the Banking (Disclosure) Rules (BDR) for implementing the Basel III final reform package (Final Package) are expected to take effect on 1 January 2025 following the passage of the amended Rules in the Legislative Council. In 2024, the HKMA will continue to prepare the supporting guidance, banking returns and standard disclosure templates and tables needed to facilitate the application of the Rules. In particular, we plan to:\n- consult the industry in the second quarter of 2024 on the revisions to the SPM module CA-B-3 on “Countercyclical Capital Buffer (CCyB)–Geographic Allocation of Private Sector Credit Exposures” and Return MA(BS)25 “Quarterly reporting on the Countercyclical Capital Buffer”, reflecting the consequential changes arising from the implementation of the Final Package and the revised Return of International Banking Statistics; and\n- finalise the package for effecting the reporting-only requirement for the new standards on market and credit valuation adjustment risks, which starts on 1 July 2024.\n\nThose parts of the proposed amendments to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules (BELR) and the Banking (Liquidity) Rules (BLR) that are largely consequential to the implementation of the Final Package under the amended BCR are also targeted to take effect on 1 January 2025. The HKMA plans to finalise the proposed consequential amendments to the related regulatory returns in 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, with a new standard on the prudential treatment of banks’ crypto-asset exposures and subsequent targeted revisions to the standard having been issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December 2022 and December 2023 respectively, local implementation of the standard is planned for 2025. The HKMA will examine the need for potential legislative amendments to various sets of rules, including the BCR, the BDR, the BELR and the BLR, and conduct the statutory consultation on the necessary rule amendments in the first half of 2025.\n\n# Other supervisory policies and risk management guidelines\n\nThe HKMA plans to update a number of SPM modules in response to lessons learned from the banking turmoil in the US and Europe of March 2023, as well as developments in regulatory requirements and international standards.

2024年及以後的工作重點\n\n2024年，預期香港經濟將持續溫和復甦，主要受惠於入境旅遊業的復甦、公共基礎建設項目的推進，以及私人消費的穩定。然而，外部環境充滿風險與不確定性，尤其是美國未來的貨幣政策走向、全球經濟成長前景，以及地緣政治緊張局勢的演變。儘管如此，香港金融體系多年來建立的韌性與充足緩衝機制，使其能夠有效抵禦不利衝擊。\n\n金管局高度重視維護香港的貨幣及金融穩定。展望未來，我們將面對不確定的宏觀經濟環境保持警惕，努力及早識別新風險並靈活應對。同時，我們將尋找機遇並創造政策空間，以進一步鞏固香港作為領先國際金融中心的地位。在管理外匯基金時，面對充滿挑戰的投資環境，我們將繼續審慎投資，保持靈活，採取適當的防禦措施，並維持高流動性。\n\n# 金融體系的穩定與健全性\n\n近年來全球經濟的不確定性預期在2024年將持續存在。金管局將密切關注最新發展，保持警惕以防範潛在風險，旨在維持金融體系的韌性與穩定性，這對於持續提供支持香港經濟運作的重要金融服務至關重要。\n\n# 保持警惕以防範潛在風險\n\n展望2024年，全球金融市場可能因美國貨幣政策前景的不確定性、地緣政治風險的演變，以及全球經濟復甦不均衡等因素而出現波動。2024年也是關鍵的選舉年，全球多地將舉行重大選舉。這些選舉的結果可能進一步加劇市場不確定性。然而，香港金融體系多年來建立的韌性與緩衝機制，使其能夠有效抵禦不利衝擊。金管局亦具備能力、資源和決心，以維護香港的貨幣及金融穩定。\n\n金管局將持續努力，密切監控國內外環境中出現的任何風險和脆弱性，並在必要時採取適當措施，以維持香港的貨幣及金融穩定。我們亦將就影響香港經濟的問題進行研究，評估和應對與這些問題相關的潛在風險。\n\n# 維持銀行業穩定\n\n在2023年，全球各地爆發了新的地緣政治緊張局勢，而其他局勢則仍未解決，導致政治不確定性和不穩定性，預期這種情況將持續至2024年。高利率形式的經濟壓力是全球局勢的特徵，而利率在2024年初仍維持在高水平。在銀行業內，持續推動數位化和實施新技術（包括人工智慧）帶來了許多優勢，但也構成了新的營運和網路安全風險，以及監管挑戰。在如此動盪的政治、經濟和技術環境下，金管局通過持續的監管工作，努力確保銀行抵禦衝擊的能力。同時，我們將繼續強化和完善銀行監管和監管框架及政策，並考慮技術發展、客戶預期變化，以及國際標準和最佳實務。\n\n# 以風險為本的監管重點\n\n# 信貸、流動性及市場風險\n\n鑑於宏觀經濟環境日益充滿挑戰，金管局將特別關注監管認可機構的資產品質，並評估其信貸風險管理和控制的有效性，尤其是貸款分類和撥備實務，以及問題貸款管理方面。我們亦將與銀行業和商業界保持密切對話，以確保認可機構在整個經濟週期內，在進行審慎的信貸風險管理與履行其金融中介職能之間取得適當平衡。具體而言，我們將透過銀行業中小企業貸款協調機制，就2024年3月推出協助中小企業從銀行取得融資的9項新措施，與銀行進行跟進。\n\n全球經濟前景的不確定性，以及地緣政治緊張局勢的加劇，可能增加資產價格和跨境資金流動的波動性。金管局將把保持警惕作為優先事項，並繼續有效監管認可機構的流動性及市場風險管理。\n\n# 從2023年銀行業動盪中汲取教訓的跟進行動\n\n金管局將落實在內部檢討中確定的跟進行動，該檢討是針對2023年美國和歐洲銀行業動盪而進行的。這些行動將進一步強化監管效能，並提升其處理銀行危機的能力（若危機發生）。這些行動包括：在金管局監管檢討程序的框架下，加強捕捉認可機構銀行帳目中的利率風險；鑑於銀行服務持續數位化，改善認可機構應對流動性壓力的準備工作；精簡金管局的危機管理程序；以及進一步強化跨機構和跨境監管協調。\n\n# 營運及科技風險\n\n金管局將繼續監控認可機構在全面遵守金管局《監管政策手冊》中有關「營運韌性」的OR-2模組方面的進展，並評估和基準測試銀行對可能出現的中斷的承受限度，以提升銀行體系的整體韌性。在網路風險方面，我們將監督認可機構根據《網路韌性評估框架2.0》進行新一輪自我評估，並監控認可機構實施安全的第三層數據備份，以提升其在面臨具破壞性的網路攻擊時的數據恢復能力。\n\n鑑於銀行業務數位化步伐加快，金管局將密切留意因使用先進技術（如生成式人工智慧和分布式帳本技術）而出現的新興風險。我們亦將與銀行和其他相關利益關係人合作，營運一個靈活和預防性的機制，以應對日益增長的數位詐騙趨勢。\n\n# 打擊洗錢及恐怖主義融資\n\n在2024年，為維護銀行體系的健全性和建立客戶信心，金管局將針對高風險領域，並優先進行以風險為本的監管更新，包括發出指引以支持有效和以風險為本的方式落實對政治人士的修訂要求，以及支持落實穩定幣發行人的監管制度。我們亦將發出指引，以協助認可機構優化其交易監控系統，並推廣負責任地使用人工智慧，以及透過專題工作，專注於控制針對高端洗錢活動的措施。為強化生態系統對數位詐騙的回應並減低受害者損失，我們將就一項建議進一步諮詢公眾和業界，該建議旨在將銀行間資訊共享的範圍從企業帳戶擴展至個人帳戶，並根據收到的回饋，推動必要的立法修訂。我們將透過匯集多間銀行的相關反洗錢數據，並將其與現有生態系統詐騙分析對接，全面建設宏觀分析3.0。這將實現更快速的跨銀行回應，並進一步強化我們以數據為基礎的反洗錢和反恐怖主義融資監管，使我們能夠更迅速、更果斷地應對系統性的洗錢和恐怖主義融資風險。\n\n# 財富管理及強積金相關業務\n\n在2024年，金管局將加強對認可機構在財富管理、證券銷售、投資產品、保險及強積金相關業務方面的現場檢查及非現場監管。具體而言，我們將重點關注跨境理財通業務、數位分銷及顧問平台、虛擬資產相關產品、長期保險產品及保費融資活動，並考慮最新的市場發展及國際標準的演變。\n\n金管局將與同行監管機構及銀行業保持緊密溝通，就投資、保險及強積金產品的銷售提供適當的監管標準指引。尤其是，為支持虛擬資產行業的可持續及負責任發展，我們將繼續與政府及同行監管機構合作，確保虛擬資產行業的監管制度健全、全面及平衡。\n\n金管局將促進及監控業界落實跨境理財通的改善措施，並繼續與業界及相關監管機構合作，以進一步完善該計畫。我們亦將繼續與同行監管機構及業界合作，精簡投資產品的銷售流程，並適當地整合及澄清指引，以促進業界遵守規定。除信託業務外，我們亦將開始監管《證券及期貨條例》下新的第13類受規管活動，該活動涉及認可機構為證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）授權的集體投資計畫提供存管服務，並將於2024年10月2日開始實施。\n\n# 監管金融市場基礎設施\n\n金管局旨在根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（PSSVFO）、《金融市場基礎設施原則》（PFMI）及支付及市場基礎設施委員會（CPMI）發出的各項指引，促進其監管下的金融市場基礎設施的安全性和效率。我們將繼續參與CPMI-IOSCO PFMI實施監測及評估工作，以及參與其他國際工作小組，以討論實施與金融市場基礎設施相關的新創新舉措。我們亦將參與國際標準制定機構的工作，並適當地檢討及強化我們的監管要求，以反映最新的國際實務及市場和技術發展。\n\n# 政策制定\n\n金管局將繼續強化及完善其銀行監管及監管框架和政策，並考慮國際標準及最佳實務。\n\n# 香港實施巴塞爾標準的情況\n\n為實施巴塞爾III最終改革方案（最終方案），對《銀行（資本）規則》（BCR）及《銀行（披露）規則》（BDR）的擬議修訂，預期將於修訂規則在立法會通過後，在2025年1月1日生效。在2024年，金管局將繼續準備所需的支援指引、銀行報表及標準披露模板和表格，以促進規則的應用。具體而言，我們計劃：\n- 在2024年第二季就《監管政策手冊》中有關「逆周期資本緩衝（CCyB）—私人部門信貸風險曝露的地域分配」的CA-B-3模組修訂，以及「逆周期資本緩衝季度報告」的MA(BS)25報表的修訂，徵詢業界意見，以反映實施最終方案及修訂國際銀行統計數據報表後所帶來的相應改變；及\n- 完成有關新市場及信貸估值調整風險標準的僅限報告要求的實施方案，該要求將於2024年7月1日開始生效。\n\n《銀行（風險限額）規則》（BELR）及《銀行（流動資金）規則》（BLR）的擬議修訂中，有部分主要與修訂後的BCR下最終方案的實施有關，亦預期將於2025年1月1日生效。金管局計劃在2024年完成有關監管報表的擬議相應修訂。\n\n與此同時，巴塞爾銀行監理委員會分別在2022年12月及2023年12月發出了有關銀行加密資產風險的審慎處理新標準，以及隨後對該標準的針對性修訂。該標準的本地實施計劃於2025年進行。金管局將檢視是否需要對《銀行（資本）規則》、《銀行（披露）規則》、《銀行（風險限額）規則》及《銀行（流動資金）規則》等一系列規則進行潛在的立法修訂，並在2025年上半年就必要的規則修訂進行法定諮詢。\n\n# 其他監管政策及風險管理指引\n\n金管局計劃更新多項《監管政策手冊》模組，以回應從2023年3月美國及歐洲銀行業動盪中汲取的教訓，以及監管要求和國際標準的最新發展。這些模組包括："}
{"en":"# About the HKMA\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is Hong Kong’s central banking institution. The HKMA has four main functions:\n- maintaining currency stability within the framework of the Linked Exchange Rate System;\n- promoting the stability and integrity of the financial system, including the banking system;\n- helping to maintain Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre, including the maintenance and development of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure; and\n- managing the Exchange Fund.\n\n# HKMA’s legal mandate\n\nThe HKMA was established on 1 April 1993 after the Legislative Council passed amendments to the Exchange Fund Ordinance in 1992 empowering the Financial Secretary to appoint a Monetary Authority.\n\nThe powers, functions and responsibilities of the Monetary Authority are set out in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the Banking Ordinance, the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance, the Deposit Protection Scheme Ordinance, the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, and other relevant Ordinances. The division of functions and responsibilities in monetary and financial affairs between the Financial Secretary and the Monetary Authority is set out in an exchange of letters dated 25 June 2003. The exchange of letters discloses delegations made by the Financial Secretary to the Monetary Authority. The letters are public documents and can be found on the HKMA website.\n\nThe Exchange Fund Ordinance establishes the Exchange Fund under the control of the Financial Secretary. According to the Ordinance, the Fund shall be used primarily for affecting the exchange value of the Hong Kong dollar. It may also be used (whilst having regard to its primary purpose) for maintaining the stability and integrity of the monetary and financial systems of Hong Kong, with a view to maintaining Hong Kong as an international financial centre.\n\nThe Monetary Authority is appointed under the Exchange Fund Ordinance to assist the Financial Secretary in performing his functions under the Exchange Fund Ordinance and to perform such other functions as are assigned by other Ordinances or by the Financial Secretary. The office of the Monetary Authority is known as the HKMA, and the Monetary Authority is the Chief Executive of the HKMA.\n\nThe Banking Ordinance provides the Monetary Authority with the responsibility and powers for regulating and supervising banking business and the business of taking deposits. Under the Ordinance, the Monetary Authority is responsible for the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong.\n\nThe Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance provides that the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for banking sector entities. The Monetary Authority is vested with a range of powers to effect the orderly resolution of a non-viable banking sector entity (the failure of which could pose systemic risk). The purpose is to maintain financial stability, while seeking to protect public funds.\n\nThe Securities and Futures Ordinance and the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Ordinance provide certain powers to the Monetary Authority regarding the securities and mandatory provident fund businesses of banks.\n\nThe Monetary Authority has been delegated with powers of inspection and investigation by the Insurance Authority under the Insurance Ordinance in relation to the insurance related businesses of banks.\n\nThe Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance empowers the Monetary Authority to supervise banks’ compliance with the customer due diligence and record-keeping requirements under the Ordinance.\n\nThe Deposit Protection Scheme Ordinance confers responsibility on the Monetary Authority to assist in the operation of the Deposit Protection Scheme and to trigger payment of compensation from the Deposit Protection Scheme Fund to depositors of a failed licensed bank.\n\nThe Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance provides a statutory regime for the Monetary Authority to designate and oversee certain significant clearing and settlement systems and retail payment systems operating in Hong Kong. It also empowers the Monetary Authority to administer a licensing regime for electronic and physical “facilities”, which are used to store monetary value and which meet the criteria specified in the Ordinance.","terms":{"signs":["跡象"],"added":["新增"],"later":["其後"],"took":["接任"],"auspices":["支持"],"closely":["緊密"],"stellar":["可觀"],"advanced":["先進"],"past":["過去"],"signed":["簽訂"],"work":["工作"],"abreast":["緊貼"],"leading":["領先"],"introducing":["推出"],"back":["回復"],"’":[""],"use":["使用"],"facilitate":["便利"],"21.1":["21.1%"],"successfully":["成功"],"focus":["重點"],"whole":["全年"],"shortly":["不久"],"Apart":["除了"],"particular":["尤其"],"conducted":["進行"],"thereby":["從而"],"expressed":["表示"],"slowing":["放緩"],"worked":["合作"],"appropriate":["適當"],"gradual":["逐步"],"People":["人民"],"message":["信息"],"spotted":["識別"],"Progress":["進展"],"dotted":["比比皆是"],"Taking":["鑑於"],"relaxation":["放寬"],"range":["種類"],"—":["—"],"number":["數字"],"city":["城市"],"general":["普遍"],"unpredictability":["難以預測"],"third":["第三"],"challenging":["充滿挑戰"],"effort":["工作"],"Moreover":["此外"],"since":["自"],"bracing":["迎來"],"introduction":["推出"],"revival":["復甦"],"confidence":["信心"],"matter":["問題"],"fronts":["範疇"],"wisdom":["智慧"],"update":["介紹"],"similarly":["同樣"],"launched":["推出"],"celebrate":["慶祝"],"colleagues":["同事"],"Despite":["儘管"],"stood":["維持"],"opportunity":["機遇"],"deepen":["深化"],"Details":["詳情"],"significant":["重大"],"Shenzhen":["深圳市"],"strong":["雄厚"],"high-powered":["高級別"],"obtain":["取得"],"departments":["部門"],"opening-up":["開放"],"continue":["繼續"],"timely":["及時"],"attracted":["吸引"],"expansion":["擴展"],"million":["百萬"],"shown":["體現"],"launch":["推出"],"expectations":["預期"],"Mr":["先生"],"success":["成功"],"towards":["朝"],"pace":["步伐"],"awareness":["意識"],"handle":["處理"],"able":["能夠"],"despite":["儘管"],"subsequent":["隨後"],"efforts":["努力"],"2024":["2024年"],"reap":["把握"],"much":["多項"],"high":["高"],"cement":["鞏固"],"broad-based":["全面"],"increased":["上升"],"topping":["增值"],"counter":["櫃台"],"aim":["目標"],"protect":["保障"],"2021":["2021年"],"credibility":["可信性"],"last":["去年"],"enriched":["豐富"],"issuing":["發行"],"smoothly":["暢順"],"within":["內"],"themes":["主題"],"IFCs":["國際金融中心"],"maintained":["維持"],"providing":["提供"],"anniversary":["周年"],"arise":["出現"],"rapidly":["迅速"],"forums":["組織"],"players":["參與者"],"exceeding":["超過"],"establish":["建立"],"existing":["現有"],"nine":["9"],"40th":["40周年"],"gatherings":["聚會"],"30":["30"],"strengthen":["加強"],"receding":["減退"],"proliferation":["快速增長"],"regards":["方面"],"year":["年"],"leaders":["領導人"],"covered":["涵蓋"],"breakthrough":["突破"],"Externally":["對外"],"foster":["促進"],"geopolitical":["地緣政治"],"team":["團隊"],"along":["連同"],"decades":["十年"],"always":["一直"],"potential":["潛在"],"Secretaries":["司司長"],"shocks":["震盪"],"opening":["重新連繫"],"implement":["推行"],"need":["需要"],"facilitative":["便利"],"may":["可能"],"years":["年"],"law":["法例"],"turbulence":["波動"],"commenced":["開始"],"overshadow":["蒙上陰影"],"introduced":["推出"],"forward-looking":["長遠"],"Leveraging":["藉"],"became":["成為"],"billion":["億"],"series":["一連串"],"progressing":["推進"],"1.56":["1.56%"],"pillar":["支柱"],"currencies":["貨幣"],"experience":["經驗"],"offering":["提供"],"pursuit":["推動"],"say":["說"],"30th":["三十週年"],"digitising":["數碼化"],"enabling":["讓"],"residents":["居民"],"increase":["增加"],"bounce":["反彈"],"milestones":["里程碑"],"August":["8月"],"pave":["鋪路"],"step":["步驟"],"name":["名稱"],"end":["年底"],"consecutive":["連續"],"actions":["行動"],"ability":["能力"],"Zone":["範圍"],"negotiating":["磋商"],"tightened":["收緊"],"reconnect":["重新連繫"],"relevant":["相關"],"contribution":["貢獻"],"obtaining":["取得"],"implementation":["執行"],"cities":["城市"],"pursue":["推動"],"position":["地位"],"sure":["相信"],"expanded":["拓展"],"improve":["改善"],"supporting":["支持"],"proactively":["積極"],"cases":["情況"],"linkage":["對接"],"episode":["事件"],"one":["一個"],"include":["包括"],"fourth":["第四"],"impetus":["推動力"],"sound":["健康"],"expand":["擴大"],"five":["五"],"base":["基地"],"driven":["推動"],"operation":["運作"],"announced":["宣布"],"representing":["標誌著"],"coming":["未來"],"reached":["達到"],"greater":["更大"],"province":["省"],"enhance":["提升"],"January":["1月"],"expanding":["拓寬"],"underpinned":["支持"],"competitiveness":["競爭力"],"uphold":["維護"],"among":["之中"],"convenient":["便捷"],"face":["面對"],"Behind":["背後"],"slightly":["微升"],"way":["方式"],"positive":["正面"],"assisted":["協助"],"recently":["最近"],"gathering":["聚會"],"advantage":["優勢"],"high-interestrate":["高息"],"continuing":["繼續"],"estimated":["估計"],"Embracing":["擁抱"],"unfolded":["發展"],"conclusion":["舉行"],"adoption":["應用"],"enhanced":["提升"],"maintains":["維持"],"sophisticated":["高端"],"eight":["8"],"notable":["顯著"],"ensure":["確保"],"5.5":["5.5%"],"risk-based":["風險為本"],"multiple":["多個"],"fifth":["五周年"],"second":["第2屆"],"lessons":["經驗"],"demonstrates":["展現"],"makes":["取得"],"implementing":["實施"],"counterparts":["有關當局"],"parties":["第三方"],"strengthening":["加強"],"also":["亦"],"completing":["完成"],"demonstrating":["展現"],"widen":["擴大"],"successful":["順利"],"stable":["穩健"],"developing":["制定"],"alongside":["隨着"],"enters":["進入"],"functionalities":["功能"],"make":["取得"],"provided":["提供"],"intensified":["加強"],"ledger":["分類帳"],"Figures":["數字"],"cornerstone":["基石"],"views":["意見"],"build":["建立"],"works":["工作"],"made":["取得"],"Highlights":["摘要"],"mostly":["大部分時間"],"usage":["使用率"],"introd

{"en":"# Corporate Governance\n\nAs Hong Kong’s central banking institution, the HKMA is committed to high standards of corporate governance, as good governance is crucial in maintaining and safeguarding the trust and confidence of the public in the HKMA to fulfil its statutory mandate.\n\nTo achieve its commitment to good corporate governance, the HKMA:\n- puts in place a well-defined governance structure with a high degree of accountability;\n- exercises robust controls to manage risks and ensure that staff behaviours at all levels and its day-to-day operations are consistent with specified standards; and\n- pursues a policy of high transparency and accessibility, and keeps close contacts with stakeholders.\n\n# The HKMA and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government\n\nThe HKMA is an integral part of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government, but is able to employ staff on terms different from those of the civil service in order to attract personnel of the right experience and expertise. The Chief Executive of the HKMA and his staff are public officers. In its day-to-day work, the HKMA operates with a high degree of autonomy within the relevant statutory powers conferred upon, or delegated to, the Monetary Authority.\n\nThe Financial Secretary is responsible for determining the monetary policy objective and the structure of the monetary system of Hong Kong: a letter from the Financial Secretary to the Monetary Authority dated 25 June 2003 specifies that these should be currency stability defined as a stable exchange value at around HK$7.80 to one US dollar maintained by Currency Board arrangements. The Monetary Authority is on his own responsible for achieving the monetary policy objective, including determining the strategy, instruments and operational means for doing so. The Monetary Authority also has responsibilities in relation to the maintenance of the stability and integrity of the monetary system of Hong Kong.\n\nThe Financial Secretary, assisted by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, has responsibility for policies for maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s financial system and the status of Hong Kong as an international financial centre. In support of these policies, the Monetary Authority’s responsibilities include:\n- promoting the general stability and effective working of the banking system;\n- promoting the development of the debt market, in co-operation with other relevant bodies;\n- matters relating to the issuance and circulation of legal tender notes and coins;\n- promoting the safety and efficiency of the financial infrastructure through the development of payment, clearing and settlement systems and, where appropriate, the operation of these systems; and\n- seeking to promote, in co-operation with other relevant bodies, confidence in Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems, and market development initiatives to help strengthen the international competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial services.\n\nThe Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary. The Monetary Authority, under delegation from the Financial Secretary, is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the use of the Exchange Fund, and for the investment management of the Fund.\n\n# Accountability and transparency\n\nThe autonomy given to the HKMA in its day-to-day operations, and in the methods it uses to pursue policy objectives determined by the Government, is complemented by a high degree of accountability and transparency.\n\nThe HKMA serves Hong Kong by promoting monetary and banking stability, by managing the official reserves effectively, and by developing and overseeing a robust and diverse financial infrastructure. These processes help to strengthen Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre and to foster Hong Kong’s economic well-being.\n\nThe HKMA must have the confidence of the community if it is to perform its duties well. The HKMA therefore takes seriously the duty of explaining its policies and work to the general public and makes every effort to address any concerns within the community relevant to the HKMA’s responsibilities. In particular, the HKMA makes timely clarifications on misinformation and rumours about the HKMA’s policies via traditional and social media.\n\nThe HKMA is accountable to the people of Hong Kong through the Financial Secretary, who appoints the Monetary Authority, and through the laws passed by the Legislative Council that set out the Monetary Authority’s powers and responsibilities. The HKMA also recognises a broader responsibility to promote a better understanding of its roles and objectives and to keep itself informed of community concerns. In its day-to-day operations and in its wider contacts with the community, the HKMA pursues a policy of transparency and accessibility. This policy has two main objectives:\n- to keep the financial industry and the public as fully informed about the work of the HKMA as possible, subject to considerations of market sensitivity, commercial confidentiality and statutory restrictions on disclosure of confidential information; and\n- to ensure that the HKMA is in touch with, and responsive to, the community it serves.\n\nThe HKMA seeks to follow international best practices in its transparency arrangements. It maintains extensive relations with the mass media and produces a range of regular and special publications in both English and Chinese. The HKMA’s bilingual website (www.hkma.gov.hk) carries a large number of HKMA publications, press releases, speeches and presentations, in addition to dedicated sections on research, statistics, regulatory resources, consumer information and other topics. Social media platforms are also used to communicate with the public more efficiently in the digital era. The HKMA maintains an Information Centre at its offices, consisting of a library and an exhibition area, which is open to the public six days a week. Further information on the HKMA’s work on public communications and engagement is contained in the Corporate Functions chapter on pages 185 to 193.\n\nOver the years, the HKMA has progressively increased the detail and frequency of its disclosure of information on the Exchange Fund and Currency Board Accounts. Since 1999, the HKMA has participated in the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard project for central banks. The HKMA publishes records of meetings of the Currency Board Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee and the reports on Currency Board operations. The supervisory policies and guidelines on banking have been published on the HKMA website since 1996.\n\nThe relations between the HKMA and the Legislative Council play an important part in promoting accountability and transparency. There is a formal commitment from the Chief Executive of the HKMA to appear before the Panel on Financial Affairs of the Legislative Council three times a year to brief Members and to answer questions on the HKMA’s work. Representatives from the HKMA attend Legislative Council panel and committee meetings from time to time to explain and discuss particular issues and to assist Members in their scrutiny of draft legislation.\n\n# Controls\n\nThe HKMA adopts robust internal and external control mechanisms to ensure that it upholds a high standard of staff conduct, prudent risk management as well as appropriate checks and balances. Internal and external audit functions provide independent assessment on the adequacy and effectiveness of the control mechanisms.\n\n# Code of Conduct\n\nA Code of Conduct, which provides guidance to staff on their ethical and legal responsibilities, is in place to ensure that staff behaviours are consistent with specified standards at all levels.\n\n# Internal controls\n\n# Operational controls\n\nAll departments and divisions have ownership and responsibility to identify and assess risks of their operational processes and put in place appropriate controls for ensuring proper day-to-day operations of the HKMA. This serves as the first line of defence for risk management.\n\n# Organisational risk management\n\nRisk management is also undertaken at the corporate level, with the Risk Committee, chaired by the Chief Executive of the HKMA, being one of the cornerstones of the organisational risk management framework.\n\nPotential and emerging risks identified by the functional units, and the adequacy of the control measures and mitigating strategies they devise, are reported to and discussed at the Risk Committee, which decides on appropriate follow-up actions.\n\n# Internal audit\n\nThe Internal Audit Division of the HKMA independently assesses the adequacy and effectiveness of governance, risk management and control processes of different functional units, and advises on areas for improvement.\n\n# External audit\n\nIn accordance with section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the Audit Commission of the HKSAR Government audits the financial statements of the Exchange Fund. The Commission does not charge for this service. The audited financial statements of the Exchange Fund are included in the HKMA Annual Report.\n","terms":{"signs":["跡象"],"added":["新增"],"later":["其後"],"took":["接任"],"auspices":["支持"],"closely":["緊密"],"stellar":["可觀"],"advanced":["先進"],"past":["過去"],"signed":["簽訂"],"work":["工作"],"abreast":["緊貼"],"leading":["領先"],"introducing":["推出"],"back":["回復"],"’":[""],"use":["使用"],"facilitate":["便利"],"21.1":["21.1%"],"successfully":["成功"],"focus":["重點"],"whole":["全年"],"shortly":["不久"],"Apart":["除了"],"particular":["尤其"],"conducted":["進行"],"thereby":["從而"],"expressed":["表示"],"slowing":["放緩"],"worked":["合作"],"appropriate":["適當"],"gradual":["逐步"],"People":["人民"],"message":["信息"],"spotted":["識別"],"Progress":["進展"],"dotted":["比比皆是"],"Taking":["鑑於"],"relaxation":["放寬"],"range":["種類"],"—":["—"],"number":["數字"],"city":["城市"],"general":["普遍"],"unpredictability":["難以預測"],"third":["第三"],"challenging":["充滿挑戰"],"effort":["工作"],"Moreover":["此外"],"since":["自"],"bracing":["迎來"],"introduction":["推出"],"revival":["復甦"],"confidence":["信心"],"matter":["問題"],"fronts":["範疇"],"wisdom":["智慧"],"update":["介紹"],"similarly":["同樣"],"launched":["推出"],"celebrate":["慶祝"],"colleagues":["同事"],"Despite":["儘管"],"stood":["維持"],"opportunity":["機遇"],"deepen":["深化"],"Details":["詳情"],"significant":["重大"],"Shenzhen":["深圳市"],"strong":["雄厚"],"high-powered":["高級別"],"obtain":["取得"],"departments":["部門"],"opening-up":["開放"],"continue":["繼續"],"timely":["及時"],"attracted":["吸引"],"expansion":["擴展"],"million":["百萬"],"shown":["體現"],"launch":["推出"],"expectations":["預期"],"Mr":["先生"],"success":["成功"],"towards":["朝"],"pace":["步伐"],"awareness":["意識"],"handle":["處理"],"able":["能夠"],"despite":["儘管"],"subsequent":["隨後"],"efforts":["努力"],"2024":["2024年"],"reap":["把握"],"much":["多項"],"high":["高"],"cement":["鞏固"],"broad-based":["全面"],"increased":["上升"],"topping":["增值"],"counter":["櫃台"],"aim":["目標"],"protect":["保障"],"2021":["2021年"],"credibility":["可信性"],"last":["去年"],"enriched":["豐富"],"issuing":["發行"],"smoothly":["暢順"],"within":["內"],"themes":["主題"],"IFCs":["國際金融中心"],"maintained":["維持"],"providing":["提供"],"anniversary":["周年"],"arise":["出現"],"rapidly":["迅速"],"forums":["組織"],"players":["參與者"],"exceeding":["超過"],"establish":["建立"],"existing":["現有"],"nine":["9"],"40th":["40周年"],"gatherings":["聚會"],"30":["30"],"strengthen":["加強"],"receding":["減退"],"proliferation":["快速增長"],"regards":["方面"],"year":["年"],"leaders":["領導人"],"covered":["涵蓋"],"breakthrough":["突破"],"Externally":["對外"],"foster":["促進"],"geopolitical":["地緣政治"],"team":["團隊"],"along":["連同"],"decades":["十年"],"always":["一直"],"potential":["潛在"],"Secretaries":["司司長"],"shocks":["震盪"],"opening":["重新連繫"],"implement":["推行"],"need":["需要"],"facilitative":["便利"],"may":["可能"],"years":["年"],"law":["法例"],"turbulence":["波動"],"commenced":["開始"],"overshadow":["蒙上陰影"],"introduced":["推出"],"forward-looking":["長遠"],"Leveraging":["藉"],"became":["成為"],"billion":["億"],"series":["一連串"],"progressing":["推進"],"1.56":["1.56%"],"pillar":["支柱"],"currencies":["貨幣"],"experience":["經驗"],"offering":["提供"],"pursuit":["推動"],"say":["說"],"30th":["三十週年"],"digitising":["數碼化"],"enabling":["讓"],"residents":["居民"],"increase":["增加"],"bounce":["反彈"],"milestones":["里程碑"],"August":["8月"],"pave":["鋪路"],"step":["步驟"],"name":["名稱"],"end":["年底"],"consecutive":["連續"],"actions":["行動"],"ability":["能力"],"Zone":["範圍"],"negotiating":["磋商"],"tightened":["收緊"],"reconnect":["重新連繫"],"relevant":["相關"],"contribution":["貢獻"],"obtaining":["取得"],"implementation":["執行"],"cities":["城市"],"pursue":["推動"],"position":["地位"],"sure":["相信"],"expanded":["拓展"],"improve":["改善"],"supporting":["支持"],"proactively":["積極"],"cases":["情況"],"linkage":["對接"],"episode":["事件"],"one":["一個"],"include":["包括"],"fourth":["第四"],"impetus":["推動力"],"sound":["健康"],"expand":["擴大"],"five":["五"],"base":["基地"],"driven":["推動"],"operation":["運作"],"announced":["宣布"],"representing":["標誌著"],"coming":["未來"],"reached":["達到"],"greater":["更大"],"province":["省"],"enhance":["提升"],"January":["1月"],"expanding":["拓寬"],"underpinned":["支持"],"competitiveness":["競爭力"],"uphold":["維護"],"among":["之中"],"convenient":["便捷"],"face":["面對"],"Behind":["背後"],"slightly":["微升"],"way":["方式"],"positive":["正面"],"assisted":["協助"],"recently":["最近"],"gathering":["聚會"],"advantage":["優勢"],"high-interestrate":["高息"],"continuing":["繼續"],"estimated":["估計"],"Embracing":["擁抱"],"unfolded":["發展"],"conclusion":["舉行"],"adoption":["應用"],"enhanced":["提升"],"maintains":["維持"],"sophisticated":["高端"],"eight":["8"],"notable":["顯著"],"ensure":["確保"],"5.5":["5.5%"],"risk-based":["風險為本"],"multiple":["多個"],"fifth":["五周年"],"second":["第2屆"],"lessons":["經驗"],"demonstrates":["展現"],"makes":["取得"],"implementing":["實施"],"counterparts":["有關當局"],"parties":["第三方"],"strengthening":["加強"],"also":["亦"],"completing":["完成"],"demonstrating":["展現"],"widen":["擴大"],"successful":["順利"],"stable":["穩健"],"developing":["制定"],"alongside":["隨着"],"enters":["進入"],"functionalities":["功能"],"make":["取得"],"provided":["提供"],"intensified":["加強"],"ledger":["分類帳"],"Figures":["數字"],"cornerstone":["基石"],"views":["意見"],"build":["建立"],"works":["工作"],"made":["取得"],"Highlights":["摘要"],"mostly":["大部分時間"],"usage":["使用率"],"introdu

公司治理\n\n香港金融管理局（金管局）是香港的中央銀行機構，致力於維持高水平的公司治理，因為良好的治理對於維持和保障公眾對金管局的信任及信心，以履行其法定職責至關重要。\n\n為實現其對良好公司治理的承諾，金管局採取以下措施：\n- 建立清晰的治理架構，並確保高度的問責制；\n- 實施強而有力的管控措施，以管理風險，並確保各級員工的行為及其日常運作符合指定標準；\n- 奉行高度透明和開放的政策，並與持份者保持緊密聯繫。\n\n# 金管局與香港特別行政區政府\n\n金管局是香港特別行政區（香港特區）政府的一部分，但為了吸引具備相關經驗和專業知識的人才，它可以以與公務員不同的條款聘用員工。金管局總裁及其員工均為公務員。在日常工作中，金管局在授予或轉授貨幣管理局的相關法定權力範圍內，享有高度的自主權。\n\n財政司司長負責制定香港的貨幣政策目標及貨幣制度架構。2003年6月25日，財政司司長致函貨幣管理局，訂明有關目標應為貨幣穩定，即由聯繫匯率制度維持港元兌美元的匯率穩定在7.80元左右的水平。貨幣管理局本身負責達成貨幣政策目標，包括制定有關策略、工具及操作方法。此外，貨幣管理局亦負有責任維持香港貨幣制度的穩定和健全。\n\n財政司司長在金融服務及庫務局局長的協助下，負責制定政策以維持香港金融體系的穩定和健全，以及香港的國際金融中心地位。為支持這些政策，貨幣管理局的職責包括：\n- 促進銀行體系的整體穩定和有效運作；\n- 與其他相關機構合作，推動債務市場的發展；\n- 處理有關發行及流通合法貨幣紙幣及硬幣的事宜；\n- 透過發展支付、清算及結算系統，以及在適當情況下運作這些系統，以促進金融基礎設施的安全和效率；\n- 與其他相關機構合作，提升對香港貨幣及金融體系的信心，並推行市場發展措施，以強化香港金融服務業的國際競爭力。\n\n外匯基金由財政司司長管理。貨幣管理局根據財政司司長的授權，就外匯基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 問責制與透明度\n\n金管局在日常運作及推行政府所制定的政策目標時所採用的方法上，享有高度的自主權，同時亦輔以高度的問責制及透明度。\n\n金管局透過促進貨幣及銀行業的穩定、有效管理官方儲備，以及制定及監察穩健而多元化的金融基礎設施，為香港提供服務。這些工作有助於鞏固香港作為國際金融中心的地位，並促進香港的經濟發展。\n\n金管局要有效履行職責，必須獲得社會的信任。因此，金管局非常重視向公眾解釋其政策和工作，並盡力解決社會上與金管局職責相關的任何疑慮。尤其是，金管局透過傳統媒體及社交媒體，及時澄清有關金管局政策的失實資訊及謠言。\n\n金管局透過財政司司長及立法會通過的法例向香港市民負責。財政司司長委任貨幣管理局，而法例則訂明貨幣管理局的權力及職責。此外，金管局亦認識到有更廣泛的責任，以促進公眾對其角色和目標有更佳的了解，並隨時掌握社會的關注事項。在日常運作及與社會的廣泛聯繫中，金管局奉行透明及開放的政策，其主要目標有兩個：\n- 在市場敏感度、商業機密性及法定披露機密資訊的限制等因素的考慮下，盡量讓金融業界及公眾充分了解金管局的工作；\n-

管控措施\n\n金管局採用強而有力的內部及外部管控機制，以確保維持高水平的員工行為標準、審慎的風險管理，以及適當的制衡。內部及外部審計職能為管控機制的充分性和有效性提供獨立評估。\n\n# 行為守則\n\n金管局制定了《行為守則》，為員工提供有關其道德及法律責任的指引，以確保各級員工的行為符合指定標準。\n\n# 內部管控\n\n# 營運管控\n\n所有部門及分處均有責任識別及評估其營運流程的風險，並制定適當的管控措施，以確保金管局的日常運作妥善進行。這是風險管理的第一道防線。\n\n# 機構風險管理\n\n風險管理亦在機構層面進行，而由金管局總裁擔任主席的風險委員會，是機構風險管理框架的基石之一。\n\n職能部門識別出的潛在及新風險，以及其制定的管控措施及緩解策略的充分性，均會向風險委員會報告及討論，由該委員會決定適當的跟進行動。\n\n# 內部審計\n\n金管局內部審計處獨立評估不同職能部門的治理、風險管理及管控流程的充分性和有效性，並就改善範疇提供建議。\n\n# 外部審計\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》第7條，香港特區政府審計署審計外匯基金的財務報表，且不收取任何費用。外匯基金的審計財務報表載於金管局年報內。"}
{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nDespite a challenging external environment, the Hong Kong economy staged a positive growth in 2023, thanks to the revivals in inbound tourism and domestic demand. The labour market continued to improve alongside the economic recovery, while inflation remained moderate. Asset markets remained soft amid tightened financial conditions and weak market sentiment. Economic activities for 2024 are expected to recover further at a moderate pace, although the outlook is clouded by multiple external uncertainties.\n\n# The economy in review\n\n# Real activities\n\nHaving navigated through the severe challenges posed by the pandemic in the previous year, the Hong Kong economy grew steadily by 3.2% in 2023 (Table 1 and Chart 1). Domestically, private consumption recovered notably on the back of improved labour market conditions and various support initiatives introduced by the Government, such as the Consumption Voucher Scheme and a series of promotional campaigns. Despite tightened financial conditions, overall investment expenditure registered significant growth against a low base of comparison from the previous year. Externally, Hong Kong’s exports of services rebounded, due mainly to the robust revival of inbound tourism. However, their positive impact on growth was more than offset by the strong recovery in outbound tourism, which was measured as imports of services. On the other hand, exports of goods remained lacklustre amid weak external demand, and put a drag on Hong Kong’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth.\n\nChart 1 Real GDP growth by contribution\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\nTable 1 Real GDP growth by expenditure component (period-over-period)\nNote: The seasonally-adjusted quarter-on-quarter rates of change in the gross domestic fixed capital formation are not available.\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\n# Inflation\n\nLocal inflation remained moderate in 2023 as external price pressures gradually eased, while domestic cost pressures remained broadly in check despite rising slightly as the economy recovered (Chart 2)1. For 2023 as a whole, the underlying and headline inflation rates were 1.7% and 2.1% respectively.\n\n# Labour market\n\nLabour market conditions improved further in 2023, with the unemployment rate falling to a decade-low level of 2.8% in July and hovering at a low level for the remaining months of the year2 (Chart 3). Both labour demand and labour supply increased, as reflected respectively by the pick-up in total employment (Chart 3) and in the labour force. In view of Hong Kong’s manpower shortages, the Government rolled out various labour importation schemes3 and talent attraction initiatives4 in 2023. Meanwhile, with tight labour market conditions, the year-on-year growth rates of nominal wages and of labour earnings increased gradually towards their pre-pandemic levels.\n\nChart 2 Underlying consumer price inflation\n\nChart 3 Labour market conditions\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\n# Stock market\n\nAfter stabilising in early 2023, the local stock market turned sluggish in the second half. Extending its rebound in late 2022, the Hang Seng Index rose to a year-high daily close of 22,689 on 27 January 2023. It then retreated and dropped further to low levels by December (Chart 4), reflecting weak market sentiment due to the banking sector problems in the US and Switzerland in March, as well as weaker global economic prospects and tightened financial conditions in the second half. The Hang Seng Index closed the year at 17,047, down notably by 13.8% from the end of 2022, and marking the fourth consecutive year of decline.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market experienced a rebound in the first four months of 2023 on the back of the resumption of normalcy in the Mainland and Hong Kong, but softened subsequently alongside rising mortgage rates5 and weak market sentiment. Overall, housing prices dropped by 6.9% year on year in 2023, while housing transactions further declined by 4.5% to a record-low of 43,002 units. Housing affordability remained stretched despite improving slightly along with the downward adjustment of housing prices. Similarly, the non-residential property markets continued to face headwinds, with prices of offices, retail premises and flatted factories softened further. The rentals for offices remained under pressure due to high vacancy rates amid the increasing prevalence of work-from-home arrangements and large supply. On the other hand, the rentals for retail premises increased in 2023 with the revival of inbound tourism and the improvement in private consumption.\n\nChart 4 Asset prices\nSources: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited\n\n# Outlook for the economy\n\n# Economic environment\n\nIn 2024, the Hong Kong economy is expected to continue its recovery at a moderate pace. Inbound tourism is set to expand further alongside the continuous improvement in handling capacity and the Government’s effort to promote mega events, while local consumption activities should be supported by a steady labour market. The various infrastructure projects to be taken forward by the Government will also lend support to the economy. Meanwhile, Hong Kong’s exports of goods will likely stabilise alongside the expected upturn in the global technology cycle. The Government forecasts real GDP to grow steadily by 2.5% –3.5% in 20246. However, the outlook is clouded by multiple risks and uncertainties, including those stemming from the US policy rate path, the pace of technology cycle recovery, the prospects for global economic growth, and evolving geopolitical tensions.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nLocal inflation is expected to remain mild in 2024, with softened external price pressures helping to offset the upward pressures on domestic costs amid further economic recovery and rising housing rentals. Market consensus forecasts a headline inflation rate of 2.1% in 2024, while the Government projects the headline and underlying inflation rates to be 2.4% and 1.7% respectively. On the other hand, the labour market is expected to be supported by the ongoing economic recovery, while the various labour importation and talent attraction schemes will continue to help alleviate manpower shortages across different industries.\n\n# Performance of the banking sector\n\nIn 2023, the Hong Kong banking sector faced a number of challenges including a high interest rate environment, heightened volatility in global financial markets caused by the March banking turmoil in the US and Europe, and a slowerthan-expected economic recovery in the Mainland and Hong Kong. Despite these multiple headwinds, the Hong Kong banking sector remained sound and continued to be supported by strong capital and liquidity buffers. The asset quality of the banking sector remained healthy despite an increase in the classified loan ratio. The profitability of banks improved notably, driven by higher net interest income.\n\n# Asset quality\n\nThe classified loan ratio of the banking sector rose to 1.56% at the end of 2023 from 1.40% at the end of 2022, with the overdue and rescheduled loan ratio increasing to 1.24% from 0.85% during the same period (Chart 5). The classified loan ratio for Mainland-related lending also rose to 2.58% at the end of 2023 from 2.26% a year before. The increase in the classified loan ratio was mainly due to downgrades of exposures to Mainland property developers. Nevertheless, the provisions set aside by banks remained sufficient. The provision coverage ratio (i.e.  total provisions to classified loans) stood at 75% at the end of 2023. If the market value of collateral held against the classified loans is taken into account, the adjusted provision coverage ratio would reach around 145%. Meanwhile, the delinquency ratios of residential mortgage lending and credit card lending remained low, at 0.08% and 0.30% respectively, at the end of 2023 (Chart 6).\n\nChart 5 Asset quality of the banking sector\nNote: Figures cover Hong Kong offices, overseas branches and major overseas subsidiaries.\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 6 Delinquency ratios of residential mortgage lending and credit card lending\nSource: HKMA\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe banking sector recorded notable profit growth in 2023. The aggregate pre-tax operating profit of retail banks increased by 62.1% in the year, while the post-tax return on average assets rose to 0.89% from 0.57% during the same period (Chart 7). The improvement in profit was predominantly the result of an increase in net interest income (+30%), coupled with a significant gain in investments held for trading in 2023 as compared to a mild loss in the previous year. This was partly offset by an increase in loan impairment charges (+28%), as specific provisions were set aside for new classified loans. Against the backdrop of rising interest rates, the net interest margin of retail banks widened to 1.68% in 2023 from 1.31% a year before (Chart 8). Meanwhile, retail banks’ cost-to-income ratio fell to 38.8% in 2023 from 48.0% in 2022 (Chart 9).\n\nChart 7 Retail banks’ performance\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 8 Retail banks’ net interest margin\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 9 Retail banks’ cost-to-income ratio\nSource: HKMA\n\n# Balance sheet trends\n\nThe banking sector’s balance sheet grew by 0.9% in 2023, as growths in negotiable debt instruments held (+8.6%) and interbank lending (+4.4%) were mostly offset by a decline in total loans. Given the subdued loan demand amid higher borrowing costs and a weakened global economic outlook, total loans decreased by 3.6% in 2023. Of the total loans, loans for use in Hong Kong remained broadly stable (-0.4%), while loans for use outside Hong Kong and trade finance decreased by 10.4% and 13.1% respectively. Mainlandrelated lending fell by 6.6% in 2023.\n\nOn the liability side, total deposits rose by 5.1% in 2023, compared with a growth of 1.7% in 2022. As total loans declined while total deposits grew, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio decreased to 62.8% at the end of 2023 from 68.5% a year before (Chart 10).\n\n# Capital adequacy\n\nThe banking sector remained well capitalised in 2023. The consolidated total capital ratio of locally incorporated authorized institutions (AIs) stood at 21.1% at the end of 2023, compared with 20.1% a year before. The Tier 1 capital ratio was 18.9% (Chart 11). Both ratios were well above their respective international minimum requirements. The Basel III leverage ratio was 7.9% at the end of 2023 (Chart 12).\n\nChart 10 Loans and deposits of the banking sector\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 11 Consolidated capital ratios of locally incorporated AIs\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 12 Consolidated leverage ratio of locally incorporated AIs\nSource: HKMA\n\n# Liquidity conditions\n\nThe banking sector continued to maintain a strong liquidity position. The quarterly average Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) of category 1 institutions was 178.6% in the fourth quarter of 2023, and the quarterly average Liquidity Maintenance Ratio (LMR) of category 2 institutions was 65.7% (Chart 13). The main source of funding for the banking sector continued to be customer deposits. The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) of category 1 institutions and the Core Funding Ratio (CFR) of category 2A institutions were 144.4% and 169.4% respectively at the end of 2023 (Chart 14). All four ratios were well above the statutory minimum requirements.\n\nChart 13 Liquidity ratios of designated AIs\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 14 Funding ratios of designated AIs\nSource:

經濟及金融環境\n\n儘管外部環境充滿挑戰，香港經濟在2023年仍錄得正成長，主要歸功於入境旅遊及國內需求的復甦。隨著經濟復甦，勞動市場持續改善，而通膨則保持溫和。在金融環境緊縮及市場氣氛疲弱的情況下，資產市場表現仍然低迷。預期2024年的經濟活動將以溫和步伐進一步復甦，但前景仍受多項外部不確定因素影響。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 實質活動\n\n香港經濟在2023年穩步成長3.2%，成功應對了前一年疫情帶來的嚴峻挑戰（表1及圖1）。在國內層面，由於勞動市場情況改善，加上政府推出多項支持措施（如消費券計畫及一系列宣傳活動），私人消費顯著復甦。儘管金融環境緊縮，但整體投資支出仍錄得顯著成長，主要是因為與前一年低基數比較有關。在外部方面，香港服務輸出復甦，主要歸功於入境旅遊的強勁復甦。然而，出境旅遊的強勁復甦（計入服務輸入）抵銷了服務輸出對成長的正面影響。另一方面，由於外部需求疲弱，貨物出口表現仍然不振，拖累了香港國內生產毛額（GDP）的成長。\n\n圖1 按貢獻劃分的實質國內生產毛額成長\n資料來源：人口普查及統計署\n\n表1 按支出組成部分劃分的實質國內生產毛額成長（按年比較）\n註：經季節性調整的國內固定資本形成總額按季變動率並無備存。\n資料來源：人口普查及統計署\n\n# 通膨\n\n由於外部價格壓力逐步緩和，2023年香港的本地通膨維持溫和，而國內成本壓力亦大致受控，儘管隨著經濟復甦而略有上升（圖2）1。2023年全年，基本通膨率及整體通膨率分別為1.7%及2.1%。\n\n# 勞動市場\n\n2023年勞動市場情況進一步改善，失業率在7月跌至2.8%的十年低點，並在餘下月份維持在低水平2（圖3）。勞動力需求及供給均有所增加，分別反映在總就業人數（圖3）及勞動力人口上升。鑑於香港面臨人力短缺，政府在2023年推出了多項輸入勞工人力計畫3及吸引人才的措施4。同時，在勞動市場情況緊張下，名義工資及勞工收益的年成長率逐步回升至疫情前的水平。\n\n圖2 基本消費物價通膨\n\n圖3 勞動市場情況\n資料來源：人口普查及統計署\n\n# 股市\n\n本地股市在2023年初穩定後，下半年轉趨疲弱。恆生指數延續2022年底的反彈勢頭，在2023年1月27日升至全年高點22,689點收盤。其後指數回落，並在12月跌至低點（圖4），反映市場氣氛疲弱，原因包括3月份美國及瑞士銀行業問題、全球經濟前景轉弱，以及下半年金融環境緊縮。恆生指數在年底收盤報17,047點，較2022年底下跌13.8%，連續第四年下跌。\n\n# 房地產市場\n\n在內地及香港恢復正常後，住宅房地產市場在2023年首四個月出現反彈，但其後因按揭利率上升5及市場氣氛疲弱而轉趨回軟。整體而言，2023年房價按年下跌6.9%，而住宅交易量則進一步下跌4.5%，至歷史低點43,002宗。住房負擔能力仍舊沉重，儘管房價下調令住房負擔能力略有改善。同樣地，非住宅房地產市場繼續面臨逆境，寫字樓、零售物業及工業大廈的價格進一步回軟。由於在家工作安排日益普及及供應充足，寫字樓空置率高企，令租金持續受壓。另一方面，零售物業租金在2023年上升，原因是入境旅遊復甦及私人消費改善。\n\n圖4

經濟環境\n\n預期香港經濟在2024年將以溫和步伐持續復甦。隨著接待能力的持續改善及政府努力推廣大型活動，入境旅遊將進一步擴張，而本地消費活動則將受惠於穩健的勞動市場。政府將推展的各項基礎建設項目亦將為經濟提供支持。同時，隨著全球科技周期預期回升，香港貨物出口將可能回穩。政府預測2024年實質國內生產毛額將穩步成長2.5%至3.5%6。然而，前景仍受多項風險及不確定因素影響，包括美國利率政策走向、科技周期復甦步伐、全球經濟成長前景，以及地緣政治局勢的演變。\n\n# 通膨及勞動市場\n\n預期2024年香港的本地通膨將維持溫和，外部價格壓力緩和將有助抵銷經濟進一步復甦及住宅租金上升所帶來的國內成本向上壓力。市場普遍預期2024年的整體通膨率為2.1%，而政府則預測整體通膨率及基本通膨率分別為2.4%及1.7%。另一方面，勞動市場預期將受惠於持續的經濟復甦，而各項輸入勞工人力及吸引人才的計畫亦將繼續有助紓緩不同行業的人力短缺問題。\n\n# 銀行業表現\n\n2023年，香港銀行業面臨多項挑戰，包括高利率環境、3月份美國及歐洲銀行業動盪引致全球金融市場波動加劇，以及內地及香港經濟復甦慢於預期。儘管面臨這些逆境，香港銀行業仍然保持穩健，並繼續受惠於雄厚的資本及流動性緩衝。銀行業的資產品質保持健康，儘管分類貸款比率有所上升。銀行的獲利能力顯著改善，主要受惠於淨利息收入上升。\n\n# 資產品質\n\n銀行業的分類貸款比率由2022年底的1.40%上升至2023年底的1.56%，同期逾期及重組貸款比率亦由0.85%上升至1.24%（圖5）。與內地相關的貸款分類貸款比率亦由前一年的2.26%上升至2023年底的2.58%。分類貸款比率上升主要是由於內地物業開發商的風險敞口被下調。然而，銀行撥備仍然充足。2023年底的撥備覆蓋率（即總撥備與分類貸款的比率）為75%。若計及用作抵押分類貸款的抵押品的市值，經調整的撥備覆蓋率將達約145%。同時，住宅按揭貸款及信用卡貸款的逾期比率在2023年底分別維持在0.08%及0.30%的低水平（圖6）。\n\n圖5

獲利能力趨勢\n\n銀行業在2023年錄得顯著的獲利成長。零售銀行的總營業利潤在當年成長了62.1%，而稅後平均資產報酬率則由0.57%上升至0.89%（圖7）。獲利改善主要是由於淨利息收入上升（+30%），加上2023年持作交易投資錄得重大收益，而前一年則錄得輕微虧損。這被貸款減值損失上升（+28%）所部分抵銷，原因是為新分類貸款撥備了特定準備金。在利率上升的背景下，零售銀行的淨利差由前一年的1.31%擴大至2023年的1.68%（圖8）。同時，零售銀行的成本與收入比率由2022年的48.0%下降至2023年的38.8%（圖9）。\n\n圖7

{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nIn 2023, amid market expectations of a “high for longer” US policy rate, the Hong Kong dollar mostly traded on the weak side of the Convertibility Zone, with the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking being triggered eight times between mid-February and early May.  The Hong Kong dollar had regained some momentum since May and traded around the central parity rate of 7.8 at year end.  Under the Linked Exchange Rate System, which marked its 40th anniversary in 2023, the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates generally track their US dollar counterparts, while also being affected by local supply and demand.  Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets remained stable and traded in a smooth and orderly manner.  As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, the Linked Exchange Rate System has shown its strength and resilience to various external shocks time after time.\n\n# Objectives\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability.  This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1.  The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n- Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks;\n- Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation;\n- The Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of clearing account balances kept with the HKMA; and\n- Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs).  With the HKMA standing ready to sell (or buy) Hong Kong dollars to (or from) banks in exchange for US dollars upon request at HK$7.75 (or HK$7.85) per US dollar when the strong-side (or weak-side) CU is triggered, the Aggregate Balance will expand (or contract) to push down (or up) Hong Kong dollar interest rates, helping move the Hong Kong dollar back to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85.\n\n# Review of 2023\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nAmid the market expectation of a “high for longer” US policy rate, the Hong Kong dollar remained soft and mostly traded on the weak side of the Convertibility Zone throughout 2023.  The weak-side CU was triggered eight times from mid-February to early May.  The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate regained some strength during early May to July, partly driven by dividend payment-related demand from listed companies and half-year-end funding needs by corporates. Thereafter, the Hong Kong dollar was mainly driven by the changes in local funding demands, such as buying flows through the Southbound Stock Connect, and traded around the central parity rate of 7.8 at year end (Chart 1).  Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market continued to function normally throughout 2023.\n\nChart 1 Market exchange rate in 2023\n\nFrom February to May, the HKMA purchased a total of HK$51.5 billion at the weak-side CU at the request of banks in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS).  Reflecting the triggering of the weak-side CU, the Aggregate Balance decreased from HK$96.3 billion at the end of 2022 to HK$45.0 billion at the end of 2023. Meanwhile, the outstanding EFBNs increased slightly from HK$1,200.4 billion to HK$1,245.5 billion during the year. The total of the Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs therefore declined from HK$1,296.7 billion at the end of 2022 to HK$1,290.4 billion at the end of 2023 (Chart 2). The Monetary Base as a whole remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\nChart 2 Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding Exchange Fund papers in 2023\n\n# Money market\n\nUnder the LERS, the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs) generally track their US dollar counterparts.  As the US continued to raise interest rates in the first seven months of 2023, the HIBORs generally rose (Chart 3).  For the year as a whole, the overnight, 1-month and 3-month HIBORs increased respectively by 286, 92 and 16 basis points to 6.09%, 5.27% and 5.15% at year end.\n\nFollowing the increases in the target range for the US federal funds rate, the Base Rate was adjusted upwards four times by a total of one percentage point (i.e. 100 basis points) from 4.75% to 5.75%.1 On the retail front, following the US policy rate hikes, many banks raised their Best Lending Rates by 12.5 basis points in early May and another 12.5 basis points in late July.  Some banks also increased the cap on HIBOR-based mortgage rates of newly approved mortgage loans during the year, and the average interest rate of new mortgage loans rose from 3.35% in 2022 to 4.13% in December 2023.  Overall, Hong Kong’s money markets continued to function normally.  Discount Window borrowing increased to HK$38.8 billion in 2023 from HK$8.4 billion in 2022 and no abnormality was noted in the relevant usage.\n\nChart 3 Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates in 2023\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nThe LERS has been a strong anchor of Hong Kong’s financial system for four decades and has shown its strength and resilience to challenges.  Despite lingering uncertainties surrounding the US interest rate path and global economic recovery, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to function in an orderly manner, reflecting the robustness of the LERS.  The Government is firmly committed to the LERS.  In its 2023 External Sector Report, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) once again reiterated that the credibility of the LERS has been ensured by a transparent set of rules, large fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nA robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS.  Hong Kong’s banking sector continued to operate smoothly with liquidity positions and capitalisation faring very well by international standards.  To ensure the resilience of the banking sector, the HKMA has been closely monitoring banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress testing results, and has maintained its supervisory efforts on bank lending.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of the Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) rose from 110.12% at the end of 2022 to a high of 112.71% on 4 May 2023, surpassing the Upper Trigger Level of 112.5% (Chart 4).  This largely reflected the contraction in the Aggregate Balance as a result of the triggering of the weak-side CU in the first half of the year2. In accordance with the arrangement approved by the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee and as a result of the redemption of Certificates of Indebtedness, assets were transferred out of the Backing Portfolio to the Investment Portfolio to reduce the Backing Ratio to around 109.97% on 8 May.  Thereafter, the Backing Ratio rose steadily to close at 110.73% on 31 December.  Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate.  The ample financial resources of the Exchange Fund, together with the sound banking system, provide a powerful backstop to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nChart 4 Daily movement of the Backing Ratio in 2023\n\n# Currency Board Sub-Committee\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong.  In 2023, the CBC considered issues including the May 2022 stablecoin market crash, the transmission of Federal Reserve’s dollar liquidity backstop measures to banks in Hong Kong, and the recent movements in the Hong Kong dollar interest rates.  Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Notes and coins\n\nThe below table summarises the value of the notes and coins in circulation at the end of 2023:\n\nChart 5 Banknotes in circulation by note-issuing banks at the end of 2023\n\nChart 6 Distribution of banknotes in circulation at the end of 2023\n\nChart 7 Banknotes in circulation at the end of 2023\n\nChart 8 Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation at the end of 2023\n\nChart 9 Breakdown of Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation at the end of 2023\n\n# Hong Kong banknotes\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA continued to organise seminars on the design and security features of Hong Kong banknotes for bank tellers, cashiers from retail establishments and students to help enhance their knowledge and skills in authenticating banknotes.  During 2023, 15 seminars were arranged for around 3,000 participants.\n\n# Coin Collection Programme\n\nThe Coin Collection Programme continued to be well received by the public.  More information about the Programme can be found in the Sustainable HKMA chapter of the Sustainability Report 2023.\n\n# Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\n\nThe EFBN Programme operated smoothly.  At the end of 2023, the nominal amount of outstanding Exchange Fund papers stood at around HK$1,255.4 billion (Table 2).\n\nTable 2 Outstanding issues of EFBNs\n\n# Monetary research\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMR)3, the research arm of the Hong Kong Academy of Finance, published 20 working papers and held 17 seminars\/ webinars on monetary and financial research topics that are of strategic importance to Hong Kong and the region. The HKIMR also published six eJournals on the Social Science Research Network (SSRN) to disseminate research outputs to SSRN’s global research community.  Moreover, to provide the public with a high-level, non-technical summary of the recently published working papers, the HKIMR published two issues of Insights from Monetary Research.\n\nApart from its research activities, the HKIMR organised four international events, one roundtable and four seminars\/ webinars with academia, global central banks and international financial institutions to promote dialogue and exchange on economic and financial issues:\n\n# 9 Mar\n\nA seminar on China’s Rebound: Recent Developments and Outlook by Dr Steven Alan Barnett, Senior Resident Representative in China of the IMF, and Dr Phakawa Jeasakul, Resident Representative for People’s Republic of China – Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) of the IMF, was held. Dr Barnett shared his views on the latest developments in the Chinese economy, as well as short- and medium-term issues that need to be addressed. More than 100 participants attended the seminar.\n\n# 17 Apr\n\nA seminar on Navigating Through a Challenging World was held. Four experts from the IMF shared their views on the analytical chapters of the most recent issues of World Economic Outlook and Global Financial Stability Report by the IMF. Over 50 participants attended the seminar.\n\n# 25 Apr\n\nA seminar with the presentation of the IMF’s April 2023 Global Financial Stability Report titled Safeguarding Global Financial Stability amid High Inflation and Interest Rates by Dr Jason Wu, Assistant Director, and Mr Thomas Pointek, Senior Financial Sector Expert, of the IMF’s Monetary and Capital Markets Department was held. More than 80 participants attended the seminar.\n\n# 2 May\n\nA fireside chat on Asia in a Challenging World was hosted between Mr Krishna Srinivasan, Director of the Asia and Pacific Department of the IMF, and Mr Eddie Yue, Chief Executive of the HKMA. Mr Srinivasan outlined the key messages of the recent IMF Regional Economic Outlook report for Asia and shared his views on the key drivers and risks of the global and regional economy. In addition, the dialogue covered many important issues concerning the regional economy and the evolution of the international monetary system. Around 120 participants attended the

貨幣穩定性\n\n2023 年，市場預期美國政策利率將「在高檔維持更長時間」，港元匯率大多時間處於兌換區間的弱方，弱方兌換保證在 2 月中至 5 月初期間被觸發了八次。港元匯率自 5 月起有所回升，年底時在 7.8 的中央平價附近交易。聯繫匯率制度在 2023 年迎來了 40 週年紀念，根據該制度，香港銀行同業拆息通常跟隨美元利率走勢，但也受到本地供需因素的影響。整體而言，港元匯率及貨幣市場保持穩定，交易暢順有序。作為香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石，聯繫匯率制度屢次展現出其應對各種外部衝擊的實力和韌性。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的首要目標是維持貨幣穩定。這是指香港貨幣在對外匯市場上的匯率相對美元保持穩定，波動區間為港元 7.75 至 7.85 兌 1 美元。貨幣制度的結構以貨幣發行管理局的安排為特色，要求貨幣基礎至少 100% 由外匯基金持有的美元儲備支持，且貨幣基礎的變動需 100% 由相應的美元儲備變動所匹配。\n\n貨幣基礎（表 1）包括以下部分：\n- 債務證明書，為三家發鈔銀行發行的紙幣提供全額擔保；\n- 政府發行的流通紙幣和硬幣；\n- 結餘總額，即存放於金管局的清算帳戶結餘總和；\n- 由金管局代表政府發行的外匯基金票據及債券（EFBNs）。\n\n港元匯率的穩定是透過自動利率調整機制和金管局對兌換保證（CUs）的堅定承諾來維持的。當強方（或弱方）兌換保證被觸發時，金管局隨時準備應銀行要求以 7.75 港元（或 7.85 港元）兌 1 美元的匯率向銀行出售（或購買）港元，此時結餘總額將擴大（或收縮），以壓低（或推高）港元利率，幫助港元匯率回到 7.75 至 7.85 的兌換區間內。\n\n# 2023 年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定性\n\n在市場預期美國政策利率將「在高檔維持更長時間」的情況下，港元匯率在 2023 年全年保持疲弱，大多時間處於兌換區間的弱方。弱方兌換保證在 2 月中至 5 月初期間被觸發了八次。港元匯率在 5 月初至 7 月期間有所回升，部分原因是上市公司與股息派發相關的需求，以及企業的半年結資金需求。此後，港元匯率主要受本地資金需求變化的影響，例如透過南向股票通的買入資金流，並於年底時在 7.8 的中央平價附近交易（圖 1）。整體而言，港元匯率市場在 2023 年全年繼續正常運作。\n\n圖 1：2023 年市場匯率\n\n從 2 月到 5 月，根據聯繫匯率制度的設計，金管局應銀行要求在弱方兌換保證下共買入 515 億港元。弱方兌換保證的觸發導致結餘總額從 2022 年底的 963 億港元下降至 2023 年底的 450 億港元。同時，未償還 EFBNs 在當年略有增加，從 12,004 億港元增至 12,455 億港元。因此，結餘總額和未償還 EFBNs 的總額從 2022 年底的 12,967 億港元下降至 2023 年底的 12,904 億港元（圖 2）。貨幣基礎整體仍獲外匯儲備充分支持。\n\n圖 2：2023 年結餘總額（未計及貼現窗前）及未償還外匯基金票據\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n在聯繫匯率制度下，香港銀行同業拆息（HIBORs）通常跟隨美元利率走勢。由於美國在 2023 年前七個月繼續加息，HIBORs 普遍上升（圖 3）。全年而言，隔夜、1 個月及 3 個月 HIBORs 分別上升 286、92 及 16 個基點，於年底時錄得 6.09%、5.27% 及 5.15%。\n\n在美國聯邦資金利率目標區間上調後，基本利率共上調了四次，累計上調 1 個百分點（即 100 個基點），從 4.75% 上調至 5.75%。1 在零售方面，在美國政策利率上調後，多家銀行在 5 月初將最優惠貸款利率上調 12.5 個基點，並在 7 月底再次上調 12.5 個基點。部分銀行亦在當年上調了新批按揭貸款的 HIBOR 掛鉤按揭利率上限，新按揭貸款的平均利率從 2022 年的 3.35% 上升到 2023 年 12 月的 4.13%。整體而言，香港貨幣市場繼續正常運作。貼現窗借貸額由 2022 年的 84 億港元增至 2023 年的 388 億港元，相關使用情況未見異常。\n\n圖 3：2023 年香港銀行同業拆息\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n聯繫匯率制度是香港金融體系的堅實支柱，已運作了四十年，並展現出其應對挑戰的實力和韌性。儘管美國利率走勢和全球經濟復甦仍存在不確定性，但港元匯率及貨幣市場繼續有序運作，反映出聯繫匯率制度的穩健性。政府堅決支持聯繫匯率制度。國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）在 2023 年對外部門報告中再次重申，聯繫匯率制度的可信性是由一套透明的規則、龐大的財政及外匯儲備、強而有力的金融監管及監督、靈活的經濟體及審慎的財政框架所確保的。\n\n穩健的銀行體系對聯繫匯率制度的正常運作至關重要。香港銀行業繼續暢順運作，流動資金狀況及資本充足率按國際標準而言表現良好。為確保銀行業的韌性，金管局一直密切監察銀行在信貸、流動資金及利率風險管理方面的表現及壓力測試結果，並維持對銀行貸款的監管工作。\n\n為提高貨幣發行管理局帳目的透明度，自 1998 年 10 月起，外匯基金資產中特定部分已被分配用於支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（定義為支持資產除以貨幣基礎）從 2022 年底的 110.12% 上升到 2023 年 5 月 4 日的 112.71% 高位，超過了 112.5% 的上限觸發水平（圖 4）。這主要是由於弱方兌換保證在今年上半年被觸發，導致結餘總額收縮。2 根據外匯基金諮詢委員會批准的安排，以及由於債務證明書的贖回，資產從支持投資組合轉移至投資組合，以將支持比率在 5 月 8 日降至約 109.97%。此後，支持比率穩步上升，並於 12 月 31 日收於 110.73%。在聯繫匯率制度下，雖然特定外匯基金資產已被指定為支持投資組合，但所有外匯基金資產均可用於支持港元匯率。外匯基金充裕的財政資源，加上穩健的銀行體系，為香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供了強而有力的支持。\n\n圖 4：2023 年支持比率的每日變動\n\n# 貨幣發行委員會小組委員會\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會的貨幣發行委員會小組委員會（CBC）監察及檢討與香港貨幣及金融穩定有關的議題。2023

{"en":"# Banking Stability\n\nThe banking sector in Hong Kong remained strong and resilient in 2023 despite multiple headwinds, including the March banking turmoil in the US and Europe, a high interest rate environment and geopolitical tensions. The HKMA responded swiftly to the March banking turmoil — from managing the ripple effects to completing an internal review (covering such areas as the supervisory processes and resolution framework) drawing lessons for the local banking sector, while maintaining its focus on the credit, liquidity and market risk management of authorized institutions. In light of escalating cyber threats and the increasing use of technology services provided by third parties, the HKMA also worked closely with authorized institutions to enhance their operational and cyber resilience.\n\nThe HKMA enhanced consumer protection in respect of payment cards, and through further revision of the Code of Banking Practice as well as the launch of the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter. The HKMA worked with fellow regulators on a balanced regulatory regime for virtual asset-related activities, streamlined the selling process for sophisticated professional investors, introduced enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Pilot Scheme, and commenced supervision of trust business. A pilot programme was launched to prepare for provision of consumer credit reference services under “Credit Data Smart”.\n\nThe HKMA’s efforts in anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT) reflect a commitment to targeting the highest threats under a risk-based approach. To address increasing digital fraud, the HKMA has strengthened ecosystem collaboration through the launch of real-time fraud monitoring and expanding the scope of public-private information-sharing partnerships, including the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce. The launch of a ground-breaking platform to facilitate bank-to-bank information sharing will help address the risk of mule account networks, while the HKMA also worked closely with the industry to take concerted action to handle increasing fraud-related banking complaints and raise public awareness about different scams, including a pre-transaction alert mechanism when using the Faster Payment System. In parallel, supervisory technology capabilities were also advanced through the Macro Analytics pilot scheme.\n\nGood progress was made on implementing international supervisory standards locally, including those on capital adequacy and disclosure. Notable efforts were also made in enhancing capacity building in the banking sector, attracting and nurturing future talents and upskilling existing practitioners. In addition, the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board completed a public consultation on proposed enhancements to the Deposit Protection Scheme.\n\nThe HKMA continued to advance its work to ensure a credible resolution regime. A new resolution standard related to accessing critical financial market infrastructures was developed and a review on experiences of implementing loss-absorbing capacity policy standards was completed. Significant progress was made in resolution planning with banks to address early termination risk and operational continuity in resolution. The HKMA also continued to be active in international policy initiatives and regional co-operation on resolution.\n\n# Objectives\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this objective is contingent upon a highly resilient financial system that is capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their businesses and, in extreme cases, by failing in a disorderly manner. The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring that banks are resilient to shocks and able to recover their positions in response to crises, ultimately helping to prevent failures. The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks and is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs).\n\nThe Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework is not designed to ensure a zero-risk financial system. Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that, in the event of an AI becoming non-viable, its failure can be managed in an orderly manner. To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong has been established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs, among other types of institutions. To operationalise the resolution regime in Hong Kong, it is important to lay down resolution rules and policy standards, undertake resolution planning to remove impediments to AIs’ resolvability and develop the HKMA’s operational capability to resolve a failing AI. In order to carry out these tasks effectively, the HKMA adopts an internationally harmonised and co-ordinated approach.\n\nThe Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs). In overseeing FMIs, the HKMA aims to promote their general safety and efficiency, limit systemic risk and foster transparency. Making FMIs more resilient to financial crises protects the monetary and financial systems in Hong Kong from possible destabilising effects arising from disruption to the FMIs.\n\n# Review of 2023\n\n# Licensing\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA granted one banking licence and one restricted bank licence to two banks incorporated outside Hong Kong. The HKMA also granted money broker approval to four foreign trading platform operators and revoked another approval granted to one money broker. The HKMA revoked authorizations of five licensed banks during the year.\n\nMore information about the AIs and local representative offices in Hong Kong can be found in the Annex and Tables D to F on pages 313 to 316 and 322 to 325 respectively.\n\n# Review of three-tier banking system\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA conducted a comprehensive review on the three-tier banking system in order to simplify the structure of Hong Kong’s banking system. The review found that the three-tier system has become more complex than necessary to achieve the original aim to strike a balance between flexibility of entry into the banking system and protection of small depositors. Subsequently, the HKMA commenced a three-month consultation in June on a proposal to simplify the three-tier banking system into two tiers by merging deposit-taking companies into the restricted licence bank sector, thereby forming a new second tier of Hong Kong’s banking system. Respondents were generally supportive of the proposal.\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA conducted 177 off-site reviews covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL rating assessment1, corporate governance and risk management. As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance, 38 meetings were held with the boards of directors, independent non-executive directors or board-level committees of AIs. Furthermore, 38 tripartite meetings were held among the HKMA, AIs and their external auditors.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA conducted regular on-site examinations on a wide range of AIs’ activities. Credit risk management was a key focus given the challenging credit risk landscape amid a high interest rate environment and debt defaults by some Mainland property developers. The management of operational risk and technology risk was another major focus as the adoption of technology by AIs gathered further momentum. The HKMA also stepped up its supervisory work on climate risk management and rolled out a new round of thematic examinations focused on climaterelated risk governance, and a series of consultative sessions to provide supervisory guidance to AIs.\n\nThe banking turmoil in the US and Europe that started in March 2023 was the most significant system-wide banking stress since the Great Financial Crisis of 2008 in terms of scale and scope. The HKMA stayed on high alert as the turmoil unfolded and took a number of precautionary actions to ensure that any potential fallout would not undermine confidence in the local banking and financial system. After the episode, the HKMA conducted an internal review exercise having regard to the observations and experience gained from the turmoil. Based on this exercise, the HKMA developed a detailed action plan to incorporate lessons learnt with a view to strengthening its supervisory effectiveness and augmenting its ability to handle a banking crisis if one did occur. See Liquidity and market risks on page 95 for more details on the HKMA’s work in this respect.\n\nOn conduct supervision, the HKMA carried out on-site examinations in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses as well as consumer protection matters, supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk or new initiatives.\n\nTable 1 contains a summary of the HKMA’s supervisory activities in 2023.\n\nTable 1 Summary of supervisory activities\n\n# Credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nTotal loans decreased by 3.6% in 2023, compared with a decline of 3.0% in 2022. Table 2 shows the breakdown of growth in loans and advances. Mainland-related lending decreased by 6.6% to HK$4,226 billion in 2023 (Table 3).\n\nTable 2 Growth in loans and advances\n\nTable 3 Growth in Mainland-related lending\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA intensified supervisory efforts in monitoring AIs’ asset quality and assessing their credit risk management practices given the high interest rate environment and continued weakness in the Mainland property market. The asset quality of the banking sector deteriorated during the year but remained manageable. The classified loan ratio of the banking sector was 1.56% at the end of 2023, up from 1.40% at the end of 2022. The classified loan ratio for Mainland-related lending increased to 2.58% from 2.26% at the end of 2022.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA conducted targeted and thematic examinations to evaluate AIs’ credit risk management focusing on exposures to vulnerable sectors, premium financing, oversight of credit risks at operations outside Hong Kong and exposures to non-bank financial institutions.\n\n# Alleviating cash flow pressure faced by bank customers\n\nThe HKMA and the Banking Sector Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) Lending Coordination Mechanism announced in July the commencement of an orderly exit from the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme. The Scheme was introduced in May 2020 to tide eligible corporates over the pandemic. Taking into account the views of the commercial sectors, the partial principal repayment options were enhanced to assist corporates’ gradual return to normal repayment. Where sectors or individual borrowers were still facing challenges despite the end of the pandemic, banks continued to offer principal moratorium or other suitable credit relief measures on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe HKMA also encouraged banks to be sympathetic in handling the funding needs of corporates which had not participated in the Scheme but were facing cash flow pressures due to individual circumstances. The HKMA reminded banks to follow the “Hong Kong Approach to Corporate Difficulties” guidelines in dealing with corporates encountering repayment problems, so that individual banks would act collaboratively in the common interest of the lenders involved.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nThe successive rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures introduced by the HKMA since 2009 have strengthened banks’ risk management of their property mortgage lending business and the banking sector’s capacity to cope with challenges arising from a sharp correction in property prices. The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of new residential mortgage loans approved in 2023 stood at 57%, compared with 64% in September 2009 before the countercyclical measures were first introduced (Chart 1). The average debt servicing ratio (DSR) of new mortgages stayed low at 40% in 2023, compared with 41% in August 2010 when a cap on DSR was first applied.\n\nOn 7 July, the HKMA adjusted the countercyclical macroprudential measures after taking into account factors such as property prices, transaction volumes and the local and external economic environment. This was the first time the countercyclical macroprudential measures for residential properties were relaxed since their introduction in 2009. The adjustments included increasing the maximum LTV ratios for residential properties and commercial properties, as well as for mortgage loans assessed based on the net worth of mortgage applicants. In addition, the requirements to lower the applicable maximum LTV ratio and DSR limit by ten percentage points for mortgage applicants with incomes derived mainly from places outside of Hong Kong were lifted. The HKMA also removed the requirement to apply a five-percentage-point reduction on applicable DSR limits when mortgage applicants’ total mortgage finance exceeded the HKMA’s normal permissible LTV ceilings by 20 percentage points.\n\nChart 1 Average LTV ratio and DSR of new residential mortgage loans

銀行穩定性\n\n儘管在2023年面對多項逆風，包括美國和歐洲在3月發生的銀行業動盪、高利率環境和地緣政治緊張局勢，香港銀行業仍然保持強勁和具韌性。金管局迅速回應了3月的銀行業動盪，從管理連鎖反應到完成內部審查（涵蓋監督流程和處置框架等領域），為本地銀行業汲取教訓，同時繼續專注於授權機構的信貸、流動性和市場風險管理。鑑於網絡威脅日益增加，以及越來越多地使用第三方提供的技術服務，金管局亦與授權機構緊密合作，以提升其營運和網絡韌性。\n\n金管局透過進一步修訂《銀行操守守則》及推出《反詐騙消費者保障約章》，強化了對支付卡的消費者保障。金管局與同行監管機構合作，為與虛擬資產相關的活動建立平衡的監管制度，簡化了專業投資者的銷售流程，引入了「跨境理財通試點計劃」的強化措施，並開始對信託業務進行監管。此外，還推出了一項試點計畫，為在「信貸數據智」下提供消費者信貸參考服務做準備。\n\n金管局在反洗錢和反恐怖主義融資（AML\/CFT）方面的努力，反映了其以風險為本的方法應對最高威脅的承諾。為應對日益增加的數位詐騙，金管局透過推出實時詐騙監測和擴大公私營資訊共享合作夥伴關係的範圍（包括詐騙和洗錢情報工作小組）來強化生態系統合作。推出一個突破性的平台以促進銀行間資訊共享，將有助於應對騾子帳戶網絡的風險，而金管局亦與業界緊密合作，採取協調一致的行動，以處理日益增加的與詐騙相關的銀行投訴，並提高公眾對不同騙局的認識，包括在使用快速支付系統時實施交易前警示機制。同時，透過「宏觀分析試點計畫」，監管科技能力亦得到提升。\n\n在本地實施國際監管標準（包括資本充足率和資訊披露標準）方面取得了良好進展。在強化銀行業能力建設、吸引和培育未來人才以及提升現有從業人員技能方面亦作出了顯著努力。此外，香港存款保障委員會完成了就強化存款保障計畫所提出的改進方案進行的公眾諮詢。\n\n金管局繼續推進其工作，以確保建立一個可信的處置機制。制定了一項與存取關鍵金融市場基礎設施相關的新處置標準，並完成了對實施吸收損失能力政策標準的經驗進行的審查。在與銀行的處置規劃方面取得了重大進展，以應對早期終止風險和處置中的營運連續性問題。金管局亦繼續積極參與國際政策倡議和區域處置合作。\n\n# 目標\n\n金管局的總體目標是促進銀行體系的安全和穩定。實現這一目標取決於建立一個高度具韌性的金融體系，該體系能夠為香港經濟提供所需的關鍵金融服務。\n\n銀行透過其業務運作方式，以及在極端情況下以無序方式倒閉，可能會影響體系的穩定性。作為監管機構，金融管理局在保障金融穩定方面發揮著關鍵作用，確保銀行具備抵禦衝擊的能力，並能在危機中恢復其地位，最終有助於防止倒閉。金融管理局負責對銀行進行審慎監管，並負責在香港授權持牌銀行、有限制牌照銀行和接受存款公司（統稱授權機構）的牌照頒發工作。\n\n香港的審慎監管框架並非旨在確保零風險的金融體系。相反，金融管理局作為處置機構，旨在確保在授權機構不可持續經營的情況下，其倒閉能以有序的方式進行管理。為此，香港建立了金融機構處置機制，其中金融管理局是授權機構及其他類別機構的處置機構。為在香港落實處置機制，重要的是制定處置規則和政策標準，進行處置規劃以消除阻礙授權機構可處置性的因素，並發展金管局的營運能力以處置失敗的授權機構。為有效執行這些任務，金管局採用了國際協調一致的方法。\n\n金融管理局亦負責指定和監督某些金融市場基礎設施（FMIs）。在監督FMIs時，金管局的目標是促進其整體安全性和效率，限制系統性風險並提高透明度。提高FMIs抵禦金融危機的能力，可保護香港的貨幣和金融體系免受FMIs中斷所造成的潛在破壞性影響。\n\n# 2023年回顧\n\n# 發照\n\n在該年度，金管局向兩家在港以外註冊成立的銀行發出一張銀行牌照和一張有限制銀行牌照。金管局亦向四家外資交易平台營運商發出貨幣經紀牌照，並撤銷向一家貨幣經紀發出的另一項牌照。金管局在該年度撤銷了五家持牌銀行的授權。\n\n有關授權機構及香港本地代表處的更多資訊，可參閱附件及表D至F（分別見第313至316頁及第322至325頁）。\n\n# 三層銀行體系回顧\n\n為簡化香港銀行體系的結構，金管局在2023年對三層銀行體系進行了全面檢討。檢討發現，三層體系已變得比實現原目標（在進入銀行體系的靈活性與保護小額存款人之間取得平衡）所需的複雜度更高。其後，金管局在6月就簡化三層銀行體系的建議展開為期三個月的諮詢，將存款公司併入有限制牌照銀行類別，從而形成香港銀行體系新的第二層。諮詢結果顯示，回應者普遍支持該建議。\n\n# 監管活動概述\n\n在2023年，金管局進行了177次非現場審查，涵蓋廣泛議題，包括CAMEL評級評估¹、企業治理和風險管理。作為金管局持續努力促進更強風險治理的一部分，與授權機構的董事會、獨立非執行董事或董事會層級委員會舉行了38次會議。此外，金管局、授權機構及其外部稽核師舉行了38次三方會議。\n\n除了非現場活動外，金管局亦對授權機構的廣泛活動進行了定期現場檢查。信貸風險管理是重點之一，因為在高利率環境和部分內地房地產開發商債務違約的情況下，信貸風險形勢充滿挑戰。營運風險和科技風險的管理是另一個重點，因為授權機構採用科技的勢頭進一步增強。金管局亦加強了對氣候風險管理的監管工作，推出了一輪新的專題檢查，重點關注與氣候相關的風險治理，並舉行了一系列諮詢會議，為授權機構提供監管指引。\n\n自2023年3月起，美國和歐洲發生的銀行業動盪，在規模和範圍上均為2008年金融危機以來最嚴重的全系統性銀行業壓力。在動盪發生期間，金管局保持高度警惕，並採取多項預防措施，以確保任何潛在影響不會損害對本地銀行和金融體系的信心。事件發生後，金管局進行了一項內部審查工作，考慮了從動盪中獲得的觀察結果和經驗。基於此工作，金管局制定了一項詳細的行動計畫，以納入所學到的經驗教訓，旨在強化其監管效能，並提升其在發生銀行危機時處理危機的能力。有關金管局在此方面工作的更多詳情，請參閱第95頁的「流動性和市場風險」部分。\n\n在行為監管方面，金管局對證券、投資產品、保險和強積金相關業務以及消費者保障事宜進行了現場檢查，並輔以對被評估為高風險領域或新舉措的專題審查。\n\n表1概述了金管局在2023年的監管活動。\n\n表1 監管活動概要\n\n# 信貸風險\n\n# 信貸增長及資產品質\n\n與2022年下降3.0%相比，2023年總貸款下降了3.6%。表2顯示了貸款和墊款增長的細節。2023年，與內地相關的貸款減少了6.6%，至42,260億港元（表3）。\n\n表2 貸款及墊款增長情況\n\n表3 內地相關貸款增長情況\n\n2023年，鑑於高利率環境和內地房地產市場持續疲弱，金管局加強了對授權機構資產品質的監測和對其信貸風險管理實務的評估方面的監管工作。銀行業的資產品質在該年度有所惡化，但仍處於可控範圍內。銀行業的不良貸款比率由2022年底的1.40%上升至2023年底的1.56%。與內地相關的貸款不良貸款比率由2022年底的2.26%上升至2.58%。\n\n在該年度，金管局進行了專項和專題檢查，以評估授權機構的信貸風險管理情況，重點關注對脆弱行業的風險敞口、保費融資、對香港以外營運的信貸風險監督以及對非銀行金融機構的風險敞口。\n\n# 紓緩銀行客戶所面臨的現金流壓力\n\n金管局與銀行業中小企貸款協調機制於7月宣布，有序退出「預先批核還本金假期計畫」。該計畫於2020年5月推出，旨在協助合資格企業渡過疫情難關。鑑於商業界的看法，部分還本金選項得到強化，以協助企業逐步恢復正常還款。對於在疫情結束後仍面臨挑戰的行業或個別借款人，銀行繼續按個別情況提供本金還款寬免或其他合適的信貸紓緩措施。\n\n金管局亦鼓勵銀行同情地處理未參與該計畫但因個別情況而面臨現金流壓力的企業的融資需求。金管局提醒銀行在處理企業還款問題時遵循「香港處理企業困難的方法」指引，以便個別銀行能為相關貸款人的共同利益而合作。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n自2009年以來，金管局先後推出多輪逆周期宏觀審慎措施，強化了銀行對物業按揭貸款業務的風險管理，以及銀行業應對物業價格大幅調整所帶來的挑戰的能力。2023年新批住宅按揭貸款的平均貸款與物業價值比率（LTV）為57%，而首次推出逆周期措施前的2009年9月則為64%（圖1）。2023年新按揭的平均供款與入息比率（DSR）維持在低水平，為40%，而首次實施DSR上限時的2010年8月則為41%。\n\n7月7日，金管局在考慮了物業價格、成交量及本地和外部經濟環境等因素後，調整了逆周期宏觀審慎措施。這是自2009年推出逆周期宏觀審慎措施以來，首次放寬針對住宅物業的措施。調整包括提高住宅物業和商業物業的最高LTV比率，以及按按揭申請人的資產淨值評估的按揭貸款的最高LTV比率。此外，取消了要求主要收入來源地為香港以外地區的按揭申請人降低適用最高LTV比率和DSR上限10個百分點的規定。金管局亦取消了當按揭申請人的總按揭融資超出金管局正常可接受LTV上限20個百分點時，適用DSR上限須下調5個百分點的要求。\n\n圖1

{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA utilised a multi-pronged approach to achieve notable progress in consolidating Hong Kong’s status as a globally competitive international financial centre.\n\nThe success of two major events, namely the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit and the HKMA-BIS High-Level Conference, had reinforced Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre and created positive ripple effects.\n\nThe HKMA, together with its Mainland and Hong Kong counterparts, made concerted efforts to deepen and widen the mutual access between the financial markets of Hong Kong and the Mainland. This included enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Scheme in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, the designation of additional market makers for Southbound Trading under Bond Connect, the successful launch of Northbound Trading of Swap Connect, and the roll-out of the HKD-RMB Dual Counter Model and the Dual Counter Market Making Programme. These initiatives were effective in strengthening Hong Kong’s gateway position and reinforcing the city’s status as a global hub for offshore renminbi business.\n\nThe HKMA also made good progress in strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, in areas including bond issuance, asset and wealth management, green and sustainable finance, and corporate treasury centres. To promote Hong Kong’s financial services, the HKMA stepped up its market outreach activities to overseas and Mainland stakeholders to keep them well informed about the opportunities in Hong Kong’s financial market and its resilience.\n\nSignificant progress has been made on all fronts of the HKMA’s “Fintech 2025” strategy, including in areas such as promoting fintech adoption, Central Bank Digital Currency, data infrastructure, talent development, and policies and funding support.\n\nThe Faster Payment System (FPS) marked its fifth anniversary in September. The number of registrations has grown steadily, and had reached 13.6 million at the end of 2023. The average daily turnover for the year rose to 1.25 million real-time transactions. FPS x PromptPay link for cross-border QR payment between Hong Kong and Thailand was jointly launched with the Bank of Thailand in December, providing a fast, secure and easily accessible cross-border retail payment service for people travelling between the two places.\n\nAs an active member of many international and regional central banking and regulatory forums, the HKMA continued to contribute to global efforts to maintain financial stability and promote financial market developments.\n\n# Overview\n\nThroughout the year, the HKMA continued making proactive efforts to strengthen Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre. In November, it organised the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit for the second year. This three-day event brought together prominent financial leaders from around the world to share their unique perspectives under the theme of “Living with Complexity”. With over 350 participants from 160 international financial institutions attending, the summit clearly showed the global financial sector’s commitment to and confidence in Hong Kong. In the same month, the HKMA and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) co-hosted the HKMA-BIS High Level Conference, which attracted more than 300 participants, including over 20 current and former central bank governors. The conference highlighted the HKMA’s close collaboration with the BIS as well as with the international central banking community.\n\nThe expansion of and enhancements made to the MainlandHong Kong Connect schemes have reinforced Hong Kong’s role as the bridge between the Mainland and international financial markets. A series of enhancements to the Crossboundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) scheme were introduced to facilitate cross-boundary retail investment in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA). Riding on the smooth operations of Southbound Bond Connect, the HKMA designated nine additional market makers to improve secondary liquidity and meet investor demand. Northbound Trading of Swap Connect was successfully launched in the year, enabling global investors to better manage the interest rate risks associated with their Mainland fixed income portfolio via Hong Kong.\n\nHong Kong’s offshore renminbi businesses saw robust growth during the year. The HKMA collaborated with the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) to launch the HKD-RMB Dual Counter Model and the Dual Counter Market Making Programme in June. This helped develop a more diverse range of renminbi-denominated products in Hong Kong by facilitating the issuance and trading of renminbidenominated stocks in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA continued to work on strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. In particular, to enhance Hong Kong’s appeal as a preferred fund management centre, the HKMA worked closely with the Government and the financial industry to provide a more facilitative tax and regulatory environment. Significant progress was also made in promoting innovation in Hong Kong’s bond market, and consolidating Hong Kong’s position as a regional green and sustainable finance hub. At the same time, the HKMA stepped up its market outreach activities to promote Hong Kong’s financial services to overseas and Mainland stakeholders.\n\nBoth the Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO) and the banking departments of the HKMA continued to implement the “Fintech 2025” strategy1 to promote wide adoption of financial technology (fintech) and strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia. Key initiatives implemented during the year included:\n- promoting further adoption in the tech focus areas of Wealthtech, Insurtech, Greentech, artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology (DLT);\n- advancing the work on wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) to improve cross-border payments;\n- progressing further in the study on the prospect of introducing a retail CBDC in Hong Kong, i.e. an e-HKD;\n- stepping up efforts to develop Commercial Data Interchange (CDI);\n- enhancing talent development;\n- nurturing the fintech ecosystem through funding and policies;\n- strengthening cross-border collaboration in fintech; and\n- expanding the adoption of the FPS.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure is vital for maintaining the city’s position as a leading international financial centre. In 2023, the four interbank Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) and the Hong Kong Trade Repository (HKTR) achieved 100%2 system availability, outperforming the target of 99.95%. The debt securities settlement service, including the Northbound and Southbound Bond Connect linkage service, continued to operate smoothly.\n\nAdoption of the FPS continued to increase in 2023, marking the significant milestone of the FPS reaching its fifth anniversary. The number of registrations for the FPS and the FPS turnover have grown steadily over the past five years, with the number of registrations growing to 13.6 million at the end of 2023 and the average daily turnover for the year rising by 33% from 2022. The increased use of the FPS for settling Government bills, making merchant payments, and topping up Stored Value Facility (SVF) e-wallets or bank accounts, were key drivers for the continued rise in the transaction volume, on top of steady growth in person-toperson and business payments.\n\nTo ensure the safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA oversees six designated retail payment systems (RPSs) and supervises 17 licensed SVFs (four of which are SVFs issued by licensed banks) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO). During the year, the HKMA also continued to facilitate the smooth implementation of the Government’s Consumption Voucher Scheme, helping to co-ordinate the relevant Government parties and the SVF licensees appointed for the scheme, and facilitate dialogue and co-operation between them.\n\nOn 27 December, the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau and the HKMA jointly issued a public consultation paper on regulation for stablecoin issuers. The HKMA subsequently introduced a sandbox arrangement on 12 March 2024 for institutions planning to issue fiat-referenced stablecoins in Hong Kong. At the same time, the HKMA has been actively participating in the work of international bodies in relation to crypto-asset activities, and monitoring the development of the market closely.\n\nInternationally, the HKMA has remained an active member of the central banking community and continued to play a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees. Currently, the HKMA co-chairs the Policy and Standards Group of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), as well as the Regional Consultative Group for Asia, the Non-Bank Monitoring Experts Group (until June) and the Financial Innovation Network of the Financial Stability Board (FSB). The HKMA also chairs the BIS’ Meeting of Governors from Major Emerging Market Economies (EMEs). Between 2018 and 2023, the HKMA served consecutive terms as the chair of the Working Group on Financial Markets established under the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP)3.\n\nThe HKMA also held bilateral meetings with the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates and the Saudi Central Bank in May and July respectively to promote investment and financial market connectivity between the Middle East and Asia. The sixth Hong Kong-Switzerland Financial Dialogue was held in Bern, Switzerland on 25 September, and the discussion covered topics on regional and domestic outlook and policy challenges, latest development, and potential collaboration in the areas of sustainable finance, fintech, and market connectivity.\n\n# A glance at the HKMA’s initiatives in 2023 in strengthening Hong Kong’s

國際金融中心\n\n2023年，香港金管局採取多管齊下的策略，在鞏固香港作為全球具競爭力的國際金融中心地位方面取得了顯著進展。\n\n全球金融領袖投資峰會及香港金管局-BIS高級別會議兩大盛事的成功舉辦，強化了香港作為國際金融中心的地位，並產生了正向的連鎖效應。\n\n香港金管局與內地及香港有關當局攜手合作，共同努力深化和擴大香港與內地金融市場的互聯互通。這包括強化粵港澳大灣區跨境理財通計畫、指定更多南向交易債券通做市商、成功推出北向交易「互換通」、以及推行港元-人民幣雙櫃台模式及雙櫃台做市商計畫。這些舉措有效地鞏固了香港作為門戶的定位，並強化了香港作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位。\n\n香港金管局亦在加強香港金融平台競爭力方面取得良好進展，相關範疇包括債券發行、資產及財富管理、綠色及永續金融，以及企業財資中心。為推廣香港的金融服務，香港金管局加強了與海外及內地利害關係人的市場推廣活動，讓他們更深入了解香港金融市場的機遇及其韌性。\n\n香港金管局「金融科技2025」策略在各方面均取得重大進展，包括推動金融科技應用、中央銀行數位貨幣、數據基礎建設、人才培育，以及政策和資助支援等範疇。\n\n快速支付系統（FPS）於九月踏入第五週年。註冊帳戶數目穩步增長，並於2023年底達1,360萬個。全年平均每日交易筆數上升至125萬筆即時交易。香港金管局於十二月與泰國中央銀行聯合推出FPS x PromptPay跨境二維碼支付連結，為香港與泰國兩地旅客提供便捷、安全及高效的跨境零售支付服務。\n\n香港金管局是多個國際及區域央行及監管組織的活躍成員，繼續為全球維持金融穩定及促進金融市場發展的努力作出貢獻。\n\n# 概述\n\n全年以來，香港金管局繼續積極努力，強化香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。十一月，金管局第二年舉辦全球金融領袖投資峰會，為期三天。這項活動匯聚了來自世界各地的金融領袖，以「與複雜性共存」為主題，分享他們獨特的見解。峰會吸引了超過350位來自160家國際金融機構的與會者，清楚地表明了全球金融界對香港的承諾和信心。同月，香港金管局與國際清算銀行（BIS）共同主辦了香港金管局-BIS高級別會議，吸引了超過300位與會者，其中包括20多位現任及前任央行行長。會議突顯了香港金管局與BIS及國際央行界的緊密合作。\n\n內地與香港互聯互通機制的擴展和強化，鞏固了香港作為內地與國際金融市場之間橋樑的角色。跨境理財通（跨境理財通）計畫推出了一系列強化措施，以促進粵港澳大灣區的跨境零售投資。憑藉南向債券通的順暢運作，香港金管局指定了額外九家做市商，以改善二級市場流動性並滿足投資者需求。北向交易「互換通」於該年成功推出，讓全球投資者能透過香港更好地管理與內地固定收益投資組合相關的利率風險。\n\n香港離岸人民幣業務在該年錄得強勁增長。香港金管局與證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）及香港交易及結算所有限公司（香港交易所）合作，於六月推出港元-人民幣雙櫃台模式及雙櫃台做市商計畫。這有助於在香港發展更多元化的人民幣計價產品，促進人民幣計價股票在香港的發行和交易。\n\n香港金管局繼續努力強化香港金融平台的競爭力。尤其是，為提升香港作為首選基金管理中心的吸引力，香港金管局與政府及金融業界緊密合作，提供更便利的稅務及監管環境。在推動香港債券市場創新及鞏固香港作為區域綠色及永續金融樞紐的地位方面，亦取得重大進展。同時，香港金管局加強了市場推廣活動，向海外及內地利害關係人推廣香港的金融服務。\n\n香港金管局的金融科技促進辦公室及銀行部門繼續推行「金融科技2025」策略，以促進金融科技的廣泛應用，並鞏固香港作為亞洲金融科技樞紐的地位。該年落實的主要舉措包括：\n- 進一步推動財富科技、保險科技、綠色科技、人工智慧及分布式帳簿技術（DLT）等金融科技重點領域的應用；\n- 推進批發型中央銀行數位貨幣（CBDC）的工作，以改善跨境支付；\n- 進一步推進在香港引入零售型CBDC（即電子港元）的前景研究；\n- 加強努力發展商業數據互通（CDI）；\n- 強化人才培育；\n- 透過資助及政策培育金融科技生態圈；\n- 強化金融科技的跨境合作；及\n- 擴大快速支付系統（FPS）的應用。\n\n香港金融基礎建設的安全及高效運作，對維持香港作為領先國際金融中心的地位至關重要。2023年，四間銀行間即時全額結算（RTGS）系統、中央貨幣市場單位（CMU）及香港交易存管處（HKTR）的系統可用性均達100%，超出99.95%的目標。債務證券結算服務（包括北向通及南向通債券通連結服務）繼續順暢運作。\n\n快速支付系統（FPS）於2023年繼續擴大應用，標誌著FPS踏入第五週年這個重要里程碑。過去五年，FPS的註冊帳戶數目及交易金額均穩步增長，註冊帳戶數目於2023年底增至1,360萬個，而全年平均每日交易金額較2022年上升33%。FPS在結算政府帳單、商戶付款及增值儲值支付工具（SVF）電子錢包或銀行帳戶餘額等方面的使用率上升，是交易筆數持續上升的主要動力，此外，個人及企業支付亦錄得穩步增長。\n\n為確保本地零售支付行業的安全及效率，香港金管局根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（PSSVFO）監管六個指定零售支付系統（RPSs），並監督17個持牌SVF（其中四個由持牌銀行發行）。在該年，香港金管局亦繼續促進政府消費券計畫的順暢落實，協助協調相關政府部門及為計畫委任的SVF發牌機構，並促進它們之間的對話及合作。\n\n十二月二十七日，財經事務及庫務局及香港金管局聯合發表了有關穩定幣發行人監管的諮詢文件。其後，香港金管局於2024年3月12日為計畫在香港發行與法定貨幣掛鉤的穩定幣的機構引入了沙盒機制。同時，香港金管局積極參與國際組織有關加密資產活動的工作，並密切監察市場發展。\n\n在國際層面，香港金管局繼續是央行界的活躍成員，並在多個區域及國際委員會中擔任領導角色。目前，香港金管局聯席主持巴塞爾銀行監理委員會（巴塞爾委員會）的政策及標準小組、亞洲區域諮詢小組、非銀行監管專家小組（直至六月）及金融穩定委員會（FSB）的金融創新網絡。香港金管局亦主持BIS主要新興市場經濟體（EMEs）央行行長會議。在2018年至2023年間，香港金管局連續擔任東亞及太平洋中央銀行行政首長會議（EMEAP）下成立的金融市場工作小組的主席。\n\n香港金管局亦分別於五月及七月與阿拉伯聯合大公國中央銀行及沙烏地中央銀行舉行雙邊會議，以促進中東與亞洲之間的投資及金融市場連結。第六屆香港-瑞士金融對話於九月二十五日在瑞士伯爾尼舉行，討論涵蓋區域及國內展望和政策挑戰、最新發展，以及永續金融、金融科技及市場連結等領域的潛在合作。\n\n#

{"en":"# Reserves Management\n\nThe investment environment in 2023 was volatile and challenging. Although some banks in the US and Europe experienced liquidity issues at the beginning of the year, the associated risks did not spread across the financial markets. While levels of inflation in major developed economies have declined from their peak in 2023, they have remained above the targets set by major central banks. Following an aggressive rate hike cycle, the US Federal Reserve has paused hiking rate since the third quarter, and indicated that the policy rate was likely at or near its peak. This, coupled with a resilient US economy, has made investor sentiment more optimistic. However, ongoing geopolitical tensions, such as the Russia-Ukraine war and the outbreak of conflict in the Middle East during the year, added turbulence and uncertainties to the investment market. In this complicated and dynamic investment environment, the investment performance of the Exchange Fund experienced some ups and downs. Despite this, the Exchange Fund managed to achieve a decent investment return. In 2023, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$226.0 billion, representing an investment return of 5.5%.\n\n# The Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems in order to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The HKMA, under the delegated authority of the Financial Secretary and within the terms of the delegation, is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# Management of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(i) To preserve capital;\n(ii) To ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(iii) To ensure that sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(iv) Subject to (i)–(iii), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Exchange Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 Portfolio segregation of the Exchange Fund\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP). The BP holds highly liquid US dollardenominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base, as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The IP invests primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member economies of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, with a view to preserving the value and long-term purchasing power of its assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA diversifies part of the Exchange Fund’s investments in a prudent and incremental manner into a wider variety of asset classes. These include emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The target asset allocation of the LTGP is determined concurrently with that of other asset classes, subject to prudent risk management principles and portfolio diversification strategy.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007, holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that have been acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes. Due to its unique nature, the Strategic Portfolio is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by the Fiscal Reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP1. A major exception is the Future Fund2, which links its interest rate to the return of both the IP and the LTGP in accordance with the portfolio mix. The portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 35:65 in 2023.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: strategic asset allocation and tactical asset allocation. Strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents long-term asset allocation based on the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark (or strategic) allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and tracking error3 limit are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with the EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may assume positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nThe HKMA’s Exchange Fund Investment Office houses the Exchange Fund’s investment and related risk management functions. Exchange Fund Investment Office staff members directly manage about 71% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, comprising the entire BP and part of the IP. The part of the IP managed internally includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 29% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes. The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to realise sustainable returns, while also drawing on diverse and complementary investment styles and taking advantage of external market insights and technical expertise in investment.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is determined primarily by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nAs the investment environment becomes more complex, good risk management is increasingly important. The HKMA sets stringent controls and investment guidelines for both its internally and externally managed portfolios, and ensures that a proper risk monitoring and compliance system is in place. Three lines of defence are in place to implement effective risk management and governance of investment-related activities. Key risk categories (including credit, market, liquidity and operational risks) are regularly monitored. The risk management process provides a robust framework that supports the HKMA’s strategic planning and investment diversification efforts.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nThe HKMA believes that an appropriate emphasis on responsible investment and sustainable long-term economic performance can help better achieve the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund, as well as reduce risks associated with environmental, social and governance (ESG)-related matters of its underlying investments. To embrace responsible investment practices, the HKMA has integrated ESG factors into the investment processes of the Exchange Fund, with the guiding principle that priority will generally be given to ESG investments if their long-term risk-adjusted returns are comparable with other investments. For more details about the HKMA’s responsible investment work, see the Responsible Investment chapter of the Sustainability Report 2023.\n\n# Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\n# The financial markets in 2023\n\nThe investment environment in 2023 was volatile and challenging.\n\nGlobal equities were generally on an upward trend in 2023. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose by 24% during the year, especially in the fourth quarter as markets began to anticipate sooner-than-expected rate cuts.\n\nIn the bond markets, yields remained high, with the 10-year US Treasury yield surging above 5% at one point to reach its highest level since 2007. However, as market expectations of central banks’ monetary policies shifted, bond yields retreated towards the end of the year alongside a gradual increase in bond prices.\n\nIn the currency markets, the US dollar recorded a mixed performance against major currencies. Among these, the pound sterling and the euro appreciated against the US dollar, while the yen and the renminbi depreciated.\n\nThe performance of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2023 is shown in Table 1.\n\nTable 1 2023 market returns\n\n# Reserves Management\n\n# Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$226.0 billion in 2023. This comprised gains on bonds of HK$144.7 billion, gains on equities of HK$58.1 billion (with gains of HK$73.6 billion from foreign equities, and losses of HK$15.5 billion from Hong Kong equities), a negative currency translation effect of HK$0.5 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets, and gains of HK$23.7 billion on other investments held by the investment-holding subsidiaries of the Fund. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation loss of HK$4.8 billion.\n\nTotal assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,016.5 billion at the end of the year. The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$517.3 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$411.9 billion and real estate HK$105.4 billion. Outstanding investment commitments of the LTGP amounted to HK$291.1 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund in 2023, excluding the Strategic Portfolio, was 5.5%. The returns of the IP and the BP were 6.4% and 5.0% respectively. The LTGP has recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 11.8% since its inception in 2009.\n\nThe annual returns of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2023 are set out in Chart 1. Table 2 shows the 2023 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over several different time horizons. The average return was 1.6% during 2021–2023, 3.3% during 2019–2023, 2.7% during 2014–2023 and 4.5% since 1994. Table 3 shows the currency mix of the Fund’s assets on 31 December 2023.\n\nSee pages 205 to 311 for the audited 2023 financial statements of the Exchange Fund.\n\nChart 1 Investment return of the

儲備管理\n\n2023 年的投資環境動盪且充滿挑戰。儘管美國和歐洲的一些銀行在年初出現流動性問題，但相關風險並未蔓延到金融市場。主要已開發經濟體的通膨水準在 2023 年已從高峰回落，但仍高於主要央行設定的目標。在經歷了一輪進取的升息週期後，美國聯邦準備銀行自第三季起已暫停升息，並表示政策利率可能已處於或接近高峰水準。這加上美國經濟的韌性，令投資者情緒更為樂觀。然而，地緣政治緊張局勢持續，例如年內發生的俄烏戰爭和中東衝突，為投資市場增添了波動和不確定性。在這個複雜和多變的投資環境下，外匯基金的投資表現出現了一些起伏。儘管如此，外匯基金仍錄得良好的投資回報。2023 年，外匯基金錄得投資收入 2,260 億港元，投資回報率為 5.5%。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n《外匯基金條例》訂明，外匯基金的主要目標是直接或間接影響香港貨幣的匯率。基金亦可用於維持香港貨幣及金融制度的穩定和健全，以協助維持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。金管局在財政司司長授予的權限範圍內，就外匯基金的運用和投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標及投資組合架構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會為外匯基金訂立了以下投資目標：\n\n（一）保障資本；\n（二）確保貨幣基礎在任何時候均獲足額的極高流通性美元資產支持；\n（三）確保有足夠的流動資金以維持貨幣及金融穩定；及\n（四）在符合（一）至（三）項的前提下，取得有助維持外匯基金長遠購買力的投資回報。\n\n這些目標充分考慮了外匯基金的法定目的，並已納入基金的投資組合架構及目標資產配置中（圖 1）。\n\n圖 1 外匯基金的投資組合劃分\n\n概括而言，外匯基金有兩大投資組合：支持投資組合（BP）及投資組合（IP）。BP 持有極高流通性的美元資產，以根據聯繫匯率制度的要求，為貨幣基礎提供足額支持。IP 主要投資於經濟合作暨發展組織成員國的債券及股票市場，以期保持其資產的價值和長遠購買力。\n\n為更好地管理風險及提升中長期回報，金管局以審慎和循序漸進的方式，將外匯基金部分投資分散至更多元化的資產類別，包括新興市場及內地債券和股票、私募股權（包括基建）及房地產。新興市場及內地債券和股票歸入 IP 持有，而私募股權及房地產投資則歸入長期增長組合（LTGP）。LTGP 的目標資產配置是與其它資產類別的目標資產配置同時釐定，並受審慎的風險管理原則及投資組合多元化策略所規限。\n\n策略性投資組合成立於 2007 年，持有政府為外匯基金策略性目的而購入的香港交易所股份有限公司的股份。由於其獨特性，策略性投資組合不包括在基金的投資表現評估之內。\n\n# 外匯基金的存款安排\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定機構的存款。利率一般與 IP1 的表現掛鉤。一個主要例外是「未來基金」2，其利率根據投資組合的比重，與 IP 及 LTGP 的回報掛鉤。2023 年，「未來基金」在 IP 及 LTGP 之間的投資組合比重約為 35:65。\n\n# 投資流程\n\n外匯基金的投資流程以兩類資產配置的決定為基礎：策略性資產配置及戰術性資產配置。策略性資產配置反映在投資基準中，代表根據外匯基金的投資目標而作出的長期資產配置。在策略性配置的指引下，資產會以戰術性方式配置，以爭取超越基準的回報。這意味著實際配置往往與基準（或策略性）配置有所不同。實際配置與基準配置之間的差異稱為「戰術性偏離」。基準及循跡誤差 3 限額由財政司司長與外匯基金諮詢委員會磋商後釐定，而戰術性決定及戰術性偏離的容許範圍則由金管局在獲賦予的權限下制定及設定。在戰術性偏離的容許範圍內，投資組合經理可採取投資倉位，以把握短期市場變動的機遇。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局外匯基金投資辦公室負責外匯基金的投資及相關風險管理工作。外匯基金投資辦公室的工作人員直接管理約 71% 的外匯基金投資，包括整個 BP 及部分 IP。內部管理的 IP 部分包括一系列的投資組合，投資於全球固定收益市場，以及多個衍生工具疊加投資組合，為基金實施宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 聘用外部經理\n\n除了內部管理資產外，金管局亦聘請外部基金經理管理約 29% 的外匯基金資產，包括所有上市股權投資組合及其他專業資產類別。聘用外部經理的目的是為了汲取市場上最佳的投資專業知識，以實現可持續的回報，同時亦能借鑑多元化和互補的投資方式，並利用外部市場見解及投資方面的技術專長。\n\n與聘用外部經理相關的開支包括基金管理費、託管費、交易成本、預扣稅及其他稅項。該開支主要由市場因素決定，並可能每年有所波動。\n\n# 風險管理及合規\n\n隨著投資環境變得更為複雜，良好的風險管理日益重要。金管局為內部及外部管理的投資組合制定嚴格的監控措施及投資指引，並確保建立妥善的風險監察及合規制度。為有效管理及管治與投資相關的活動，已設立三道防線。主要風險類別（包括信貸、市場、流動性及操作風險）受到定期監察。風險管理流程提供了一個穩健的框架，支持金管局的策略規劃及投資多元化工作。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n金管局相信，適當地重視負責任投資及可持續的長遠經濟表現，有助更好地實現外匯基金的投資目標，並減低與環境、社會及管治（ESG）相關的基礎投資事項所帶來的風險。為積極支持負責任投資的實踐，金管局已將 ESG 因素併入外匯基金的投資流程，指導原則是若 ESG 投資的長期經風險調整回報與其它投資相若，一般會優先考慮 ESG 投資。有關金管局在負責任投資方面的工作詳情，請參閱《2023 年可持續發展報告》中的「負責任投資」章節。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2023 年的金融市場\n\n2023 年的投資環境動盪且充滿挑戰。\n\n全球股市在 2023 年普遍呈上升趨勢。標普 500 指數全年上升 24%，尤其在第四季，市場開始預期減息會比預期更早進行。\n\n在債券市場，收益率維持在高水準，美國 10 年期國債收益率一度突破 5%，創下 2007 年以來的最高水準。然而，隨著市場對央行貨幣政策的預期改變，債券收益率在年底回落，同時債券價格逐步上升。\n\n在貨幣市場，美元對主要貨幣的表現不一。其中，英鎊及歐元對美元升值，而日圓及人民幣則貶值。\n\n2023 年主要貨幣、債券及股權市場的表現見表 1。\n\n表 1 2023 年市場回報\n\n# 儲備管理\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n2023 年，外匯基金錄得投資收入 2,260

{"en":"# Corporate Functions\n\nCorporate functions support the operations of the HKMA with a high level of transparency, accountability, efficiency and professionalism. To promote public understanding of its policies and operations, the HKMA communicates actively with the community and market participants through traditional and social media, the HKMA website, the Information Centre and other channels.\n\nInternally, the HKMA is striving to build an agile and professional workforce, maintain rigorous financial discipline, and upgrade its digital capabilities in order to adapt to changes and ensure its policies and initiatives are effectively implemented.\n\n# Transparency\n\n# Media relations and use of social media\n\nThe HKMA works closely with the media to enhance transparency and promote public understanding of its policies and operations. In 2023, the HKMA held or participated in 188 open press events, comprising 11 press conferences, six media briefings, 15 stand-up interviews and 156 other public functions. Over the course of the year, it also arranged a further 25 media interviews, issued 583 bilingual press releases and handled a large number of media enquiries on a daily basis.\n\nPress conferences and media briefings to raise awareness of the HKMA’s key functions were organised for local, Mainland and foreign media. Topics included anti-scam initiatives, Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), and stablecoins.\n\nMedia representatives were active participants in events organised by the HKMA in 2023, in particular the second Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit. The three-day event generated over 2,000 pieces of positive, factual news coverage in local, Mainland and international media.\n\nMr Eddie Yue, Chief Executive, speaks at a media stand-up at the Hong Kong FinTech Week 2023\n\nMr Eddie Yue, Chief Executive, conducts a media stand-up at the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit\n\nMr Arthur Yuen (first from right), Deputy Chief Executive, hosts a sharing session at the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter event\n\nMr Howard Lee (centre), Deputy Chief Executive, hosts a media briefing on the e-HKD Pilot Programme Phase 1 Report\n\nMr Darryl Chan (first from left), Deputy Chief Executive, moderates a panel discussion at the Treasury Markets Summit 2023\n\nCreative social media content helps to raise public awareness on the HKMA initiatives and a range of other topics\n\nTo engage with the public more effectively, the HKMA operates six social media channels (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, WeChat, X (formerly Twitter), and YouTube), which collectively have over 150,000 followers. The HKMA’s major summit and conferences, including the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit, are livestreamed on its social media channels to enhance participation by the public and the industry. The HKMA also develops creative social media content to raise public awareness on a range of topics and initiatives. Recent content covered topics such as consumer protection and scam prevention, the Faster Payment System, fintech, green and sustainable finance, and major events of the HKMA.\n\n# Public enquiries\n\nThe HKMA’s Public Enquiry Service provides an effective channel for the public looking to better understand key HKMA functions and operations.\n\nIn 2023, the Public Enquiry Service handled 9,565 enquiries. About half of these were related to consumer banking issues, banking policies and regulations, financial infrastructure and debt market development, and notes and coins. Some of the common subjects of enquiries concerned banking products and services, the Coin Collection Programme, the Retail Bond Issuance Programme, banking-related guidelines and circulars, and the Faster Payment System.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received by the Public Enquiry Service since 2020, and Chart 2 provides a breakdown of the nature of enquiries received in 2023.\n\nChart 1 Total number of public enquiries\n\nChart 2 Nature of enquiries received in 2023\n\n# Publications\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA published its Annual Report 2022 along with its first standalone Sustainability Report 2022. The Annual Report 2022 received a Gold Award in the “Non-profit Making and Charitable Organizations” category, the highest ranking within the category, at the Hong Kong Management Association’s 2023 Best Annual Reports Awards. Meanwhile, the Sustainability Report 2022 won the ESG Award in the Public Sector\/Not-for-profit (Large) Category of the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants’ Best Corporate Governance and ESG Awards 2023.\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA published two issues of its Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report and four issues of its Quarterly Bulletin, and regularly updated its Monthly Statistical Bulletin to provide up-to-date and thematic information on and analyses of monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. The HKMA also published 14 inSight1 articles in which it introduced major new policies and initiatives and discussed topical issues.\n\n# Corporate website\n\nThe corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk), with nearly 60,000 pages of content in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, is the public gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It contains the register of authorized institutions (AIs) and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance (BO), as well as the register of stored value facility licensees under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance.\n\nThe HKMA has been releasing financial data and important information on its website via an Open Application Programming Interface (Open API) in phases since 2018. By the end of 2023, the HKMA had opened up 175 sets of Open APIs on its website, in line with its target schedule.\n\nThe HKMA’s Open API portal:\n\n# Information Centre\n\nLocated on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre, the HKMA Information Centre consists of an exhibition area and a library designed to introduce the work of the HKMA to the community and enhance public awareness of monetary and banking matters. The interactive exhibition area presents an overview of the HKMA’s work, and of the development of money and banking in Hong Kong, along with information and exhibits useful for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nDuring the year, the Information Centre welcomed more than 31,000 visitors and hosted over 480 guided tours for schools and other groups.\n\nThe library, next to the exhibition area, houses over 26,000 books, journals and other publications on Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs as well as central banking topics. It also maintains the register of AIs and local representative offices, as well as the register of securities staff of AIs, for public access as required by section 20 of the BO.\n\nYoung visitors learn about the design of banknotes in Hong Kong during a guided tour of the Information Centre\n\nGuided tour of the Information Centre for kindergarten students\n\n# Community engagement and public education\n\nSince 1998, the HKMA has been running a public education programme that reaches out to the community to raise public awareness of its work. To date, more than 66,000 people have participated in the public education programme. In 2023, a webinar was organised for over 1,200 students and teachers from 58 secondary schools. The webinar topics included an overview of the HKMA’s work, the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, protection of personal digital keys, the Deposit Protection Scheme, green finance, and career opportunities in the banking industry.\n\nThe HKMA educates and engages the public on how to be smart and responsible financial consumers. In light of the rise in phishing scams and credit card fraud, the HKMA continued its efforts across different media to remind the public to stay vigilant. A brand new awareness campaign was rolled out following the launch of the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter, emphasising that banks and major merchants have committed not to send hyperlinks via instant electronic messages soliciting personal and credit card information. The HKMA also passed on smart tips on credit cards, personal loans, online shopping, banking services and different payment options (including “Buy Now, Pay Later” products) via radio and social media channels.\n\nA new video and animations with cannibal plant and animal trap are produced with the theme “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!”\n\nCross-media publicity is produced reminding members of the public not to click on suspicious links\n\nAnimated video to promote e-laisees\n\nIn support of the environment, and drawing on technological advances in financial services, the HKMA encouraged members of the public to give out electronic lai sees (e-laisees) and to consider using good-as-new banknotes for physical lai sees over the Chinese New Year through social media and radio promotions.\n\nThe HKMA also seeks to enhance public understanding of the financial industry and raise young people’s interest in pursuing a career in the industry, thus enlarging Hong Kong’s talent pool for the financial industry. Following positive feedback for its earlier video series “Four Faces of Talents in Central”, the HKMA launched a new video series titled “Financial Special Forces: Unleashing New Horizons” that featured four growth areas in the financial industry: data science, fintech, green and sustainable finance, and wealth management. The video series utilised computer graphics and animation to show seasoned market practitioners supervising young talents as they managed daily work challenges, providing a light-touch introduction to career opportunities and prospects within the industry.\n\nA video series “Financial Special Forces: Unleashing New Horizons” is produced to keep the younger generation abreast of career opportunities in finance\n\nMentors from different areas sharing their expertise and experience with students\n\nTo enhance financial literacy among secondary school students, the HKMA worked with other stakeholders to co-organise the “Hong Kong Financial Literacy Championship” for the ninth consecutive year. Under the theme of digital and sustainable economy, the event helped students learn more about money management, green and sustainability, the current state of the financial market and career opportunities. It also included an online quiz that received around 20,000 submissions, mentoring by experienced practitioners from diverse areas, and design thinking challenge.\n\n# $mart Money Management 321\n\nThe HKMA launched its first financial education board game called “$mart Money Management 321”, which is jointly designed and developed with a social enterprise specialising in board game production. The board game was designed to help primary school students learn about different payment methods, money management concepts, fintech and cybersecurity in a simulated setting.\n\nThe HKMA took a booth at the Hong Kong Book Fair 2023 to promote the board game, which was one of the best-selling items at the Fair. In addition, the HKMA organised a series of free promotional activities, which included workshops in community centres, trials for students in primary schools, and train-the-trainer workshops for primary school teachers and social workers at non-governmental organisations, as well as running a “$mart Money Management Experiential Centre” at PMQ during the festive season.\n\nThe HKMA’s first financial education board game, “$mart Money Management 321”, and the “$mart Money Management Experiential Centre” receive several international design awards\n\nFollowing its launch at the Hong Kong Book Fair, the board game is promoted through train-the-trainer workshops, student trial sessions and an experiential centre at PMQ\n\nThe HKMA also collaborated with different stakeholders in a number of community engagement programmes. One of these was the second phase of a cross-generation outreach educational programme, organised jointly with an educational institution. It included a bank simulation game along with talks targeting kindergarten students, their parents and teachers, and young adults.\n\nThe HKMA continued to support the work of the Investor and Financial Education Council in promoting financial literacy and financial capacity in Hong Kong. It will explore further collaboration with different stakeholders to maximise the impact of its community engagement work.\n\n# Financial disclosure\n\nTo maintain a high level of transparency, the HKMA adopts international standards in financial disclosure insofar as they are applicable to central banking operations. These include the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and other applicable reporting requirements, such as the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard. The Finance Division works with external auditors and other accounting professionals to prepare and present the Exchange Fund’s financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards. The HKMA also provides detailed disclosures and thorough analyses of a wide range of expense items and budgetary information in its Annual Report.\n\n# Accountability and controls\n\n# Risk management\n\nOne of the HKMA’s most important tasks is to manage risks to the monetary and banking systems. Risk management is undertaken both at a working level in its day-to-day operations, and at a higher level through strategic planning. Two high-level committees, the Macro Surveillance Committee and the Risk Committee, operate under the HKMA’s risk management framework. Both are chaired by the Chief Executive of the

理財321」，該遊戲由金管局與一間專注於桌遊製作的社會企業聯合設計及開發。遊戲旨在透過模擬環境，協助小學學生學習不同支付方式、理財概念、金融科技及網路安全知識。\n\n金管局在2023年香港書展設攤位推廣該桌遊，該遊戲成為書展中最暢銷的產品之一。此外，金管局舉辦了一系列免費宣傳活動，包括在社區中心舉辦工作坊、為小學學生提供試玩機會、為小學教師及非政府組織的社工舉辦導師培訓工作坊，以及在PMQ於節日期間營運「$mart 理財體驗中心」。\n\n金管局首個金融教育桌遊「$mart 理財321」及「$mart 理財體驗中心」獲多項國際設計大獎。\n\n該桌遊在香港書展推出後，透過導師培訓工作坊、學生試玩環節及PMQ的體驗中心進行推廣。\n\n金管局亦與不同利害關係人合作，推行多項社區聯繫計畫。其中一項是與教育機構聯合舉辦的跨世代教育推廣計畫第二階段，包括銀行模擬遊戲及針對幼稚園學生、家長、教師及青少年的講座。\n\n金管局繼續支持投資者及理財教育委員會在香港推廣金融知識及提升金融能力的工作。金管局將與不同利害關係人探索進一步合作，以最大化其社區聯繫工作的成效。\n\n# 財務披露\n\n為維持高度的透明度，金管局在財務披露方面採用適用於中央銀行運作的國際標準，包括香港財務報告準則及其他適用報告要求，如國際貨幣基金組織的特別數據發佈標準。財務部與外部審計師及其他會計專業人士合作，按照香港財務報告準則編製及呈交外匯基金的財務報表。金管局亦在年報中提供詳盡的披露及深入分析，涵蓋廣泛的開支項目及預算資訊。\n\n# 問責及監控\n\n# 風險管理\n\n金管局最重要的任務之一是管理貨幣及銀行體系的風險。風險管理在日常運作層面及策略規劃層面均進行，後者屬更高層次。金管局的風險管理框架下設有兩個高層委員會，分別為宏觀監測委員會及風險委員會，兩者均由金管局行政總裁擔任主席。"}
{"en":"# The Exchange Fund\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 211 to 311, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2023, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including material accounting policy information.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2023, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards. My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report. I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises all the information included in the 2023 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. I also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and\n- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nProf. LAM Chi Yuen Nelson\nDirector of Audit\n\n# 1 PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES\n\nThe Monetary Authority, under delegated authority from the Financial Secretary as Controller of the Exchange Fund (the Fund), manages the Fund in accordance with the provisions of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66). The principal activities of the Fund are safeguarding the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong and maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems.\n\nThe assets of the Fund are managed as four portfolios: the Backing Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio and the Strategic Portfolio. The assets of the Backing Portfolio fully match the Monetary Base, under Hong Kong’s Currency Board system. The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The Long-Term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments. The Strategic Portfolio holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited acquired by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government for the account of the Fund for strategic purposes. Operating segment information is set out in note 31.\n\n# 2 MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n# 2.1 Statement of compliance\n\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRSs), which is a collective term that includes all applicable individual HKFRSs, Hong Kong Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), and accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong. Material accounting policies adopted by the Fund and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) is set out below.\n\nThe HKICPA has issued certain new or revised HKFRSs that are first effective or available for early adoption for the current accounting period of the Group. Note 3 provides information on the changes, if any, in accounting policies resulting from initial application of these developments to the extent that they are relevant to the Group for the current and prior accounting periods reflected in these financial statements.\n\n# 2.2 Basis of preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe Group financial statements include the financial statements of the Group as well as the Group’s interests in associates and joint ventures. The principal activities of the principal subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are shown in notes 16 and 17.\n\nThe measurement basis used in the preparation of the financial statements is historical cost except for the following assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value:\n- derivative financial instruments (note 2.6);\n- financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value through income and expenditure account (note 2.6);\n- financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (note 2.6);\n- gold (note 2.10); and\n- investment properties (note 2.11).\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with HKFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nJudgements made by management in the application of HKFRSs that have significant effect on the financial statements and major sources of estimation uncertainty are disclosed in note 2.18.\n\nCertain comparative figures have been restated to conform to the current year presentation of the Group financial statements.\n\n# 2.3 Subsidiaries and non-controlling interests\n\nA subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. When assessing whether the Group has power, only substantive rights (held by the Group and other parties) are

匯豐基金\n\n# 審計總監報告\n\n# 獨立核數師致財政司司長的報告\n\n# 意見\n\n我已審核第 211 至 311 頁所載的匯豐基金及其附屬公司（簡稱「集團」）的財務報表，其中包括匯豐基金及集團截至 2023 年 12 月 31 日的資產負債表，以及該年度的收支帳目、全面收益表、權益變動表和現金流量表，還有財務報表附註，包括重要會計政策資訊。\n\n我認為，該財務報表根據香港會計師公會（HKICPA）頒布的《香港財務報告準則》（HKFRSs），真實而公允地反映了該基金及集團截至 2023 年 12 月 31 日的財務狀況，以及該年度的財務表現和現金流量，並已按照行政長官根據《匯豐基金條例》（第 66 章）第 7 條發出的指示妥善編製。\n\n# 意見依據\n\n我依據行政長官根據《匯豐基金條例》第 7 條發出的指示及審計委員會的審計準則進行審計。我根據這些準則所承擔的責任，在我報告的「審計師對財務報表審計的責任」一節中作了進一步說明。我依據這些準則獨立於集團之外，並已履行了根據這些準則所承擔的其他道德責任。我相信我所獲得的審計證據是充分而適當的，為我發表意見提供了基礎。\n\n# 主要審計事項\n\n主要審計事項是指我在專業判斷中認為對我審計 2023 年 12 月 31 日止年度財務報表最具重要性的事項。這些事項是在我審計整個財務報表的背景下進行處理的，並在形成我的意見時予以考慮，我不對這些事項單獨發表意見。\n\n# 其他資訊\n\n其他資訊由金融管理局負責。其他資訊包括香港金融管理局 2023 年年報中包含的所有資訊，但不包括財務報表及我就該報表出具的核數師報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見不涵蓋其他資訊，我亦不對其他資訊發表任何形式的保證結論。\n\n在審計財務報表的過程中，我的責任是閱讀其他資訊，並考慮其他資訊是否與財務報表或我在審計中獲得的知識存在重大不一致，或是否似乎存在重大錯報。如果我根據所進行的工作得出結論，認為其他資訊存在重大錯報，我有責任報告該事實。在這一方面，我沒有任何需要報告的事項。\n\n# 金融管理局及匯豐基金諮詢委員會審計小組委員會對財務報表的責任\n\n金融管理局負責根據香港會計師公會頒布的 HKFRSs 及行政長官根據《匯豐基金條例》第 7 條發出的指示，編製真實而公允的財務報表，並負責建立金融管理局認為必要的內部控制，以使編製的財務報表不存在因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯報。\n\n在編製財務報表時，金融管理局負責評估集團作為持續經營實體的能力，酌情披露與持續經營有關的事項，並採用持續經營的會計基礎。\n\n匯豐基金諮詢委員會審計小組委員會負責監督集團的財務報告流程。\n\n# 審計師對財務報表審計的責任\n\n我的目標是取得合理保證，以確定財務報表整體是否不存在因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯報，並出具包含我意見的審計師報告。合理保證是高水平的保證，但並不能保證按照審計委員會審計準則進行的審計在存在重大錯報時總能發現錯報。錯報可能因欺詐或錯誤而產生，如果錯報個別或合計起來可能影響用戶依據這些財務報表作出的經濟決策，則被認為是重大的。\n\n作為按照審計委員會審計準則進行審計的一部分，我在整個審計過程中運用專業判斷並保持職業懷疑態度。我還：\n\n- 識別和評估財務報表中因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯報風險，設計和執行回應這些風險的審計程序，並取得充分而適當的審計證據，作為我發表意見的基礎。未能發現因欺詐而導致的重大錯報的風險高於未能發現因錯誤而導致的重大錯報的風險，因為欺詐可能涉及串通、偽造、故意遺漏、虛假陳述或凌駕於內部控制之上。\n- 取得對與審計相關的內部控制的了解，以設計適當的審計程序，但目的並非對集團的內部控制有效性發表意見。\n- 評估金融管理局所採用的會計政策的適當性、會計估計的合理性及相關披露的恰當性。\n- 就金融管理局採用持續經營會計基礎的適當性作出結論，並根據所獲取的審計證據，確定是否存在與可能對集團作為持續經營實體的能力產生重大疑慮的事件或情況相關的重大不確定性。如果我得出結論認為存在重大不確定性，我有責任在審計師報告中提請注意財務報表中的相關披露，或如果披露不充分，則修改我的意見。我的結論是基於截至我出具審計師報告之日所獲取的審計證據。然而，未來的事件或情況可能導致集團無法繼續作為持續經營實體。\n- 評估財務報表的整體呈現方式、結構和內容，包括披露，以及財務報表是否以實現公允呈現的方式反映了基礎交易和事件。\n- 取得關於集團內實體或業務活動的財務資訊的充分而適當的審計證據，以對財務報表發表意見。我負責指導、監督和執行集團審計工作，並對我的審計意見負有唯一責任。\n\n我就審計的計劃範圍和時間安排及重大審計發現等事項，與匯豐基金諮詢委員會審計小組委員會進行溝通，包括我在審計過程中識別的任何重大內部控制缺陷。\n\n我還向匯豐基金諮詢委員會審計小組委員會提供一份聲明，表明我已遵守有關獨立性的相關道德要求，並向其溝通所有可能合理地認為與我的獨立性有關的關係和其他事項，以及在適用情況下，相關的保障措施。\n\n從與匯豐基金諮詢委員會審計小組委員會溝通的事項中，我確定了在本期財務報表審計中最為重要的事項，因此這些事項是主要審計事項。我會在我的審計師報告中描述這些事項，除非法律或法規禁止公開披露該事項，或在極為罕見的情況下，我確定某事項不應在我的報告中溝通，因為這樣做的不利後果可能合理地預期會超過此類溝通的公共利益。\n\n林志遠教授  Nelson\n審計總監\n\n# 1 主要活動\n\n金融管理局根據財政司司長作為匯豐基金（簡稱「基金」）監管人的授權，按照《匯豐基金條例》（第 66 章）的規定管理基金。基金的主要活動是保障香港貨幣的匯率穩定，以及維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定和健全。\n\n基金的資產分為四個投資組合管理：支持組合、投資組合、長期增長組合和策略組合。根據香港貨幣委員會制度，支持組合的資產與貨幣基礎完全匹配。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織（OECD）成員國的債券和股票市場。長期增長組合持有私募股權和房地產投資。策略組合持有香港交易所股份有限公司的股份，該股份由香港特別行政區政府為基金的策略目的而購入。營運分部資訊載於附註 31。\n\n# 2 重要會計政策\n\n# 2.1 遵守聲明\n\n這些財務報表是按照《香港財務報告準則》（HKFRSs）編製的，該準則是一個統稱，包括所有適用的個別 HKFRSs、香港會計師公會（HKICPA）頒布的香港會計準則和詮釋，以及在香港普遍接受的會計原則。基金及其附屬公司（統稱「集團」）所採納的重要會計政策如下所述。\n\n香港會計師公會已頒布某些新的或經修訂的 HKFRSs，這些準則首次生效或可供集團在本會計期間提前採用。附註 3 提供了有關會計政策變化的資訊（如有），這些變化是由於初步應用這些發展而產生的，且與集團在本財務報表所反映的當前及前期會計期間相關。\n\n# 2.2 編製財務報表的基礎\n\n集團財務報表包括集團的財務報表以及集團在聯營公司和合營企業中的權益。主要附屬公司、聯營公司和合營企業的主要活動載於附註 16 和 17。\n\n編製財務報表時所採用的計量基礎是歷史成本，但下列資產和負債除外，它們按公允價值計量：\n- 衍生金融工具（附註 2.6）\n- 通過收支帳目按公允價值計量的金融資產和金融負債（附註 2.6）\n- 通過其他全面收益按公允價值計量的金融資產（附註 2.6）\n- 金屬（附註 2.10）\n- 投資物業（附註 2.11）\n\n按照 HKFRSs 編製財務報表要求管理層作出判斷、估計和假設，這些判斷、估計和假設影響政策的適用及所報告的資產、負債、收入和支出的金額。估計和相關假設是基於歷史經驗和其他因素，這些因素在當時情況下被認為是合理的，其結果構成對資產和負債的賬面價值作出判斷的基礎，而這些賬面價值從其他來源並不明顯可見。實際結果可能與這些估計不同。\n\n估計和基本假設是持續檢討的。會計估計的修訂在修訂估計的期間內予以確認，如果修訂僅影響該期間；或在修訂期間及未來期間予以確認，如果修訂同時影響當前及未來期間。\n\n管理層在應用 HKFRSs 時所作的判斷，如對財務報表有重大影響及估計不確定性的主要來源，在附註 2.18 中披露。\n\n某些比較數字已重新列報，以符合本年度集團財務報表的列報方式。\n\n# 2.3 附屬公司及非控股權益\n\n附屬公司是集團控制下的實體。當集團因參與某實體而面臨或享有可變回報，且有能力通過對該實體的權力影響這些回報時，集團即控制該實體。在評估集團是否具有權力時，僅考慮集團及其他方所持有的實質性權利。"}

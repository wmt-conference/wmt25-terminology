{"en":"# Chief Executive’s Statement\n\nIn 2017, the global economy and financial markets performed much better than expected: the real economy saw steady growth; inflation remained subdued; the three interest rate hikes and the reduction in the balance sheet by the US Federal Reserve during the year did not result in capital outflows from emerging market economies or a strengthening of the US dollar. Amid bullish sentiment, global stock markets, including the three major US stock indices, kept hitting new highs. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index surged by 34%. The Hang Seng Index gained nearly 8,000 points (or 36%) in 2017 and surpassed the 30,000-point level to reach an all-time high in January 2018.\n\nMany investors were filled with optimism, even exuberance, in such a favourable environment. However, this was until early February this year when the latest data showed a higher than expected wage increase in the US, prompting investors to reappraise inflation risks and triggering significant corrections to global stock markets. The Dow Jones Index fell more than 1,000 points in two days during the second week of February, and the Hang Seng Index dropped more than 3,000 points in the same week. The 10-year US Treasury yield surged to as high as 2.95%. The swift reversal of fund flows indicated that the record high market valuation was not built on a solid foundation. It also reminded us of the importance of a sound and robust financial system for Hong Kong to meet the challenges brought by asset market volatility and capital outflows.\n\n# Banking system resilience boosted by precautionary measures\n\nAs the saying goes, “prevention is better than cure”. The HKMA implemented further risk mitigation measures in 2017 to safeguard the stability of Hong Kong’s banking and financial systems. In May, we introduced the eighth round of countercyclical measures for banks’ mortgage loans and strengthened banks’ credit risk management on lending to property developers, with the aim of enhancing the banking system’s resilience to shocks arising from any downturn in the property market. With the several rounds of measures, the average loan-to-value ratio of new residential mortgage loans fell to 49% at the end of 2017 from 64% in September 2009, while the average debt servicing ratio also declined to 35% from 41% in August 2010.\n\nIn 2017, we established the Resolution Office to implement international standards on the resolution of non-viable financial institutions that are considered “too big to fail”. This will help prevent a recurrence of a global financial crisis similar to the one in 2008 where public money was used to save failing financial institutions, and will minimise the impact of their closures on the financial system, the economy and the community at large.\n\nRobust risk management is the cornerstone of steady and sustainable development of the banking sector. The liquidity ratio and capital adequacy ratio of Hong Kong’s banking system are well above the applicable statutory requirements and among the highest in the world. This undoubtedly reflects the high resilience of Hong Kong’s banking system. Indeed, the banking sector registered strong growth in 2017, with total loans increasing by 16%, while the asset quality also held up well. The classified loan ratio of retail banks fell to 0.54% from 0.72% in 2016, well below the long-term average of 2.2% since 2000. The banking industry’s overall return on equity (based on pre-tax operating profits) reached 11.74% in 2017, a very healthy level compared with other international financial centres.\n\n# Sound banking the key to long-term financial stability\n\nThe 2008 global financial crisis revealed the limitations of relying solely on rules and regulations to restrain the financial industry from pursuing profitability without regard to their primary responsibilities. In light of this, the HKMA has stepped up the promotion of “sound banking” practices in recent years, encouraging banks to develop and pursue good corporate culture and values. In particular, to address the issue of bank staff pursuing short-term profits at the expense of the long-term interests of their customers or banks, we are encouraging banks to put in place appropriate incentive systems that are in line with their corporate culture and values. As part of this campaign, we arranged the inaugural Annual Conference for Independent Non-Executive Directors (INEDs) in March 2017 to highlight the importance of establishing a good banking culture and to empower the INEDs to perform their oversight and monitoring roles more effectively.\n\nWith the support of the banking industry, 2017 was a successful year for the HKMA in the advancement of financial inclusion. Six physical bank branches and three mobile branches began operating in remote areas. The Hong Kong Association of Banks worked out an arrangement with EPS and a convenience store chain to launch a pilot scheme allowing the elderly to withdraw cash from the stores in remote areas without the need to make purchases. Hongkong Post is also launching this year a cash withdrawal service for the elderly at seven Post Offices mainly on outlying islands and in the New Territories. Regarding account opening, the HKMA last year set up a webpage and an email account with a dedicated team to follow up public enquiries or complaints relating to the opening of bank accounts. Thanks to the concerted efforts of various stakeholders, there has been a significant improvement in customer experience in opening individual and corporate bank accounts.\n\n# Fintech a game changer for the banking industry\n\nIn an era of rapid technological advancement, fintech has been gradually integrated into our daily lives. In this ever changing technological environment, banks must embrace new developments and pursue innovation in their application of fintech. With the new era of Smart Banking, the HKMA launched seven initiatives in September (see page 106 for details) promoting the adoption of fintech in banking to improve the quality of banking products and services for customers. While these initiatives are independent of one another, they are complementary and will be a game changer for the future landscape of payment and banking services in Hong Kong. Customers will not only enjoy more convenient, efficient and secure payment and banking services, they will also have more choices and greater control over their financial transactions. Fintech will be the key to banks’ future business success, and moving into the new era of Smart Banking will be a great opportunity for the banks to upgrade and transform themselves.\n\n# Enormous opportunities created by the Belt and Road and the Bay Area Initiatives\n\nWith competition among international financial centres becoming more intense, a diversified financial industry is of paramount importance to Hong Kong. In 2017, the HKMA stepped up its work on enhancing Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre. Given Hong Kong’s unparalleled advantage of “having the Mainland as our hinterland while maintaining an international outlook”, the Belt and Road Initiative and the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Bay Area (Bay Area) will offer enormous opportunities for the financial and banking sectors and give new impetus to the economic growth of Hong Kong. The HKMA Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office, which was established in response to the Belt and Road Initiative, saw the number of its partners grow to around 90 since launch, laying a solid foundation for promoting Hong Kong as a financing hub for infrastructure investments. The issuance of the first Belt and Road bond in Hong Kong by the China Development Bank in 2017 highlighted the pivotal role Hong Kong can play in facilitating the financing of these infrastructure projects.\n\nIn addition to infrastructure financing, we are actively involved in the development of Hong Kong as a hub for corporate treasury centres, private equity funds and Asian derivatives businesses, by attracting multinational corporations and major financial institutions to manage their funds, assets and various financial risks in the city. These initiatives will further consolidate and upgrade Hong Kong’s financial and related professional services sectors. The HKMA also maintains close dialogue with the relevant authorities responsible for the development of the Bay Area to strengthen collaboration with a view to contributing to the financial development of the area as a world-class city cluster.\n\nOver the years, Hong Kong’s financial industry has been developing under the theme of “leveraging Hong Kong’s advantages, meeting the country’s needs”. With the introduction of the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect in 2014, the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect in 2016 and the Northbound Trading of Bond Connect in July last year, the mutual market access between the Mainland and the rest of the world through Hong Kong’s financial platform has been expanded from stock markets to bond markets. This underscores Hong Kong’s unique role as a financial intermediary in facilitating global investors’ access to the Mainland’s financial markets. In 2017, Hong Kong maintained its position as the leading global hub for offshore renminbi business. Average daily turnover of the renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement system stood at RMB900 billion. In addition, according to SWIFT statistics, more than 70% of global renminbi payment transactions were handled through Hong Kong during the year. The offshore renminbi market continued to operate smoothly and develop steadily.\n\n# Nurturing talent to strengthen the soft power of the banking industry\n\nWith the continuing growth of the financial industry, nurturing talent is crucial to its sustainable development. The HKMA attaches great importance to the soft power of the banking industry, and we have been encouraging and supporting ongoing capacity building of banking practitioners. Following the introduction of two modules on anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism and cybersecurity under the Enhanced Competency Framework, we expanded its coverage last year by including retail wealth management and treasury management to enhance the level of core competence of banking practitioners through continuing professional development. The HKMA is also committed to nurturing young talent for the banking industry. In 2017, we launched the Pilot Apprenticeship Programme for Private Wealth Management and the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme in collaboration with the industry. Given the overwhelming response, the coverage of these programmes will be further expanded in the future.\n\n# Prudent investment strategy achieving a reasonable and stable return over the medium to long term\n\nOn the back of strong global economic growth, the Exchange Fund achieved a record high investment income of HK$264 billion last year with gains across the board, including equities, bonds and foreign exchange. The overall investment return was 7.4%. The Investment Portfolio achieved a rate of return of 12.1%, while the Backing Portfolio gained 1.8%. The Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP)’s annualised internal rate of return since its inception in 2009 reached as high as 13.7%. While the investment performance last year was satisfactory, the increasingly complex investment environment requires the HKMA to continue its prudent management of the Exchange Fund. We will remain agile and nimble, monitor market developments closely and deploy defensive measures as and when appropriate. Investments under the LTGP will also be further expanded. As always, the investment principle of “capital preservation first, long-term growth next” within acceptable risk levels will be adhered to when managing the wealth for the people of Hong Kong.\n\nWhile the global real economy is extending last year’s growth momentum, uncertainties and risks still abound in 2018. These include a faster-than-expected pace of US interest rate hikes in case inflation picks up, escalating trade frictions and a deteriorating geopolitical landscape. Should these downside risks materialise, they will have significant and widespread implications for global financial markets, and knock-on effects for Hong Kong’s fund flows, asset prices and real economy. It is therefore advisable that we should all manage the risks prudently.\n\nIn the coming months, it is likely Hong Kong dollar interest rate movements will remain in the spotlight. The US Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times since December 2015. With widening spreads between Hong Kong dollar interest rates and their US dollar counterparts, there is a greater incentive for funds to flow from the Hong Kong dollar into the US dollar. The Hong Kong dollar has been under weakening pressure recently and the 7.85 weak-side Convertibility Undertaking (CU) has been triggered. As we have repeatedly stated, when the 7.85 weak-side CU is triggered, the HKMA will act as a “super money changer” by buying Hong Kong dollars and selling US dollars in the market to ensure that the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate will not weaken beyond the 7.85 level. Such operations are normal and in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System. This should not cause any concern. Indeed, the Exchange Fund currently holds more than HK$4 trillion worth of assets, of which the Hong Kong dollar Monetary Base amounts to about HK$1.7 trillion, providing a strong buffer in the event of fund outflows. Over the years, the HKMA has put in place various lines of defence to safeguard the stability of the banking and financial systems. From a positive perspective, capital outflows will lead to a gradual increase in Hong Kong dollar interest rates, which will be conducive to the normalisation of the interest rate environment in Hong Kong and hence the sustainable development of the local economy and asset markets. During this process, the HKMA will stay vigilant and make every effort to maintain monetary and banking stability in Hong Kong.\n","terms":{"10 Years Plus Caring Organisation

行政總裁發言\n\n2017年，全球經濟和金融市場表現遠超預期：實體經濟穩步增長；通膨維持低檔；美國聯邦準備理事會（Fed）在當年三度升息並縮減資產負債表，並未導致新興市場經濟體的資本外流或美元升值。在全球市場氣氛樂觀的情況下，包括美國三大股市在內的全球股市屢創新高。MSCI新興市場指數急升34%。恒生指數在2017年上升近8,000點（或36%），並於2018年1月突破30,000點大關，創下歷史新高。\n\n在如此有利的環境下，許多投資者都感到樂觀，甚至興奮。然而，這種情況在今年2月初出現轉變，當時最新數據顯示美國薪資升幅高於預期，促使投資者重新評估通膨風險，並觸發全球股市大幅調整。在2月第二週，道瓊指數在兩天內下跌超過1,000點，恒生指數在同一週內下跌超過3,000點。美國十年期國庫債券收益率更升至2.95%的高位。資金流向迅速逆轉，反映市場估值創下歷史新高並非建基於穩固基礎之上。這也提醒我們，香港必須建立健全和穩固的金融體系，以應對資產市場波動和資本外流所帶來的挑戰。\n\n# 預防措施提升銀行體系的抗禦能力\n\n俗話說：「預防勝於治療」。金管局在2017年進一步採取風險管控措施，以保障香港銀行及金融體系的穩定。在5月，我們推出第八輪針對銀行按揭貸款的逆周期措施，並加強銀行對物業發展商貸款的信用風險管理，以提升銀行體系抵禦樓市下跌所帶來的衝擊的能力。經過多輪措施後，新造住宅按揭貸款的平均貸款與價值比率由2009年9月的64%降至2017年底的49%，而平均還款與收入比率亦由2010年8月的41%下降至35%。\n\n在2017年，我們成立處置機制辦公室，以落實國際訂立的標準，處理被視為「大到不能倒」的非可行金融機構。這將有助於防止重演2008年全球金融危機，當時動用公帑拯救瀕臨倒閉的金融機構，並可將這些機構倒閉對金融體系、經濟及社會整體所造成的影響減至最低。\n\n穩健的風險管理是銀行業穩步及可持續發展的基石。香港銀行體系的流動性比率及資本充足率均遠高於法定要求，並名列全球前茅。這無疑反映出香港銀行體系的抗禦能力極高。事實上，銀行業在2017年錄得強勁增長，貸款總額上升16%，而資產品質亦保持良好。零售銀行的不良貸款比率由2016年的0.72%降至0.54%，遠低於自2000年以來的長期平均值2.2%。銀行業的整體股東權益回報率（以除稅前營業利潤計算）在2017年達11.74%，與其它國際金融中心比較，屬非常健康的水平。\n\n# 穩健金融是長期金融穩定的關鍵\n\n2008年全球金融危機揭示了單靠規則和規管來約束金融業，使其在追求獲利時不忘其主要責任，存在局限性。有鑑於此，金管局近年來加大力度推廣「穩健金融」的實踐，鼓勵銀行建立和追求良好的企業文化和價值觀。尤其是為了解決銀行員工為追求短期利益而犧牲客戶或銀行的長遠利益的問題，我們鼓勵銀行建立與企業文化和價值觀相符的適當獎勵制度。作為這項工作的一部分，我們在2017年3月舉辦了首次獨立非執行董事年度會議，強調建立良好銀行文化的的重要性，並賦權予獨立非執行董事更有效地履行其監督和監察職責。\n\n在銀行業的支持下，金管局在2017年於推動金融普惠方面取得成功。六間實體銀行分行和三間流動銀行車開始在偏遠地區營運。香港銀行公會與易辦事及一間便利店連鎖店達成協議，推出試點計畫，讓長者在偏遠地區的便利店提取現金，無需進行任何購物。香港郵政亦在今年於七間主要位於離島及新界的郵政局為長者推出提款服務。在開戶方面，金管局去年設立了一個網頁和電郵帳戶，並成立專責小組跟進公眾有關開立銀行帳戶的查詢或投訴。在各持份者的共同努力下，客戶在開立個人及企業銀行帳戶方面的體驗有顯著改善。\n\n# 金融科技是銀行業的顛覆性力量\n\n在科技快速發展的時代，金融科技已逐漸融入我們的日常生活。在這個不斷變化的科技環境中，銀行必須擁抱新發展，並在應用金融科技方面追求創新。在智慧銀行新紀元，金管局在9月推出了七項措施（詳情見第106頁），以推動銀行業採用金融科技，提升為客戶提供的銀行產品及服務品質。雖然這些措施是獨立的，但它們是相輔相成的，並將顛覆香港未來的支付及銀行服務格局。客戶不僅將享有更便捷、高效和安全的支付及銀行服務，還將擁有更多選擇和更大的金融交易控制權。金融科技將是銀行未來業務成功的關鍵，邁向智慧銀行新紀元將是銀行升級和轉型的良機。\n\n# 「一帶一路」及「灣區」倡議創造龐大機遇\n\n隨著國際金融中心之間的競爭日趨激烈，多元化的金融業對香港至為重要。在2017年，金管局加大力度提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。鑑於香港擁有「以內地為腹地，面向國際」的獨特優勢，「一帶一路」倡議及粵港澳大灣區（灣區）的發展將為金融及銀行業帶來龐大機遇，並為香港經濟增長注入新動力。金管局為響應「一帶一路」倡議而成立的基建融資促進辦公室，自成立以來已吸引約90家夥伴加入，為推廣香港成為基建投資的融資樞紐奠下穩固基礎。國家開發銀行在2017年在香港發行首隻「一帶一路」債券，突顯了香港在促進這些基建項目融資方面可擔當的重要角色。\n\n除了基建融資外，我們亦積極參與將香港發展成為企業財資中心、私募基金中心及亞洲衍生工具業務中心的項目，吸引跨國企業及主要金融機構在香港管理其資金、資產及各類金融風險。這些措施將進一步鞏固和提升香港金融業及相關專業服務業。金管局亦與負責灣區發展的相關當局保持緊密對話，以加強合作，共同促進灣區發展成為世界級城市群，推動其金融發展。\n\n多年來，香港金融業的發展以「發揮香港優勢、服務國家所需」為主題。隨著滬港通在2014年、深港通在2016年以及債券通北向通在去年7月相繼推出，內地與世界其它地區透過香港金融平台進行的互聯互通，已從股市擴展至債市。這突顯了香港作為金融中介的獨特角色，促進全球投資者進入內地金融市場。在2017年，香港維持其作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的領先地位。人民幣即時支付結算系統的平均每日成交額達9,000億元人民幣。此外，根據SWIFT的統計數據，在2017年，全球超過70%的人民幣支付交易是透過香港處理。離岸人民幣市場繼續運作順暢，並穩步發展。\n\n# 培育人才以強化銀行業的軟實力\n\n隨著金融業的持續發展，培育人才對其可持續發展至為重要。金管局非常重視銀行業的軟實力，我們一直鼓勵及支持銀行從業人員持續提升能力。在推出資歷架構下的反洗錢、反恐怖融資及網絡安全兩個模組後，我們去年進一步擴展其涵蓋範圍，加入零售財富管理及財資管理，以透過持續的專業發展，提升銀行從業人員的核心能力水平。金管局亦致力為銀行業培育年輕人才。在2017年，我們與業界合作，推出私人財富管理人才培訓計畫試點計畫及金融科技人才培育計畫。鑑於反應熱烈，這些計畫的涵蓋範圍將進一步擴展。\n\n# 穩健的投資策略在中期至長期實現合理及穩定的回報\n\n在全球經濟強勁增長的帶動下，外匯基金去年的投資收入創下歷史新高，達2,640億港元，股票、債券及外匯等各項投資均錄得收益。整體投資回報率為7.4%。投資組合的回報率為12.1%，而支持組合則錄得1.8%的回報。長期增長組合自2009年成立以來，其年化內部回報率高達13.7%。雖然去年的投資表現令人滿意，但日益複雜的投資環境要求金管局繼續審慎管理外匯基金。我們將保持靈活敏捷，密切監察市場發展，並在適當時採取防禦措施。長期增長組合下的投資亦將進一步擴展。一如既往，在管理香港市民的財富時，我們將恪守「保本先行、長期增值」的投資原則，並把風險控制在可接受的水平內。\n\n雖然全球實體經濟延續去年的增長勢頭，但2018年仍存在不少不確定性和風險。這些風險包括美國通膨上升引致升息步伐快於預期、貿易摩擦加劇及地緣政治局勢惡化。若這些下行風險成為現實，將對全球金融市場造成重大和廣泛的影響，並對香港的資金流向、資產價格及實體經濟造成連鎖效應。因此，我們應審慎管理風險。\n\n在未來數月，港元利率走勢將繼續成為焦點。美國聯邦準備理事會自2015年12月以來已六次升息。隨著港元利率與美元利率的差距擴大，資金從港元流向美元的誘因增加。港元最近備受貶值壓力，弱方兌換保證匯率7.85已遭觸發。正如我們屢次表明，當弱方兌換保證匯率7.85遭觸發時，金管局會扮演「超級找換店」的角色，在市場買入港元、沽出美元，以確保港元匯率不會弱於7.85的水平。這些操作屬正常，並符合聯繫匯率制度的設計。這不應引起任何憂慮。事實上，外匯基金現時持有超過4萬億港元的資產，其中港元貨幣基礎約達1.7萬億港元，為資本外流提供強大緩衝。多年來，金管局已建立多道防線，以保障銀行及金融體系的穩定。從積極的角度看，資本外流將導致港元利率逐步上升，有利於香港利率環境正常化，從而促進本地經濟及資產市場的可持續發展。在這個過程中，金管局將保持警惕，並竭力維持香港的貨幣及銀行業穩定。"}
{"en":"# Highlights of 2017\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nThe Hong Kong economy grows at a faster pace on the back of synchronised expansion of the global economy. The local stock market rallies and residential property market maintains its upward momentum, while housing affordability stretches further.\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector remains safe and sound, with strong capital and liquidity positions and healthy asset quality.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar eases against the US dollar as a result of the widening negative interest rate spreads between the two currencies. Nevertheless, the public remains highly confident in the Linked Exchange Rate System.\n\nThe money markets continue to operate smoothly with ample interbank liquidity. The Base Rate in Hong Kong is adjusted upwards by a total of 75 basis points to 1.75%, in tandem with the increase in the target range for the US federal funds rate.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA places its supervisory focus on the effectiveness of banks’ risk governance framework, including credit, liquidity and technology risk management. The eighth round of countercyclical macroprudential measures is introduced to strengthen the resilience of the banking sector against any downturn in the property market.\n\nOn the policy side, substantial progress is made on the local implementation of international supervisory standards. The resolution regime comes into operation, establishing a new line of defence for banking stability. The Resolution Office is established as part of the HKMA’s efforts to make the resolution regime operational for the Hong Kong banking sector.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\nSeven new initiatives are introduced to embrace the enormous opportunities brought about by the convergence of banking and technology and to promote Hong Kong as a fintech hub in Asia. Hong Kong’s international profile as a financing hub for infrastructure investments is raised further, thanks to a series of efforts on network and capacity building.\n\nHong Kong maintains its leading position in offshore renminbi business. The launch of the Bond Connect reinforces Hong Kong’s role as the main gateway to opportunities in Mainland China.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\nBenefiting from a favourable investment environment, the Exchange Fund achieves a record high investment income of HK$264 billion, representing an investment return of 7.4%.\n\nEfforts on investment diversification continue, especially through the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The LTGP records an annualised internal rate of return of 13.7% since its inception in 2009.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communication with the community and the market through the media, public education programmes, and other various channels to facilitate public understanding of its policies and operations.\n\nThe HKMA continues to improve corporate governance by supporting professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline, and enhancing IT security to cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives and the increasing complexity of work.\n","terms":{"10 Years Plus Caring Organisation Logo":["10年Plus同心展關懷標誌"],"10-Year US Treasury yield":["10年期美國國庫券收益率"],"10-year US Treasury yield":["美國十年期國庫債券收益率"],"10th

經濟及金融環境\n\n在全球經濟同步擴張的帶動下，香港經濟增長加速。本地股市反彈，住宅物業市場維持上升趨勢，但置業負擔能力進一步惡化。\n\n香港銀行體系保持穩健，資本及流動性充裕，資產質素良好。\n\n# 貨幣穩定\n\n由於港元與美元之間的負利差擴大，港元兌美元匯率有所回落。然而，公眾對聯繫匯率制度仍保持高度信心。\n\n貨幣市場運作順暢，銀行同業流動資金充裕。香港基本利率共上調 75 個基點至 1.75%，與美國聯邦基金利率目標區間的上升幅度一致。\n\n# 銀行體系穩定\n\n金管局監督工作的焦點是銀行風險管治架構的有效性，包括信貸、流動性及科技風險管理。第八輪逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施已推出，以強化銀行體系抵禦樓市下滑的能力。\n\n在政策方面，本地落實國際監管標準的工作取得重大進展。處置機制已開始運作，為銀行體系穩定建立了一道新防線。金管局設立了處置機制辦公室，以確保處置機制在香港銀行體系中有效運作。\n\n# 國際金融中心\n\n推出七項新措施，以把握銀行業與科技結合所帶來的龐大機遇，並推動香港成為亞洲金融科技樞紐。香港作為基建投資融資中心的國際地位進一步提升，這歸功於一系列構建網絡及提升技能的努力。\n\n香港在離岸人民幣業務方面保持領先地位。「債券通」的推出強化了香港作為內地機遇主要門戶的角色。\n\n# 儲備管理\n\n受惠於有利的投資環境，外匯基金錄得創紀錄的投資收入 2,640 億港元，投資回報率為 7.4%。\n\n多元化投資的努力持續進行，尤其是透過「長期增長組合」（LTGP）。自 2009 年成立以來，LTGP 的年化內部回報率為 13.7%。\n\n#

{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nAgainst the backdrop of a more synchronised expansion of the global economy, Hong Kong saw faster economic growth, tighter labour market conditions and subdued inflationary pressures in 2017. Economic growth for 2018 is expected to remain solid.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Real activities\n\nAmid a more synchronised expansion of the global economy, the Hong Kong economy grew faster in 2017. Growth in real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increased to 3.8%, much higher than the 2.1% growth in 2016 and the long-term growth of about 3% over the past decade (Chart 1 and Table 1). Domestic demand firmed up, with private consumption growth accelerating and overall investment spending reviving. Stronger domestic demand reflected favourable job and income conditions, booming asset prices and improved business sentiment. Externally, Hong Kong’s exports of goods expanded at a faster pace due to increased global trade flows, and exports of services recovered because of vibrant trade and cargo flows and improving inbound tourism. Imports of goods recorded stronger growth on export-induced demand, and imports of services increased steadily amid strong travel interest among residents. On a net basis, the overall trade surplus shrank, making a negative contribution to GDP growth.\n\n\n# Monetary conditions\n\nOn the monetary front, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate generally eased against the US dollar driven primarily by interest rate arbitrage activities amid the negative interest rate differentials between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar. This reflected the normal functioning of the Linked Exchange Rate System in accordance with its design. While still at relatively low levels, Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates faced more upward pressures towards the end of 2017 due to Initial Public Offeringrelated funding demand and banks’ year-end liquidity needs. For credit growth, after two years of single-digit growth, total bank loans increased at a notably faster pace of 16.1% in 2017, reflecting improving economic conditions and positive financial market sentiment. Despite faster loan growth, there were no signs of loosening of banks’ credit underwriting standards, and overall loan quality remained good.\n\n# Inflation\n\nInflationary pressures remained well contained throughout 2017 (Chart 2). Netting out the effects of the Government’s one-off relief measures, the underlying inflation rate declined to 1.7%, down from 2.3% in 2016. In particular, the housing component of the price index increased at a milder pace, reflecting the filter-through of slower increases in fresh-letting private residential rentals in 2016. More broadly, milder increases in nominal wages and earnings amid strong output growth helped keep local cost pressures in check. Import price inflation was also tame, in line with low inflation in Hong Kong’s major import sources despite a weaker US dollar.\n\n# Labour market\n\nThe labour market tightened in 2017 along with above-par economic growth. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell from 3.4% in 2016 to 2.9% towards the end of 2017, below 3% for the first time in nearly 20 years (Chart 3). Most major economic sectors registered decreases in their respective unemployment rates, with more notable declines seen in the retail, financing and professional and business services sectors. As total employment grew faster and the number of private-sector vacancies picked up, overall labour demand continued to strengthen. The labour force also expanded, partly reflecting more active participation of older-age workers (aged 55 and above). Consistent with tighter labour market conditions and lower inflation, real wages and earnings saw faster increases.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe Hong Kong stock market had an almost uninterrupted rally in 2017. The Hang Seng Index rose by 36%, the largest annual gain since 2010 (Chart 4). The rally reflected optimism about the global economy and corporate earnings, and was in part supported by substantial fund inflows from Mainland investors through the Stock Connects. The Hang Seng Index hit a ten-year high in November and remained at high levels towards the end of 2017. Average daily turnover expanded to HK$88.3 billion from HK$66.9 billion in the previous year, and overall equity funds raised from the local market also increased to HK$581.4 billion, compared with HK$490.1 billion a year earlier.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market maintained its upward momentum throughout the year (Chart 4). Transaction volume expanded from 54,701 units a year ago to 61,591 units and housing prices increased by 14.8% in 2017. Housing affordability stretched further, with a price-toincome ratio of 16.4, higher than the previous peak in 1997, and an income-gearing ratio of 74.1, far above its long-term average.1 In view of rising property prices and the intensifying competition for mortgage business among banks, the HKMA introduced the eighth round of prudential measures in May to strengthen banks’ risk management and safeguard banking stability. Housing price growth moderated temporarily following these measures before accelerating in the fourth quarter. As for the commercial and industrial property markets, trading activities increased significantly during the year, with both transaction value and volume registering double-digit growth. With the pick-up in non-residential property prices, corresponding rental yields fell slightly compared to the previous year.\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nEconomic growth for 2018 is expected to remain solid. The Government forecasts growth in the range of 3–4%, while private-sector analysts project the economy to expand at an average rate of 3.2%. Externally, Hong Kong’s export performance will continue to benefit from the improving global growth outlook and the gradual recovery in inbound tourism. Domestically, private consumption growth is expected to hold up mainly as a result of favourable labour market conditions. As for fixed capital formation, building and construction activity should progress steadily on the back of rising housing supply and continuing infrastructure projects. While improved economic conditions will support business capital spending, headwinds may come from potential rises in interest rates.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nWith still-moderate global inflation and steady increase in local costs, inflationary pressures in Hong Kong are anticipated to remain moderate in 2018, but the inflation rate is likely to pick up gradually from the low in 2017. For example, the rental component of inflation may gather momentum in the latter part of 2018 because of feedthrough from increases in fresh-letting private residential rentals. Market consensus predicts the headline inflation rate to be a still-moderate 2.2% for 2018, and the Government projects the underlying inflation rate to be 2.5%. On the other hand, sustained economic growth, expanding building and construction activity and the gradual recovery in inbound tourism are expected to keep the labour market tight in the near future. Private-sector analysts forecast the unemployment rate to stay at about 3.0% in 2018.\n\n# Uncertainties and risks\n\nThe economic outlook for 2018 is subject to a number of uncertainties and risks including those relating to major central banks’ monetary policy normalisation and global financial market stability, as well as heightened protectionist sentiment and deteriorating geopolitical tensions. In particular, if such risks materialise to trigger reversal of fund flows in Hong Kong, local monetary conditions could tighten faster than expected, putting downward pressures on the real economy and asset prices.\n\nThe outlook for the residential property market remains uncertain. In the near term, the current favourable domestic economic conditions, perceived housing shortage, low mortgage rates and alternative sources of home financing (including mortgage loans provided by property developers and financial support from parents), will continue to support the demand for properties. However, the recent sell-off in global financial markets may dampen sentiments. Over the longer term, the property market will continue to face a number of headwinds. In particular, as the US monetary policy normalisation continues, domestic mortgage rates will rise eventually. In addition, on the back of the Government’s effort to increase the supply of land and residential properties, the housing demand-supply gap is expected to narrow gradually, which would ease the upward pressure on property prices in the longer term.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector continued to be safe and sound in 2017 notwithstanding uncertainties surrounding the global economy. The capital and liquidity positions of authorized institutions (AIs) remained strong, asset quality stayed at healthy levels, and profitability improved notably thanks to increased interest margins and robust credit growth.\n\n# Interest rate trends\n\nAs the US interest rate normalisation continued, the onemonth and three-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) fixings increased by 49 basis points and 39 basis points respectively in 2017. More notable rises were observed in the fourth quarter. Nevertheless, the Hong Kong dollar funding cost of retail banks, as measured by the composite interest rate, remained broadly stable over the year (Chart 5).\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe aggregate pre-tax operating profits of retail banks’ Hong Kong offices grew by 15.8% in 2017. The improved performance was mainly due to increases in net interest income (+20.3%) and fee and commission income (+9.4%). However, these increases were partially offset by a decline in income from foreign exchange and derivatives operations (-29.9%) and a growth in operating expenses (+8.4%). The aggregate post-tax profit of retail banks dropped by 18.1% because of certain non-recurring items recorded in 2016. The post-tax return on average assets of retail banks dropped to 1.07% from 1.44% in 2016 (Chart 6).\n\nRetail banks’ net interest margin widened to 1.45% in 2017 from 1.32% in 2016 (Chart 7) mainly due to rising market interest rates.\n\nThe proportion of retail banks’ non-interest income to total operating income decreased to 40% from 44.3% in 2016. While fee and commission income increased by 9.4%, income originated from foreign exchange and derivatives operations dropped by 29.9%.\n\nRetail banks’ cost-to-income ratio declined to 41.9% in 2017 from 43.2% in 2016, as operating costs (+8.4%) increased at a slower pace than operating income (+11.8%) (Chart 8). Retail banks’ loan impairment charges decreased to HK$7.3 billion from HK$8 billion in 2016.\n\n# Asset quality\n\nLoan quality of retail banks improved during the year, with the classified loan ratio decreasing to 0.54% from 0.72% a year earlier. The overdue and rescheduled loan ratio also decreased to 0.4% from 0.53% in 2016 (Chart 9). Similarly, the classified loan ratio and the overdue and rescheduled loan ratio of the whole banking sector decreased to 0.67% and 0.52%, from 0.85% and 0.67% respectively.\n\nThe quality of banks’ residential mortgage lending portfolios remained good, with the delinquency ratio staying at a low level of 0.03% at the end of 2017 (Chart 10). The rescheduled loan ratio was close to 0%. There was no residential mortgage loan in negative equity at the end of the year, as compared with four cases a year ago.\n\nThe delinquency ratio of credit card lending stayed low at 0.22% at the end of 2017, compared with 0.24% a year ago (Chart 10). The combined delinquent and rescheduled loan ratio edged down to 0.31% from 0.33% during the period. The charge-off ratio also fell slightly to 1.75% from 1.92% in 2016.\n\n# Balance sheet trends\n\nTotal loans of the banking sector grew by 16.1% in 2017, compared with 6.5% in 2016. Demand for credit increased, driven by optimism about the global economic outlook. As total deposits increased at a slower pace than total loans, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio rose to 73% at the end of 2017 from 68.4% a year earlier. The Hong Kong-dollar loan-to-deposit ratio also increased to 82.7% from 77.1% during the same period (Chart 11).\n\nMainland-related lending (including loans booked in Mainland subsidiaries of locally incorporated banks) increased by 17.5% in 2017, compared with a growth of 7% recorded in 2016.\n\n# Holdings of negotiable debt securities\n","terms":{"10 Years Plus Caring Organisation

經濟及金融環境\n\n在全球經濟更同步擴張的背景下，香港在2017年錄得更快的經濟增長、更緊繃的勞動市場狀況及溫和的通膨壓力。預期2018年的經濟增長將保持穩健。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 實質活動\n\n在全球經濟更同步擴張的帶動下，香港經濟在2017年錄得更快的增長。本地生產總值（GDP）的實質增幅升至3.8%，遠高於2016年的2.1%及過去十年的長期增幅約3%（圖1及表1）。本地需求穩健，私人消費增長加快，整體投資支出回升。本地需求強勁反映出就業和收入情況良好、資產價格上升及營商氣氛改善。對外方面，由於全球貿易流量增加，香港的貨品出口錄得較快增長；服務輸出亦因貿易和貨運暢旺及訪港旅遊業改善而復甦。由於出口帶動需求，貨品進口錄得較大增幅；在居民出遊意願強勁下，服務進口亦穩步上升。在淨額基礎上計算，整體貿易順差收窄，對GDP增長的貢獻為負。\n\n# 貨幣狀況\n\n在貨幣方面，港元匯率對美元普遍有所回軟，主因是港元與美元的利息差為負值，引致套息活動。這反映聯繫匯率制度按其設計正常運作。港元銀行同業拆息在2017年年底仍處於相對低水平，但受新股集資相關的資金需求及銀行年底流動性需求所影響，面對較大的上升壓力。在信貸增長方面，銀行貸款總額在連續兩年錄得個位數增長後，於2017年顯著加快至16.1%，反映經濟情況改善及金融市場氣氛正面。儘管貸款增速加快，但並無跡象顯示銀行的信貸審批標準有所放寬，整體貸款質素仍然良好。\n\n# 通膨\n\n通膨壓力在2017年全年維持輕微（圖2）。扣除政府一次性紓困措施的影響後，基本通膨率由2016年的2.3%下降至1.7%。尤其是價格指數中的住屋部分升幅較溫和，反映2016年私人住宅新租約租金升幅放緩的滲透效應。更廣泛而言，在產出強勁增長的同時，名義工資及收益升幅較溫和，有助控制本地成本壓力。進口貨品通膨亦維持溫和，與香港主要進口來源地的低通膨情況相符，而這情況並未因美元轉弱而改變。\n\n# 勞動市場\n\n在經濟增長強勁下，勞動市場在2017年進一步趨緊。經季節性調整的失業率由2016年的3.4%下降至2017年年底的2.9%，是近20年以來首次低於3%（圖3）。大部分主要經濟行業的失業率均見下跌，當中以零售、金融及專業及商用服務業的跌幅較為顯著。由於總就業人數增速加快及私人機構職位空缺有所增加，整體勞動需求持續增強。勞動人口亦見上升，部分反映年長勞工（55歲及以上）的參與率增加。在勞動市場情況趨緊及通膨偏低下，實質工資及收益錄得較快增幅。\n\n# 股市\n\n香港股市在2017年幾乎持續上揚。恒生指數上升36%，是2010年以來最大的年度升幅（圖4）。股市上揚反映市場對全球經濟及企業盈利的樂觀情緒，部分亦受惠於內地投資者透過滬港通及深港通帶來的大量資金流入。恒生指數在11月升至十年高位，並在2017年年底維持在高水平。平均每日成交額由去年的669億元增至883億元，而本地市場集資總額亦由去年的4,901億元增至5,814億元。\n\n# 房地產市場\n\n住宅物業市場在全年維持上升勢頭（圖4）。成交量由去年的54,701宗增至61,591宗，而房價在2017年上升14.8%。置業負擔能力進一步緊張，房價與收入比率升至16.4，高於1997年的上一次高峰，而收入槓桿比率亦升至74.1，遠高於其長期平均水平。1 鑑於房價上升及銀行在按揭業務方面競爭日趨激烈，金管局在五月推出第八輪逆周期監管措施，以強化銀行的風險管理及保障銀行體系穩定。在推出措施後，房價升幅曾一度放緩，但在第四季再度加快。至於工商物業市場，買賣活動在年內顯著增加，成交量及成交額均錄得雙位數增長。隨著非住宅物業價格上升，相應的租金收益率較去年略為下跌。\n\n# 經濟展望\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n預期2018年的經濟增長將保持穩健。政府預測增長介乎3%至4%之間，而民間機構分析師則預計經濟平均增長3.2%。對外方面，香港的出口表現將繼續受惠於全球經濟增長前景改善及訪港旅遊業逐步復甦。在本地方面，私人消費增長預期維持穩健，主因是勞動市場情況良好。至於固定資本形成，在房屋供應增加及基建項目持續進行的帶動下，樓宇及建造活動應會穩步發展。雖然經濟情況改善將支持企業資本支出，但利率可能上升或會構成阻力。\n\n# 通膨及勞動市場\n\n在全球通膨維持溫和及本地成本穩步上升下，預期香港在2018年的通膨壓力將維持溫和，但通膨率可能由2017年的低位逐步回升。例如，由於私人住宅新租約租金上升的滲透效應，通膨中的租金部分在2018年下半年或會加快升勢。市場普遍預期2018年的整體通膨率仍維持在溫和的2.2%，而政府則預測基本通膨率為2.5%。另一方面，經濟持續增長、樓宇及建造活動擴張及訪港旅遊業逐步復甦，預期將令勞動市場在短期內維持緊繃。民間機構分析師預測2018年的失業率將維持在約3.0%。\n\n# 不確定因素及風險\n\n2018年的經濟展望面臨多項不確定因素及風險，包括主要央行貨幣政策正常化及全球金融市場穩定的情況，以及保護主義情緒升溫及地緣政治緊張局勢惡化。尤其是，若這些風險成為現實，引致香港資金流向逆轉，本地貨幣狀況可能比預期更快收緊，對實體經濟及資產價格構成下跌壓力。\n\n住宅物業市場的前景仍然不明朗。在短期內，現時有利的本地經濟情況、房屋供應短缺的觀感、低按揭利率及置業所需資金的其他來源（包括由物業發展商提供的按揭貸款及父母的財務支持），將繼續支持樓宇需求。然而，全球金融市場近期的沽售潮或會影響市場情緒。在較長遠而言，樓市將繼續面對多項阻力。尤其是，隨著美國貨幣政策正常化持續，本地按揭利率最終會上升。此外，在政府增加土地及房屋供應的努力下，房屋供求缺口預期會逐步收窄，長遠而言將舒緩房價的上升壓力。\n\n# 銀行業表現\n\n儘管全球經濟存在不明朗因素，香港銀行體系在2017年繼續保持穩健。認可機構的資本及流動性狀況維持強健，資產質素保持良好，而盈利能力亦顯著改善，主因是息差擴大及信貸增長強勁。\n\n# 利率走勢\n\n隨著美國利率正常化持續，香港銀行同業拆息在2017年上升，當中一個月及三個月拆息分別上升49基點及39基點，第四季的升幅更為顯著。然而，以綜合利率衡量，零售銀行的港元資金成本在年內大致維持穩定（圖5）。\n\n# 盈利能力走勢\n\n零售銀行香港辦事處的除稅前經營溢利總額在2017年上升15.8%。業績改善主要是由於淨利息收入（+20.3%）及費用和佣金收入（+9.4%）增加。然而，這些增幅部分被外匯及衍生工具業務收入下跌（-29.9%）及經營支出上升（+8.4%）所抵銷。零售銀行的除稅後溢利總額下跌18.1%，原因是2016年錄得某些非經常項目。零售銀行的除稅後平均資產回報率由2016年的1.44%下跌至1.07%（圖6）。\n\n零售銀行的淨息差由2016年的1.32%擴大至2017年的1.45%（圖7），主因是市場利率上升。\n\n零售銀行的非利息收入佔總經營收入的比例由2016年的44.3%下降至40%。雖然費用和佣金收入上升9.4%，但外匯及衍生工具業務產生的收入下跌29.9%。\n\n零售銀行的成本與收入比率由2016年的43.2%下降至2017年的41.9%，原因是經營支出（+8.4%）的增速較經營收入（+11.8%）為慢（圖8）。零售銀行的貸款減值撥備由2016年的80億元下降至73億元。\n\n# 資產質素\n\n零售銀行的貸款質素在年內改善，分類貸款比率由上年的0.72%下降至0.54%。逾期及經重組貸款比率亦由2016年的0.53%下降至0.4%（圖9）。同樣地，整體銀行業的分類貸款比率及逾期及經重組貸款比率分別由0.85%及0.67%下降至0.67%及0.52%。\n\n銀行的住宅按揭貸款組合質素維持良好，拖欠比率在2017年年底維持在低水平的0.03%（圖10）。經重組貸款比率接近零。與上年四宗個案相比，在年底並無住宅按揭貸款出現負資產淨值。\n\n信用卡貸款的拖欠比率在2017年年底維持在低水平的0.22%，與上年的0.24%相若（圖10）。拖欠及經重組貸款的合計比率由0.33%微降至0.31%。撇帳率亦由2016年的1.92%略為下降至1.75%。\n\n# 資產負債表走勢\n\n銀行業貸款總額在2017年增長16.1%，而2016年則為6.5%。信貸需求上升，主因是市場對全球經濟前景感到樂觀。由於存款總額的增速較貸款總額為慢，整體貸存比率由上年的68.4%上升至2017年年底的73%。港元貸存比率亦在同期由77.1%上升至82.7%（圖11）。\n\n與內地相關的貸款（包括本地註冊銀行內地子公司的貸款）在2017年上升17.5%，而2016年錄得的增幅則為7%。\n\n#

{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nDespite weakening pressure on the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to operate in an orderly manner with ample liquidity. The Linked Exchange Rate System has served as a strong anchor for Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability and proved to be highly resilient against various shocks.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability. This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n- Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three noteissuing banks\n- Government-issued notes and coins in circulation\n- the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of the clearing account balances of banks kept with the HKMA\n- Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the HKMA’s firm commitment to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs). When the demand for Hong Kong dollars is greater than the supply and the market exchange rate strengthens to the strong-side CU of HK$7.75 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to sell Hong Kong dollars to banks for US dollars. The Aggregate Balance will then expand to push down Hong Kong dollar interest rates, creating monetary conditions that move the Hong Kong dollar away from the strong-side limit to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if the supply of Hong Kong dollars is greater than the demand and the market exchange rate weakens to the weak-side CU of HK$7.85 to one US dollar, the HKMA will buy Hong Kong dollars from banks. The Aggregate Balance will then contract to drive Hong Kong dollar interest rates up, pushing the Hong Kong dollar away from the weak-side limit to stay within the Convertibility Zone.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2017\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate generally saw weakening pressure in 2017 (Chart 1). Driven mainly by interest carry trade activities amid widened negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates, the Hong Kong dollar eased gradually against the US dollar, from 7.7566 on 3 January to the year-low of 7.8265 on 22 August. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate gained some strength between late September and early November, underpinned by a tightening of Hong Kong dollar liquidity due to initial public offering (IPO)-related funding demand, and traded steadily within a narrow range of 7.80–7.81. Weakening pressures on the Hong Kong dollar were seen again towards the end of the year, partly reflecting slightly improved Hong Kong dollar liquidity conditions as well as increased year-end commercial demand for the US dollar. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market functioned normally throughout 2017.\n\nAs the CUs were not triggered, the total of the Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs remained virtually unchanged at around HK$1,225.3 billion in 2017 (Chart 2). During the year, the HKMA issued a total of HK$80 billion additional Exchange Fund Bills to meet banks’ increased demand for liquidity management. This led to a contraction of the Aggregate Balance to HK$179.8 billion at the end of 2017. The issuance of additional Exchange Fund Bills was consistent with Currency Board principles, as it only represented a change in the composition of the Monetary Base, with a shift from the Aggregate Balance to the outstanding EFBNs. The Monetary Base remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\n# Money market\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates stayed soft in the first eight months of 2017 before facing more upward pressure towards the end of the year (Chart 3). Despite concerns about the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes and balance sheet normalisation, the Hong Kong dollar interbank rates generally remained soft for the first eight months. As such, the negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates widened between January and August. From September onward, the shortdated Hong Kong dollar interbank rates witnessed large pick-ups, driven mainly by IPO-related and year-end funding demand. Correspondingly, the negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates narrowed in the short-dated segment. Overall, the short-dated interbank rates traded mostly below the Base Rate in 2017.\n\nThe Base Rate was adjusted upwards on 16 March, 15 June and 14 December, by a total of 75 basis points from 1.00% to 1.75%, as the target range for the US federal funds rate moved upward three times by a total of 75 basis points from 0.50–0.75% to 1.25–1.50% during the year. The adjustment of the Base Rate was in accordance with the revised formula announced on 26 March 2009, in which the Base Rate is set at either 50 basis points above the lower bound of the prevailing target range for the US federal funds rate or the average of the five-day moving averages of the overnight and one-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs), whichever is the higher.\n\nRoughly tracking the movements of the Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads, the discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points widened gradually during the first three quarters, with the 12-month Hong Kong dollar forward points reaching about -615 pips in midSeptember (Chart 4). In the fourth quarter, the discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points narrowed slightly along with the narrowing of the negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates. Overall, Hong Kong’s money market continued to operate in an orderly manner and interbank liquidity remained ample. Discount Window borrowing increased from HK$5.3 billion in 2016 to HK$10.3 billion in 2017.\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nSince its establishment in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has served as a strong anchor for Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, and proved to be highly resilient in a series of regional and global financial crises. The Government has reasserted its full commitment to the LERS and the credibility of its commitment was further reinforced by the stability in the foreign exchange and money markets. There is also continued strong public confidence in the Hong Kong dollar as a means of payment and a storage of value. In its 2017 Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund reaffirmed its support for the LERS, commenting that the LERS remained the best exchange rate arrangement for Hong Kong. Combined with robust financial supervision and regulation, prudent fiscal management, and flexible markets, the LERS has worked well to help Hong Kong navigate successfully through both external and domestic challenges.\n\nInternational Monetary Fund: “The Linked Exchange Rate System remains the best arrangement for Hong Kong.”\n\nA sound banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS. During 2017, the HKMA continued to monitor closely banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and stepped up its supervisory efforts on corporate, property-related and mainland-related lending to bolster the resilience of the banking sector. As the US Federal Reserve continues to normalise its monetary policy, the Hong Kong dollar interest rates will gradually normalise as well. The HKMA reiterated that, under the design of the LERS, the outflow of capital, the weakening of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, the triggering of the weak-side CU and the reduction of the Monetary Base are part of the necessary process of the normalisation of Hong Kong dollar interest rates. The HKMA also reminded the public to manage their risks prudently and be well prepared for potential financial turbulence.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio, defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base, moved within a range of 106.7–108.2% during 2017, without touching the Upper or Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 108.1% on 31 December (Chart 5). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. In the event of abrupt shocks, the sizeable amount of financial resources of the Exchange Fund will provide a powerful backstop in protecting Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\n# Other activities\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to the monetary and financial stability of Hong Kong. In 2017, the CBC considered various issues, including the drivers of short-run dynamics in Hong Kong’s housing prices, the determinants of HIBOR-London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) spreads, the effect of property valuation changes on corporate borrowing in Mainland China, and the effect of mortgage debt service burden on private consumption in Hong Kong. Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and the reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research (HKIMR) continued to sponsor research in the fields of monetary policy, banking and finance. Over the past three years, the HKIMR has been re-orienting its activities towards higher policy relevance. This is reflected, in particular, in its conference activities and visiting fellowship programmes. The HKIMR has been collaborating with major central banks and policy institutions to jointly organise more policyfocused conferences. Meanwhile, a thematic research fellowship programme introduced in 2016 has been supporting more research projects related to policy issues that are of importance to the HKMA.\n\nIn 2017, the HKIMR hosted 18 research fellows and published 29 working papers. It also organised four international conferences and workshops during the year:\n- The Eighth Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy, titled “China’s Economic Rebalancing: Where is it Heading?”, was held in January in Hong Kong. The conference provided a forum for academics, policy makers and business economists to discuss important analytical and policy issues related to the Mainland economy. 11 highquality research papers were presented, covering a wide variety of issues including Mainland’s economic rebalancing, structural reform and international spillovers, issues on the renminbi exchange rate, and Mainland’s monetary policy framework and transmission.\n- The 15th HKIMR Summer Workshop was held in July. The workshop was intended to provide an opportunity for staff members of the HKIMR and the HKMA to present their research papers, and to enhance interaction between research staff and visiting fellows.\n- A joint conference organised by the HKMA and the Bank for International Settlements, titled “The Price, Real and Financial Effects of Exchange Rates”, was held in August. The conference provided a platform for in-depth and insightful discussion. A wide range of important topics were covered, including the exchange rate system, the pricing system of international trade, risk taking in the accumulation of foreign currency reserves, and foreign exchange market behaviour.\n- A conference jointly sponsored by the HKMA, the US Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta on “Unconventional Monetary Policy: Lessons Learned” was held in October. The conference reviewed lessons learned from the unconventional monetary policies (UMP) of major central banks over the past ten years. The topics included monetary policy in a low interest rate environment, UMP and its spillovers to emerging economies, UMP and bank lending, and UMP and its effects on the real economy and financial stability.\n","terms":{"10 Years Plus Caring Organisation Logo":["10年Plus同心展關懷標誌"],"10-Year US Treasury yield":["10年期美國國庫券收益率"],"10-year US Treasury yield":["美國十年期國庫債券收益率"],"10th Asian Financial

貨幣穩定\n\n儘管港元匯率的壓力有所減輕，但港元匯率及貨幣市場仍維持有序運作，流動性充裕。聯繫匯率制度為香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供了堅實的支柱，並證明了其對各種衝擊的高度韌性。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的首要目標是維持貨幣穩定。這是指香港貨幣在對外匯市場上相對美元的匯率保持在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的區間內，維持其穩定的對外匯價值。貨幣制度的結構以貨幣發行局制度為特色，要求貨幣基礎至少100%由外匯基金持有的美元儲備支持，且貨幣基礎的變動需100%由相應的美元儲備變動所匹配。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括以下部分：\n- 負債證明書，為三家發鈔銀行發行的紙幣提供全額擔保\n- 政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣\n- 總結餘，即銀行在金管局的清算賬戶餘額總和\n- 金管局代表政府發行的外匯基金票據及債券（EFBNs）。\n\n港元匯率的穩定是通過自動利率調整機制和金管局對兌換保證的堅定承諾來維持的。當港元需求大於供應，市場匯率升至強方兌換保證匯率7.75港元兌1美元時，金管局會準備向銀行出售港元以換取美元。總結餘將因此擴大，推動港元利率下跌，創造貨幣條件，使港元匯率遠離強方上限，保持在7.75至7.85的兌換範圍內。相反，當港元供應大於需求，市場匯率跌至弱方兌換保證匯率7.85港元兌1美元時，金管局會向銀行購買港元。總結餘將因此收縮，推動港元利率上升，使港元匯率遠離弱方上限，保持在兌換範圍內。\n\n# 2017年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n2017年，港元匯率普遍承受較小的壓力（圖1）。主要受港元與美元利率負差擴大的套息活動驅動，港元對美元匯率逐步走軟，由1月3日的7.7566跌至8月22日的全年低點7.8265。9月下旬至11月初，港元匯率有所回升，主要因為新股集資活動相關的資金需求導致港元流動性收緊，匯率在7.80至7.81的狹窄區間內穩定交易。年底時，港元再次承受較小的壓力，部分原因是港元流動性狀況略有改善，以及年底商業對美元的需求增加。總體而言，港元匯率市場在2017年全年運作正常。\n\n由於兌換保證未曾觸發，總結餘與未償還外匯基金票據及債券的總額在2017年基本維持不變，約為12,253億港元（圖2）。在該年度，金管局發行了額外800億港元的外匯基金票據，以滿足銀行對流動性管理的增加需求。這導致總結餘在2017年底收縮至1,798億港元。發行額外外匯基金票據符合貨幣發行局原則，因為這僅代表貨幣基礎組成的變化，即從總結餘轉向未償還外匯基金票據及債券。貨幣基礎仍由外匯儲備提供全額支持。\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n2017年前八個月，港元銀行同業拆息維持低位，但在年底前面臨較大的上行壓力（圖3）。儘管市場對美國聯邦儲備局加息及資產負債表正常化的憂慮，港元銀行同業拆息在前八個月普遍維持低位。因此，港元與美元利率的負差在1月至8月期間擴大。從9月起，短期港元銀行同業拆息大幅上升，主要受新股集資活動及年底資金需求驅動。相應地，港元與美元利率的負差在短期部分收窄。總體而言，2017年短期銀行同業拆息大多低於基本利率。\n\n基本利率在3月16日、6月15日及12月14日上調，共上調75個基點，由1.00%升至1.75%，原因是美國聯邦基金利率目標區間在當年上調了三次，共75個基點，由0.50-0.75%升至1.25-1.50%。基本利率的調整符合2009年3月26日公佈的修訂公式，其中基本利率設定為美國聯邦基金利率目標區間下限加50個基點，或香港銀行同業拆息隔夜及一個月平均值的五天移動平均數，以較高者為準。\n\n大致跟隨港元與美元利差的走勢，港元遠期匯率點子的折讓在頭三個季度逐步擴大，12個月期港元遠期匯率點子在9月中旬跌至約-615點（圖4）。在第四季度，隨著港元與美元利率負差的收窄，港元遠期匯率點子的折讓亦略有收窄。總體而言，香港貨幣市場繼續有序運作，銀行同業流動性保持充裕。貼現窗借貸額由2016年的53億港元增至2017年的103億港元。\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n自1983年成立以來，聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）為香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供了堅實的支柱，並在一系列區域及全球金融危機中展現出高度的韌性。政府重申其對聯匯制度的全面承諾，而外匯及貨幣市場的穩定進一步強化了這一承諾的可信度。公眾對港元作為支付手段及價值儲存工具的信心亦持續強勁。在2017年與香港的第四條磋商中，國際貨幣基金組織重申其對聯匯制度的支持，並表示聯匯制度仍然是對香港最佳的匯率安排。聯匯制度與穩健的金融監管及規管、審慎的財政管理及靈活的市場相結合，有效地幫助香港成功應對了外部及內部挑戰。\n\n國際貨幣基金組織表示：「聯繫匯率制度仍然是對香港最佳的安排。」\n\n穩健的銀行體系對聯匯制度的正常運作至關重要。2017年，金管局繼續密切監控銀行的信貸、流動性及利率風險管理情況及壓力測試結果，並加強對企業、物業相關及內地相關貸款的監管，以提升銀行業的韌性。隨著美國聯邦儲備局繼續正常化其貨幣政策，港元利率亦將逐步正常化。金管局重申，在聯匯制度的設計下，資本外流、港元匯率走弱、弱方兌換保證匯率被觸發及貨幣基礎減少，均是港元利率正常化過程的必要部分。金管局亦提醒公眾審慎管理風險，並為潛在的金融動盪做好準備。\n\n為提高貨幣發行局帳目的透明度，自1998年10月起，外匯基金資產的某一特定部分已被分配用以支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（即支持資產除以貨幣基礎）在2017年介乎106.7%至108.2%之間，未觸及上限或下限觸發水平。該比率在12月31日收於108.1%（圖5）。在聯匯制度下，雖然特定外匯基金資產已被指定為支持組合，但所有外匯基金資產均可用於支持港元匯率。在發生突發衝擊時，外匯基金的大量金融資源將提供強有力的支持，以保護香港的貨幣及金融穩定。\n\n# 其他活動\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會下的貨幣發行委員會（CBC）監控及審視與香港貨幣及金融穩定相關的問題。2017年，CBC審視了多項議題，包括香港樓價短期動態的驅動因素、HIBOR與倫敦銀行同業拆息（LIBOR）利差的決定因素、物業估值變動對內地企業借貸的影響，以及按揭供款負擔對香港私人消費的影響。CBC就這些議題進行的討論記錄及提交給CBC的貨幣發行局運作報告均公佈於金管局網站。\n\n香港金融研究中心（HKIMR）繼續資助貨幣政策、銀行及金融領域的研究。過去三年，HKIMR重新定位其活動，以提高政策相關性。這特別反映在其會議活動及訪問學者計劃中。HKIMR與主要央行及政策研究機構合作，共同舉辦更多以政策為焦點的會議。同時，2016年推出的專題研究學者計劃支持了更多與金管局重要政策議題相關的研究項目。\n\n2017年，HKIMR接待了18位研究學者，並發表了29篇工作論文。該年度，它還組織了四場國際會議及研討會：\n- 第八屆中國經濟年度國際會議於1月在香港舉行，主題為「中國經濟再平衡：未來走向何方？」該會議為學者、政策制定者及企業經濟學家提供了一個平台，以討論與內地經濟相關的重大分析及政策議題。會議上發表了11篇高品質的研究論文，涵蓋了廣泛的議題，包括內地經濟再平衡、結構改革及國際溢出效應、人民幣匯率問題，以及內地貨幣政策框架及傳導機制。\n- 第15屆HKIMR夏季研討會於7月舉行。研討會的目的是為HKIMR及金管局的工作人員提供一個機會，以發表其研究論文，並加強研究人員與訪問學者之間的互動。\n- 由金管局及國際結算銀行聯合舉辦的會議「匯率的價格、實體及金融效應」於8月舉行。該會議提供了一個深入及有洞見的討論平台，涵蓋了廣泛的重要議題，包括匯率制度、國際貿易定價制度、積累外匯儲備中的風險承擔，以及外匯市場行為。\n- 由金管局、美國聯邦儲備局及亞特蘭大聯邦儲備銀行聯合贊助的會議「非常規貨幣政策：經驗教訓」於10月舉行。該會議回顧了過去十年主要央行非常規貨幣政策（UMP）的經驗教訓，議題包括低利率環境下的貨幣政策、UMP及其對新興經濟體的溢出效應、UMP與銀行借貸，以及UMP對實體經濟及金融穩定的影響。"}
{"en":"# Banking Stability\n\nIn 2017, the HKMA continued to place its supervisory focus on the effectiveness of authorized institutions’ risk governance framework, including credit and liquidity risk management systems. During the year, another round of countercyclical macro-prudential measures was introduced to strengthen the resilience of the banking sector to cope with any downturn in the property market. With cyber threats on the rise, the HKMA stepped up the supervision of authorized institutions’ technology risk management. At the same time, the HKMA launched seven initiatives that prepare Hong Kong to move into a New Era of Smart Banking. The effectiveness of authorized institutions’ anti-money laundering and counterterrorist financing controls remained a key supervisory focus of the HKMA as part of its efforts to combat financial crimes. On conduct supervision, the HKMA took further steps to promote a customer-centric corporate culture, foster financial inclusion, and address difficulties encountered by small and medium-sized enterprises and start-up companies in opening and maintaining bank accounts in Hong Kong. Efforts were also made to enhance the supervision of authorized institutions’ sales practices for investment and insurance products to further strengthen customer protection.\n\nSubstantial progress was made on the local implementation of international supervisory and accounting standards, including capital adequacy standards, disclosure standards, the Net Stable Funding Ratio, large exposure limits, recovery planning and International Financial Reporting Standard 9. In support of the need for capacity building amid an ever-changing banking environment and evolving risk landscape, the HKMA co-ordinated with the industry to develop director empowerment programmes and the Enhanced Competency Framework for banking practitioners.\n\nThe Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance came into operation on 7 July 2017, making Hong Kong one of the few Financial Stability Board member jurisdictions with a fully cross-sectoral resolution regime for financial institutions. The Ordinance, establishing a new line of defence for financial stability, confers necessary powers on the Monetary Authority to manage, in an orderly manner, failure of a financial institution in circumstances where such failure could have adverse systemic consequences.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this objective is contingent upon the financial system being highly resilient and capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their business and, in extremis, by failing in a disorderly manner. The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring banks are resilient to shocks and are able to recover their positions in response to crises, which ultimately helps prevent failures. The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banking business, which includes the business of taking deposits, in Hong Kong. It is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposittaking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs). The Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs).\n\nHowever, the Monetary Authority cannot ensure, nor is the Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework designed to ensure, a zero-risk financial system. Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that in the event of an AI’s failure, resolution may be conducted in an orderly manner such that continuity in critical financial services provided by AIs to their customers can be maintained. To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong is established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs, amongst other financial institutions.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2017\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nIn 2017, 192 off-site reviews were conducted covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL ratings1, corporate governance, business operations and risk management of AIs. As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance at AIs, 30 meetings were held with the boards of directors or board-level committees of AIs, with the discussions focused on important risk management issues. The HKMA also conducted a survey to monitor the adoption of its recent guidance on corporate governance. 27 tripartite meetings among the HKMA, AIs and their external auditors were also held.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA continued to conduct regular on-site examinations supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk. This approach has allowed the HKMA to prioritise its supervisory resources to focus on emerging and more significant risks faced by AIs. The HKMA conducted 401 on-site examinations and thematic reviews during the year. Credit risk management and controls remained the key focus of these examinations and reviews. Another major focus was technology risk and operational risk management. The HKMA also increased the number of overseas examinations and the number of on-site examinations and thematic reviews targeted at liquidity and market risk management as well as anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML\/CFT) controls. On-site examinations of AIs’ activities in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses were also conducted by specialist teams.\n\n# Supervision of credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nTotal bank lending grew by 16.1%, compared with a growth of 6.5% in 2016. As shown in Table 2, the loan growth was broad-based.\n\nSpecifically, Mainland-related lending grew by 17.5% to HK$4,188 billion at the end of 2017 (Table 3). This included HK$644 billion of loans booked with Mainland subsidiaries of banks incorporated in Hong Kong.\n\nThe asset quality of AIs remained healthy in 2017. Retail banks’ classified loan ratio edged down from 0.72% at the end of 2016 to 0.54% at the end of 2017, well below the long-run historical average of 2.2% since 2000. For the banking industry as a whole, the classified loan ratio decreased from 0.85% to 0.67%. As regards Mainlandrelated lending, retail banks’ classified loan ratio of such lending edged down to 0.75% in 2017 from 0.82%. For the banking industry as a whole, the ratio decreased to 0.67% from 0.80% a year ago.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA stepped up its supervisory efforts to ensure that AIs continued to adopt prudent credit risk management standards. In particular, the surveillance of AIs’ exposures to major corporates was enhanced. Targeted thematic examinations were conducted, focusing on key credit risk management controls such as loan underwriting standards, the loan classification and provisioning system, credit risk governance framework and risk management for lending to property developers, asset-backed financing and insurance premium financing.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nProperty prices continued to rise in 2017. There were more loans extended by AIs involving borrowers with multiple mortgages or with income derived from outside of Hong Kong. In view of these developments, the HKMA introduced another round of countercyclical macroprudential measures on 19 May. The eighth round of measures included raising the risk-weight floor for the calculation of capital charges for new residential mortgage loans granted by AIs, lowering the applicable loan-to-value (LTV) ratio cap for property mortgage loans extended to borrowers with pre-existing mortgages, and lowering the applicable debt servicing ratio (DSR) limit for property mortgage loans extended to borrowers whose income is derived mainly from outside of Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA’s macro-prudential measures on property mortgage loans, introduced since 2009, have enhanced banks’ resilience to risks associated with the property market. The average LTV ratio of new residential mortgage loans fell to 49% in December 2017 from 64% in September 2009, before the countercyclical measures were first introduced. The average DSR also decreased to 35% in December 2017 from 41% in August 2010, when a cap on DSR was first applied (Chart 1).\n\nThe HKMA observed that some developers financed their property development projects with high gearing and some of them provided mortgages with high LTV ratios to buyers of properties. To address the risks associated with these developments, the HKMA introduced new risk management measures for lending to property developers on 12 May. These included requiring AIs to lower the financing caps for construction financing; requiring AIs to set aside more capital for their lending to property developers with a higher proportion of mortgage loans relative to equity; and performing a round of thematic examinations to ensure that banks continue to follow prudent underwriting standards in their lending to property developers.\n\nSeparately, the HKMA worked with the Land Registry in launching an e-Alert service in February. The e-Alert service provides a notification to the AI concerned whenever a further mortgage in respect of the mortgaged property is lodged with the Land Registry for registration, so that the mortgagee bank can take appropriate risk mitigating actions as appropriate.\n\n# Supervision of operational and technology risks\n\nCybersecurity threats continued to increase over the year. The HKMA stepped up its supervisory efforts in a bid to enhance the cyber resilience of the banking sector. As part of the Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative (CFI) rolled out by the HKMA in 2016, 30 AIs completed an assessment of the maturity of their cyber defences. Separately, the HKMA and the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), after extensive consultation with the banking and securities industry, jointly decided to introduce a mandatory twofactor authentication for online share trading. A round of on-site examinations focused on banks’ cybersecurity controls and operational resilience was also conducted. The HKMA further completed a round of discussions with the senior management of major banks to assess how the banks were managing strategic risks posed by potential new market entrants powered by technological advancement.\n\n# Smart Banking\n\nIn September, the HKMA announced a package of measures to assist Hong Kong’s banking sector in migrating to a new era of Smart Banking. On the supervisory front, the HKMA enhanced the Fintech Supervisory Sandbox to version 2.0, with new features including a Chatroom facility accessible by both banks and technology firms and the establishment of linkages among the sandboxes of the HKMA, the SFC and the Insurance Authority (IA), so as to provide a single point of entry for conducting trials of cross-sector fintech products.\n\nThe HKMA also launched a Banking Made Easy initiative to identify and minimise regulatory frictions with the aim of further improving customers’ experience in using fintech and digital banking services. A taskforce has been set up with the current focus on remote onboarding and account maintenance, online finance and online wealth management.\n\nA review of the existing Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks has commenced to facilitate the introduction of virtual banking in Hong Kong.\n\n# Supervision of treasury activities and liquidity risk\n\nAs the US continued to normalise its monetary policy, global fund flows might become increasingly volatile. In consideration of this, the HKMA placed increased focus on the supervision of liquidity risk during the year. The HKMA enhanced its supervisory liquidity stress testing with additional scenarios, including a more stressful but plausible scenario of fund outflows and a short-term, confidencedriven bank run scenario. The HKMA also stepped up the monitoring and analysis of individual AIs’ liquidity profiles and required selected AIs to strengthen their liquidity risk management capability.\n\nSeparately, the HKMA conducted more on-site examinations of AIs’ market risk management in respect of their debt securities portfolios. A round of thematic reviews were carried out to evaluate potential risks arising from AIs’ increased investment activities in foreign currency bonds and to assess the effectiveness of the corresponding risk management, including hedging practices.\n\n# Prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing (ML\/TF)\n\nThe Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) (Amendment) Bill 2017 was gazetted on 23 June and will come into operation in 2018. The amendment is intended to update Hong Kong’s regulatory regime for AML\/CFT in line with the latest international requirements as promulgated by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). These changes, together with updates to the statutory guideline on AML\/CFT, will help clarify and implement the risk-based approach in customer due diligence (CDD) processes for account opening and the maintenance of bona fide customers, and encourage innovation where such processes are carried out remotely.\n","terms":{"10 Years Plus Caring Organisation Logo":["10年Plus同心展關懷標誌"],"10-Year US

銀行體系穩定性\n\n金管局在2017年持續將監管重點放在認可機構的風險治理架構成效上，包括信貸及流動性風險管理系統。該年度，當局再次推出逆周期的宏觀審慎措施，以強化銀行業應對房地產市場下滑的韌性。隨著網路威脅日益增加，金管局加強了對認可機構科技風險管理的監督。同時，金管局推出七項措施，為香港邁向智慧銀行新紀元做好準備。認可機構的反洗錢及反恐融資管控成效，仍是金管局監管工作的重點之一，以打擊金融犯罪。在行為監管方面，金管局採取進一步措施，推廣以客戶為中心的企業文化、促進金融普惠，並解決中小企業及新創公司在香港開立及維持銀行帳戶時遇到的困難。此外，當局亦致力強化對認可機構投資及保險產品銷售實務的監管，以進一步強化客戶保護。\n\n在本地落實國際監管及會計標準方面，取得了重大進展，包括資本充足標準、資訊披露標準、淨穩定資金比率、大額風險暴露限額、復原計畫及國際財務報導準則第9號。鑑於銀行業環境不斷變化，風險狀況亦不斷演變，有必要提升從業人員的能力，因此金管局與業界合作，為銀行從業人員制訂董事賦能計畫及強化能力架構。\n\n《金融機構（處置）條例》於2017年7月7日生效，使香港成為少數設有跨部門金融機構全面處置機制的金融穩定委員會成員司法管轄區之一。該條例為金融穩定建立了一道新防線，賦予貨幣管理局必要的權力，以有序地管理金融機構在可能對體系造成不利影響的情況下出現的倒閉事件。\n\n# 目標\n\n金管局的總體目標是促進銀行體系的安全與穩定。要實現此目標，金融體系必須具有高度韌性，並能提供香港經濟所需的關鍵金融服務。\n\n銀行的營運方式會影響體系的穩定性，而在極端情況下，銀行若以無序方式倒閉，亦會影響體系的穩定性。貨幣管理局作為監管機構，在保障金融穩定方面發揮關鍵作用，確保銀行能抵禦衝擊，並在危機中恢復其地位，最終有助於防止倒閉。貨幣管理局負責在香港對銀行業務進行審慎監管，包括存款業務。其職責包括在香港授權持牌銀行、有限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司（統稱認可機構）。貨幣管理局亦負責指定及監督某些金融市場基礎設施。\n\n然而，貨幣管理局無法確保金融體系零風險，香港的審慎監管框架亦非旨在確保零風險。相反，貨幣管理局作為處置機構，旨在確保在認可機構倒閉時，可有序地進行處置，以維持認可機構向客戶提供的關鍵金融服務的連續性。為此，香港設立了金融機構處置機制，貨幣管理局是認可機構及其他金融機構的處置機構。\n\n# 2017年回顧\n\n# 監管活動概覽\n\n2017年，共進行了192次非現場審查，涵蓋範圍廣泛的議題，包括CAMEL評級、公司治理、業務營運及認可機構的風險管理。作為金管局持續強化認可機構風險治理的一部分，與認可機構的董事會或董事會層級委員會舉行了30次會議，討論重點風險管理議題。金管局亦進行了一項調查，以監控其最近有關公司治理的指引的採納情況。金管局、認可機構及其外部稽核亦舉行了27次三方會議。\n\n除了非現場活動外，金管局持續進行定期的現場檢查，並輔以對評估為高風險領域的專題審查。此方法使金管局能優先分配監管資源，集中應對認可機構面臨的新興及更重大風險。金管局在該年度進行了401次現場檢查及專題審查。信貸風險管理及控制仍是這些檢查及審查的焦點。另一個主要焦點是科技風險及營運風險管理。金管局亦增加了海外檢查的次數，以及針對流動性及市場風險管理和反洗錢及反恐融資管控措施的現場檢查及專題審查的次數。專業團隊亦對認可機構在證券、投資產品、保險及強積金相關業務方面的活動進行了現場檢查。\n\n# 信貸風險監管\n\n# 信貸成長及資產品質\n\n銀行總放款額成長了16.1%，而2016年的成長則為6.5%。如表2所示，貸款成長是廣泛的。\n\n具體而言，與內地相關的放款在2017年底成長了17.5%，達41,880億港元（表3）。這包括香港註冊銀行內地子公司的6,440億港元貸款。\n\n認可機構的資產品質在2017年保持健康。零售銀行的分類貸款比率由2016年底的0.72%下降至2017年底的0.54%，遠低於自2000年以來的長期歷史平均值2.2%。就銀行業整體而言，分類貸款比率由0.85%下降至0.67%。至於與內地相關的放款，零售銀行此等貸款的分類貸款比率由2016年的0.82%下降至2017年的0.75%。就銀行業整體而言，該比率由一年前的0.80%下降至0.67%。\n\n在該年度，金管局強化了監管工作，以確保認可機構持續採用審慎的信貸風險管理標準。尤其是，對認可機構對主要企業的風險暴露的監控得到了強化。進行了有針對性的專題檢查，重點關注關鍵信貸風險管理控管措施，如貸款核准標準、貸款分類及撥備制度、信貸風險治理架構，以及對房地產開發商貸款、資產擔保融資及保險費融資的風險管理。\n\n# 房地產按揭貸款\n\n房地產價格在2017年持續上漲。認可機構發放了更多貸款予有多個按揭的借款人或收入主要來自香港以外的借款人。有鑑於此，金管局在5月19日再次推出逆周期的宏觀審慎措施。第八輪措施包括調高認可機構新造住宅按揭貸款的風險權重下限以計算其資本需求、調低向有現有按揭的借款人提供的房地產按揭貸款的適用貸值比率上限，以及調低向收入主要來自香港以外的借款人提供的房地產按揭貸款的適用還款與收入比率上限。\n\n金管局自2009年起實施的房地產按揭貸款宏觀審慎措施，提升了銀行應對房地產市場相關風險的能力。新造住宅按揭貸款的平均貸值比率由逆周期措施首次推出前的2009年9月的64%，下降至2017年12月的49%。平均還款與收入比率亦由首次實施還款與收入比率上限時的2010年8月的41%，下降至2017年12月的35%（圖1）。\n\n金管局觀察到，部分開發商以高槓桿率為房地產開發項目融資，其中部分開發商向房地產買家提供高貸值比率的按揭。為應對與這些情況相關的風險，金管局在5月12日就對房地產開發商貸款引入新的風險管理措施。這些措施包括要求認可機構調低建築融資的上限；要求認可機構就按揭貸款佔股本比率較高的房地產開發商貸款預留更多資本；以及進行一輪專題檢查，以確保銀行在對房地產開發商貸款時持續遵循審慎的核准標準。\n\n此外，金管局與土地註冊處合作，在二月推出電子警示服務。當按揭物業再被送交土地註冊處註冊時，電子警示服務會向有關認可機構發出通知，以便承按銀行可採取適當的風險緩解措施。\n\n# 營運及科技風險監管\n\n網路安全威脅在該年度持續增加。金管局強化了監管工作，以提升銀行業的網路韌性。作為金管局在2016年推出的網路防禦計畫的一部分，30家認可機構完成了對其網路防禦能力的成熟度評估。此外，金管局與證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）在與銀行及證券業進行廣泛諮詢後，共同決定為線上股票交易引入強制性的雙重認證。亦進行了一輪以銀行網路安全控管及營運韌性為焦點的現場檢查。金管局進一步與主要銀行的高階管理層進行了一輪討論，以評估銀行如何管理由科技進步驅動的潛在新市場參與者帶來的策略風險。\n\n# 智慧銀行\n\n在九月，金管局宣布了一套措施，以協助香港銀行業邁向智慧銀行新紀元。在監管方面，金管局將金融科技監管沙盒提升至2.0版，新增功能包括一個供銀行及科技公司使用的聊天室，以及建立金管局、證監會及保險業監管局沙盒之間的連結，以提供單一入口進行跨部門金融科技產品的試驗。\n\n金管局亦推出了「銀行易」計畫，以識別及減低監管要求，旨在進一步改善客戶使用金融科技及數位銀行服務的體驗。已成立一個專責小組，目前重點關注遠端開戶及帳戶維護、線上理財及線上財富管理。\n\n已開始檢討現有的《虛擬銀行的認可》指引，以促進虛擬銀行在香港的引入。\n\n# 庫務活動及流動性風險監管\n\n隨著美國持續正常化其貨幣政策，全球資金流向可能變得更加波動。有鑑於此，金管局在該年度加大了對流動性風險的監管力度。金管局強化了其監管流動性壓力測試，增加了額外情境，包括一個更具壓力但可信的資金流出情境及一個短期、信心驅動的銀行擠兌情境。金管局亦強化了對個別認可機構流動性狀況的監控及分析，並要求部分認可機構強化其流動性風險管理能力。\n\n此外，金管局對認可機構債務證券組合的市場風險管理進行了更多現場檢查。進行了一輪專題審查，以評估認可機構增加外幣債券投資活動所帶來的潛在風險，並評估相應風險管理的成效，包括避險實務。\n\n# 防止洗錢及恐怖主義融資\n\n《2017年反洗錢及反恐怖主義融資（金融機構）修訂條例草案》於6月23日刊憲，並將在2018年生效。該修訂旨在更新香港的反洗錢及反恐融資監管制度，以符合金融行動特別工作組（FATF）頒布的最新國際要求。這些修訂，連同反洗錢及反恐融資法定指引的更新，將有助於澄清及落實以風險為基礎的方法，進行客戶盡職審查程序，以開立帳戶及維持誠信客戶，並鼓勵在遠端進行這些程序時的創新。"}
{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nTo consolidate Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre, the HKMA strives to enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. On fintech, the seven new initiatives aimed at facilitating the development and use of fintech in the banking and payment industries were well received by stakeholders and the public. Hong Kong’s international profile as a financing hub for infrastructure investments was raised further, thanks to a series of efforts on network and capacity building on this front. The launch of Bond Connect reinforced Hong Kong’s position as the main gateway to opportunities in Mainland China. The HKMA’s efforts on other areas such as corporate treasury centres were also bearing fruits.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nIn view of the rapid technological advancements, the HKMA in September announced the launch of seven initiatives to prepare Hong Kong to move into a new era of Smart Banking. These initiatives included:\n- developing the Faster Payment System (FPS) to achieve full connectivity of digital retail payments;\n- introducing an Open Application Programming Interface (Open API) framework;\n- enhancing fintech research and talent development;\n- stepping up cross-border collaboration in fintech;\n- upgrading our existing Fintech Supervisory Sandbox (FSS) 1.0 to Version 2.0;\n- facilitating the introduction of virtual banking; and\n- promoting a new Banking Made Easy initiative to minimise regulatory frictions in customers’ digital experience.\n\nThe HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO), together with the banking departments of the HKMA, played a pivotal role in driving the implementation of these initiatives to strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia.\n\nHong Kong’s international profile as a financing hub for infrastructure investments was raised further, as the number of partners of the HKMA Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO) grew to 87 as at 31 January 2018 from about 40 at inception. During the year, IFFO organised and participated in more than 10 seminars and workshops to facilitate experience sharing and collaborative networking among key stakeholders. In particular, IFFO steered the development of an infrastructure equity investment reference term sheet in its inaugural Debt Financing and Investors’ Roundtables with a view to enhancing infrastructure projects’ bankability and investability.\n\nBond Connect was launched in July, marking another major milestone in mutual access between the Hong Kong and Mainland capital markets, and further solidifying our gateway position for international investors seeking to enter the Mainland market. During the year, Hong Kong’s Renminbi Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (RQFII) quota was increased to RMB500 billion from RMB270 billion. Hong Kong maintained the world’s largest offshore renminbi liquidity pool, with vibrant renminbi financial intermediation activities as evidenced by a high turnover of our renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system and the lion’s share of Hong Kong’s renminbi payment activities in the world.\n\nFollowing the introduction of the tax regime for corporate treasury centres (CTCs) in 2016, the HKMA stepped up its outreach efforts with a view to attracting more multinational corporates to set up treasury centres in Hong Kong. By the end of 2017, more than 40 corporates reflected to the HKMA that they were actively planning to set up, or had set up, treasury centre operations in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA actively contributed to international discussions on issues of significance to global and regional financial stability. The Chief Executive of the HKMA became the Chair of the Standing Committee on Supervisory and Regulatory Co-operation (SRC) of the Financial Stability Board (FSB)1 in April to lead discussions on key financial stability issues.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure lays a solid foundation for Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre and global offshore renminbi business hub. The four interbank RTGS systems and the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) achieved 100% system availability in 2017, as compared to the target of 99.95%. To support Northbound Trading of Bond Connect, CMU has set up accounts with the two Mainland central securities depositories (CSDs) to facilitate the settlement of Bond Connect transactions and holding of Mainland debt securities on behalf of relevant CMU members.\n\nTo promote the general safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA designated four retail payment systems (RPSs) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO) in August to bring their operations under the HKMA’s oversight. The HKMA also conducted supervision of 16 stored value facility (SVF) licensees which actively launched new products and services that sought to offer customers more choices and better user experience. Separately, the coverage of e-Cheque and Electronic Bill Presentment and Payment (EBPP) service was further expanded to include crossboundary payments between Hong Kong and the entire Guangdong Province.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2017\n\n# Hong Kong as a fintech hub in Asia\n\n# Smart Banking Initiatives\n\nIn light of the rapid technological advancements, the HKMA in September announced seven initiatives that would prepare Hong Kong to move into a new era of Smart Banking. The initiatives aimed to help the banking sector to rise to a higher level and embrace the enormous opportunities brought about by the convergence of banking and technology.\n\n“Smart Banking would offer full interconnectivity amongst retail and corporate customers and allow financial services and transactions to be undertaken with great mobility, speed, ease and safety.”\n\nThe HKMA has been working closely with the banking industry and the fintech community, and made good progress in implementing the seven initiatives.\n\n# Faster Payment System\n\nThe FPS is a multi-currency platform that would enable the public to make round-the-clock funds transfers in a real-time manner with ease, through using mobile phone numbers or email addresses. It can support payments in Hong Kong dollars and renminbi. Banks and non-bank payment service providers can participate in the FPS, enabling full connectivity among all payment participants. With system development work close to completion, the FPS is scheduled to launch in September 2018.\n\nFurthermore, the HKMA led a working group, comprising major credit card scheme operators, banks, licensed SVF operators and merchant acquirers, to establish a common QR code standard for retail payments in Hong Kong. A common QR code standard would facilitate merchants in using a single QR code to accept QR code payment solutions from multiple payment service providers, providing greater convenience to customers and merchants. The working group has finalised the relevant technical specification, and would work out the implementation arrangements.\n\n# Open Application Programming Interface\n\nOpen API allows banks’ data to be accessed by third parties to facilitate better and easier integration of services offered by banks and other industries. Users can therefore conveniently stay on one system to enjoy integrated services in a secure environment. To facilitate the development and adoption of Open API by the banking sector, the HKMA has come up with a draft Open API framework, comprising a selection of Open API functions and deployment time frame, technical standards, third-party service provider governance, facilitation measures and maintenance models, for a two-month industry consultation.\n\n# Research and talent development\n\nOne of the major research projects was on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). Following the first DLT whitepaper in 2016, the second whitepaper on DLT was published in October 2017. The second whitepaper further explores the three Proof-of-Concept works, namely trade finance, digital identity management and mortgage application. It also offers advice on the implementation issues relating to governance, legal and compliance, and general control principles on deploying DLT for the banking and payment industries.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan, announces the release of the second whitepaper on DLT at the HKMA Fintech Day.\n\nRiding on the success of the Proof-of-Concept work on trade finance led by the HKMA, seven banks in Hong Kong decided to commercialise the prototype into a production system named Hong Kong Trade Finance Platform (HKTFP) to digitise and share trade documents and automate processes with a view to improving the overall trade process and reducing risks and fraud in the trade finance business.\n\nIn an effort to enlarge the talent pool in the fintech industry, the HKMA launched the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme in collaboration with the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute in December 2016. Response from students was positive. More than 3,000 applications from 421 applicants were received. Finally, 74 students accepted internship offers from the HKMA and 12 banks to work on fintech-related projects for six months or one year starting from July.\n\n# Cross-border collaboration\n\nAs the first step of strengthening our collaboration within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Bay Area, we are partnering with Shenzhen to promote fintech and talent developments. Specifically, the HKMA and the Office of Financial Development Service, the People’s Government of Shenzhen Municipality (OFDS) entered into an agreement in June to (i) provide reciprocal soft-landing support for fintech firms, (ii) co-organise the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Fintech Award in October to recognise and reward outstanding fintech products and solutions in the two cities; and (iii) arrange summer internships at Shenzhen fintech and techfin firms for Hong Kong students.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan (middle), signs and exchanges Memoranda of Understanding on softlanding arrangements with OFDS Director-General, Mr He Xiaojun (left), and Cyberport Chairman, Dr Lee George Lam, at the HKMA Fintech Day.\n\nE-leaflet for the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Fintech Award.\n\nThe HKMA also signed fintech co-operation agreements with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Dubai Financial Services Authority on innovation projects, referrals of innovative businesses, information sharing and exchange of expertise.\n\nIn November, the HKMA further signed a Memorandum of Understanding with MAS to jointly build the Global Trade Connectivity Network (GTCN), which would connect Singapore’s National Trade Platform to the HKTFP to form a cross-border DLT infrastructure in order to digitalise cross-border trade and trade finance processes, making them safer, more efficient and costeffective. It will be an open platform that allows other interested jurisdictions to participate in the future. The GTCN is expected to be launched in the first quarter of 2019.\n\n# Fintech Supervisory Sandbox\n\nThe FSS launched by the HKMA in September 2016 was upgraded to FSS 2.0 to expedite communication with banks and tech firms to facilitate new ideas and initiatives. Specifically, FSS 2.0 has the following new features:\n- A Fintech Supervisory Chatroom is set up to provide feedback to banks and tech firms at an early stage of their fintech projects.\n- Tech firms can access the FSS by seeking feedback from the Chatroom without going through a bank.\n- The sandboxes of the HKMA, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Insurance Authority are linked up so that there is a single point of entry for pilot trials of cross-sector fintech products.\n\nAs of end-2017, 28 new technology products have been tested in the FSS. Out of these cases, 14 pilot trials have been completed, and the relevant products have been rolled out to the market subsequently.\n\n# Banking Made Easy initiative\n\nA Banking Made Easy initiative was launched to minimise regulatory frictions hindering technological innovations. A taskforce has been set up with current focus on the following areas:\n- Remote onboarding and account maintenance\n- Online finance\n- Online wealth management\n\n# Virtual Banking\n\nVirtual banks, which operate without physical branches, are expected to provide additional impetus to the application of fintech in Hong Kong and offer a new kind of customer experience in mobile and digital banking. They may also help promote financial inclusion as they normally target the retail segment, be they individuals or small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The HKMA has commenced the review of the existing Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks with a view to facilitating the introduction of virtual banking in Hong Kong.\n\n# A New Era of Smart Banking\n\n# Supervision and Innovation\n\nThe seven initiatives unveiled by the HKMA last year to prepare Hong Kong for a new era of Smart Banking are a large-scale project involving cooperation among various departments within the HKMA. With fintech becoming an unstoppable force, Mr Raymond Chan, Executive Director (Banking Supervision) of the HKMA, indicated that the HKMA, as a regulator, must embrace this new trend by keeping abreast of the latest technological developments and adjusting its supervisory mindset and approach as appropriate, in order to take bank services and customer experience to a new level.\n","terms":{"10 Years Plus Caring Organisation Logo":["10年Plus同心展關懷標誌"],"10-Year US Treasury yield":["10年期美國國庫券收益率"],"10-year US Treasury yield":["美國十年期國庫債券收益率"],"10th Asian Financial

國際金融中心\n\n為鞏固香港作為國際金融中心的地位，金管局致力提升香港金融平台的競爭力。在金融科技方面，七項旨在促進金融科技在銀行業和支付行業發展及應用的新措施，受到業界和公眾的歡迎。香港作為基建投資融資樞紐的國際地位進一步提升，這歸功於一系列在相關領域的網絡和能力建設工作。債券通的推出強化了香港作為通往內地機遇的主要門戶的地位。金管局在其他領域（如企業財資中心）的努力也取得了成果。\n\n# 概述\n\n鑑於科技發展迅速，金管局於九月宣布推出七項措施，為香港邁向智慧銀行新紀元做好準備。這些措施包括：\n- 開發快速支付系統（FPS），以實現數位零售支付的全面互聯互通；\n- 引入開放應用程式介面（Open API）框架；\n- 強化金融科技研究和人才培育；\n- 加強金融科技領域的跨境合作；\n- 將現有的金融科技監管沙盒（FSS）1.0升級至2.0版；\n- 促進虛擬銀行的引入；以及\n- 推行「輕鬆銀行服務」新措施，以減少客戶在數位體驗中的監管摩擦。\n\n金管局金融科技促進辦公室（FFO）與金管局的銀行部門共同合作，在推動落實這些措施方面發揮了關鍵作用，以強化香港作為亞洲金融科技樞紐的地位。\n\n香港作為基建投資融資樞紐的國際地位進一步提升，截至2018年1月31日，金管局基建融資促進辦公室（IFFO）的合作夥伴數量從成立初的約40家增加至87家。在過去一年中，IFFO組織和參與了超過10場研討會和工作坊，以促進主要利益相關者之間的經驗分享和協作網絡。特別值得一提的是，IFFO在首屆債權融資及投資者圓桌會議上引領制定了基建股權投資參考條款，以提升基建項目的銀行可融資性和投資吸引力。\n\n債券通於七月推出，標誌著香港與內地資本市場互聯互通方面又一重要里程碑，進一步鞏固了香港作為國際投資者進入內地市場的主要門戶的地位。在過去一年中，香港人民幣合格境外機構投資者（RQFII）的額度從人民幣2,700億元增加至5,000億元。香港保持了全球最大的離岸人民幣資金池，人民幣金融中介活動活躍，這從香港人民幣即時支付結算（RTGS）系統的交易量高企和香港在全球人民幣支付活動中佔據主導地位可見一斑。\n\n繼2016年推出企業財資中心稅務優惠後，金管局加大了外聯工作力度，以吸引更多跨國企業在香港設立財資中心。截至2017年底，超過40家企業向金管局表示，它們正在積極規劃或已在香港設立財資中心業務。\n\n金管局積極參與國際上關於全球和區域金融穩定重大議題的討論。金管局總裁於四月成為金融穩定委員會（FSB）監管合作常設委員會（SRC）的主席，領導關於金融穩定關鍵議題的討論。\n\n香港金融基礎設施的安全和高效運作，為香港作為國際金融中心和全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐奠定了堅實基礎。2017年，四個銀行同業交易的RTGS系統和債務工具中央結算系統（CMU）實現了100%的系統可用性，而目標為99.95%。為支持債券通北向交易，CMU已與內地兩家中央證券託管機構（CSDs）建立帳戶，以促進債券通交易的結算，並代表相關CMU成員持有內地債務證券。\n\n為提升本地零售支付行業的整體安全性和效率，金管局於八月根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（《支付條例》）指定了四個零售支付系統（RPSs），將其運作納入金管局的監管範圍。金管局還對16家儲值支付工具持牌人進行了監管，這些持牌人積極推出新產品和服務，以為客戶提供更多選擇和更好的用戶體驗。此外，電子支票及電子帳單及繳費服務（EBPP）的覆蓋範圍進一步擴大，涵蓋了香港與廣東省全境之間的跨境支付交易。\n\n# 2017年回顧\n\n# 香港作為亞洲金融科技樞紐\n\n# 智慧銀行措施\n\n鑑於科技發展迅速，金管局於九月宣布七項措施，為香港邁向智慧銀行新紀元做好準備。這些措施旨在幫助銀行業提升至更高水平，擁抱銀行業與科技結合所帶來的巨大機遇。\n\n「智慧銀行將為零售和企業客戶提供全面互聯互通，讓金融服務和交易能夠以高度的流動性、速度、便利性和安全性進行。」\n\n金管局一直與銀行業和金融科技界緊密合作，並在落實七項措施方面取得了良好進展。\n\n# 快速支付系統\n\n快速支付系統（FPS）是一個多幣種平台，讓公眾能夠透過手機號碼或電郵地址，隨時隨地輕鬆進行即時資金轉帳。該系統支援港元及人民幣付款。銀行及非銀行支付服務供應商均可參與快速支付系統，令所有支付參與者全面互聯互通。系統開發工作已接近完成，預計於2018年9月推出。\n\n此外，金管局牽頭成立了一個工作小組，成員包括主要信用卡計畫營運商、銀行、持牌儲值支付工具營運商及收單機構，以制定香港零售支付的通用QR碼標準。通用QR碼標準將有助商戶使用單一QR碼接受多個支付服務供應商的QR碼支付方案，為客戶及商戶提供更大便利。工作小組已完成相關技術規範，並將制定實施安排。\n\n# 開放應用程式介面\n\n開放API讓銀行數據可供第三方存取，以促進銀行服務與其他行業服務的更好及更便捷整合。用戶因此可便捷地留在同一系統內，在安全環境下享受整合服務。為促進銀行業發展及採用開放API，金管局制定了開放API框架草案，內容涵蓋開放API功能及部署時間表、技術標準、第三方服務供應商管治、促進措施及維護模式等，供業界諮詢兩個月。\n\n# 研究與人才培育\n\n其中一項主要研究項目是分布式分類帳技術（DLT）。繼2016年發布首份DLT白皮書後，第二份DLT白皮書於2017年10月發布。第二份白皮書進一步探討了三個概念驗證項目，分別為貿易融資、數位身分管理及按揭申請。它還就與管治、法律和合規相關的實施問題，以及為銀行業和支付行業部署DLT的一般控制原則提供了建議。\n\n金管局總裁陳德霖先生在金管局金融科技日上宣布發布第二份DLT白皮書。\n\n在金管局牽頭的貿易融資概念驗證項目取得成功後，香港七家銀行決定將原型商業化，開發名為香港貿易融資平台（HKTFP）的生產系統，以數位化和共享貿易文件，並自動化流程，以期改善整體貿易流程，降低貿易融資業務中的風險和詐騙行為。\n\n為擴大金融科技行業的人才庫，金管局於2016年12月與香港應用科技研究院合作推出金融科技人才培育計畫。學生反應熱烈，共收到來自421名申請者的3,000多份申請。最終，74名學生接受了金管局和12家銀行的實習邀請，從7月起從事金融科技相關項目，為期六個月或一年。\n\n# 跨境合作\n\n作為加強粵港澳大灣區合作的初步措施，我們與深圳合作，共同促進金融科技和人才發展。具體而言，金管局與深圳市人民政府金融發展服務辦公室（OFDS）於六月簽訂協議，以（一）為金融科技公司提供相互的軟著陸支援，（二）於十月共同舉辦深港金融科技創新獎，以表彰和獎勵兩地優秀的金融科技產品和解決方案；以及（三）為香港學生安排在深圳金融科技和科技金融公司進行暑期實習。\n\n金管局總裁陳德霖先生（中）在金管局金融科技日上，與深圳金融辦主任何曉軍先生（左）及數碼港主席李家賢博士簽署軟著陸安排諒解備忘錄。\n\n深港金融科技創新獎電子宣傳單張。\n\n金管局還與新加坡金融管理局（MAS）和杜拜金融服務管理局簽署了金融科技合作協議，內容涉及創新項目、創新企業推薦、資訊共享和專業知識交流。\n\n十一月，金管局進一步與MAS簽署諒解備忘錄，共同建立全球貿易連接網絡（GTCN），將新加坡的國家貿易平台與香港貿易融資平台（HKTFP）連接起來，形成跨境DLT基礎設施，以數位化跨境貿易和貿易融資流程，使其更安全、更高效和更具成本效益。這將是一個開放平台，未來將允許其他感興趣的司法管轄區參與。GTCN預計將於2019年第一季度推出。\n\n# 金融科技監管沙盒\n\n金管局於2016年9月推出的金融科技監管沙盒已升級至沙盒2.0版，以加快與銀行和科技公司的溝通，促進新想法和新措施的落實。具體而言，沙盒2.0版具有以下新功能：\n- 設立金融科技監管聊天室，在金融科技項目的早期階段為銀行和科技公司提供回饋。\n- 科技公司可透過向聊天室尋求回饋來使用沙盒，無需透過銀行。\n- 金管局、證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）和保險業監管局的沙盒相互連結，為跨部門金融科技產品的試行提供單一入口點。\n\n截至2017年底，共有28項新技術產品在沙盒中進行了測試。其中，14項試行已完成，相關產品隨後已推向市場。\n\n# 輕鬆銀行服務措施\n\n推出「輕鬆銀行服務」措施，以減少阻礙技術創新的監管要求。已成立一個專責小組，目前重點關注以下領域：\n- 遙距開戶及維持戶口\n- 網上金融\n- 網上財富管理\n\n# 虛擬銀行\n\n虛擬銀行無需實體分行營運，預期可為香港金融科技的應用提供額外動力，並為客戶提供嶄新的行動及數位銀行體驗。由於虛擬銀行一般以零售業務為目標，客戶可以是個人或中小型企業，故它們亦有助促進普及金融。金管局已開始檢討現有的《虛擬銀行的認可》指引，以促進虛擬銀行在香港的引入。\n\n# 智慧銀行新紀元\n\n# 監管與創新\n\n金管局去年公布了七項措施，為香港邁向智慧銀行新紀元做好準備，這是一個涉及金管局內多個部門合作的重大項目。隨著金融科技成為一股不可阻擋的力量，金管局助理總裁（銀行監理）陳維民先生表示，金管局作為監管機構，必須擁抱這一新趨勢，緊跟最新技術發展，並適當調整監管思維和方法，以將銀行服務和客戶體驗提升至新水平。"}
{"en":"# Reserves Management\n\nThe global economy and financial markets performed better than expected in 2017. Global equity markets went up on the back of synchronised economic growth in major developed and emerging market economies, strong corporate earnings, and market expectation of slow and gradual tightening of monetary policies by major central banks. While the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates three times as expected, and began to reduce its balance sheet in October, the 10- Year US Treasury yield remained stable and the US dollar weakened (rather than strengthened) against other major currencies. Under such a favourable environment, the Exchange Fund’s investment income reached a record high of HK$264 billion in 2017, representing an investment return of 7.4%.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary and may be invested in securities or other assets he considers appropriate, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC).\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nEFAC has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n(a) to preserve capital;\n(b) to ensure the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(c) to ensure sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) subject to (a)–(c), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the Fund’s long-term purchasing power.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund.\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP). The BP holds highly liquid US dollardenominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The IP is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of the assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA has been diversifying part of the Exchange Fund’s investments, in a prudent and incremental manner, into a wider variety of asset classes, including emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity and real estate. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The cap for the market value of investments under the LTGP is set at onethird of the accumulated surplus of the Exchange Fund, with further capacity arising from the allocation of part of the Future Fund to long-term assets.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007 to hold shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that were acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes, is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of the unique nature of this Portfolio.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by fiscal reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP1, with the exception of the Future Fund which links its interest rate to both the IP and the LTGP depending on the portfolio mix. As at the end of 2017, the portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 65:35. The portion of the Future Fund linked with the LTGP is expected to gradually build up to around 50% by 2018.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation. The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents the long-term optimal asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark, or strategic allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and tracking error limit are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may take positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nHKMA staff in the Reserves Management Department directly manage about 73% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, which includes the entire BP and part of the IP. This part of the IP includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 27% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes. The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to capture sustainable returns, to benefit from diverse and complementary investment styles and to share market insights and technical expertise with the Exchange Fund.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is primarily determined by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe high volatility of the financial markets subsequent to the 2008\/09 global financial crisis has highlighted the importance of risk management. Stringent controls and investment guidelines have been established for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and compliance with guidelines and regulations is closely monitored. Risk assessment has been strengthened to support the Exchange Fund’s increased pace of investment diversification. Risk-control tools are deployed to assess market risks under both normal and adverse market conditions. Detailed performance attribution analyses are also conducted to identify sources of performance, allowing the HKMA to make the best use of the investment skills of internal and external managers.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nThe HKMA is supportive of responsible investment. For instance, the HKMA supports the Principles of Responsible Ownership issued by the Securities and Futures Commission on 7 March 2016, which are voluntary and help investors determine how best to meet their ownership responsibilities in relation to their investments in Hong Kong-listed companies. For the management of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA has encouraged the appointed external fund managers for its Hong Kong equity portfolio to adopt the Principles of Responsible Ownership in managing the investments. Furthermore, the front offices and the Risk Management and Compliance Division have incorporated environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into various internal procedures for making and monitoring investment activities. The HKMA will closely monitor the development of ESG standards and assess how these standards can be further integrated into the investment process.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2017\n\nThe global economy and financial markets in 2017 performed better than expected. On the back of synchronised economic growth in major developed and emerging market economies, strong corporate earnings, and market expectation of slow and gradual tightening of monetary policies by major central banks, the global equity markets performed well. In particular, the Hong Kong equity market rose by 36%, outperforming other major equity markets.\n\nIn the bond markets, short-dated US Treasury yields shot up as the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates three times as expected, and began to reduce its balance sheet in October. Nevertheless, the 10-year US Treasury yield remained stable at about 2.4% over the year. Other major 10-Year government bond yields also ended the year little changed, with the exception of German Bunds which rose on the euro area’s solid economic growth and market expectation of the European Central Bank’s policy tightening.\n\nIn the currency markets, the US dollar weakened against other major currencies, despite the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes and the beginning of its balance sheet reduction. The depreciation of the US dollar was a result of the reviving economic growth in Europe and Japan, and market expectation of diminishing monetary policy divergence between the US and other major economies. The euro and yen appreciated by around 14% and 4% respectively against the US dollar in 2017.\n\nThe performance of major currencies as well as bond and equity markets in 2017 is shown in Table 1.\n\nTable 1 2017 market returns\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$264 billion in 2017. This comprised gains of HK$80.4 billion on overseas equities, gains of HK$58.3 billion on Hong Kong equities, gains of HK$34.4 billion on bonds, a positive currency translation effect of HK$53.5 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets and gains of HK$37.4 billion on other investments held by the investment holding subsidiaries of the Exchange Fund. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$4.5 billion.\n\nThe investment income of HK$264 billion last year is a record high for the Exchange Fund, surpassing the previous record in 2007 (HK$142.2 billion) by HK$121.8 billion.\n\nThe total assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,015.3 billion at year end. The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$235.6 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$157.2 billion and real estate at HK$78.4 billion. Outstanding investment commitments amounted to HK$162.4 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund (excluding the Strategic Portfolio) in 2017 was 7.4%. Specifically, the IP achieved a rate of return of 12.1%, while the BP gained 1.8%. The LTGP recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 13.7% since its inception in 2009.\n\nThe annual return of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2017 is set out in Chart 1. Table 2 shows the 2017 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over several different time horizons. The average return was 2.9% over the past three years, 2.5% over the past five years, 2.2% over the past ten years and 4.9% since 1994. Table 3 shows the currency mix of the Fund’s assets as at 31 December 2017.\n\nHKMA Deputy Chief Executive, Mr Eddie Yue (middle), speaks at the press conference on 2017 Exchange Fund Results.\n\nChart 1 Investment return of the Exchange Fund (1994–2017)\n\nTable 2 Investment return of the Exchange Fund in Hong Kong dollar terms\n\nTable 3 Currency mix of the Exchange Fund’s assets

儲備管理\n\n2017年全球經濟和金融市場表現優於預期。在全球主要已開發經濟體和新興市場經濟體同步增長的支撐下，加上企業獲利強勁，以及市場預期主要央行會逐步緩慢收緊貨幣政策，環球股市上揚。雖然美國聯邦儲備局如預期般加息三次，並於十月開始縮減資產負債表，但10年期美國國庫券收益率保持穩定，而美元兌其他主要貨幣則轉弱（而非轉強）。在如此有利的環境下，外匯基金的投資收入在2017年創下歷史新高，達2,640億港元，投資回報率為7.4%。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n《外匯基金條例》訂明，外匯基金的主要目的是直接或間接影響香港貨幣的匯率。基金亦可用以維持香港貨幣及金融制度的穩定和完整，以助維持香港作為國際金融中心。外匯基金由財政司司長管理，經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）後，可投資於他認為適當的證券或其他資產。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標及組合結構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會為外匯基金訂立了以下投資目標：\n(a) 保存資本；\n(b) 確保貨幣基礎在任何時候均獲足額的高度流動美元資產支持；\n(c) 確保有足夠的流動性，以維持貨幣及金融穩定；及\n(d) 在符合(a)至(c)項的前提下，達致有助保存基金長期購買力的投資回報。\n\n這些目標充分考慮了外匯基金的法定目的，並已納入基金的組合結構和目標資產配置中。\n\n概括而言，外匯基金有兩個主要組合：支持組合（BP）及投資組合（IP）。BP持有高度流動的美元資產，以根據貨幣發行局制度的要求，為貨幣基礎提供足額支持。IP主要投資於經濟合作暨發展組織成員國的債券及股票市場，以保存資產的價值和長期購買力。\n\n為更好地管理風險及提升中長期回報，金管局一直以審慎和循序漸進的方式，將外匯基金部分投資分散至更多元化的資產類別，包括新興市場及內地債券與股票、私募股權及房地產。新興市場及內地債券與股票歸入IP持有，而私募股權及房地產投資則歸入長期增長組合（LTGP）。LTGP的投資市值上限為外匯基金累計盈餘的三分之一，而未來基金撥作長期資產的款項亦會增加LTGP的投資容量。\n\n策略性資產組合成立於2007年，目的是持有政府為外匯基金策略性用途而購入的香港交易及結算所有限公司的股份，由於該組合的性質獨特，故不納入基金的投資表現評估範圍內。\n\n# 外匯基金的存款安排\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定機構的存款。除未來基金外，其利率一般與IP1的表現掛鉤，而未來基金的利率則按組合比重與IP及LTGP掛鉤。截至2017年底，未來基金在IP及LTGP之間的組合比重約為65:35。未來基金與LTGP掛鉤的部分預期在2018年逐步增至約50%。\n\n# 投資程序\n\n外匯基金的投資程序以兩種資產配置決定為基礎：策略性資產配置及戰術性資產配置。策略性資產配置反映在投資基準中，代表了根據外匯基金的投資目標而作出的長期最佳資產配置。在策略性配置的指引下，資產會以戰術性方式配置，以求取得高於基準的回報。這意味著實際配置往往與基準或策略性配置有所不同。實際配置與基準配置之間的差異稱為「戰術偏差」。基準及循跡誤差限額由財政司司長與外匯基金諮詢委員會商討後決定，而戰術性決定及戰術偏差的容許範圍則由金管局根據授權制定及設定。在戰術偏差的容許範圍內，投資組合經理可採取倉位，以把握短期市場波動的機會。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局儲備管理部的員工直接管理約73%的外匯基金投資，包括整個BP及部分IP。這部分IP包括一系列投資於全球固定收益市場的組合，以及多個衍生工具組合，以實施基金的宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 聘用外部投資經理\n\n除了內部管理資產外，金管局亦聘用外部基金經理管理約27%的外匯基金資產，包括所有上市股票組合及其他特殊資產類別。聘用外部投資經理的目的，是運用市場上最佳的專業投資技術以獲取可持續的回報，受惠於多元化及互補的投資風格，並與外匯基金分享市場見解及技術專長。\n\n與聘用外部投資經理相關的開支包括基金管理費、託管費、交易費，以及代扣稅款及其他稅項。該開支主要由市場因素決定，並可能每年有所波動。\n\n# 風險管理及合規\n\n自2008至2009年全球金融危機後，金融市場波動性增加，突顯了風險管理的重要性。已為內部及外部管理的投資組合制定嚴格的監控措施及投資指引，並密切監察對指引及規定的遵守情況。風險評估工作已獲強化，以支持外匯基金加快投資多元化的步伐。風險管控工具被用以評估正常及不利市場情況下的市場風險。此外，亦會進行詳盡的投資表現因素分析，以找出表現的來源，讓金管局能充分運用內部及外部投資經理的投資技巧。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n金管局支持負責任投資。例如，金管局支持證券及期貨事務監察委員會於2016年3月7日發出的《負責任的擁有權原則》，該原則屬自願性質，協助投資者釐定如何在投資香港上市公司時，最妥善地履行其擁有權責任。在管理外匯基金方面，金管局已鼓勵委任的外部香港股票投資基金經理在管理投資時採用《負責任的擁有權原則》。此外，前線投資部門及風險管理及監察處已將環境、社會及管治（ESG）因素納入多項制定及監察投資活動的內部程序中。金管局會密切監察ESG標準的發展，並評估如何將這些標準進一步融入投資程序中。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2017年的金融市場\n\n2017年全球經濟和金融市場表現優於預期。在全球主要已開發經濟體和新興市場經濟體同步增長的支撐下，加上企業獲利強勁，以及市場預期主要央行會逐步緩慢收緊貨幣政策，環球股市表現理想。當中，香港股市升幅達36%，表現優於其他主要股市。\n\n在債券市場方面，由於美國聯邦儲備局如預期般加息三次，並於十月開始縮減資產負債表，短期美國國庫券收益率急升。然而，美國十年期國庫債券收益率在全年維持穩定，約為2.4%。其他主要10年期政府債券收益率在年內亦變化不大，只有德國政府債券收益率上升，原因是歐元區經濟增長強勁，以及市場預期歐洲中央銀行會收緊政策。\n\n在貨幣市場方面，儘管美國聯邦儲備局加息及開始縮減資產負債表，美元兌其他主要貨幣仍轉弱。美元貶值是由於歐洲及日本經濟增長復甦，以及市場預期美國與其他主要經濟體的貨幣政策差距會縮小。2017年，歐元及日圓兌美元分別升值約14%及4%。\n\n2017年主要貨幣、債券及股票市場的表現載於表1。\n\n表1 2017年市場回報\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n外匯基金在2017年的投資收入為2,640億港元，包括海外股票錄得收益804億港元、香港股票錄得收益583億港元、債券錄得收益344億港元、非港元資產產生535億港元的正向匯兌效應，以及外匯基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資錄得收益374億港元。此外，策略性資產組合錄得估值收益45億港元。\n\n去年2,640億港元的投資收入是外匯基金歷來最高，較2007年的舊紀錄（1,422億港元）高出1,218億港元。\n\n外匯基金的資產總值在年底達40,153億港元。長期增長組合的投資市值總額為2,356億港元，其中私募股權為1,572億港元，房地產為784億港元。已承擔但尚未提取作投資的總額為1,624億港元。\n\n外匯基金（不包括策略性資產組合）在2017年的投資回報率為7.4%。具體而言，IP的回報率為12.1%，而BP的回報率則為1.8%。自2009年成立以來，LTGP的年化內部回報率為13.7%。\n\n外匯基金由1994年至2017年的年度回報載於圖1。表2顯示基金在2017年的投資回報，以及基金在不同時間區間內的平均投資回報。過去三年的平均回報為2.9%，過去五年為2.5%，過去十年為2.2%，而自1994年以來則為4.9%。表3顯示截至2017年12月31日基金資產的貨幣分布（包括遠期交易）。\n\n金管局副總裁余偉文先生（中）在2017年外匯基金業績記者會上發言。\n\n圖1

{"en":"# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communication with the community and the market through the media, public education programmes and other various channels to facilitate public understanding of its policies and operations. During the year, the HKMA continued to improve corporate governance by supporting professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline and enhancing IT security to cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives and the increasing complexity of work.\n\n# ENGAGING THE COMMUNITY CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT\n\n# Media relations\n\nThe HKMA works closely with the media to enhance transparency and promote public understanding about its policies and work. In 2017, 86 open press events were organised, comprising nine press conferences, 16 stand-up interviews and 61 other public functions. In addition, 42 media interviews were arranged and a total of 360 bilingual press releases were issued. It also handles a large number of media enquiries every day.\n\nTo raise awareness of the HKMA’s key functions, guided tours were organised for the media to visit the newly revamped HKMA Information Centre. Furthermore, indepth media briefings and educational workshops were conducted for local and overseas media on a wide range of topics, including the Bond Connect scheme, prudential measures for property mortgage loans, the Resolution Regime and Exchange Fund investments.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan, introduces a mosaic artwork called “Small Change, Big Ode” to the media at the HKMA Information Centre. The artwork, featuring the Victoria Harbour and the Hong Kong skyline, was created using a total of 135,811 pieces of Hong Kong coins in different denominations.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan, conducts a media interview with local newspapers regarding the key initiatives of the HKMA’s Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office and Fintech Facilitation Office.\n\n# Public enquiries\n\nThe Public Enquiry Service provides an effective means for the public to better understand the key functions and operations of the HKMA. A total of 8,752 enquiries were handled in 2017, about half of which were related to banking policies and regulations, monetary and economic issues, consumer banking issues as well as notes and coins. Notable examples included the Coin Collection Programme, banking products and services, bankingrelated guidelines and circulars, monetary and economic statistics, prudential measures for property mortgage loans, and prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received since 2014 and Chart 2 provides a breakdown in terms of the nature of enquiries received in 2017.\n\nChart 1 Total number of public enquiries\n\nChart 2 Nature of enquiries received in 2017\n\n# Publications\n\nApart from the HKMA Annual Report, in 2017 the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report and four issues of the Quarterly Bulletin, and released regular updates of the Monthly Statistical Bulletin to provide up-to-date and thematic information and analyses on monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. In addition, the HKMA issued a total of 23 inSight articles, covering various topical issues related to its work.\n\n# HKMA website\n\nThe HKMA corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk), with over 60,000 pages in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, is the public access gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It also contains the register of authorized institutions (AIs) and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the register of stored value facility (SVF) licensees under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance. Dedicated webpages and eye-catching short-cut links are designed to draw public attention to the new initiatives of the HKMA, such as account opening, the regulatory regime for SVFs, the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office and the Fintech Facilitation Office, as well as important and timely information, such as reminders on the need to remain vigilant against bogus telephone calls and the location of Coin Carts under the Coin Collection Programme.\n\n# Public Education Programme\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre is an important resource for introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters. It consists of an exhibition area and a library, and is open to the public six days a week. The exhibition area introduces the work of the HKMA and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong. It also contains reading materials and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nThe new look of the policy section of the Information Centre, which introduces the work of the HKMA and related financial concepts, was re-opened to the public on 24 February 2017 upon completion of the refurbishment work. The revamped policy section contains various interactive games and devices that integrate play into learning and explain complicated financial concepts in a simple way. Feedback from the visitors has been positive.\n\nStudents try out the educational games at the policy section of the Information Centre to learn about the work of the HKMA.\n\nGuided tours of the Information Centre are organised for visitors. During the year, it received more than 59,000 visitors and hosted over 650 guided tours for schools and other groups (Chart 3). More than 645,000 people have visited the Information Centre since it opened in December 2003.\n\nThe library, situated next to the exhibition area, houses more than 23,000 books, journals and other publications for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs and central banking topics. It also maintains the register of AIs and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nThe library in the HKMA Information Centre.\n\nTo reach out to the community and raise public awareness of the HKMA’s work, the HKMA organised four public education seminars for about 2,000 secondary school students and teachers in 2017. Topics covered in the seminars included the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, banking stability, consumer protection, the Deposit Protection Scheme, fintech, the Belt and Road Initiative and careers in the financial industry. More than 58,400 people have participated in this public education programme since its launch in 1998.\n\nStudents and teachers from secondary schools in different districts participate in one of the public education seminars.\n\nChart 3 Types of group visits to the Information Centre in 2017\n\n# HUMAN RESOURCES\n\nThe HKMA recruits, develops and maintains a highly professional workforce to support its policy objectives and respond flexibly to changing work priorities. While the HKMA is an integral part of the Government, it employs staff on terms different from those of the civil service to attract personnel with the right experience and expertise. As a public organisation, the HKMA aims to maintain a lean and flexible structure and, where possible, to redeploy staff resources to undertake new initiatives and meet increasing workload.\n\n# Organisational changes\n\nThe Resolution Office was established on 1 April 2017 to implement the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance enacted in June 2016. The Office aims to ensure that the Hong Kong resolution regime is operational for banks. This is essential to enhancing the resilience of the Hong Kong banking sector in the event of any crisis.\n\n# Staffing\n\nThe establishment of the HKMA in 2017 was 927. This will be increased by 35 to 962 in 2018 (an increase of 3.8%) to ensure that sufficient resources are provided to cope with the new initiatives and the increasing complexity and volume of existing work. The new posts are deployed to the following functions:\n\n- Enhancing banking and financial stability, which includes:\n    – enhancing capacity to support the launch of the Faster Payment System and easy banking initiatives;\n    – strengthening supervisory capacity to deal with the regional and business expansion of banks and to facilitate (i) the wider adoption of fintech in the provision of banking services and (ii) collaboration with other regulatory authorities on cyber security and fintech issues; and\n    – supporting the work of the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce to fight against fraud, money laundering and other types of financial crimes, and strengthening legal support for enforcement actions under legislation governing anti-money laundering and SVFs.\n- Strengthening investment, risk management and other related support for the further expansion and diversification of the Exchange Fund’s investment activities.\n- Stepping up global macro and financial-sector surveillance, and strengthening talent development programmes to ensure that the HKMA has the necessary human capital to meet the long-term development needs of the organisation.\n\nTable 1 gives a breakdown of the establishment and strength of the HKMA.\n\nTable 1 Establishment and strength of the HKMA on 1 January 2018\n\nTemporary resources are deployed to meet other work demands. The HKMA also transfers staff members on secondment to other international or local organisations, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Services Development Council, to assist in activities or policy initiatives in which Hong Kong or the HKMA has an interest. Some staff members are deployed on a full-time or part-time basis to provide operational support to the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board and the Treasury Markets Association.\n\n# Remuneration policies and pay review mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary (FS) determines the pay and conditions of service for HKMA staff on the advice of the Governance Sub-Committee (GSC) through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC), taking into account the prevailing market rates and practices. Remuneration comprises a total cash package and a provident fund scheme, with minimal benefits in kind. The cash package consists of monthly fixed pay (or basic pay) and variable pay, which may be awarded to individual staff members as a lump sum once a year, depending on performance.\n\nPay for HKMA staff is reviewed annually by the FS in the light of recommendations made to him by the GSC through the EFAC, taking into account the GSC’s assessment of the performance of the HKMA in the preceding year, the paysurvey findings of the financial sector conducted by independent human resources consultants, and any other relevant factors. Special pay adjustments may be made from time to time for individual meritorious staff members to maintain their pay competitiveness.\n\nAny approved annual adjustments to the fixed pay and any variable pay awards for the HKMA are distributed to individual staff members based on their performance. Investment professionals in the HKMA are subject to a variable pay system that seeks to strengthen the link between their investment performance and remuneration award. The pay adjustments and awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Executive Director and above are approved by the FS on the advice of the GSC. The staff members concerned are not present at the meetings when their pay is discussed. The pay adjustments and awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Division Head and below are determined by the Chief Executive of the HKMA under delegated authority from the FS and within the approved overall pay awards.\n\n# Remuneration of senior staff members\n\nThe remuneration packages of senior staff members in 2017 are shown in Table 2.\n\nTable 2 Remuneration packages of HKMA senior staff members in 2017\n\n# Manager Trainee (MT) and Graduate Economist (GE) programmes\n\nTo develop a pool of young talent with sharp analytical minds, strong communication skills and good team spirit for a long-term career in central banking, the HKMA runs two trainee programmes: the MT programme and the GE programme. Each programme lasts for a period of two years.\n\nThe MT programme prepares young graduates interested in central banking work to become the HKMA’s future key management staff and contribute to the financial stability and prosperity of Hong Kong. Each MT undergoes on-the-job training in two to three departments to acquire hands-on experience on the important functions of the HKMA. For the GE programme, young graduates interested in economic research are offered the opportunity to harness their research skills in two to three departments to provide important input to the policy formulation process.\n\nBoth the MT and GE programmes provide an all-rounded career development environment for the trainees.

{"en":"# The Exchange Fund\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 157 to 243, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2017, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2017, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards.  My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report.  I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards.  I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017.  These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information.  The other information comprises all the information included in the 2017 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.  If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact.  I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.  I also:\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.  The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.  If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion.  My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report.  However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and\n- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements.  I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit.  I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nDavid Sun\nDirector of Audit\n\n11 April 2018\n\n# 1 PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES\n\nThe Monetary Authority, under delegated authority from the Financial Secretary as Controller of the Exchange Fund (the Fund), manages the Fund in accordance with the provisions of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).  The principal activities of the Fund are safeguarding the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong and maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems.\n\nThe assets of the Fund are managed as four portfolios: the Backing Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio and the Strategic Portfolio.  The assets of the Backing Portfolio fully match the Monetary Base, under Hong Kong’s Currency Board system.  The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.  The Long-Term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments.  The Strategic Portfolio holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited acquired by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) for the account of the Fund for strategic purposes. Operating segment information is set out in note 30.\n\n# 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n# 2.1 Statement of compliance\n\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with all applicable Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRSs), which is a collective term that includes all applicable individual Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, Hong Kong Accounting Standards (HKASs) and Interpretations issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), and accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong.  A summary of the significant accounting policies adopted by the Fund and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) is set out below.\n\nThe HKICPA has issued certain new and revised HKFRSs that are first effective or available for early adoption for the current accounting period.  Note 3 provides information on the changes, if any, in accounting policies resulting from initial adoption of these developments to the extent that they are relevant to the Group for the current and prior accounting periods reflected in these financial statements.\n\n# 2.2 Basis of preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe Group financial statements include the financial statements of the Group as well as the Group’s interests in associates and joint ventures.  The principal activities of the principal subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are shown in notes 16 and 17.\n\nThe measurement basis used in the preparation of the financial statements is historical cost except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair values as explained in the accounting policies set out below:\n- trading financial instruments (note 2.6.2.1);\n- financial assets and financial liabilities designated at fair value (note 2.6.2.2);\n- available-for-sale securities (note 2.6.2.5);\n- gold (note 2.11); and\n- investment properties (note 2.12).\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with HKFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure.  The estimates and associated assumptions are based on experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.  Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nNote 18 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of investment properties.  Note 36 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of financial instruments.  Apart from the accounting judgements involving these fair value estimations, there are no other critical accounting judgements involved in the application of the Group’s accounting policies.\n\n# 2.3 Subsidiaries and non-controlling interests\n\nA subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group.  The Group controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.  When assessing whether the Group has power, only substantive rights (held by the Group and other parties) are considered.\n","terms":{"10 Years Plus Caring Organisation

意見\n\n我已審核外匯基金及其附屬公司（統稱「該集團」）的財務報表，該報表載於第157至243頁，包括外匯基金及該集團截至2017年12月31日的資產負債表，以及該年度的收支帳目、全面收益表、權益變動表和現金流量表，還有財務報表附註，包括重要會計政策概要。\n\n我認為，該財務報表按照香港會計師公會（「香港會計師公會」）頒布的香港財務報告準則（「香港財務報告準則」），真實而公允地反映了該基金及該集團截至2017年12月31日的財務狀況，以及該年度的財務表現和現金流量，並已按照行政長官根據《外匯基金條例》（第66章）第7條發出的指示妥善編製。\n\n# 意見依據\n\n我依據行政長官按照《外匯基金條例》第7條發出的指示及審計署審計準則進行審核。我根據這些準則所承擔的責任，在我報告的「審計師對財務報表審核的責任」一節中作了進一步說明。我依據這些準則，與該集團保持獨立性，並履行了其他道德責任。我相信，我所獲得的審計憑證充分而適當，足以作為我提出意見的依據。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項是指我在專業判斷中認為對2017年12月31日止年度財務報表審核最具重要性的事項。這些事項是在我審核財務報表的整體情況下考慮的，我在形成意見時亦考慮了這些事項，但我不會就這些事項單獨發表意見。\n\n# 其他資訊\n\n其他資訊由金融管理局負責。其他資訊包括香港金融管理局2017年年報中載列的所有資訊，但不包括財務報表及我就該報表所發表的審計師報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見並不涵蓋其他資訊，我亦不就其他資訊發表任何形式的保證結論。\n\n在審核財務報表時，我的責任是閱讀其他資訊，並考慮其他資訊是否與財務報表或我在審核中獲得的知識有重大不一致，或是否似乎有重大錯報。如果我根據所進行的工作得出結論，認為其他資訊存在重大錯報，我有責任報告該事實。在這一方面，我沒有任何事項需要報告。\n\n# 金融管理局及外匯基金諮詢委員會審核小組委員會對財務報表的責任\n\n金融管理局負責按照香港會計師公會頒布的香港財務報告準則及行政長官根據《外匯基金條例》第7條發出的指示，編製真實而公允的財務報表，並負責金融管理局認為必要的內部控制，以使編製的財務報表不存在因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯報。\n\n在編製財務報表時，金融管理局負責評估該集團作為持續經營的能力，酌情披露與持續經營有關的事項，並採用持續經營的會計基礎。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會審核小組委員會負責監督該集團的財務報告程序。\n\n# 審計師對財務報表審核的責任\n\n我的目標是取得合理保證，以確定財務報表整體是否不存在因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯報，並發表包含我意見的審計師報告。合理保證是高水平的保證，但並不能保證按照審計署審計準則進行的審核在存在重大錯報時總能發現該錯報。錯報可能因欺詐或錯誤而產生，如果錯報個別或合計起來可能影響用戶依據這些財務報表作出的經濟決策，則認為錯報具有重要性。\n\n在按照審計署審計準則進行審核時，我在整個審核過程中運用專業判斷並保持職業懷疑態度。我還：\n- 識別和評估財務報表是否存在因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯報風險，設計和執行適應這些風險的審計程序，以及獲取充分、適當的審計憑證，作為我發表意見的依據。未能發現因欺詐而導致的重大錯報的風險高於未能發現因錯誤而導致的重大錯報的風險，因為欺詐可能涉及串通、偽造、故意遺漏、虛假陳述或凌駕於內部控制之上；\n- 瞭解與審核相關的內部控制，以設計適應當時情況的審計程序，但目的並非對該集團的內部控制有效性發表意見；\n- 評估金融管理局所採用的會計政策是否適當，其會計估計及相關披露是否合理；\n- 就金融管理局採用持續經營的會計基礎是否適當作出結論，並根據所獲取的審計憑證，確定是否存在與可能對該集團作為持續經營的能力產生重大疑慮的事件或情況有關的重大不確定性。如果我得出結論認為存在重大不確定性，我有責任在審計師報告中提請注意財務報表中的相關披露，或如果披露不充分，則修改我的意見。我的結論是基於截至我發表審計師報告之日所獲取的審計憑證。然而，未來的事件或情況可能導致該集團無法繼續作為持續經營；\n- 評估財務報表的整體呈現、結構和內容，包括披露，以及財務報表是否以實現公允呈現的方式反映了基礎交易和事件；以及\n- 獲取關於該集團內實體或業務活動的財務資訊的充分、適當審計憑證，以對財務報表發表意見。我負責指導、監督和執行集團審計。我對我的審計意見負有全部責任。\n\n我就審核的計劃範圍和時間安排及重大審核結果，包括我在審核中發現的任何重大內部控制缺陷，與外匯基金諮詢委員會審核小組委員會進行溝通。\n\n我亦向外匯基金諮詢委員會審核小組委員會提供一份聲明，表明我已遵守有關獨立性的相關道德要求，並與他們溝通所有可能合理地被視為影響我獨立性的關係和其他事項，以及在適用情況下，相關的保障措施。\n\n從與外匯基金諮詢委員會審核小組委員會溝通的事項中，我確定了在本期財務報表審核中最為重要的事項，因此這些事項是關鍵審計事項。我在審計師報告中描述這些事項，除非法律或法規禁止公開披露該事項，或在極為罕見的情況下，我確定不應在報告中溝通該事項，因為這樣做的不利後果可能合理地預期會超過此類溝通的公共利益。\n\n戴維孫\n審計署署長\n\n2018年4月11日\n\n# 1 主要業務\n\n金融管理局根據財政司司長作為外匯基金（該基金）管理人的授權，按照《外匯基金條例》（第66章）的規定管理該基金。該基金的主要業務是捍衛港元匯率，並維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定和健全。\n\n該基金的資產分為四個組合管理：支持組合、投資組合、長期增長組合及策略性資產組合。根據香港貨幣發行局制度，支持組合的資產與貨幣基礎完全匹配。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債券及股票市場。長期增長組合持有私募股權及房地產投資。策略性資產組合持有香港交易及結算所有限公司的股份，該股份由香港特別行政區政府為該基金的策略性目的而收購。經營分部資料載於附註30。\n\n#

符合準則聲明\n\n這些財務報表已按照所有適用的香港財務報告準則編製，該準則是一個統稱，包括所有適用的個別香港財務報告準則、香港會計準則及香港會計師公會頒布的詮釋，以及香港普遍接受的會計原則。該基金及其附屬公司（統稱「該集團」）所採納的重要會計政策概要載列如下。\n\n香港會計師公會已頒布某些新的及經修訂的香港財務報告準則，這些準則在本會計期間首次生效或可供提早採用。附註3載列了因初次採用這些發展而對會計政策作出的任何變動的資訊（如適用），只要這些變動與本財務報表所反映的本會計期間及先前會計期間該集團有關。\n\n# 2.2 編製財務報表的依據\n\n集團財務報表包括集團的財務報表以及集團在聯營公司及合營企業中的權益。主要附屬公司、聯營公司及合營企業的主要業務載於附註16及17。\n\n編製財務報表所採用的計量基準為歷史成本，但下列資產及負債按其公允值列帳，詳見下文所載的會計政策：\n- 交易用途的金融工具（附註2.6.2.1）；\n- 指定以公允值列帳的金融資產及金融負債（附註2.6.2.2）；\n- 可供出售證券（附註2.6.2.5）；\n- 金屬（附註2.11）；及\n- 投資物業（附註2.12）。\n\n按照香港財務報告準則編製財務報表，要求管理層作出判斷、估計及假設，這些判斷、估計及假設影響政策的適用及所報告的資產、負債、收入及支出的金額。估計及相關假設是基於經驗及其他因素，這些因素在當時情況下被認為是合理的，其結果構成對資產及負債的賬面值作出判斷的依據，而這些賬面值通常不易從其他來源獲得。實際結果可能與這些估計不同。\n\n估計及基本假設是持續檢討的。會計估計的修訂於修訂估計的期間確認，如果修訂只影響該期間，或於修訂期間及未來期間確認，如果修訂同時影響當前期間及未來期間。\n\n附註18載有與投資物業公允值估計相關的假設的資訊。附註36載有與金融工具公允值估計相關的假設的資訊。除了涉及這些公允值估計的會計判斷外，在適用該集團的會計政策時，沒有其他重要的會計判斷。\n\n# 2.3 附屬公司及非控股權益\n\n附屬公司是指由該集團控制的實體。該集團控制一個實體，即該集團因與該實體之關係而承受變動回報的風險或享有變動回報的權利，且該集團有能力利用對該實體的權力影響該回報。在評估該集團是否具有權力時，只考慮該集團及其他方所持有的實質性權利。"}

{"en":"# Chief Executive’s Statement\n\nThe year 2021 was a year of concurrent consolidation and development.\n\nIn 2021, the pandemic entered its second year unabated: global supply chains were disrupted, inflation pressures were on the rise, risk of premature tightening of global financial conditions increased.  Adding to the unpredictability were the emergence of mutant variants of COVID-19 and the intensification of geopolitical tensions.  Despite such a macro environment filled with uncertainties, we continued to safeguard monetary and financial stability and maintain operational resilience.\n\n2021 also brought hope for recovery with the successful rollout of COVID-19 vaccines together with the accommodative monetary and fiscal policies introduced in multiple economies.  The global economy began to recover from the severe contraction in 2020.  Locally, after having endured economic contraction in 2019 and 2020, the Hong Kong economy grew by 6.3% in 2021, thanks to the rollout of the vaccination programme and the Government’s pandemic relief measures which have lent crucial support to our economic recovery.\n\nWith financial and monetary stability maintained, as well as a steadying macro environment, 2021 gave us some room to pursue more development work.  We seized the opportunity and pressed ahead with developmental initiatives that will help our financial sector remain highly competitive. Significant progress has been made across our three strategic priorities, namely fintech, green finance and Mainland market opportunities arising from Hong Kong’s gateway role.\n\nAs we entered 2022, the global environment took a turn for the worse.  But as the saying goes, when the going gets tough, the tough get going.  We will continue to be proactive and pursue our developmental goals and priorities to be better prepared for the next challenge and to cement our status as an international financial centre.  We will also remain steadfast in our commitment to ensure the soundness of Hong Kong monetary and financial systems, as we have risen to the many challenges time and again as in the past.\n\n# Monetary and financial stability: foundation of an international financial centre\n\nSince its establishment in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has been a strong anchor of Hong Kong’s financial system and has helped Hong Kong withstand numerous shocks and challenges.  Despite the lingering uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and market concerns about the pace of US monetary tightening, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to function in an orderly manner throughout the year, reflecting the robustness of the LERS.\n\nThis confidence in our systems did not happen overnight, but is based on the solid foundation which has been built up over the years.  In its 2021 External Sector Report, the International Monetary Fund once again reiterated that the credibility of the LERS has been assured by a transparent set of rules, ample fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy, and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nThe confidence is also a result of our efforts in public and market engagement, as well as effective surveillance.  On the latter, we have leveraged technology and data analytics to strengthen our capability for more timely and comprehensive analysis on financial stability and macroprudential surveillance.\n\nThe robustness of the banking system is of paramount importance to financial stability in Hong Kong.  Two years into the COVID-19 pandemic, our banks remained resilient with liquidity positions and capitalisation faring very well by international standards.  As at end-2021, the capital adequacy ratio of local banks stood at 20.2%, well above the minimum requirement of 8%, while the average Liquidity Coverage Ratio of large banks was 151.9% in the fourth quarter of 2021, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 100%.  Despite a challenging credit landscape amid the pandemic, the asset quality of the banking sector remained largely stable during the year. The classified loan ratio of the industry was 0.88% at the end of 2021, down from 0.90% at the end of 2020, well below the long-run historical average of 1.8% since 2000.\n\n# Banking sector: a pillar of support to the economy\n\nAs always, the banking sector is an important pillar of support to economic activity.  This is ever more crucial in the face of economic fallout from the COVID-19 outbreak.  In the past year, a main challenge was to strike a balance between managing credit risk in the banking sector and maintaining the sector’s support for the real economy.  With our supervisory work over the years, banks continued to manage credit risks effectively.  At the same time, we worked closely with banks to provide the much needed relief to corporate and personal customers through the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme (PPPHS) and other relief measures.  The PPPHS, launched together with the Banking Sector Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) Lending Coordination Mechanism in 2020 allowing eligible corporate customers to defer loan principal payments by six months on a pre-approval basis, was again further extended twice during 2021 until April 2022 recognising that some economic sectors were still hard-pressed by the lingering pandemic and were in need of continued credit relief.  Subsequently, in light of a resurgence of local coronavirus infections, in February 2022, the PPPHS was further extended until the end of October 2022.  It is encouraging to see that the banking sector has joined forces with the HKMA to help relieve cash-flow pressures on corporate and individual borrowers, even whilst the sector itself is experiencing its own difficult operating conditions due to the outbreak of the pandemic.\n\nApart from the challenging credit landscape, the pandemic also brought about a more difficult operating environment and a digital landscape with escalating cyber threat. We have stepped up our efforts to enhance operational and cyber resilience of the banking sector, as well as consumer and investor protection amid increasing digitalisation and a surge in phishing scams.  In particular, the Code of Banking Practice was revised to enhance consumer protection in digital financial services.\n\nBesides supervisory work, we are dedicated to promoting financial inclusion and customer-centric culture in the banking sector.  Enhancing accessibility to banking services by customers in need has been one of our priority areas and we have been working closely with the industry to develop industry guidelines.  Further to the guidance on barrier-free banking services and provision of banking services for persons with intellectual disabilities, the industry, with the support of the HKMA, published in December 2021 a guideline to set out the principles and good practices for the banking industry in providing banking services to persons with dementia and customers in need.\n\nTo support the continued development of the banking sector in the future where the new growth opportunities and challenges require a new set of skills from the workforce, the HKMA has formulated a holistic talent development strategy — “Connecting Talent to the Future” — to groom future talent and upskill existing practitioners in a more systematic and targeted manner.  Our new strategy is built on three “connect” directions: connecting students to the banking industry, connecting practitioners to the future of banking, and connecting the key stakeholders together to enhance collaboration in implementing the strategy.  We have launched a series of outreach and promotional campaigns to attract more students to enter the banking industry. To better prepare university students to be “future ready”, we have launched the Future Banking Bridging Programme jointly with the Hong Kong Institute of Bankers, which comprises a series of courses that cover practical banking knowledge and useful soft skills that are highly in demand in the banking industry.  For the existing banking practitioners, we have been working closely with the industry on developing opportunities for upskilling through providing more in-demand training programmes.  In December 2021, the new Fintech module under the Enhanced Competency Framework for banking practitioners was launched.\n\nFinancial talent is crucial to the future development of Hong Kong as an international financial centre.  We will work hand in hand with all stakeholders with a view to strengthening the talent pool for the further development of the industry.\n\n# International financial centre: strong position underpinned by an unparalleled access to opportunities\n\nThe competitiveness of Hong Kong as an international financial centre is underpinned by the unparalleled access to opportunities it offers.  There is general consensus that global fintech adoption, opening-up of Mainland’s financial markets, and the mainstreaming of green and sustainable finance present huge opportunities for the future development of Hong Kong’s financial sector.  At the HKMA, we have dedicated substantial efforts in leveraging Hong Kong’s unique edge to capture these opportunities.  Let me talk about the fintech and Mainland opportunities first.\n\n# Comprehensive adoption of fintech\n\nThe pandemic has clearly demonstrated the power of fintech and permanently changed customers’ behaviour towards financial services.  To make sure we continue to stay at the forefront of the global fintech scene and are ready to tap all of the potential of fintech, we must build an ecosystem where the value of fintech is experienced across all levels and by all groups of people.\n\nThis vision has driven us to formulate a new strategy, “Fintech 2025”, which was unveiled in June 2021.  As its name suggests, it aspires to help the financial sector adopt technology comprehensively by 2025.  The strategy comprises five focus areas which cover the required elements to achieve a successful ecosystem, and also the right factors for the ecosystem to grow further in a virtuous cycle. The first two parts of the strategy, namely “all banks go fintech” and “future-proofing Hong Kong for Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)” mainly sought to create more demand for fintech adoption.  The other parts of the strategy relate to data, infrastructure, talent and funding, which are vital to the growth of the ecosystem.\n\nUnder this strategy, a number of new initiatives were introduced, such as the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) fintech pilot trial facility which allows financial institutions and technology firms to conduct pilot trials and obtain early feedback from regulators and users on their cross-boundary fintech initiatives, and the pilot launch of the Commercial Data Interchange which leverages the use of alternative data to facilitate SME financing.  We have also stepped up research on the application of wholesale CBDC to cross-border payments, and explored the prospect of e-HKD, which will increase Hong Kong’s readiness in terms of adopting CBDCs and in turn future-proof our city’s financial infrastructure in the decades ahead.\n\nWhile we capitalise on the new opportunities presented by technological advancement, we also continue to build on our existing achievements as well as watch out for new risks that may arise.  For example, the Faster Payment System (FPS) introduced in 2018 has grown rapidly over the years, with the number of registrations reaching 9.6 million at the end of 2021, up 40% year on year.  The average daily turnover also increased 90% from 2020, reaching about 673,000 real-time transactions in 2021.  Meanwhile, in view of the rapid development of crypto-assets particularly payment-related stablecoins, we have issued a discussion paper earlier this year to invite market feedback on the development of an appropriate regulatory framework.\n\nOur new, forward-thinking strategy will set the scene for a healthy growth of the fintech ecosystem.  As the banking sector increasingly adopts fintech to capture the opportunities it offers, this will ultimately benefit both financial institutions and Hong Kong people, while strengthening Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre.\n\n# Hong Kong as the dominant gateway to the Mainland\n\nHong Kong has always played a strategic role in linking the Mainland market with international financial markets, providing international investors with a familiar regime and platform to conduct various kinds of financial, investment and wealth management activities.  The National 14th Five-Year Plan strengthens Hong Kong’s position as an international financial centre, a global offshore renminbi business hub, as well as asset management and risk management centres. This together with global economic trends has reinforced our conviction that Hong Kong should continue to enhance its unique value as a bridge connecting the Mainland and international markets.\n\nIn 2021, we reached a milestone in enhancing connectivity, adding two new members to our family of Connect schemes, namely the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) Scheme in the GBA, and Southbound Trading under Bond Connect, essentially completing the two-way loop of mutual access in a wide spectrum of financial markets including equities, debts and wealth management.  The launch of the two schemes will bring new opportunities for Hong Kong in various aspects. By meeting the increasing diversification needs of Mainland investors, the two schemes will enlarge the customer base of our bond market and wealth management industry.  I am pleased to see that these two schemes have been operating smoothly.  The HKMA will continue to engage the Mainland authorities to further enhance these schemes over time.\n","terms":{"12-month expected credit losses":["12個月預期信用虧損"],"2022–23

年，疫情進入第二年，仍未見緩和：全球供應鏈受到干擾，通膨壓力上升，全球金融狀況過早收緊的風險增加。此外，新冠病毒變異株的出現和地緣政治緊張局勢的加劇，更增加了局勢的不確定性。儘管宏觀環境充滿不確定性，我們仍繼續維護貨幣和金融穩定，並保持營運韌性。\n\n2021 年也帶來了復甦的希望，因為新冠疫苗成功推出，加上多個經濟體實施寬鬆的貨幣和財政政策。全球經濟開始從 2020 年的嚴重衰退中復甦。本地方面，在經歷了 2019 年和 2020 年的經濟衰退後，香港經濟在 2021 年增長了 6.3%，這歸功於疫苗接種計畫的推行和政府的抗疫支援措施，為我們的經濟復甦提供了重要支持。\n\n在金融和貨幣穩定得到維持，以及宏觀環境趨於穩定的情況下，2021 年為我們提供了一些空間來推進更多發展工作。我們把握了這個機會，推進了多項發展舉措，以幫助我們的金融業保持高度競爭力。我們在三個重點策略領域（即金融科技、綠色金融和香港作為門戶所帶來的內地市場機遇）上取得了重大進展。\n\n踏入 2022 年，全球環境進一步惡化。但正如俗話所說，越是困難，越要迎難而上。我們將繼續積極進取，追求我們的發展目標和優先事項，以更好地應對下一個挑戰，並鞏固我們作為國際金融中心的地位。我們亦將堅定不移地確保香港貨幣及金融體系的穩健性，正如我們過去屢次成功應對各種挑戰一樣。\n\n# 貨幣及金融穩定：國際金融中心的基石\n\n聯繫匯率制度自 1983 年確立以來，一直是香港金融體系的堅實支柱，並協助香港抵禦了無數的衝擊和挑戰。儘管新冠疫情的不確定性持續存在，市場亦對美國收緊貨幣政策的步伐感到憂慮，但港元匯率及貨幣市場在全年仍保持有序運作，反映出聯匯制度的穩健性。\n\n我們對體系的信心並非一蹴而就，而是建立在多年來奠定的堅實基礎之上。國際貨幣基金組織在 2021 年的《對外部門報告》中再次重申，聯匯制度的可信性得到透明的規則、充足的財政及外匯儲備、強而有力的金融監管及監督、靈活的經濟和審慎的財政制度所保障。\n\n這份信心亦源於我們在公眾及市場溝通方面的努力，以及有效的監控工作。在後者方面，我們運用科技及數據分析技術，以強化我們在金融穩定及宏觀審慎監控方面進行更及時及全面的分析的能力。\n\n銀行體系的穩健性對香港的金融穩定至為重要。新冠疫情爆發兩年以來，本港銀行的流動性水平和資本狀況按國際標準而言仍然非常穩健。截至 2021 年底，本地銀行的資本充足比率為 20.2%，遠高於 8% 的最低要求，而大型銀行在 2021 年第四季的平均流動性覆蓋比率則為 151.9%，亦遠高於 100% 的法定最低要求。儘管疫情期間信貸環境充滿挑戰，但銀行業的資產品質在年內大致保持穩定。行業的特定分類貸款比率在 2021 年底為 0.88%，較 2020 年底的 0.90% 有所下降，遠低於自 2000 年以來的長期平均水平 1.8%。\n\n# 銀行業：支持經濟的支柱\n\n銀行業一如既往地是支持經濟活動的重要支柱，在新冠肺炎爆發造成的經濟影響下，這一點更為重要。過去一年，主要挑戰是如何在管理銀行業的信用風險與維持銀行業對實體經濟的支持之間取得平衡。憑藉我們多年來的監管工作，銀行繼續有效地管理信用風險。同時，我們與銀行緊密合作，透過「預先批核還息不還本計畫」及其他紓困措施，為企業及個人客戶提供所需的紓緩。「預先批核還息不還本計畫」於 2020 年與「銀行業中小企貸款協調機制」一同推出，讓合資格企業客戶可預先獲批延後償還貸款本金六個月，該計畫在 2021 年再獲延長兩次至 2022 年 4 月，因為我們意識到部分行業仍受持續疫情所困，需要繼續獲得信貸紓緩。其後，鑑於本地新冠病毒感染個案再度上升，該計畫在 2022 年 2 月進一步延長至 2022 年 10 月底。令人鼓舞的是，即使銀行業本身因疫情爆發而面臨營運困難，但該行業仍與金管局攜手合作，協助紓緩企業及個人借款人的現金流壓力。\n\n除了信貸環境充滿挑戰外，疫情亦導致營運環境更加困難，數位環境亦面臨日益增加的網路威脅。我們已加大力度，在數位化日益普及和網路釣魚騙案激增的情況下，提升銀行業的營運和網路防禦能力，以及消費者及投資者的保障。特別是，《銀行業務操守守則》已作出修訂，以加強數位金融服務的消費者保障。\n\n除了監管工作外，我們亦致力於在銀行業推廣普及金融和以客為本的文化。提升有需要客戶使用銀行服務的便利性一直是我們的優先工作領域之一，我們與業界緊密合作，制定行業指引。在無障礙銀行服務指引及為智障人士提供銀行服務指引的基礎上，業界在金管局的支持下，於 2021 年 12 月發表了一份指引，訂明銀行業為認知障礙症患者及有需要客戶提供銀行服務的原則和良好做法。\n\n為支持銀行業在未來持續發展，因應新的成長機遇和挑戰，從業人員需要掌握新技能，金管局制定了一項全面的「連接人才與未來」人才發展策略，以更有系統和針對性的方式培養未來人才和提升現有從業人員的技能。我們的新策略建基於三個「連接」方向：將學生與銀行業連接起來、將從業人員與銀行業的未來連接起來，以及將主要利害關係人連接起來，以加強協作，落實策略。我們已推出一系列推廣及宣傳活動，以吸引更多學生加入銀行業。為讓大學生更好地為未來做好準備，我們與香港銀行學會聯合推出了「銀行業銜接課程」，其中包括一系列涵蓋實用銀行知識和銀行業高度需求的軟技能的課程。對於現有的銀行從業人員，我們與業界緊密合作，透過提供更多熱門的培訓課程，為他們創造提升技能的機會。2021 年 12 月，銀行從業人員「銀行專業資歷架構」下的金融科技新單元正式推出。\n\n金融人才對香港未來發展成為國際金融中心至關重要。我們將與所有利害關係人攜手合作，以強化人才庫，促進行業的進一步發展。\n\n# 國際金融中心：強大的地位由無與倫比的機會獲取能力所支持\n\n香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力，由其提供的無與倫比的機會獲取能力所支持。普遍認為，全球金融科技應用、內地金融市場開放，以及綠色和永續金融的主流化，為香港金融業的未來發展帶來了巨大的機會。在金管局，我們投入了大量精力，利用香港的獨特優勢來把握這些機會。讓我先談談金融科技和內地機會。\n\n# 全面採用金融科技\n\n疫情清楚地展示了金融科技的力量，並永久改變了客戶對金融服務的行為。為確保我們繼續在全球金融科技領域中保持領先地位，並準備好發揮金融科技的全部潛力，我們必須建立一個生態系統，讓各階層和各群體的人都能體驗到金融科技的價值。\n\n這個願景促使我們制定了一項新策略——「金融科技 2025」，該策略於 2021 年 6 月公布。正如其名稱所示，該策略旨在協助金融業在 2025 年之前全面採用科技。該策略包括五個重點領域，涵蓋了建立成功生態系統所需的要素，以及生態系統在良性循環中進一步增長的正確因素。策略的前兩部分，即「所有銀行採用金融科技」和「為央行數位貨幣（CBDC）而強化香港未來的防禦能力」，主要旨在創造更多對金融科技應用的需求。策略的其他部分則與數據、基礎建設、人才和資源有關，這些都是生態系統增長的關鍵因素。\n\n在這個策略下，我們推出了一系列新舉措，例如粵港澳大灣區金融科技測試平台，讓金融機構和科技公司可以進行試點測試，並從監管機構和用戶獲得早期回饋，以了解其跨境金融科技項目；以及商業數據通的試點推出，該項目利用替代數據來促進中小企融資。我們亦加大力度研究批發層面央行數位貨幣在跨境支付中的應用，並探索數位港元的前景，這將提高香港在採用央行數位貨幣方面的準備就緒程度，進而為本市未來的金融基礎建設提供保障。\n\n在我們利用科技發展所帶來的嶄新機會的同時，我們亦繼續鞏固現有的成就，並留意可能出現的新風險。例如，2018 年推出的「轉數快」系統在過去幾年迅速發展，截至 2021 年底，登記數目達 960 萬，按年上升 40%。平均每日交易量亦較 2020 年增加 90%，在 2021 年達到約 67.3 萬宗即時交易。同時，鑑於加密資產（尤其是與支付相關的穩定幣）的快速發展，我們在今年初發表了一份討論文件，邀請市場就制定適當監管框架提供意見。\n\n我們的新策略具有前瞻性，將為金融科技生態圈的健康成長奠定基礎。隨著銀行業越來越多地採用金融科技以把握其所帶來的機會，這最終將惠及金融機構和香港市民，並強化香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。\n\n# 香港作為通往內地的主要門戶\n\n香港一直扮演著連結內地市場與國際金融市場的策略性角色，為國際投資者提供熟悉的制度和平台，以進行各種金融、投資和財富管理活動。國家「十四五規劃綱要」強化了香港作為國際金融中心、全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐，以及資產管理及風險管理中心的地位。這與全球經濟趨勢一起，強化了我們的信念，即香港應繼續強化其作為連接內地與國際市場橋樑的獨特價值。\n\n2021 年，我們在提升連通性方面達到了一个里程碑，為「互聯互通」計畫家族增加了兩個新成員，即大灣區的「跨境理財通」和「債券通」下的「南向通」，基本上完成了涵蓋股票、債務及財富管理的廣泛金融市場的雙向互聯互通循環。這兩個計畫的推出將為香港在各個方面帶來新的機會。透過滿足內地投資者日益增長的多元化需求，這兩個計畫將擴大我們債券市場和財富管理業的客戶基礎。我很高興看到這兩個計畫運作順暢。金管局將繼續與內地當局合作，進一步完善這些計畫。"}
{"en":"# Highlights of 2021\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nIn 2021, the Hong Kong economy resumes positive growth on the back of strong merchandise exports, reviving domestic demand and a boost from the Government’s supportive policy measures.

年，香港經濟在強勁的商品出口、復甦的內需及政府支持性政策措施的帶動下，恢復正增長。就業市場亦有所改善，而通膨則保持溫和，儘管有所上升。\n\n香港銀行業保持穩健，資本及流動性狀況良好。資產品質按歷史及國際標準而言均維持在健康水平。\n\n# 貨幣穩定\n\n儘管新冠疫情持續存在不確定性，市場亦關注美國收緊貨幣政策的步伐，港元市場仍然運作暢順及有序。聯繫匯率制度繼續運作良好。\n\n# 儲備管理\n\n2021 年，全球金融市場踏上復甦之路，外匯基金錄得投資收入 1,919 億港元，投資回報率為 4.1%。\n\n金管局繼續努力支持負責任投資及資產多元化。自 2009 年成立以來，長期增長組合的年化內部回報率為 15.4%。\n\n# 銀行體系穩定\n\n金管局繼續專注於監管銀行的風險管理。鑑於網路威脅日益增加及數位化加速，金管局已加強監管銀行的運作穩健性及網路防禦能力。銀行業務操守守則亦已修訂，以加強數位金融服務的消費者保障。\n\n經廣泛諮詢後，粵港澳大灣區「跨境理財通」業務試點順利推出。金管局為銀行提供指引，說明如何以客戶友善及提供保障的方式，透過非面對面渠道分銷投資及保險產品。\n\n在打擊洗錢及恐怖主義融資方面，金管局的優先工作是進一步加強銀行的能力，以預防及偵測與疫情期間網路金融犯罪增加相關的非法資金流動。金管局亦透過公私合作關係加強資訊共享，同時支持遠端開戶，並鼓勵採用其他技術（包括網路分析），為此推出了首個反洗錢合規科技實驗室。\n\n在軟實力方面亦作出了進一步努力，包括銀行文化及人才發展等領域。\n\n在本地實施國際監管標準（包括資本充足率及資訊披露標準）方面取得了良好進展。金管局亦推進其工作，制定處置標準、進行處置規劃及發展處置執行能力，以確保銀行的處置機制可靠。\n\n# 國際金融中心\n\n金管局公佈「金融科技 2025」策略，以促進金融業廣泛採用金融科技，並鞏固香港作為亞洲金融科技樞紐的地位。在快速支付系統方面，其註冊數量及交易量均錄得顯著增長，使用量亦持續擴大。\n\n在加強連通性方面，跨境理財通及「債券通」下的南向交易已推出，進一步鞏固香港作為離岸人民幣業務樞紐的角色。\n\n此外，亦作出顯著努力以創造新的業務機會，以提升香港金融平台的競爭力，包括在債券發行、資產及財富管理、企業財資中心，以及綠色及永續金融等領域。\n\n為推廣香港金融服務，金管局加強與各利益相關者的市場聯繫，讓他們了解香港金融體系的韌性及其所帶來的機會。香港金融學院亦推出新的金融領袖計畫，以啟發香港未來的金融領袖。\n\n# 機構職能\n\n金管局透過不同渠道與社會及市場保持有效溝通，以提升公眾對其政策及運作的了解。在機構內部，金管局悉心建立一支靈活及永續的人才隊伍，實行嚴格的財務紀律，並提升資訊科技能力，以適應變化及確保有效落實其政策及措施。\n\n# 永續發展\n\n金管局致力強化香港金融體系，以支持更綠色及永續的未來，推動行動以支持政府的氣候目標，並為全球議程作出貢獻。今年，金管局首次發表永續發展報告，作為其《2021

{"en":"# Priorities for 2022 and Beyond\n\nGlobal and local conditions deteriorated notably entering 2022. On the one hand, the escalation of the Ukraine situation and expectations of rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve triggered market volatility. On the other hand, the local economy took a hit from the new wave of COVID-19 pandemic. That said, Hong Kong’s financial system remains well-positioned to withstand adverse shocks given its resilience and buffers built up over the years. Looking ahead, the HKMA will continue to attach high importance to safeguarding monetary and financial stability. In doing so, we will endeavour to stay ahead of the curve by identifying emerging risks and responding to them in an agile manner. At the same time, the HKMA will seek opportunities that would help bolster Hong Kong’s status as a leading international financial centre. In managing the Exchange Fund in this complicated investment environment, the HKMA will continue to invest prudently, while remaining flexible, implementing defensive measures as appropriate, and maintaining a high degree of liquidity.\n\n# STABILITY AND INTEGRITY OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM\n\nThe global economic outlook remains subject to significant uncertainties.  The HKMA will keep abreast of latest developments and stay vigilant against potential risks, with the aim of upholding the resilience and stability of the financial system, which are essential for the ongoing provision of critical financial services that support the functioning of the Hong Kong economy.\n\n# Staying vigilant against potential risks\n\nLooking ahead, markets may be subject to heightened volatilities amid increased uncertainties on various fronts. On the one hand, the US Federal Reserve’s monetary policy normalisation, if continuing at a fast pace, may tighten global financial conditions visibly ahead and increase the global debt-servicing burden.  On the other hand, following the escalation of the Ukraine situation in early 2022, geopolitical uncertainties including the China–US tension may continue to stay high and trigger bouts of financial market volatility again.  Last but not least, with the evolving pandemic developments, there might be a potential downside scenario where lockdowns were to be re-imposed at a large scale, leading to persistent global supply bottlenecks and adversely affecting global growth and inflation.  Having said that, Hong Kong’s financial system is well-positioned to withstand adverse shocks given the resilience and buffers built up over the years.  The HKMA also has the capability, resources and commitment to safeguard Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nThe HKMA will continue to closely monitor risks and vulnerabilities in the domestic and external environments and stand ready to deploy appropriate measures where necessary to maintain Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. Research programmes in 2022 will study issues affecting the Hong Kong economy and assess their potential risks. Meanwhile, the HKMA’s ongoing Digitalisation Programme will help enhance its surveillance capabilities to support more holistic surveillance and comprehensive analysis of the financial system.\n\n# Maintaining banking stability\n\nAs developed markets tighten monetary policies and the impact of the pandemic lingers, the credit landscape facing the banking sector is expected to remain challenging. At the same time, rapid technological advancement and digitalisation present both opportunities and challenges to the banking sector.  Facing an ever-changing financial landscape, the HKMA strives to ensure banks’ ability to withstand shocks through its ongoing supervisory efforts. At the same time, the HKMA will also continue to enhance and refine its banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account international standards and best practices.\n\n# A risk-based supervisory focus\n\n# Credit risk\n\nIn 2022, the HKMA will step up the surveillance of banks’ credit risk exposures and take proactive steps to ensure that overall risk levels remain well contained.\n\nThe HKMA will also continue to monitor the development of the pandemic and its effect on the operating conditions of corporates, as well as maintain close dialogue with the banking and commercial sectors while keeping the various relief measures under review.\n\n# Operational and technology risks\n\nWith the issuance of the new Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module on “Operational Resilience” in May 2022, the HKMA will continue to engage the industry and understand authorized institutions’ (AIs’) progress in developing their operational resilience frameworks.  In parallel, the HKMA will seek to raise the banking sector’s cyber resilience by following up with AIs on issues revealed by the assessments under the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 and monitoring AIs’ implementation of secure tertiary data backup.  Another key supervisory focus will be evaluating and addressing the risks from AIs’ growing dependency on technology service providers.\n\nWith enhanced digital capabilities and extensive remote working experience accumulated during the pandemic, some AIs are planning to transition to a hybrid working model on a business-as-usual basis.  The HKMA will keep track of this development and assess whether the associated risks are adequately addressed by the industry.\n\n# Liquidity and market risks\n\nThe HKMA will focus on the supervision of AIs’ liquidity and market risk management in 2022.  In particular, the HKMA will continue to monitor AIs’ progress in transitioning away from the remaining London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) settings before these settings cease to be published by 30 June 2023.\n\n# Combating money laundering and terrorist financing\n\nIn 2022, the HKMA’s work on anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT) will continue to focus on strengthening response to fraud and financial crime through collaboration and information sharing, pursuing closer co-operation with various stakeholders in the AML\/CFT ecosystem.  Other priorities are to implement a wider range of risk-sensitive supervisory techniques, by leveraging enhanced data and supervisory technology (Suptech) capabilities, and promote the use of Regtech by banks, including transaction monitoring systems.\n\nThe HKMA will also keep working closely with the Government, the banking and stored value facility (SVF) sectors to publish an updated Hong Kong money laundering and terrorist financing risk assessment, and assist the industry in combatting new and emerging risks.  Work will also continue on understanding evolving money laundering and terrorist financing risks, implementing changes to AML law and related guidance to align with international standards, and maintaining proactive engagement with other regulators and international standard setters.\n\n# Wealth management and mandatory provident fund-related businesses\n\nIn 2022, the HKMA will carry out on-site examinations and off-site surveillance of AIs’ conduct in relation to wealth management and the selling of securities, mandatory provident fund (MPF) and other investment and insurance products, with a focus on the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) Scheme in the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area, digital advisory platforms, complex products, virtual assets and non-investment-linked long term insurance products.\n\nWhile maintaining close communication with other regulators and the banking industry, the HKMA will provide further guidance on regulatory standards in relation to the sale of investment, insurance and MPF products.  This will cover, among other things, investment services related to virtual assets and the selling of Protection Linked Plans, a new subset of investment-linked assurance scheme products with high level of insurance protection.  The HKMA, the Insurance Authority and the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority will jointly launch a mystery shopping programme on the selling practices of intermediaries in respect of Qualifying Deferred Annuity Policies and Tax-deductible Voluntary Contributions.\n\nFollowing the smooth launch of the Cross-boundary WMC, the HKMA will continue engaging the industry and relevant regulatory authorities to enhance the scheme.\n\nMoreover, the HKMA will embark on preparation work for supervising AIs’ trust business under a new SPM module and a new Code of Practice.\n\n# Oversight of financial market infrastructures\n\nThe HKMA will continue to promote the safety and efficiency of the financial market infrastructures (FMIs) under its oversight, in accordance with the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO), the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMI)1, and the various guidances issued by the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI).  It will fine-tune the FMI oversight framework taking into account the latest technological and market developments.\n\nThe HKMA will work with the FMIs on their observance of the PFMI, conducting and updating assessments as appropriate. In addition, the HKMA will continue to participate in the CPMI-IOSCO PFMI implementation monitoring and assessment exercise.  The HKMA will also participate in the work of international standard setting bodies and strengthen its oversight requirements in response to market and technology developments and in line with international practices.  The HKMA will work with relevant authorities to further strengthen co-operative oversight arrangements where appropriate.\n\n# Policy development\n\nThe HKMA will continue to enhance and refine its banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account international standards and best practices.\n\n# Implementation of Basel standards in Hong Kong\n\n# Capital standards\n\nThe HKMA will continue to enhance the capital framework with the implementation of the standards published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) in recent years, which include the following:\n\nThe Capital Requirements for Banks’ Equity Investments in Funds of December 2013 (EIF standard), which will come into effect on 1 July 2022 with the Banking (Capital) (Amendment) Rules 2022 commencing operation after negative vetting by the Legislative Council.\n\nThe revised capital standards set out in the Basel III Finalising Post-crisis Reforms of December 2017, the Minimum Capital Requirements for Market Risk of January 2019 (revised in February 2019), and the Targeted Revisions to the Credit Valuation Adjustment Risk Framework of July 2020, which are collectively referred to as the “Basel III final reform package”.  These revised capital standards set out the revised capital treatment of credit risk, market risk, credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk and operational risk, introduce an output floor requirement, and enhance the leverage ratio framework.  Amendments to the Banking (Capital) Rules (BCR) are being prepared in consultation with the industry with a view to them taking effect from 1 July 2023 as minimum requirements (except for those on market risk and CVA risk2).\n\nGiven that the capital treatment for sovereign concentration risk under the BCR was designed to complement the Basel Committee’s large exposure framework as implemented by the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules, the HKMA will propose amendments to the capital rules in parallel with relevant changes to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules.\n\n# Exposure limits\n\nThe HKMA will continue its work on the proposed amendments to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules in consultation with the industry and the Department of Justice with a target implementation date aligned with the one for the Basel III final reform package, i.e. 1 July 2023.\n\n# Disclosure standards\n\nNew or revised disclosure requirements associated with the revised capital standards in the Basel III final reform package are mainly set out in the Pillar 33 Disclosure Requirements – Updated Framework and the Revisions to Market Risk Disclosure Requirements, published by the Basel Committee in December 2018 and November 2021 respectively.  The Basel Committee also published the Revisions to Leverage Ratio Disclosure Requirements in June 2019 amending the disclosure requirements for leverage ratio to address concerns regarding potential “window-dressing” (i.e. banks reducing the volumes of certain transactions around reporting dates to artificially inflate their leverage ratios for reporting and public disclosure).  Corresponding amendments to the Banking (Disclosure) Rules to implement these new or revised disclosure requirements are also being prepared, with a view to having them take effect in Hong Kong along the same timelines as their associated revised capital standards.\n\n# Other supervisory policies and risk management guidelines\n\nTo reflect developments in regulatory requirements and international standards, the HKMA plans to update certain SPM modules, including those relevant to the implementation of the revised capital and disclosure standards in the Basel III final reform package, “Countercyclical Capital Buffer – Approach to its Implementation”, “Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book”, “New Share Subscription and Share Margin Financing” and “Stress Testing”.  The HKMA will also continue to work on the revised SPM modules on “Code of Conduct” and “Reporting Requirements Relating to Authorized Institutions’ External Auditors under the Banking Ordinance”, with an aim to finalising the revisions within 2022. Consequential to the proposed amendments to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules, the related Code of Practice and SPM modules, e.g. CR-G-8 on “Large Exposures and Risk Concentrations” and CR-G-9 on “Exposures to Connected Parties”, will be updated accordingly.\n","terms":{"12-month expected credit losses":["12個月預期信用虧損"],"2022–23 Budget":["2022至23年度財政預算案"],"24\/7 operations":["每日24小時無間斷運作"],"80%

年初，全球和本地情況顯著惡化。一方面，烏克蘭局勢的升級以及美國聯邦儲備局加息的預期，觸發了市場波動。另一方面，本地經濟受到新一波新冠疫情的衝擊。儘管如此，香港金融體系憑藉多年來建立的抗震能力和緩衝空間，仍然能夠抵禦不利衝擊。展望未來，金管局將繼續高度重視維護貨幣及金融穩定。在此過程中，我們將努力領先趨勢，及早識別新興風險並靈活應對。同時，金管局將尋找機會，以鞏固香港作為領先國際金融中心的地位。在管理外匯基金時，面對複雜的投資環境，金管局將繼續審慎投資，保持靈活，適時採取防禦措施，並維持高水平的流動性。\n\n# 金融體系的穩定性和健全性\n\n全球經濟前景仍然面臨重大不確定性。金管局將密切關注最新發展，保持警惕以防範潛在風險，旨在維護金融體系的抗震能力和穩定性，這對於持續提供支持香港經濟運作的關鍵金融服務至關重要。\n\n# 保持警惕以防範潛在風險\n\n展望未來，市場可能面臨來自多方面的高度不確定性，導致波動性加劇。一方面，如果美國聯邦儲備局繼續快速推進貨幣政策正常化，可能會顯著收緊全球金融狀況，並增加全球的債務負擔。另一方面，繼 2022 年初烏克蘭局勢升級後，包括中美緊張關係在內的地緣政治不確定性可能持續高企，再次引發金融市場波動。最後但同樣重要的是，隨著疫情發展的演變，可能出現一種不利情景，即大規模重新實施封鎖，導致全球供應鏈持續瓶頸，並對全球增長和通脹造成不利影響。儘管如此，香港金融體系憑藉多年來建立的抗震能力和緩衝空間，仍然能夠抵禦不利衝擊。金管局亦具備能力、資源和決心，以維護香港的貨幣及金融穩定。\n\n金管局將繼續密切監察本地及外圍環境的風險與不穩定因素，並隨時準備在有需要時採取適當措施，以維持香港的貨幣及金融穩定。2022 年的研究項目將探討影響香港經濟的問題，並評估其潛在風險。同時，金管局正在進行的數位化計畫將有助提升其監察能力，以支持對金融體系進行更全面的監察及綜合分析。\n\n# 維持銀行體系穩定\n\n隨著已開發市場收緊貨幣政策，以及疫情的影響持續，銀行業面臨的信貸環境預期將保持嚴峻。同時，快速的科技發展和數位化為銀行業帶來了機遇和挑戰。面對不斷變化的金融環境，金管局通過持續的監管工作，努力確保銀行能夠抵禦衝擊。同時，金管局亦將繼續強化和完善銀行監管架構及政策，並參考國際標準及最佳實務。\n\n# 以風險為本的監管重點\n\n# 信用風險\n\n2022 年，金管局將加強監察銀行的信用風險承擔，並採取主動措施，以確保整體風險水平維持在可控範圍內。\n\n金管局亦將繼續監察疫情的發展及其對企業營運狀況的影響，並與銀行業及商界保持緊密溝通，同時檢視各項紓困措施。\n\n# 業務操作及科技風險\n\n2022 年 5 月，金管局發佈了新的《監管政策手冊》模組「運作穩健性」，金管局將繼續與業界溝通，瞭解認可機構在建立運作穩健性框架方面的進展。同時，金管局將透過跟進《網路防衛評估框架 2.0》下的評估結果，與認可機構就發現的問題進行溝通，並監察認可機構實施安全的三重數據備份的情況，以提升銀行業的網路防衛能力。另一個監管重點是評估及應對認可機構日益依賴科技服務供應商所帶來的風險。\n\n部分認可機構在疫情期間累積了強大的數位能力及豐富的遠端工作經驗，正計畫在日常營運中轉為混合工作模式。金管局將密切關注這一發展，並評估業界是否已充分應對相關風險。\n\n# 流動性及市場風險\n\n2022 年，金管局將重點監察認可機構的流動性及市場風險管理。具體而言，金管局將繼續監察認可機構在 2023 年 6 月 30 日倫敦銀行同業拆息（LIBOR）停止發佈前，轉用其他利率設定的進展。\n\n# 打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集\n\n在 2022 年，金管局在打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集（AML\/CFT）方面的工作將繼續聚焦於透過協作及訊息共享，強化對詐騙及金融犯罪的應對措施，並致力與反洗錢生態系統中的各持份者建立更緊密的合作關係。其他優先事項包括運用強化後的數據及監管科技（Suptech）能力，實施更廣泛的風險為本監管技巧，以及推廣銀行使用合規科技（Regtech），包括交易監控系統。\n\n金管局亦將繼續與政府、銀行業及儲值支付工具（SVF）業界緊密合作，發佈經更新的香港洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險評估，並協助業界應對新出現的風險。此外，金管局將繼續努力瞭解洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險的演變，實施打擊洗錢法例及相關指引的修訂以符合國際標準，並保持與其它監管機構及國際標準制定組織的積極聯繫。\n\n# 財富管理及與強制性公積金相關的業務\n\n2022 年，金管局將就認可機構在財富管理、證券銷售、強制性公積金（強積金）及其他投資和保險產品方面的行為，進行現場檢查及非現場監察，重點關注粵港澳大灣區的「跨境理財通」計畫、數位顧問平台、複雜產品、虛擬資產及非投資相連長期保險產品。\n\n金管局將與其它監管機構及銀行業保持緊密溝通，並就投資、保險及強積金產品的銷售提供進一步的監管標準指引。這將涵蓋與虛擬資產相關的投資服務，以及保障型投資相連壽險產品（一類具有高水平保險保障的新投資相連壽險產品）的銷售。金管局、保險業監管局及強制性公積金計劃管理局將聯合推出一項喬裝客戶檢查計畫，以監察中介人在銷售合資格延期年金保單及可扣稅自願性供款方面的銷售實務。\n\n在「跨境理財通」順利推出後，金管局將繼續與業界及相關監管機構合作，以完善該計畫。\n\n此外，金管局將根據新的《監管政策手冊》模組及新的《營運守則》，展開監督認可機構信託業務的準備工作。\n\n# 監察金融市場基礎設施\n\n金管局將繼續根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（PSSVFO）、《金融市場基礎設施原則》（PFMI）1，以及支付及金融基礎設施委員會（CPMI）發出的各項指引，促進其監管下的金融市場基礎設施的安全及效率。金管局將根據最新的科技及市場發展，優化金融市場基礎設施的監察架構。\n\n金管局將與金融市場基礎設施合作，監察其遵守《金融市場基礎設施原則》的情況，並適時進行評估及更新。此外，金管局將繼續參與 CPMI-國際證監會組織（IOSCO）的《金融市場基礎設施原則》實施監察及評估工作。金管局亦將參與國際標準制定組織的工作，並根據市場及科技發展，以及國際慣例，強化其監察要求。金管局將與相關部門合作，在適當時進一步強化合作監察安排。\n\n# 政策制定\n\n金管局將繼續強化和完善銀行監管架構及政策，並參考國際標準及最佳實務。\n\n# 在香港實施巴塞爾標準\n\n# 資本標準\n\n金管局將繼續強化資本框架，落實巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（巴塞爾委員會）近年發佈的標準，其中包括：\n\n2013 年 12 月的《銀行於基金的股權投資的資本要求》（EIF 標準）將於 2022 年 7 月 1 日生效，而《2022 年銀行業（資本）（修訂）規則》亦將在立法會否決後開始實施。\n\n2017 年 12 月的《巴塞爾協定三：危機後改革的最終方案》、2019 年 1 月的《市場風險最低資本規定》（2019 年 2 月修訂）及 2020 年 7 月的《信用估值調整風險框架的目標修訂》所訂定的修訂資本標準，統稱為「《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案」。這些修訂資本標準訂定了經修訂的信用風險、市場風險、信用估值調整（CVA）風險及操作風險的資本處理方法，引入了出項下限規定，並強化了槓桿比率框架。金管局正與業界磋商修訂《銀行業（資本）規則》（BCR），以期於 2023 年 7 月 1 日將其作為最低要求實施（市場風險及 CVA 風險的相關規定除外 2）。\n\n鑑於《銀行業（資本）規則》下對主權集中風險的資本處理方法旨在補充巴塞爾委員會的大額風險承擔框架（該框架由《銀行業（風險承擔限度）規則》實施），金管局將建議修訂資本規則，並同時對《銀行業（風險承擔限度）規則》作出相關修訂。\n\n# 風險承擔限度\n\n金管局將繼續與業界及律政司磋商，推進《銀行業（風險承擔限度）規則》的修訂工作，目標實施日期與《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案的實施日期一致，即 2023 年 7 月 1 日。\n\n# 披露標準\n\n與《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案中修訂資本標準相關的新披露要求或經修訂的披露要求，主要載於巴塞爾委員會分別於 2018 年 12 月及 2021 年 11 月發佈的《第三支柱披露要求——更新框架》及《市場風險披露要求修訂本》。巴塞爾委員會亦於 2019 年 6 月發佈《槓桿比率披露要求修訂本》，修訂槓桿比率的披露要求，以解決對「粉飾櫥窗」的關注（即銀行在報告日期前後減少某些交易量，以人為地抬高其槓桿比率，供報告及公開披露之用）。為落實這些新披露要求或經修訂的披露要求，金管局亦正在修訂《銀行業（披露）規則》，以期與相關修訂資本標準同時在香港實施。\n\n# 其他監管政策及風險管理指引\n\n為反映監管要求及國際標準的發展，金管局計畫更新部分《監管政策手冊》模組，包括與落實《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案中修訂資本及披露標準相關的模組、「逆周期緩衝資本 實施方法」、「銀行帳內的利率風險」、「新股認購及股票孖展融資」及「壓力測試」。金管局亦將繼續修訂《監管政策手冊》中「行為守則」及「認可機構外聘核數師根據《銀行業條例》提交報告書的規定」模組，目標在 2022 年內完成修訂工作。因應《銀行業（風險承擔限度）規則》的建議修訂，相關的《營運守則》及《監管政策手冊》模組（例如 CR-G-8「大額風險承擔及風險集中」及 CR-G-9「對關連各方的風險承擔」）亦會作出相應更新。"}
{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nWith strong merchandise exports, reviving domestic demand and a boost from the Government’s supportive policy measures, the Hong Kong economy resumed positive growth in 2021, reversing the contraction experienced during 2019 and 2020. The labour market also improved, and inflation remained moderate albeit having edged up. While economic recovery is expected to continue after the fifth wave of COVID-19 subsides, its strength and speed are subject to uncertainties and risks, especially those surrounding the pandemic and the path of US monetary policy normalisation.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Real activities\n\nDriven by strong merchandise exports and improving domestic demand, the Hong Kong economy grew by 6.3% in 2021, ending the economic contraction in 2019 and 2020 (Table 1 and Chart 1).  Private consumption recovered, thanks to improved labour market conditions and a boost from the Government’s Consumption Voucher Scheme1. Overall investment spending also rebounded as the business environment and outlook improved2.  Externally, HongKong’s exports of goods saw strong growth for the whole year, in part supported by the continued global economic recovery.  Export of services recorded modest growth, reflecting active regional trade and cargo flows as well as stronger cross-border business and financial activities. Total imports rose appreciably, mainly because of greater domestic and re-export-induced demand.  On a net basis, external trade contributed positively to real gross domestic product (GDP) growth in 2021 (Chart 1) as total exports grew faster than imports.\n\nTable 1 Real GDP growth by expenditure component (period-over-period)\n\nNote: The seasonally-adjusted quarter-on-quarter rates of change in the gross domestic fixed capital formation are not available. Source: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Inflation\n\nInflationary pressures edged up but remained moderate during the year.  Netting out the effects of the Government’s one-off relief measures, the year-on-year underlying inflation rate3 picked up gradually to a mild 1.4% in December (Chart 2)4.  Prices of consumer items such as dining out, transport, clothing and footwear regained upward momentum as local consumption demand improved. Import prices also increased notably alongside bottlenecks in global supply chains and the surge in international energy and commodity prices.  By contrast, the housing component was a drag on overall inflation, reflecting the feed-through of the earlier decline in fresh-letting private residential rentals (Chart 2).  More broadly, slow growth in nominal wage and commercial rentals helped keep domestic business cost pressures in check.  For 2021 as a whole, the underlying and headline inflation rates5 stayed mild at 0.6% and 1.6% respectively.\n\nChart 2 Underlying consumer price inflation\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Labour market\n\nAlongside the domestic economic recovery, the labour market improved in 2021.  After reaching a 17-year high of 7.2% in February, the unemployment rate declined visibly to 4.0% in December6 (Chart 3) and the decline was broad based across most economic sectors.  Overall labour demand strengthened gradually as reflected by a pick-up in total employment (Chart 3) and private sector vacancies, though they were still below their pre-pandemic peaks.  On the other hand, the labour force shrank slightly by 1.3% in December compared with a year earlier, partly due to a modest decline in the labour force participation rate. The year-on-year growth in nominal wage and labour earnings, while moderate, showed signs of acceleration in the first three quarters of 2021, reversing the trend of deceleration during 2019–2020.\n\nChart 3 Labour market conditions\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe local stock market was broadly sluggish during the year, despite a continued rally in some major overseas equity markets (Chart 4).  Extending its rebound in late 2020, the Hang Seng Index rose to a high of 31,085 on 17 February 2021, but market sentiment had turned sharply negative since then owing to a host of factors, including concerns about the new COVID-19 virus variants, potential monetary policy tightening by major central banks and reduced inflows from southbound trading under Stock Connect7.  The Hang Seng Index closed the year at 23,398, down markedly by 14.1% from a year ago.\n\nChart 4 Asset prices\nSources: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market regained some upward momentum in the first half of 2021 alongside better economic prospects, but saw some consolidation in the second half amid weakened asset market sentiments (Chart 4).  Overall, housing prices and transaction volume still recorded an increase of 3.7% and 24.1% respectively in 2021. Household affordability also became even more stretched, partly reflecting reduced household income.  On the other hand, after going through sharp corrections in 2019 and 2020, the non-residential property markets generally improved, with prices and rentals of industrial properties generally rising to their pre-pandemic peaks, whereas those of retail and office spaces remained below their respective peaks.\n\nSee Table B: Major Economic Indicators on pages 326 to 327 for more details, including their trends during 2017–2021.\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nIn early 2022, the fifth wave of local COVID-19 infections has exerted pressures on domestic economic activities. In response, the Government introduced the fifth and the sixth rounds of the Anti-epidemic Fund and additional countercyclical measures under the 2022–23 Budget to help support the economy.  The HKMA, together with the banking sector, also extended the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme to the end of October 2022.\n\nFor 2022 as a whole, economic recovery is expected to continue, albeit at a more moderate pace compared to 2021, partly reflecting the impact of the fifth wave of COVID-19, slower global economic growth, a less favourable base effect and US monetary policy normalisation.  The Government forecasts real GDP growth for 2022 to be in the range of 1–2% and the latest growth estimates by international organisations and private sector analysts averaged 1.1%.  That said, the strength and pace of the recovery are subject to a host of uncertainties and risks, especially those surrounding the pandemic, the Ukraine situation, and the path of US monetary policy normalisation.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nAlongside rising import prices and pandemic-induced logistics disruptions, inflationary pressures are expected to edge up in the near term, but should stay broadly in check owing to soft rentals and mild local labour cost pressures. Market consensus forecasts a headline inflation rate of 2.4% in 2022, while the Government projects the headline and underlying inflation rates to be 2.1% and 2.0% respectively. The fifth wave of local COVID-19 infections has exerted pressures on the labour market in early 2022, especially for contact-intensive sectors.  Further out, labour market conditions will depend on the pandemic developments and the pace of the domestic economic recovery.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector continued to be stable in 2021.  Total banking assets expanded moderately as both loans and deposits increased.  The capital and liquidity positions of the banking sector remained robust. Asset quality stayed at a healthy level by both historical and international standards.\n\n# Balance sheet trends\n\nThe banking sector’s balance sheet grew by 1.9% in 2021. Driven by the economic recovery, total loans recorded a growth of 3.8% during the year, compared with 1.2% in 2020.  Among the total, loans for use in Hong Kong grew by 4.4%, loans for use outside Hong Kong grew by 1.1% and trade finance increased by 14.2%.  Mainland-related lending expanded by 3.6% in 2021, after remaining largely stable in 2020.\n\nOn the liability side, total deposits rose by 4.6% in 2021, compared with 5.4% in 2020.  As total deposits increased at a faster pace than total loans, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio edged down to 71.8% at the end of 2021 from 72.3% a year ago (Chart 5).\n\nChart 5 Loans and deposits of the banking sector\nSource: HKMA.\n\n# Capital adequacy\n\nThe banking sector remained well capitalised. The consolidated total capital ratio of locally incorporated authorized institutions (AIs) stood at 20.2% at the end of 2021.  The Tier 1 capital ratio was 18.2% (Chart 6). Both ratios were well above their respective international minimum requirements of 8% and 6%.\n\nThe Basel III leverage ratio was 7.9% at the end of 2021, well above the statutory minimum requirement of 3% (Chart 7).\n\n# Liquidity\n\nThe liquidity position of the banking sector was sound.  The quarterly average Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) of category 1 institutions8 was 151.9% in the fourth quarter of 2021, well\n\nabove the statutory minimum requirement of 100%. The quarterly average Liquidity Maintenance Ratio (LMR) of category 2 institutions was 59.1%, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 25% (Chart 8).\n\nChart 8 Liquidity ratios of designated AIs\nSource: HKMA.\n\nThe sources of funding of the banking sector remained stable.  The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) of category 1 institutions was 135.3% at the end of 2021, well above the statutory minimum requirement of 100%.  The Core Funding\n\nRatio (CFR) of category 2A institutions9 was 150.3% at the end of 2021, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 75% (Chart 9).\n\nChart 9 Funding ratios of designated AIs\nSource: HKMA.\n\n# Asset quality\n\nAsset quality remained stable during the year and stayed at a healthy level by both historical and international standards. The classified loan ratio was 0.88% at the end of 2021 as compared to 0.90% at the end of 2020, with the overdue and rescheduled loan ratio edging down to 0.56% from 0.57% during the period (Chart 10).  The classified loan ratio for Mainland-related lending was 0.86% at the end of 2021 as compared to 0.96% at the end of 2020.  The delinquency ratios of residential mortgage lending and credit card lending remained low at 0.04% and 0.20% respectively (Chart 11). The HKMA will continue to closely monitor the change in the asset quality of the banking sector.\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe low interest rate environment continued to weigh on the profitability of the banking sector.  The aggregate pre-tax operating profit of retail banks declined by 19.8% in 2021 (Chart 12), mainly attributable to a decrease in net interest income (-13.6%) and an increase in total operating expenses (+7.1%).  These were partly offset by an increase in income from fees and commissions (+9.6%) and a drop in loan impairment charges (-25.1%).  The net interest margin further narrowed to 0.98% in 2021 from 1.18% in 2020 (Chart 13).\n\nRetail banks’ cost-to-income ratio rose to 54.7% in 2021 from 47.0% in 2020 (Chart 14).\n","terms":{"12-month expected credit losses":["12個月預期信用虧損"],"2022–23 Budget":["2022至23年度財政預算案"],"24\/7 operations":["每日24小時無間斷運作"],"80% and 90% Guarantee Products":["八成及九成信貸擔保產品"],"A hub for

經濟及金融環境\n\n憑藉強勁的貨物出口、復甦的內需，以及政府相關政策措施的推動，香港經濟於2021年恢復正增長，扭轉了2019年及2020年的衰退局面。勞工市場亦有所改善，通脹雖然略有上升，但整體仍保持溫和。雖然預期在第五波新冠疫情消退後，經濟復甦將持續，但其強度和速度仍面臨不確定性和風險，尤其是與疫情及美國貨幣政策正常化路徑相關的風險。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 實體經濟活動\n\n在強勁的貨物出口及改善中的本地需求帶動下，香港經濟於2021年增長6.3%，結束了2019年及2020年的經濟衰退（表1及圖1）。私人消費得以復甦，這歸功於勞工市場狀況改善，以及政府「消費券計劃」1的推動。隨著營商環境和前景好轉，整體投資開支亦出現反彈2。在外圍方面，香港全年貨物出口錄得強勁增長，部分原因是全球經濟持續復甦。服務輸出錄得溫和增長，反映區內貿易和貨物流量活躍，以及跨境商業和金融活動更為強勁。總進口額顯著上升，主要是由於本地需求和轉口需求增加。從淨額角度看，由於總出口增長快於進口，對外貿易在2021年對實質本地生產總值（GDP）的增長作出了正面貢獻（圖1）。\n\n表一 按開支項目劃分的實質GDP成長率（同期比較）\n\n注意：本地固定資本形成總額的經季節性調整按季增減幅度並無提供。資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 通貨膨脹\n\n通脹壓力在當年略有上升，但整體仍保持溫和。若扣除政府一次性紓困措施的影響，基本通脹率按年逐步回升至12月的溫和水平1.4%（圖表2）4。隨著本地消費需求改善，外出用膳、交通、服裝及鞋類等消費項目的價格重拾升勢。此外，受全球供應鏈瓶頸及國際能源和商品價格飆升影響，進口價格亦顯著上升。相比之下，租金項目對整體通脹構成拖累，反映早前新簽訂的私人住宅租金下跌的影響（圖表2）。更廣泛而言，名義工資及商業樓宇租金增幅放緩，有助抑制本地企業的成本壓力。整體而言，2021年的基本通脹率及整體通脹率分別維持在溫和的0.6%及1.6%水平。\n\n圖表 2 基本消費者物價通脹\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 勞工市場\n\n隨著國內經濟復甦，2021 年的勞工市場有所改善。失業率在 2 月攀升至 17 年來的最高點 7.2% 後，於 12 月顯著下降至 4.0%6（圖 3），且下降趨勢遍及大多數經濟行業。整體勞動需求逐步增強，總就業人數（圖 3）和私營機構職位空缺均有所回升，儘管仍低於疫情前的峰值。另一方面，與去年同期相比，12 月的勞動人口略微減少了 1.3%，部分原因是勞動人口參與率小幅下降。名義工資和勞工收入的同比增長雖然溫和，但在 2021 年前三季度卻出現加速跡象，扭轉了 2019 年至 2020 年期間的減速趨勢。\n\n圖表 3 勞工市場狀況\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 股市\n\n當地股市在過去一年普遍表現疲弱，儘管部分主要海外股市持續上漲（圖4）。恒生指數延續2020年底的反彈勢頭，於2021年2月17日升至31,085點高位，但此後市場情緒急劇轉差，主因包括對新冠病毒新變異株的擔憂、主要央行可能收緊貨幣政策，以及「港股通」南向交易流入量減少等多項因素。恒生指數在年底收報23,398點，較去年同期顯著下跌14.1%。\n\n**圖表 4

房地產市場\n\n2021年上半年，隨著經濟前景改善，住宅物業市場重拾上升動能，但下半年由於資產市場氣氛轉弱，市場出現了整固情況（圖4）。整體而言，2021年樓價及成交量分別錄得3.7%及24.1%的升幅。家庭置業負擔能力進一步惡化，部分原因是家庭收入減少。另一方面，非住宅物業市場在2019及2020年經歷劇烈修正後，整體有所改善，其中工業物業的價格及租金普遍回升至疫情前的峰值水平，而零售及寫字樓物業的價格及租金則仍低於各自的高峰。\n\n請參閱第 326 至 327 頁的表 B：主要經濟指標，以了解更多詳情，包括 2017 年至 2021 年的趨勢。\n\n# 經濟展望\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n2022年初，第五波本地新冠疫情對國內經濟活動造成壓力。為此，政府推出第五及第六輪防疫抗疫基金，並在2022至23年度財政預算案下採取額外逆周期措施，以支持經濟。金管局亦與銀行業合作，將預先批核還息不還本計劃延長至2022年10月底。\n\n預期2022年全年經濟復甦將持續，但步伐相較於2021年將較為溫和，部分原因是受到第五波新冠病毒疫情的影響、全球經濟增長放緩、基數效應較不理想，以及美國貨幣政策正常化。政府預測2022年實質GDP增長率將介於1%至2%之間，而國際組織和私人分析師的最新增長預估值平均為1.1%。然而，復甦的力度和速度面臨諸多不確定性和風險，尤其是與疫情、烏克蘭局勢，以及美國貨幣政策正常化路徑相關的風險。\n\n# 通貨膨脹與就業市場\n\n在進口價格上升及疫情導致物流受阻的背景下，預期通膨壓力在短期內會有所上升，但由於租金疲軟及本地勞工成本壓力溫和，通膨壓力應可大致受控。市場共識預測2022年的整體通膨率為2.4%，而政府則預測整體通膨率及基本通膨率分別為2.1%及2.0%。本地第五波新冠疫情在2022年初對勞工市場造成壓力，尤其是面對面接觸的行業。往後，勞工市場狀況將取決於疫情發展及本地經濟復甦的步伐。\n\n# 銀行體系表現\n\n香港銀行業在2021年持續保持穩定。由於貸款及存款均有所增加，銀行體系資產總額出現溫和增長。銀行業的資本及流動性狀況保持強健。資產質素無論按歷史標準或國際標準而言，均維持在健康水平。\n\n# 資產負債表趨勢\n\n銀行業的資產負債表在2021年成長了1.9%。受惠於經濟復甦，全年貸款總額成長了3.8%，相較於2020年的1.2%有所增加。其中，用於香港的貸款成長了4.4%，用於香港以外的貸款成長了1.1%，而貿易融資則成長了14.2%。與內地相關的貸款在2020年大致持平後，於2021年成長了3.6%。\n\n在負債方面，2021年存款總額上升了4.6%，低於2020年的5.4%。由於存款總額的增速高於貸款總額，整體貸存比率由去年的72.3%略微下降至2021年底的71.8%（圖表5）。\n\n**圖表 5 銀行業貸款與存款**\n**資料來源：金管局**\n\n# 資本充足性\n\n銀行業的資本狀況依然充足。截至2021年底，本地註冊的認可機構合併總資本比率為20.2%，而一級資本比率則為18.2%（圖6）。這兩個比率均遠高於國際最低要求，分別為8%和6%。\n\n《巴塞爾協定三》槓桿比率於2021年底為7.9%，遠高於3%的法定最低要求（圖表7）。\n\n# 流動性\n\n銀行體系的流動性狀況良好。2021年第四季度，第1類機構的流動性覆蓋比率（LCR）季度平均值為151.9%，遠高於法定最低要求。\n\n高於法定最低要求的100%。第2類機構的流動性維持比率（LMR）季度平均值為59.1%，亦遠高於法定最低要求的25%（圖表8）。\n\n圖表 8 指定認可機構的流動性比率\n資料來源：金管局\n\n銀行業的資金來源維持穩定。截至2021年底，第1類機構的穩定資金淨額比率（NSFR）為135.3%，遠高於法定最低要求的100%。核心資金\n\n第2A類機構的資金比率（CFR）在2021年底為150.3%，亦遠高於法定最低要求的75%（圖9）。\n\n圖表 9 指定認可機構的資金比率\n資料來源：金管局\n\n# 資產質素\n\n資產質素在過去一年保持穩定，無論從歷史數據或國際標準來看，均維持在健康水平。2021年底的特定分類貸款比率為0.88%，低於2020年底的0.90%，而同期逾期及經重組貸款比率則由0.57%微降至0.56%（圖10）。與內地相關的貸款之特定分類貸款比率在2021年底為0.86%，亦低於2020年底的0.96%。住宅按揭貸款及信用卡貸款的拖欠比率分別維持在0.04%及0.20%的低水平（圖11）。金管局將繼續密切監察銀行體系的資產質素變化。\n\n# 盈利趨勢\n\n低利率環境持續對銀行業的獲利能力造成壓力。2021年，零售銀行的稅前營業利潤總額下降了19.8%（圖12），主要原因是淨利息收入減少（-13.6%）及營業總開支增加（+7.1%）。這些影響部分被手續費及佣金收入的增加（+9.6%）及貸款減值損失的下降（-25.1%）所抵消。2021年，淨利息差進一步收窄至0.98%，而2020年則為1.18%（圖13）。\n\n零售銀行的成本與收入比率由2020年的47.0%上升至2021年的54.7%（圖14）。"}
{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nDespite the lingering uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and increased concerns about the pace of US monetary tightening, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to trade in a smooth and orderly manner.  As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability since it was implemented in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System has shown its strength and resilience to external shocks.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability.  This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\n# The Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n\nCertificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks; Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation; the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of clearing account balances kept with the HKMA; and Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs).  With the HKMA standing ready to sell (or buy) Hong Kong dollars to (or from) banks in exchange for US dollars upon request at 7.75 (or 7.85) per US dollar, when the strong-side (or weak-side) CU is triggered, the Aggregate Balance will expand (or contract) to push down (or up) Hong Kong dollar interest rates that would help move the Hong Kong dollar back to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2021\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nDriven by equity-related demand arising from fundraising activities and the southbound Stock Connects1, the Hong Kong dollar traded close to the strong-side CU at the beginning of the year.  Thereafter, the Hong Kong dollar weakened amid stock market correction and repatriation of initial public offering (IPO) proceeds by some newly listed firms before rebounding slightly in the second quarter due to corporates’ dividend payment needs and net inflows from the southbound Stock Connects.  Stepping into the second half of the year, while the Hong Kong dollar drifted lower amid softened equity market sentiment, it stayed mostly at the strong side of the Convertibility Zone and continued to trade in a smooth and orderly manner (Chart 1).  Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market functioned normally throughout 2021.\n\nChart 1 Market exchange rate in 2021\n\nAs the CUs were not triggered, the total of the Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs remained virtually unchanged at around HK$1,526.3 billion in 2021 (Chart 2). During the year, the HKMA issued a total of HK$80 billion additional Exchange Fund Bills to meet the ongoing demand for Exchange Fund paper by banks amid the abundance of liquidity in the banking system, which led to a contraction of the Aggregate Balance from HK$457.5 billion at the end of 2020 to HK$377.5 billion at the end of 2021.\n\nReflecting the additional issuance of Exchange Fund Bills and the issuance of EFBNs to absorb EFBNs’ interest payments according to the established practice, the outstanding EFBNs increased from HK$1,069.2 billion to HK$1,148.8 billion during the year.  The Monetary Base as a whole remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\n# HK$1,526.3 billion\n\nTotal Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs\n\nChart 2 Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding Exchange Fund papers in 2021\n\n# Money market\n\nWith the sizeable Aggregate Balance, the Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained largely stable at low levels throughout the year (Chart 3).  While the demand for the Hong Kong dollar increased along with the IPO activities during the first quarter, Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs) of various tenors saw little fluctuations.  Thereafter, HIBORs remained largely stable despite concerns about the pace of US monetary tightening.  Towards the end of 2021, HIBORs witnessed mild pick-ups, partly reflecting anticipated funding needs towards the year end.  On the retail front, banks kept their Best Lending Rates unchanged.  Overall, Hong Kong’s money markets continued to function normally.  Discount Window borrowing decreased to HK$6.8 billion in 2021 from HK$9.1 billion in 2020.\n\nChart 3 Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates in 2021\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nThe Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has been a strong anchor of Hong Kong’s financial system for more than three decades and has shown its strength and resilience to challenges.  Despite lingering uncertainties surrounding global economic recovery, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to function in an orderly manner, reflecting the robustness of the LERS.  The Government is firmly committed to the LERS.  In its 2021 External Sector Report, the International Monetary Fund once again reiterated that the credibility of the LERS has been assured by a transparent set of rules, ample fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nA robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS.  Hong Kong’s banking sector continued to operate smoothly with liquidity positions and capitalisation faring very well by international standards.  To ensure resilience of the banking sector, the HKMA has been closely monitoring banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and has maintained its supervisory efforts on bank lending.\n\nTo improve transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998.  The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) moved within a range of 109.8–110.5% during 2021, without touching the Upper or the Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 110.2% on 31 December (Chart 4). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate.  The ample financial resources of the Exchange Fund, together with the sound banking system, provide a powerful backstop to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nChart 4 Daily movement of the Backing Ratio in 2021\n\n# Currency Board Sub-Committee\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong.  In 2021, the CBC considered issues, including an assessment of inflation in the US, implications of the US dollar depreciation on Hong Kong, assessment of the taper tantrum risk and its impact on Hong Kong, and understanding the influence of Mainland-related fund flows on monetary conditions in Hong Kong.  Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and reports on the Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Notes and coins\n\nAt the end of 2021, the total value of banknotes issued by note-issuing banks in circulation was HK$592.6 billion, an increase of 5.9% from a year earlier (Charts 5, 6 and 7). The total value of Government-issued notes and coins in circulation amounted to HK$12.9 billion at the end of 2021, up 1.7% year on year (Charts 8 and 9).\n\n# HK$592.6 billion, +5.9%\n\nTotal value of banknotes issued by note-issuing banks\n\n# HK$12.9 billion, +1.7%\n\nTotal value of notes and coins issued by Government\n\n# Chart 5\n\nBanknotes in circulation by note-issuing banks at the end of 2021\n\n# Chart 6 \n\nDistribution of banknotes in circulation at the end of 2021\n\n# Hong Kong banknotes\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA arranged 14 seminars for more than 4,000 participants, including professionals in the banking and retail industries as well as students, to help enhance their knowledge and skills in differentiating between authentic and counterfeit banknotes.  These public education programmes on the design and security features of Hong Kong banknotes are well received.\n\n# Coin Collection Programme\n\nThe Coin Collection Programme continued to be well received by the public.  More information about the Programme can be found in the Sustainability chapter on page 198.\n\n# Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\n\nThe EFBN Programme continued to operate smoothly. To meet the ongoing demand for Exchange Fund paper by banks amid the abundance of liquidity in the banking system, the HKMA issued a total of HK$80 billion additional Exchange Fund Bills in the second half of 2021.  The additional issuance resulted in a corresponding reduction of the Aggregate Balance.  At the end of 2021, the nominal amount of outstanding Exchange Fund papers stood at HK$1,148.6 billion (Table 2).\n\nTable 2 Outstanding issues of Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\n\n# Monetary research\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMR)  maintained a steady research output in 2021 despite the ongoing pandemic.  During the year, the HKIMR released 30 working papers and held nine webinars, which encompassed a wide range of topics including monetary policy, banking stability, market microstructure and financial technology (fintech) development.  The HKIMR also organised an international conference and a webinar in hybrid format.\n\nThe webinar, titled RMB Exchange Rate Formation Mechanism and Exchange Rate Outlook, was co-organised with the Hong Kong Academy of Finance on 17 August.  It was live-streamed on a number of online platforms and attracted a total of over 1.16 million real-time views.\n\nThe 11th Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy, titled On the Path to Common Prosperity: China’s Economic Development in Dual Circulation, was held on 11 November.  The conference discussed recent policy developments related to common prosperity, dual circulation, anti-monopoly regulations, property market, Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect and financial developments in the Greater Bay Area5.  Expert speakers also presented in-depth analyses on the impact of population ageing and the sustainability of social security funds, as well as China’s contribution to global financial stability and world economy.  The six different sessions of the conference attracted over 3,200 online and on-site viewers, totaling 5,900 views.\n\n","terms":{"12-month expected credit losses":["12個月預期信用虧損"],"2022–23

目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的首要目標是維持貨幣穩定。這是指香港貨幣在外匯市場上相對美元的兌換價值保持穩定，兌換匯率在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的區間內波動。貨幣體系的結構以貨幣發行局制度為特色，要求貨幣基礎至少需由外匯基金持有的美元儲備100%支持，且貨幣基礎的任何變動都必須與美元儲備的相應變動完全匹配。\n\n# 貨幣基礎（表1）包括以下項目：\n\n負債證明書為三家發鈔銀行發行的紙幣提供全額擔保；政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣；總結餘，即存放於金管局的結算戶口結餘總額；以及由金管局代表政府發行的外匯基金票據及債券（EFBNs）。\n\n港元匯率的穩定，是透過自動利率調節機制，以及金管局堅定履行兌換保證（CUs）來維持的。當強方（或弱方）兌換保證被觸發時，金管局隨時準備應銀行要求，以每美元7.75（或7.85）港元的匯率向銀行出售（或購買）港元。屆時，總結餘將會增加（或減少），以推低（或推高）港元利率，從而協助港元匯率回升至7.75至7.85的兌換範圍之內。\n\n# 2021 年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n受集資活動及南向「港股通」1 所帶動的股票相關需求影響，港元匯率在今年初曾觸及「兌換保證」的強方水平。其後，港元匯率因股市調整及部分新上市公司把新股集資所得資金調回國內而有所回軟，及後在第二季因企業派息需求及南向「港股通」錄得淨流入而略為反彈。踏入下半年，雖然港元匯率在股市氣氛轉弱下有所下跌，但大部分時間仍處於「兌換範圍」的強方區域，並繼續有序及暢順地運作（圖表 1）。總體而言，港元匯兌市場在 2021 年全年運作正常。\n\n圖表 1：2021 年市場匯率\n\n由於兌換保證並未被觸發，2021年總結餘及未償還外匯基金票據及債券的總額基本維持不變，約為15,263億港元（圖2）。在銀行體系流動性充裕的情況下，金管局在該年度合共發行了800億港元額外外匯基金票據，以滿足銀行對外匯基金票據的持續需求，導致總結餘由2020年底的4,575億港元降至2021年底的3,775億港元。\n\n因應額外發行外匯基金票據，以及根據既定慣例發行外匯基金票據及債券（EFBNs）以吸收該等票據的利息開支，未償還的外匯基金票據及債券於該年度由10,692億港元增至11,488億港元。整體貨幣基礎繼續獲外匯儲備充分支持。\n\n# 15,263 億港元\n\n總結餘及未償還之外匯基金票據及債券\n\n圖表 2：2021 年貼現窗前總結餘及未償還外匯基金票據總額\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n由於總結餘規模龐大，港元銀行同業拆息在全年大部分時間內維持低水平穩定（圖表 3）。儘管首季港元需求隨新股集資活動增加，但不同期限的香港銀行同業拆息（HIBORs）波動幅度不大。此後，儘管市場對美國收緊貨幣政策的步伐存有疑慮，HIBORs 仍大致保持穩定。至 2021 年底，HIBORs 出現輕微上升，部分反映了預期中的年底資金需求。在零售方面，銀行維持最優惠貸款利率不變。總體而言，香港貨幣市場繼續正常運作。2021 年貼現窗借貸額由 2020 年的 91 億港元降至 68 億港元。\n\n圖表 3：2021 年港元銀行同業拆息\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n聯繫匯率制度（LERS）已是香港金融體系逾三十年的重要支柱，並展現出其應對挑戰的實力與韌性。儘管全球經濟復甦仍存在不確定性，港元匯率及貨幣市場仍能有序運作，反映出聯繫匯率制度的穩健性。政府堅定支持聯繫匯率制度。國際貨幣基金組織在2021年的《對外部門報告》中再次重申，聯繫匯率制度的可信度得益於一套透明的規則、充足的財政及外匯儲備、強而有力的金融監管與監督、靈活的經濟體，以及審慎的財政制度。\n\n穩健的銀行體系對於聯匯制度的正常運作至關重要。香港銀行業繼續保持順暢運作，其流動性及資本狀況根據國際標準表現良好。為確保銀行業的韌性，金管局一直密切監察銀行在信用、流動性及利率風險的管理情況，以及壓力測試結果，並持續對銀行貸款進行監管。\n\n為提高貨幣發行局帳目的透明度，自1998年10月起，外匯基金資產中的一定部分已被劃撥用以支持貨幣基礎。2021年間，支持比率（定義為支持資產除以貨幣基礎）在109.8%至110.5%的範圍內波動，並未觸及上限或下限觸發水平。該比率於12月31日收報110.2%（圖表4）。在聯匯制度下，雖然外匯基金的特定資產已被指定為支持組合，但所有外匯基金資產均可用於支持港元匯率。外匯基金充裕的財務資源，加上健全的銀行體系，為香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供了強有力的後盾。\n\n圖表 4：2021 年支持比率每日變動情形\n\n# 貨幣發行委員會小組委員會\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會下的貨幣發行委員會（CBC）負責監察及檢討與香港貨幣及金融穩定相關的事宜。2021年，CBC 審視了多項議題，包括評估美國的通脹情況、美元貶值對香港的影響、評估「縮減恐慌」風險及其對香港的影響，以及了解與內地相關的資金流動對香港貨幣狀況的影響。CBC 就這些議題進行的討論記錄，以及提交給 CBC 的貨幣發行局運作報告，均已刊登於金管局網站上。\n\n# 紙幣與硬幣\n\n截至2021年底，發鈔銀行發行的流通紙幣總值為5,926億港元，較前一年增加5.9%（圖表5、6及7）。截至2021年底，政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣總值達129億港元，較前一年上升1.7%（圖表8及9）。\n\n# 港元5926億元，增幅5.9%\n\n發鈔銀行發行之紙幣總值\n\n#

{"en":"# Banking Stability\n\nThe banking sector in Hong Kong remained sound and stable in 2021, despite the emergence of more contagious COVID-19 variants, causing uncertainty to global economic recovery.  During the year, the HKMA remained focused on the supervision of authorized institutions’ risk management.  Supervision of authorized institutions’ operational and cyber resilience was also stepped up in light of escalating cyber threats and accelerating digitalisation in the banking sector.\n\nOn conduct supervision, the HKMA provided guidance to banks to facilitate the use of non-face-to-face channels for distributing investment and insurance products, and worked with fellow regulators to formulate supervisory requirements on new products in the market such as insurance-linked securities and virtual assets.  The Code of Banking Practice was also revised to enhance consumer protection in digital financial services.\n\nIn the area of anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT), the HKMA’s priority has been to further strengthen banks’ gatekeeper role in the ecosystem and their ability to prevent and detect illicit fund flows associated with increases in online fraud, mule account networks and other financial crimes during the pandemic.  To increase protection for customer accounts against fraud and financial crimes, the HKMA scaled up collaboration and information sharing with other stakeholders via public-private partnerships.  While supporting remote customer on-boarding, the HKMA also encouraged adoption of other technologies including network analytics through the launch of the first AML Regtech Lab in November.  Internationally, proactive engagement has kept the HKMA at the forefront of global AML\/CFT efforts in the Financial Action Task Force.\n\nOn the development front, the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Pilot Scheme in the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area was launched smoothly in September.  During the year, the HKMA continued to execute its two-year roadmap for promoting Regtech adoption in Hong Kong.  Several initiatives were rolled out to lay the foundation for banks’ climate risk management and promote green and sustainable banking more broadly, as discussed in the Sustainability chapter. Further efforts were also made in the area of soft infrastructure, including promoting a customercentric corporate culture, as well as working with the banking industry to roll out capacity-building initiatives to facilitate talent development.\n\nMeanwhile, the HKMA has worked closely with the banking industry in optimising supervisory policies and processes. Good progress was made on implementing international supervisory standards locally, including those on capital adequacy and disclosure.  The HKMA continued to advance its work to ensure a credible resolution regime for authorized institutions, including developing new resolution standards and implementing rules on loss-absorbing capacity requirements to enhance authorized institutions’ resolvability.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system.  Achieving this objective is contingent upon a highly resilient financial system that is capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their businesses and, in extreme cases, by failing in a disorderly manner.  The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring that banks are resilient to shocks and able to recover their positions in crises, ultimately helping to prevent failures.  The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks and is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs).\n\nHowever, the Monetary Authority cannot ensure, nor is the Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework designed to ensure, a zero-risk financial system.  Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that, in the event of an AI becoming non-viable, its failure can be managed in an orderly manner.  To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong has been established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs, among other types of institutions.  To operationalise the resolution regime in Hong Kong, it is important to lay down resolution rules and policy standards, undertake resolution planning to remove impediments to AIs’ resolvability and develop the HKMA’s operational capability to resolve a failing AI.  In order to carry out these tasks effectively, the HKMA adopts an internationally harmonised and co-ordinated approach.\n\nThe Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs). In overseeing FMIs, the HKMA aims to promote their general safety and efficiency, limit systemic risk and foster transparency.  Making FMIs more resilient to financial crises protects the monetary and financial systems in Hong Kong from possible destabilising effects arising from disruption to the FMIs.  Information regarding the HKMA’s oversight approach is available on the HKMA website.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2021\n\n# Licensing\n\nAt the end of 2021, Hong Kong had:\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA granted two banking licences and one restricted bank licence to three non-local banks. The HKMA also granted a money broker approval to a foreign trading platform operator.  The authorizations of three licensed banks and two restricted licence banks were revoked during the year.\n\nMore information about the AIs and local representative offices in Hong Kong can be found in the Annex and Tables D to F on pages 321 to 324, and 330 to 333 respectively.\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nThe HKMA conducted 189 off-site reviews covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL rating assessment1, corporate governance, risk management and financial technology (fintech) strategies.  As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance, 40 meetings were held with the AIs’ boards of directors, independent non-executive directors or board-level committees.  A further 38 tripartite meetings were held among the HKMA, AIs and their external auditors.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA conducted regular on-site examinations supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk.  A total of 679 on-site examinations and thematic reviews were carried out during the year with credit risk management as a key focus. Amid growing adoption of technology by banks, management of operational risk and technology risk was another major area of attention.  The HKMA also increased the number of on-site examinations and thematic reviews targeting liquidity and market risk management.  In addition, specialist teams performed on-site examinations and thematic reviews of AIs’ activities in securities, investment products, insurance and mandatory provident fund (MPF)- related businesses, as well as their anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT) controls. Table 1 contains a summary of the HKMA’s supervisory activities in 2021.\n\n# Credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nTotal loans increased by 3.8% in 2021, compared with a growth of 1.2% in 2020.  Table 2 shows the breakdown of growth in loans and advances.\n\nMainland-related lending increased by 3.6% to HK$4,725 billion in 2021 (Table 3).\n\nThe asset quality of the banking sector remained largely stable during the year and stayed at a healthy level by both historical and international standards.  The classified loan ratio of the industry was 0.88% at the end of 2021, down from 0.90% at the end of 2020, well below the long-run historical average of 1.8% since 2000.  The ratio for Mainland-related lending also decreased to 0.86% from 0.96% a year ago.\n\nDuring the year, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to weigh on some sectors of the economy, while credit events in the Mainland property sector caught the attention of the market.  The HKMA enhanced the breadth and depth of its surveillance, with deep-dive reviews focused on banks’ exposures to highly leveraged borrowers. Close communication with banks has been maintained to facilitate up-to-date assessment of the impact of economic and market developments as well as the adequacy of banks’ risk management measures.  The overall credit risk facing the banking sector is assessed to be manageable.  The latest results of the HKMA’s solvency stress tests confirm that the banking sector continues to maintain sufficient capital buffers to withstand extreme stress.\n\nTargeted and thematic examinations were conducted during the year to evaluate AIs’ systems and controls over loan classification and loan loss provisioning, overseas lending operations, and collateralised lending to private banking and wealth management customers.\n\n# Alleviating cash-flow pressure faced by customers\n\nIn September, the HKMA and the Banking Sector Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) Lending Coordination Mechanism announced a six-month extension of the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme until the end of April 2022.  This scheme was first launched in May 2020 to defer loan principal payments of eligible corporate customers by six months.  In light of a resurgence of local coronavirus infections, in February 2022, the scheme was further extended until the end of October 2022.  In addition, the scheme was enhanced to offer a one-year partial principal repayment option to those customers who are financially capable and willing to resume principal repayment gradually.\n\nBy the end of December 2021, banks had approved loan tenor extensions and other forms of relief in over 83,000 cases, involving an aggregate amount of over HK$920 billion. For personal customers, banks had approved more than 52,000 cases of principal payment holidays for residential mortgages and other personal relief loans, amounting to over HK$53 billion.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nThe successive rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures introduced by the HKMA since 2009 have strengthened banks’ risk management and the banking sector’s resilience to a possible abrupt downturn in the local property market.  The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of new residential mortgage loans (RMLs) approved in December 2021 was 53%, compared with 64% in September 2009 before the countercyclical measures were first introduced.  The average debt servicing ratio (DSR) of new mortgages remained low at 36% in December 2021, compared with 41% in August 2010, when a cap on DSR was first applied (Chart 1).\n\n# Operational and technology risks\n\nIn light of banks’ increasing reliance on technology to support their operations, the HKMA stepped up supervision of operational and technology risks.  Key supervisory focuses during the year included controls over cloud outsourcing and remote working arrangements.  The HKMA launched an industry consultation in December on a draft new Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module on “Operational Resilience”. The new SPM module seeks to provide guidance to banks on developing a holistic and integrated operational resilience framework.\n\nThe HKMA introduced the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 in January to reflect the latest sound practices on cyber security risk management.  During the year, the HKMA monitored AIs’ implementation of the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 and reviewed their cyber resilience capabilities.  In view of the growing risk of destructive cyber-attacks, in May, the HKMA requested all AIs to critically assess the need for a secure tertiary data backup, taking reference from the Secure Tertiary Data Backup Guideline issued by the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB).\n\nIn response to heightened risks and rising numbers of phishing attacks, the HKMA worked closely with the industry to strengthen the security of internet and mobile banking services.  A large-scale joint HKMA-HKAB public awareness campaign, themed “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!” began in July (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 Raising public awareness of phishing attacks\n\nSlogan icon for the public awareness campaign themed “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!”\n\n# Liquidity and market risks\n\nTo enhance monitoring of AIs’ liquidity risk exposures, the HKMA introduced additional scenarios into its liquidity stress testing framework to evaluate AIs’ ability to cope with liquidity shocks over a prolonged period.\n\nDuring the year, thematic reviews were conducted to assess the adequacy of AIs’ liquidity stress testing programmes and evaluate the sufficiency of their monitoring metrics and control limits for managing liquidity risk.  The HKMA also carried out reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of AIs’ market risk management frameworks for debt securities investments and operational controls over treasury activities.\n\nThe HKMA closely monitored AIs’ progress in preparing for the transition away from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR).

年出現了更具傳染性的新冠病毒變種，對全球經濟復甦造成不確定性，但香港銀行業仍保持穩健與穩定。在該年度，金管局持續專注於監督認可機構的風險管理。鑑於網路威脅日益增加，以及銀行業數位化進程加速，金管局亦強化了對認可機構營運及網路防禦能力的監管。\n\n在操守監管方面，金管局為銀行提供指引，以促進使用非面對面方式分銷投資及保險產品，並與其他監管機構合作，為市場上新推出的產品（如保險相連證券及虛擬資產）制定監管規定。此外，金管局亦修訂了《銀行操守守則》，以強化數位金融服務的消費者保護。\n\n在打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集方面，金管局的優先工作是進一步強化銀行在生態系統中的把關角色，以及提升其能力，以預防和偵測與疫情期間網路詐騙、傀儡帳戶網路及其他金融犯罪增加有關的不法資金流動。為加強保護客戶帳戶免受詐騙及金融犯罪侵害，金管局透過公私協力，加強與其他利害關係方的協作及資訊共享。在支持遠端開戶的同時，金管局亦鼓勵採用其他科技（包括網路分析），並於 11 月成立首個反洗錢合規科技實驗室。在國際層面，金管局透過積極參與，在財務行動特別組織中繼續領先全球打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集的工作。\n\n在發展方面，粵港澳大灣區跨境理財通試點計畫於 9 月順利推出。在該年度，金管局繼續執行其為期兩年的計畫，以促進合規科技在香港的採用。正如《永續發展》章節所述，金管局推出多項措施，為銀行的氣候風險管理奠定基礎，並更廣泛地推廣綠色及永續銀行業。此外，金管局亦在軟實力方面作出更多努力，包括推廣以客戶為中心的企業文化，以及與銀行業合作推出人才培育計畫，以促進人才發展。\n\n同時，金管局與銀行業緊密合作，優化監管政策及程序。在本地落實國際監管標準（包括資本充足率及資訊披露標準）方面，取得了良好進展。金管局繼續推進其工作，以確保認可機構的處置機制具公信力，包括制定新的處置標準，以及落實有關吸收損失能力的要求規則，以提升認可機構的處置可行性。\n\n# 目標\n\n金管局的總體目標是促進銀行體系的安全與穩定。要實現這一目標，有賴於一個高度具韌性的金融體系，該體系能夠提供香港經濟所需的關鍵金融服務。\n\n銀行的經營方式會影響體系的穩定性，而在極端情況下，銀行若以無序方式倒閉，亦會影響體系的穩定性。作為監管機構，金融管理專員在保障金融穩定方面發揮關鍵作用，確保銀行具備韌性，能夠在危機中恢復其地位，最終有助於預防倒閉。金融管理專員負責對銀行進行審慎監管，並負責在香港發照予持照銀行、限制性持照銀行及接受存款公司（統稱認可機構）。\n\n然而，金融管理專員無法確保（亦非香港審慎監管框架旨在確保）零風險的金融體系。相反，作為處置機構，金融管理專員致力確保，若認可機構變得不可行，其倒閉可以有序方式進行管理。為此，香港已建立金融機構處置機制，其中金融管理專員為認可機構（及其他類型的機構）的處置機構。為在香港落實處置機制，有必要制定處置規則及政策標準，進行處置規劃以消除認可機構處置可行性的障礙，並發展金管局的運作能力以處置倒閉的認可機構。為有效執行這些任務，金管局採用國際協調一致的方法。\n\n金融管理專員亦負責指定及監督某些金融市場基礎設施。在監督金融市場基礎設施時，金管局的目標是促進其整體安全及效率，限制系統性風險，並提升透明度。提高金融市場基礎設施抵禦金融危機的能力，可保護香港貨幣及金融體系免受金融市場基礎設施中斷所可能造成的破壞性影響。有關金管局監督方法的資訊，可於金管局網站查閱。\n\n# 2021 年回顧\n\n# 發照\n\n截至 2021 年底，香港有：\n\n在該年度，金管局向三家非本地銀行發出兩張銀行牌照及一張限制性銀行牌照。金管局亦向一家外資交易平台營運商發出貨幣經紀牌照。在該年度，有三家持照銀行及兩家限制性持照銀行的牌照被撤銷。\n\n有關認可機構及香港本地代表辦事處的更多資訊，可參閱附件及表 D 至 F（第 321 至 324 頁及第 330 至 333 頁）。\n\n# 監管活動概述\n\n金管局進行了 189 次非現場審查，涵蓋廣泛議題，包括 CAMEL 評級評估、企業治理、風險管理及金融科技策略。作為金管局持續努力促進更強風險治理的一部分，與認可機構的董事會、獨立非執行董事或董事會層面委員會舉行了 40 次會議。此外，金管局、認可機構及其外部稽核師亦舉行了 38 次三方會議。\n\n除了非現場活動外，金管局亦進行定期現場檢查，並輔以對評估為高風險領域的專題審查。在該年度，共進行了 679 次現場檢查及專題審查，信用風險管理是主要焦點。鑑於銀行日益採用科技，業務操作風險及科技風險的管理是另一主要關注領域。金管局亦增加了針對流動性及市場風險管理的現場檢查及專題審查次數。此外，專項審查小組對認可機構在證券、投資產品、保險及強積金相關業務方面的活動，以及其打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集的控制措施，進行了現場檢查及專題審查。表 1 概述了金管局在 2021 年的監管活動。\n\n# 信用風險\n\n# 信貸成長及資產品質\n\n與 2020 年成長 1.2% 相比，2021 年貸款總額成長了 3.8%。表 2 顯示貸款及墊款成長的細節。\n\n與內地相關的貸款在 2021 年成長了 3.6%，達 47,250 億港元（表 3）。\n\n銀行業的資產品質在該年度大致保持穩定，並按歷史及國際標準維持在健康水準。行業的特定分類貸款比率在 2021 年底為 0.88%，低於 2020 年底的 0.90%，遠低於自 2000 年以來的長期歷史平均水準 1.8%。與內地相關的貸款比率亦由去年的 0.96% 下降至 0.86%。\n\n在該年度，新冠疫情繼續對某些經濟領域造成影響，而內地房地產市場的信貸事件亦引起市場關注。金管局加強了監察的廣度及深度，進行深入審查，以了解銀行對高槓桿借款人的風險暴露。金管局與銀行保持密切溝通，以促進對經濟及市場發展影響的最新評估，以及銀行風險管理措施的充分性。銀行業面臨的整體信用風險被評估為可控。金管局最新的償債壓力測試結果確認，銀行業繼續維持足夠的資本緩衝，以抵禦極端壓力。\n\n在該年度，進行了有針對性的專題審查，以評估認可機構在貸款分類及貸款虧損準備金、海外貸款業務，以及向私人銀行及財富管理客戶提供抵押貸款方面的制度及控制措施。\n\n# 紓緩客戶面臨的現金流壓力\n\n在 9 月，金管局及銀行業中小企業貸款協調機制宣布，將預先核准還息不還本計畫延長六個月至 2022 年 4 月底。該計畫於 2020 年 5 月首次推出，為合資格企業客戶提供六個月貸款本金還款延期。鑑於本地新冠病毒感染個案再次上升，該計畫於 2022 年 2 月進一步延長至 2022 年 10 月底。此外，該計畫亦作出優化，為有財務能力及意願逐步恢復償還本金的客戶提供一年的部分還本選擇。\n\n截至 2021 年 12 月底，銀行已核准超過 83,000 宗貸款展期及其他形式的紓緩措施，涉及金額超過 9,200 億港元。對於個人客戶，銀行已核准超過 52,000 宗住宅按揭及個人應急貸款的本金還款假期，涉及金額超過 530 億港元。\n\n# 房地產按揭貸款\n\n自 2009 年以來，金管局先後推出多輪逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施，強化銀行的風險管理，並提升銀行業抵禦本地房地產市場可能出現的急劇下跌的能力。2021 年 12 月新核准的住宅按揭貸款平均貸款與價值比率為 53%，而 2009 年 9 月（即首次推出逆周期措施前）則為 64%。2021 年 12 月新按揭的平均還款與收入比率維持在低水準，為 36%，而 2010 年 8 月（即首次實施還款與收入比率上限時）則為 41%（圖 1）。\n\n# 業務操作及科技風險\n\n鑑於銀行日益依賴科技支持其業務，金管局加強了對業務操作及科技風險的監管。在該年度，監管重點包括雲端服務外包及遠端工作安排的控制措施。金管局於 12 月就一份新的《監管政策手冊》模組草稿「運作韌性」展開業內諮詢。新的《監管政策手冊》模組旨在為銀行提供指引，以制定全面及綜合的運作韌性框架。\n\n金管局於 1 月推出網路防禦評估框架 2.0，以反映網路風險管理的最新良好做法。在該年度，金管局監察了認可機構落實網路防禦評估框架 2.0 的情況，並檢視了其網路防禦能力。鑑於具破壞性的網路攻擊風險日益增加，金管局於 5 月要求所有認可機構，參照香港銀行公會（HKAB）發出的《穩固三重數據備份指引》，嚴格評估是否需要穩固的三重數據備份。\n\n為應對日益增加的風險及網路釣魚攻擊案件，金管局與業界緊密合作，加強網路及行動銀行服務的安全性。金管局與香港銀行公會於 7 月聯合推出大型公眾教育活動，主題為「保護你的個人數位金鑰；提防釣魚詐騙！」（圖 1）。\n\n圖 1 提高公眾對網路釣魚攻擊的認識\n\n「保護你的個人數位金鑰；提防釣魚詐騙！」公眾教育活動的口號圖示\n\n# 流動性及市場風險\n\n為加強監察認可機構的流動性風險暴露，金管局在其流動性壓力測試框架中引入了額外情境，以評估認可機構在長時間內應對流動性衝擊的能力。\n\n在該年度，進行了專題審查，以評估認可機構的流動性壓力測試計畫的充分性，並評估其監控指標及控制限額在管理流動性風險方面的充足性。金管局亦進行審查，以評估認可機構在債券投資方面的市場風險管理框架的有效性，以及對財資業務的運作控制。\n\n金管局密切監察認可機構在準備從倫敦銀行同業拆息（LIBOR）過渡至其他備用參考利率方面的進展。金管局與業界公會合作，開發工具以協助認可機構支持其客戶遷移，包括一份傳單以提高企業對過渡的認識，以及一份資訊備忘錄，說明貸款市場中可取代美元 LIBOR 的選項。認可機構已大幅修訂了涉及 LIBOR 設定的合約，而 LIBOR 設定在 2021 年底後已不再公布。金管局提醒認可機構，自 2022 年 1 月 1 日起，不得簽訂新的 LIBOR 合約。"}
{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nDuring 2021, the HKMA achieved good progress in strengthening Hong Kong’s status as a globally competitive international financial centre through a multi-pronged approach.\n\nThe HKMA unveiled “Fintech 2025” strategy to promote the wide adoption of fintech by the financial sector and bolster Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub more broadly.  On the Faster Payment System, it has seen a surge in turnover during the year amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOn enhancing connectivity, significant progress was made during the year with the addition of the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect and Southbound Trading under Bond Connect to the suite of Connect schemes.  Thanks to its world-class market infrastructure and the Connect schemes, Hong Kong is the favoured platform for Mainland funds to tap into global markets and for international investors to access the fast-growing Mainland markets.\n\nAlso during 2021, the HKMA devoted significant efforts in creating new business opportunities to strengthen the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, in areas including bond issuance, asset and wealth management, corporate treasury centres, and green and sustainable finance.  To promote Hong Kong’s financial services, the HKMA stepped up market outreach to overseas and Mainland stakeholders to keep them informed about the resilience of Hong Kong’s financial system and the prospects it presents.\n\nMeanwhile, the HKMA is active in international and regional central banking and regulatory forums, contributing to global efforts in maintaining financial stability and promoting financial market developments.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nThe HKMA announced its “Fintech 2025” strategy, covering a series of initiatives to promote wide adoption of financial technology (fintech) and strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia.  The HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO), together with the banking departments, played a pivotal role in driving various key initiatives during the year including the following:\n\n- Promoting regulatory technology (Regtech) adoption\n- Rolling out the Tech Baseline Assessment to understand banks' adoption of fintech\n\nHong Kong’s position as an offshore renminbi hub remained firm, with offshore renminbi businesses registering robust growth during the year.  Inflows into renminbi assets continued to gather pace as the inclusion of onshore securities in major financial market indices continued. Hong Kong plays an indispensable role in facilitating international investors’ increased allocation to renminbi assets, with the Mainland–Hong Kong Connect schemes being widely accepted as the channels of choice for international investors to access onshore capital markets. In 2021, daily turnover under Northbound Bond Connect increased 34% to around RMB25.8 billion.\n\nFollowing the success of Northbound Bond Connect, Southbound Bond Connect was launched in September, completing the two-way connection between the Mainland and international bond markets.  In the same month, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), the HKMA and the Monetary Authority of Macao promulgated the implementation details for the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Crossboundary WMC) Scheme in the Guangdong–Hong Kong– Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA).  In October, eligible banks in Hong Kong started providing Cross-boundary WMC services together with their Mainland partner banks.\n\n\n\nTo enhance Hong Kong’s role as a key offshore renminbi centre, a working group comprising the HKMA, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) was formed to conduct a feasibility study on promoting trading of renminbi-denominated equity securities in Hong Kong.  A joint seminar was also co-organised by the PBoC and the HKMA in December, showcasing Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre and a leading renminbi business hub.\n\nThe HKMA continues to make progress towards strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform.  In particular, to increase Hong Kong’s appeal as a preferred fund domicile, the HKMA worked closely with the Government and the financial industry to provide a more facilitating tax and regulatory environment for fund formation.  Significant strides were also made in further elevating Hong Kong’s position as a regional green and sustainable finance hub, and as a bond issuance centre. At the same time, the HKMA stepped up market outreach to promote Hong Kong’s financial services to overseas and Mainland stakeholders.\n\nSafe and efficient operation of financial infrastructure is fundamental for reinforcing Hong Kong’s position as a leading international financial centre.  In 2021, the four interbank Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) and the Hong Kong Trade Repository achieved 100%1 system availability, outperforming the target of 99.95%.  Following the launch of Southbound Bond Connect in September, the CMU became the settlement and custodian service provider for transactions conducted under both Northbound and Southbound Bond Connect.\n\nAdoption of the FPS continued to expand in 2021. The number of registrations grew to 9.6 million at the end of 2021 and the average daily turnover for the year rose by 90% from 2020.  Increased use of the FPS for settling Government bills, making merchant payments and topping up stored value facility (SVF) e-wallets or bank accounts were the key drivers for the continued rise in transaction volume, on top of a steady growth in person-to-person and business payments.\n\nTo promote the safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA oversees six designated retail payment systems (RPSs) and supervises 15 licensed SVFs under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO).  During the year, the HKMA facilitated the smooth implementation of the Government’s Consumption Voucher Scheme by co-ordinating and promoting dialogues and co-operation between the relevant Government parties and the SVF licensees appointed for the scheme.\n\nIn January 2022, the HKMA issued a discussion paper on crypto-assets and stablecoins, setting out the HKMA’s thinking on the relevant regulatory approach and inviting views from stakeholders.  Relevant factors, including feedback to this discussion paper and recommendations of relevant international bodies, will be taken into account when drawing up the appropriate regulatory regime.\n\nInternationally, the HKMA is an active member of the central banking community and plays a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees.  For example, the HKMA chairs the Working Group on Financial Markets (WGFM) established under the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP)2.  The HKMA also co-chairs the Policy and Standards Group of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), the Non-Bank Monitoring Experts Group and the Financial Innovation Network of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), and leads a team that looks into supervisory issues associated with financial benchmark transition.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2021\n\n# Hong Kong as a fintech hub in Asia\n\n# Fintech 2025\n\nIn June, the HKMA unveiled its “Fintech 2025” strategy to drive fintech development in Hong Kong.  The strategy aims to encourage the financial sector to adopt technology comprehensively by 2025, as well as to promote the provision of fair and efficient financial services for the benefit of Hong Kong citizens and the economy.  The five focus areas of the strategy are:\n\n- All banks go fintech\n- Future-proofing Hong Kong for CBDCs\n- Creating the next-generation data infrastructure\n- Expanding the fintech-savvy workforce\n- Nurturing the ecosystem with funding and policies\n\nThe HKMA’s “Fintech 2025” strategy drives fintech development in Hong Kong\n\n# Fintech Adoption in the Banking Sector\n\nTo support the “All banks go fintech” initiative of the “Fintech 2025” strategy, the HKMA rolled out the Tech Baseline Assessment in June 2021.  The assessment aims to help the HKMA develop a better understanding of the current fintech landscape in the banking sector, and identify which fintech areas may warrant the HKMA’s support.  All licensed banks with significant operations in Hong Kong were requested to develop a three-year plan for fintech adoption by the end of 2021.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA also continued to implement its two-year roadmap to promote Regtech adoption by banks in Hong Kong, and incorporate technology in its own supervisory processes to improve efficiency and effectiveness.  See page 98 of the Banking Stability chapter for more details.\n\n# Wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency\n\nThe HKMA and the Bank of Thailand expanded the scope of their joint research project with the joining of the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates and the Digital Currency Institute of the PBoC in February 2021.  Renamed as “Multiple Central Bank Digital Currency Bridge (mBridge)” and strongly supported by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Innovation Hub Centre in Hong Kong, the project further explores the capabilities of distributed ledger technology to facilitate real-time cross-border foreign exchange payment-versus-payment (PvP) transactions in a multi-jurisdictional context and on a 24\/7 basis.  A joint report was published in September to deliver the interim findings, followed by the publication of potential use cases and a future roadmap in November.\n\n# Retail Central Bank Digital Currency\n\nTo future-proof Hong Kong in terms of CBDC readiness, the HKMA started a study on the prospect of issuing retail CBDC in Hong Kong, i.e. e-HKD, covering both technical and policy considerations.  In collaboration with the BIS Innovation Hub Centre in Hong Kong, the HKMA embarked on a study called Project Aurum to explore the technical aspect of issuing retail CBDC.  Separately, an internal cross-departmental working group was set up to study the relevant technical, policy and legal issues.  In October, the HKMA released a technical white paper titled e-HKD: A technical perspective to explore and invite comments on potential technical design options for issuing and distributing retail CBDC.\n\nFurthermore, the HKMA supports the Digital Currency Institute of the PBoC on the technical pilot testing of using e-CNY for cross-boundary payments.  This will help promote interconnection in the GBA and bring greater convenience to Hong Kong and Mainland tourists by enhancing the efficiency and user experience of cross-boundary payments.\n\n# Commercial Data Interchange\n\nIn July, the HKMA hosted a virtual symposium to encourage banks and SVF operators to join the CDI, a next-generation financial data infrastructure that aims to enable more efficient financial intermediation in the banking system.  To further facilitate development and adoption, the launch of the CDI Innovation Hub was announced during the symposium. To facilitate small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) financing, the HKMA completed two phases of proof-of-concept study examining the technical feasibility of the CDI.  Applying alternative data to facilitate credit assessment and the underwriting of loans, more than 550 SME loans exceeding HK$900 million in total were approved by the participating banks during the study.  Based on the encouraging results, the HKMA announced the pilot launch of the CDI in November.\n\nSME owners commend the CDI for streamlining their loan applications\n\n# Talent development\n\nTo expand the fintech talent pool, the HKMA continued to run the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme 2.0 in collaboration with its strategic partners3 to nurture young talent at various stages of their career development. More than 180 students benefitted from the scheme in 2021. Separately, the Industry Project Masters Network scheme was piloted in September to provide opportunities for master’s degree students majoring in fintech to work on real-life fintech projects.  To form strategic partnerships and foster collaboration in areas including fintech talent development, the HKMA entered into memorandums of understanding (MoUs) with four local universities in October.\n\nMr Colin Pou (middle), Executive Director (Financial Infrastructure) of HKMA, at the MoU signing ceremony with four local universities\n\n# Fintech Supervisory Sandbox\n\nThe use of Fintech Supervisory Sandbox (FSS) continued to rise during the year.  As of end-December 2021, a total of 234 pilot trials of fintech initiatives had been allowed in the FSS since its launch in 2016, compared with 193 as of end-2020.  As of end-December 2021, the HKMA had also received in total 666 requests to access the FSS Chatroom for supervisory feedback at the early stage of fintech projects since the introduction of the Chatroom in 2017.  Over 63% of the Chatroom requests were made by technology firms (tech firms) .\n","terms":{"12-month expected credit losses":["12個月預期信用虧損"],"2022–23 Budget":["2022至23年度財政預算案"],"24\/7

年期間，金管局透過多管齊下的方式，在鞏固香港作為具全球競爭力的國際金融中心的地位方面，取得了顯著進展。\n\n金管局推出「金融科技2025」策略，以促進金融業廣泛採用金融科技，並進一步鞏固香港作為金融科技樞紐的地位。在轉數快方面，該系統在COVID-19疫情期間錄得全年交易量激增。\n\n在提升互聯互通方面，本年度取得了顯著進展，將「跨境理財通」及「債券通」下的「南向通」納入互聯互通機制中。憑藉其世界級的市場基礎設施及互聯互通機制，香港已成為內地資金進入全球市場，以及國際投資者進入快速增長的內地市場的首選平台。\n\n在2021年期間，金管局亦投入大量精力，在債券發行、資產及財富管理、企業財資中心及綠色和可持續金融等領域創造新商機，以強化香港金融平台的競爭力。為推廣香港的金融服務，金管局加強了與海外及內地持份者的市場聯繫，讓他們了解香港金融體系的韌性及其所呈現的前景。\n\n同時，金管局積極參與國際及區域性的中央銀行及監管組織論壇，為全球維持金融穩定及促進金融市場發展的努力作出貢獻。\n\n# 概述\n\n金管局宣布了「金融科技2025」策略，該策略涵蓋一系列措施，旨在推動金融科技的廣泛應用，並鞏固香港作為亞洲金融科技樞紐的地位。金管局金融科技促進辦公室（FFO）與銀行部門合作，在過去一年中發揮了關鍵作用，推動了多項重要措施，包括下列各項：\n\n- 推動合規科技（Regtech）的採用\n- 推出金融科技基線評估，以了解銀行對金融科技的採用情況\n\n香港作為離岸人民幣樞紐的地位依然穩固，過去一年離岸人民幣業務呈現強勁增長。隨著在岸證券持續被納入主要金融市場指數，人民幣資產的資金流入量也持續增加。香港在促進國際投資者增加人民幣資產配置方面扮演了不可或缺的角色，而內地與香港之間的互聯互通機制，更被廣泛視為國際投資者進入在岸資本市場的首選管道。2021年，北向債券通的日均交易量增長了34%，達到約人民幣258億元。\n\n在「北向債券通」成功後，南向債券通於九月推出，實現了內地與國際債券市場的雙向連結。同月，中國人民銀行、香港金管局及澳門金融管理局公佈了《粵港澳大灣區跨境理財通業務試點》的實施細則。十月，香港符合資格的銀行開始與內地合作銀行共同提供跨境理財通服務。\n\n**XYZ 公司年度財務報告**\n**執行摘要**\nXYZ 公司很高興呈交截至 2022 年 12 月 31 日止財政年度的年度財務報告。公司收入實現顯著增長，同比增長 15%。這歸功於我們成功推出新產品線，以及持續關注創新與客戶滿意度。\n**財務亮點**\n- 收入：5,000 萬美元（較 2021 年增長 15%）\n- 淨利潤：1,000 萬美元（較 2021 年增長 20%）\n- 每股收益：0.50 美元（較 2021 年增長 25%）\n- 宣告股息：每股 0.25 美元\n**挑戰與機遇**\n儘管我們的財務表現強勁，但我們認識到未來仍面臨挑戰。全球經濟前景仍不確定，我們必須持續監控市場狀況並相應調整策略。然而，我們也看到了增長機會，特別是在新興市場和透過策略性合作夥伴關係。\n**結論**\n總而言之，XYZ 公司已為持續成長和成功做好準備。我們將繼續秉持創新、客戶滿意和財務責任的核心價值觀，並期待在未來與股東分享我們的進展。\n\n為強化香港作為主要離岸人民幣中心的地位，由金管局、證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）及香港交易及結算所有限公司（港交所）組成的工作小組已成立，以進行可行性研究，促進人民幣計價股票在香港的交易。此外，人民銀行與金管局於去年十二月合辦了一場聯合研討會，展示了香港作為國際金融中心及領先人民幣業務樞紐的地位。\n\n金管局在強化香港金融平台的競爭力方面持續取得進展。特別為了提升香港作為首選基金註冊地的吸引力，金管局與政府及金融業界緊密合作，為基金成立提供更便利的稅務及監管環境。此外，香港在進一步鞏固其作為區域綠色和可持續金融中心及債券發行中心的地位方面，也取得了重大進展。同時，金管局加強了市場推廣工作，向海外及內地持份者推廣香港的金融服務。\n\n金融基礎設施的安全及高效運作，對鞏固香港作為領先國際金融中心的地位至關重要。2021年，四間銀行間即時支付結算（RTGS系統）系統、債務工具中央結算系統（CMU）及香港交易資料儲存庫的系統可用性均達100%1，超出99.95%的目標。在「南向債券通」於九月推出後，CMU系統成為「北向債券通」及「南向債券通」下交易的結算及託管服務供應商。\n\n2021年，「轉數快」的採用率持續上升。截至2021年底，登記數目增至960萬，而該年的日均交易量較2020年上升了90%。除了個人對個人及企業對企業的支付穩步增長外，使用「轉數快」支付政府帳單、商戶付款及為儲值支付工具的電子錢包或銀行帳戶增值，是交易量持續上升的主要原因。\n\n為提升本地零售支付業的安全性和效率，金管局根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（PSSVFO），監管六個指定零售支付系統（RPSs）及15間持牌儲值支付工具（SVFs）。在過去一年，金管局透過協調及促進相關政府部門與獲委任參與計劃的儲值支付工具持牌人之間的對話與合作，協助政府順利推行消費券計劃。\n\n2022年1月，金管局發表了《加密資產及穩定幣討論文件》，闡述其對相關監管方法的看法，並邀請持份者提供意見。在制定適當的監管制度時，將考慮相關因素，包括對該討論文件的意見回饋，以及相關國際組織的建議。\n\n在國際上，金管局是中央銀行界的活躍成員，並在多個區域及國際委員會中擔任領導角色。例如，金管局擔任在東亞及太平洋中央銀行總裁會議（EMEAP）2 下成立的金融市場工作小組（WGFM）主席。此外，金管局亦共同主持巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（巴塞爾委員會）的政策及標準小組、非銀行監察專家小組，以及金融穩定委員會（FSB）的金融創新網絡，並領導一個團隊，研究與金融基準過渡相關的監管議題。\n\n# 2021 年回顧\n\n# 香港：亞洲金融科技樞紐\n\n# 金融科技 2025\n\n金管局於六月公佈了「金融科技2025」策略，以推動香港金融科技的發展。該策略旨在鼓勵金融業界在2025年前全面採用科技，並促進提供公平及高效的金融服務，以惠及香港市民及經濟。該策略的五大重點領域為：\n\n- 所有銀行都擁抱金融科技\n- 為香港未來的央行數位貨幣做好準備\n- 打造下一代數據基礎建設\n- 擴充具備金融科技專長的人才隊伍\n- 透過資金與政策培育生態體系\n\n香港金管局的「金融科技2025」策略，推動了香港金融科技的發展。\n\n# 銀行業中的金融科技採用情況\n\n為支持「金融科技2025」策略中的「所有銀行都投入金融科技」倡議，金管局於2021年6月推出「金融科技應用評估」。該評估旨在協助金管局更深入了解銀行業當前的金融科技發展情況，並確定哪些金融科技領域可能需要金管局的支持。所有在香港有重大業務運作的持牌銀行，均被要求在2021年底前制定一項為期三年的金融科技應用計劃。\n\n在本年度，金管局亦持續推行其為期兩年的計畫，以推動香港銀行採用合規科技，並將科技應用於自身的監管流程，以提升效率和效能。更多詳情請參見銀行體系穩定章節第98頁。\n\n# 批發層面央行數位貨幣\n\n香港金管局與泰國中央銀行於2021年2月擴大了其聯合研究項目的範圍，阿拉伯聯合大公國中央銀行及中國人民銀行數位貨幣研究所亦加入其中。該項目更名為「多邊央行數位貨幣橋（mBridge）」，並獲得國際結算銀行（BIS）香港創新中心的大力支持，旨在進一步探索分布式帳本技術的能力，以促進在多司法管轄區環境下、全天候進行即時跨境外匯交易同步交收（PvP）交易。9月發表了一份聯合報告，公佈了中期研究結果，隨後於11月公佈了潛在應用案例及未來發展藍圖。\n\n# 零售型央行數位貨幣\n\n為確保香港在央行數位貨幣（CBDC）方面的未來準備，金管局展開了一項研究，探討在香港發行零售層面央行數位貨幣（即數位港元）的前景，涵蓋技術及政策考量。金管局與國際結算銀行（BIS）香港創新中心合作，開展了一項名為「Aurum 項目」的研究，以探討發行零售層面央行數位貨幣的技術層面。此外，還成立了一個內部跨部門工作小組，以研究相關的技術、政策及法律問題。十月份，金管局發布了一份技術白皮書，題為《數位港元：技術視角》，旨在探討發行及分發零售層面央行數位貨幣的潛在技術設計方案，並徵求意見。\n\n此外，金管局支持中國人民銀行數碼貨幣研究所進行技術試點測試，以電子人民幣進行跨境支付。這將有助於促進大灣區內的互聯互通，並透過提升跨境支付的效率及用戶體驗，為香港及內地旅客帶來更大便利。\n\n# 商業數據通\n\n7 月，金管局舉辦了一場虛擬研討會，鼓勵銀行及儲值支付工具營運商加入「商業數據通」（CDI），這是一個旨在提升銀行體系金融中介效率的新世代金融數據基建。為進一步促進其發展及應用，金管局在研討會上宣布成立「商業數據通創新樞紐」。為便利中小企融資，金管局完成了兩階段的概念驗證研究，以檢視「商業數據通」在技術上的可行性。在研究期間，參與銀行運用另類數據以促進信貸評估及貸款承保，合共批出超過 550 宗中小企貸款，總金額逾 9 億港元。基於這些令人鼓舞的結果，金管局宣布於 11 月試行推出「商業數據通」。\n\n中小企業主讚揚商業數據通簡化了貸款申請流程。\n\n# 人才培育\n\n為擴大金融科技人才庫，金管局繼續與策略夥伴3合作，推行「金融科技人才培育計劃2.0」，以培養處於不同職業生涯階段的年輕人才。2021年，超過180名學生從該計劃中受益。此外，金管局於9月試行「金融科技先鋒聯網」計劃，為金融科技專業的碩士生提供參與真實金融科技項目的機會。為建立策略夥伴關係及促進金融科技人才發展等領域的合作，金管局於10月與四所本地大學簽訂了諒解備忘錄（MoUs）。\n\n金管局金融基建助理總裁高林·鮑先生（中）與四所本地大學簽署諒解備忘錄時合影。\n\n# 金融科技監管沙盒\n\n金融科技監管沙盒（FSS）的使用量在當年持續上升。自 2016 年推出以來，截至 2021 年 12 月底，FSS 共批准了 234 項金融科技計畫的試點試驗，而 2020 年底的數字則為 193 項。自 2017 年推出 FSS 聊天室以來，截至 2021 年 12 月底，金管局共收到 666 宗申請，要求在金融科技項目的早期階段使用 FSS

Although the global economy continued to be affected by the evolving COVID-19 pandemic situation, a number of factors, including an increasing vaccination rate as well as accommodative monetary policies and fiscal measures around the world, have contributed to notable recovery in the global economy and financial markets.  Against this background, a number of overseas equity markets achieved record highs during the year, and the Exchange Fund’s overall equity holdings were able to achieve a decent return despite the sluggish performance in Hong Kong equities. During 2021, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$191.9 billion, representing an investment return of 4.1%.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong.  The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre.  The HKMA, under the delegated authority of the Financial Secretary and within the terms of the delegation, is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(i) to preserve capital;\n(ii) to ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(iii) to ensure that sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(iv) subject to (i)–(iii), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Exchange Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 Portfolio Segregation of the Exchange Fund\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP).  The BP holds highly liquid US dollardenominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The IP invests primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member economies of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of its assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA diversifies part of the Exchange Fund’s investments in a prudent and incremental manner into a wider variety of asset classes.  This includes emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate.  Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP).  The HKMA has put in place a cap1 to guide the pace of diversification into the LTGP since its inception.  As the LTGP has become increasingly mature in investment scale and asset diversity, the EFAC decided in January 2022 to replace the cap by a target asset allocation that is determined concurrently with that of other asset classes, subject to prudent risk management principles.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007, holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that have been acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes.  The Strategic Portfolio is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of its unique nature.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by Fiscal Reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP2, with the major exception of the Future Fund3, which links its interest rate to the return of both the IP and the LTGP in accordance with the portfolio mix.  The portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 40:60 in 2021.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation.  The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents long-term asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund.  Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark.  This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark (or strategic) allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”.  While the benchmark and tracking error4 limit are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with the EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority.  Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may assume positions to take advantage of short-term market movements (Figure 2).\n\nFigure 2 Asset allocation of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nThe HKMA’s Exchange Fund Investment Office houses its investment and related risk management functions. Exchange Fund Investment Office staff members directly manage about 71% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, comprising the entire BP and part of the IP.  This part of the IP includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 29% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes.  The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to realise sustainable returns, draw on diverse and complementary investment styles, and gain market insights and technical expertise in investment.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes.  The expenditure is determined primarily by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe growing complexity of the investment environment underlines the importance of risk management.  The HKMA sets stringent controls and investment guidelines for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and ensures a proper risk monitoring and compliance system is in place. Three lines of defence are in place to implement effective risk management and governance of investment-related activities.  Key risk categories (including credit, market, liquidity and operational risks) are regularly monitored, and the risk management process provides a robust framework to support strategic planning and investment diversification.\n\n# RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT\n\nThe HKMA believes that, by putting an appropriate emphasis on responsible investment and sustainable long-term economic performance, it can better achieve the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund and reduce risks associated with environmental, social and governance (ESG)- related matters of its underlying investments.  The HKMA supports responsible investment by integrating ESG factors into the investment processes for both public and private market investments of the Exchange Fund, underpinned by the guiding principle that priority will generally be given to ESG investments if the long-term risk-adjusted return is comparable with other investments.  For more details about the HKMA’s responsible investment framework and implementation, see the Sustainability chapter on pages 184 to 191.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2021\n\nGlobal equity markets rose sharply and hit new record highs on the back of ultra-loose monetary policies and fiscal measures, driving an accelerated recovery of the global economy and financial markets.  However, Hong Kong and Mainland equity markets underperformed amid market reforms.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index in the US rose by 27%, while the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong dropped by 14%.\n\nFor the bond markets, rising inflation expectations and tapering of asset purchases by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) led to a rise in US Treasury yields and falling bond prices during 2021.  Ten-year US Treasury yields increased by about 60 basis points from 0.9% at the beginning of the year to 1.5% at the end of the year.\n\nIn the currency markets, the US dollar strengthened against other major currencies, particularly towards the end of 2021, on the back of expectations about the Fed’s tapering pace. In particular, the euro and the yen depreciated by 7.1% and 10.3% against the US dollar respectively.\n\nThe performance of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2021 is shown in Table 1.\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$191.9 billion in 2021.  This comprised gains on bonds of HK$12.6 billion, net gains on equities of HK$47.8 billion (with gains of HK$68.8 billion from foreign equities, and losses of HK$21.0 billion from Hong Kong equities), a positive currency translation effect of HK$16.8 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets and gains of HK$114.7 billion on other investments held by the investment-holding subsidiaries of the Fund. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$3.1 billion.\n\nTotal assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,570.2 billion at the end of the year.  The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$515.3 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$392.5 billion and real estate HK$122.8 billion.  Outstanding investment commitments of the LTGP amounted to HK$225.7 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund in 2021, excluding the Strategic Portfolio, was 4.1%.  Specifically, the IP achieved a rate of return of 3.7%, while the BP gained 0.4%.  The LTGP has recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 15.4% since its inception in 2009.\n\nThe annual returns of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2021 are set out in Chart 1.  Table 2 shows the 2021 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over several different time horizons.  The average return was 5.3% during 2019–2021, 4.7% during 2017–2021, 3.3% during 2012–2021 and 4.8% since 1994.  Table 3 shows the currency mix of the Fund’s assets on 31 December 2021.\n\nSee pages 211 to 319 for the audited 2021 financial statements of the Exchange Fund.\n","terms":{"12-month expected credit

年，全球金融市場開始復甦。儘管全球經濟持續受到新冠疫情演變的影響，但包括疫苗接種率上升，以及全球各地寬鬆的貨幣政策和財政措施等多項因素，促使全球經濟和金融市場顯著復甦。在這種背景下，多個海外股市在年內創下歷史新高，而外匯基金的整體股票持有量亦錄得不俗回報，儘管港股表現疲弱。2021 年，外匯基金錄得投資收入 1,919 億港元，投資回報率為 4.1%。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n《外匯基金條例》訂明，外匯基金的主要目標是直接或間接影響港元匯率。基金亦可用以維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定和完整，以協助維持香港作為國際金融中心。金管局在財政司司長授權下，根據授權的條款，就外匯基金的運用和投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標及組合架構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）為外匯基金訂立了以下投資目標：\n\n（一）保存資本；\n（二）確保貨幣基礎在任何時候均獲足額的高度流動美元資產支持；\n（三）確保有足夠的流動資金以維持貨幣及金融穩定；及\n（四）在符合（一）至（三）項的前提下，達致有助保存外匯基金長期購買力的投資回報。\n\n這些目標充分考慮了外匯基金的法定目的，並已納入基金的組合架構及目標資產配置（圖 1）。\n\n圖 1 外匯基金的投資組合類別\n\n概括而言，外匯基金有兩個主要組合：支持組合（BP）及投資組合（IP）。BP 持有高度流動的美元資產，以根據貨幣發行局制度的要求，為貨幣基礎提供足額支持。IP 主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債券及股票市場，以保存其資產的價值及長期購買力。\n\n為更好地管理風險及提升中長期回報，金管局以審慎及循序漸進的方式，將外匯基金部分投資分散至更多元化的資產類別。這包括新興市場及內地債券與股票、私募股權（包括基建）及房地產。新興市場及內地債券與股票歸入 IP 持有，而私募股權及房地產投資則歸入長期增長組合（LTGP）。自 LTGP 開展投資以來，金管局已訂立市值上限，以引導其分散投資的步伐。隨著 LTGP 的投資規模及資產多元性日趨成熟，EFAC 於 2022 年 1 月決定以目標資產配置取代市值上限，該目標資產配置與其它資產類別的目標資產配置同步制定，並須符合審慎的風險管理原則。\n\n2007 年成立的策略性資產組合持有香港交易及結算所有限公司的股份，該等股份由政府為外匯基金的賬戶購入，以作策略用途。由於策略性資產組合的性質獨特，故不包括在基金的投資表現評估之內。\n\n# 於外匯基金的存款\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定機構的存款。利率一般與 IP 的表現掛鉤，但未來基金則屬主要例外，其利率按組合比重與 IP 及 LTGP 的回報掛鉤。2021 年，未來基金在 IP 及 LTGP 之間的組合比重約為 40:60。\n\n# 投資流程\n\n外匯基金的投資流程以兩種資產配置的決定為基礎：策略性資產配置及戰術性資產配置。策略性資產配置反映在投資基準中，代表了根據外匯基金的投資目標而作出的長期資產配置。在策略性配置的指引下，資產會以戰術性方式配置，以圖取得超越基準的回報。這意味著實際配置往往與基準（或策略性）配置有所不同。實際配置與基準配置之間的差異稱為「戰術性偏離」。基準及循跡誤差限額由財政司司長與 EFAC 磋商後釐定，而戰術性決定及戰術性偏離的容許範圍則由金管局在授權下制定及設定。在戰術性偏離的容許範圍內，投資組合經理可採取倉位以把握短期市場走勢（圖 2）。\n\n圖 2 外匯基金的資產配置\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局外匯基金投資辦公室負責投資及相關的風險管理工作。外匯基金投資辦公室的工作人員直接管理約 71% 的外匯基金投資，包括整個 BP 及部分 IP。這部分 IP 包括一系列投資於全球固定收益市場的投資組合，以及多個衍生工具組合，以實施基金的宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 使用外部經理\n\n除了內部管理資產外，金管局亦聘用外部投資經理管理約 29% 的外匯基金資產，包括所有上市股票組合及其他專業資產類別。聘用外部經理的目的是運用市場上最佳的投資專才以實現可持續回報，借鑑多元及互補的投資風格，並獲取市場洞見及投資方面的技術專長。\n\n與使用外部經理有關的開支包括基金管理費、託管費、交易費，以及預扣稅款及其他稅項。該開支主要由市場因素決定，並可能每年有所波動。\n\n# 風險管理及監察\n\n投資環境日益複雜，突顯了風險管理的重要性。金管局為內部及外部管理的投資組合制定嚴格的監控措施及投資指引，並確保設有適切的風險監察及合規制度。已設立三道防線，以落實有效的風險管理及管治投資相關活動。主要風險類別（包括信貸、市場、流動資金及業務操作風險）受到定期監察，而風險管理流程則為策略規劃及投資多元化提供穩健的框架支持。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n金管局相信，適當地重視負責任投資及可持續的長期經濟表現，有助更好地實現外匯基金的投資目標，並減低與環境、社會及管治（ESG）相關的基礎投資事項所帶來的風險。金管局支持負責任投資，將 ESG 因素納入外匯基金的公共和私人市場投資流程，其指導原則是，若 ESG 投資的經風險調整長期收益與其它投資相若，一般會優先考慮 ESG 投資。有關金管局負責任投資框架及實施情況的更多詳情，請參閱第 184 至 191 頁的可持續發展章節。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2021 年的金融市場\n\n在全球超寬鬆的貨幣政策及財政措施支持下，環球股市急升並創下新高，推動全球經濟及金融市場加速復甦。然而，香港及內地股市在市場改革下表現落後。美國標準普爾 500 指數上升 27%，而香港恒生指數則下跌 14%。\n\n在債券市場方面，通脹預期上升，加上美國聯邦儲備局縮減資產購買規模，導致 2021 年美國國債收益率上升，債券價格下跌。十年期美國國債收益率由年初的 0.9% 上升至年底的 1.5%，升幅約為 60 基點。\n\n在貨幣市場方面，受市場對美聯儲縮減購債步伐的預期所帶動，美元於 2021 年年底尤其顯著地對其他主要貨幣升值。其中，歐元及日圓分別對美元貶值 7.1% 及 10.3%。\n\n2021 年主要貨幣、債券及股票市場的表現載於表 1。\n\n#

{"en":"# Corporate Functions\n\nCorporate functions support the operation of the HKMA with a high level of transparency, accountability, efficiency and professionalism.  To facilitate public understanding about its policies and operations, the HKMA maintains effective communication with the community and the market through traditional and social media, its website, the Information Centre and other channels. Within the institution, the HKMA conscientiously builds an agile and sustainable workforce, institutes rigorous financial discipline and upgrades information technology capabilities to adapt to changes and ensure effective implementation of its policies and initiatives.\n\n# TRANSPARENCY\n\n# Media relations and social media\n\nThe HKMA works closely with the media to enhance transparency and promote public understanding of its policies and operations.  In 2021, the HKMA held or participated in 169 physical and virtual events, comprising eight press conferences, eight stand-up interviews and 153 other public functions. A further 27 media interviews were arranged.  A total of 632 bilingual press releases were issued over the course of the year and a large number of media enquiries were handled on a daily basis.\n\nTo raise awareness of the HKMA’s key functions, press conferences and media briefings were organised for local, Mainland and foreign media.  Topics included the Connect schemes, financial technology (fintech) and the reform of interest rate benchmarks.\n\nTo engage and interact with the public in a timely manner, the HKMA maintains five social media channels (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter and YouTube) with over 80,000 followers.  The HKMA utilises its social media channels to raise public awareness on a wide range of topics notably phishing scams, which increased significantly during the pandemic.  In addition, extensive promotion campaigns on green finance, fintech and the Connect schemes were conducted via social media to keep the public abreast of the latest development trends.\n\nMr Eddie Yue, Chief Executive of HKMA, moderates a virtual panel discussion at the Hong Kong FinTech Week 2021\n\nMr Howard Lee, Deputy Chief Executive of HKMA, hosts a media briefing on the HKMA’s “Fintech 2025” strategy\n\nMr Arthur Yuen, Deputy Chief Executive of HKMA, hosts a media briefing on the Hong Kong banking sector’s preparation for London Interbank Offered Rate transition\n\nMr Edmond Lau, Deputy Chief Executive of HKMA, conducts an interview with an international news channel\n\n# Public enquiries\n\nThe Public Enquiry Service provides an effective means for the public to better understand key HKMA functions and operations.  During 2021, it handled 9,781 enquiries. About half of them were related to banking policies and regulations, consumer banking issues, notes and coins, as well as financial infrastructure and debt market development. Some of the notable enquiries were about the Coin Collection Programme, banking products and services, banking-related guidelines and circulars and the Retail Bond Issuance Programme.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received since 2018 and Chart 2 provides a breakdown by enquiry nature in 2021.\n\nChart 1 Total number of public enquiries\n\nChart 2 Nature of enquiries received in 2021\n\n# Publications\n\nApart from the HKMA Annual Report, the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report, and four issues of the Quarterly Bulletin, and it regularly updated the Monthly Statistical Bulletin to provide up-to-date and thematic information and analyses on monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. The HKMA also published 11 inSight1 articles to introduce its major new initiatives and policies and discuss topical issues of interest.\n\nThe HKMA Annual Report 2020 received a Silver Award in the “Non-profit Making and Charitable Organisations” category, and an Excellence Award in Environmental, Social and Governance Reporting at the Hong Kong Management Association’s 2021 Best Annual Reports Awards.\n\n# Corporate website\n\nThe corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk) presents more than 44,000 pages of content in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, and is the public gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It contains the register of authorized institutions (AIs) and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the register of stored value facility licensees under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance.\n\nThe HKMA has been releasing financial data and important information on its website via Open Application Programming Interface (API) in phases since 2018. By end-2021, the HKMA had opened up 148 sets of Open APIs on its website, in line with the targeted schedule.\n\n# Information Centre\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre, located on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre, is an important facility introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters.  It consists of an exhibition area and a library. The exhibition area presents an overview of the HKMA’s work and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong in an interactive manner.  It also contains information and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.  The library, situated next to the exhibition area, houses more than 26,000 books, journals and other publications on Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs as well as central banking topics.  It also maintains the register of AIs and local representative offices, as well as the register of securities staff of AIs, for public access as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nTo safeguard public health and safety during the COVID-19 pandemic, special operational arrangements were put in place at the Information Centre.  Cleansing and disinfection were stepped up, and facilities and exhibits were sanitised regularly with anti-microbial coating.\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre’s exhibition area comprises the Policy Section, the Currency Section and the Historical Timeline\n\n# Community engagement and public education\n\nTo reach out to the community and raise public awareness of the HKMA’s work, a public education programme has been running since 1998.  In 2021, a webinar was organised for over 2,300 students and teachers from 84 secondary schools.  The webinar covered an overview of the HKMA’s work, the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, protection of personal digital keys, the Deposit Protection Scheme and career opportunities in the banking industry.  To date, more than 63,000 people have participated in the public education programme.\n\nThe HKMA educates and engages the public on how to be smart and responsible financial consumers.  In view of the increase in phishing scams, the HKMA conducted a public awareness campaign themed “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!” with cross-media promotion to urge the public to stay vigilant against fraudulent hyperlinks embedded in SMS messages and emails purportedly from banks.\n\nCross-media promotion reminding the public to beware of fraudulent hyperlinks\n\nThe HKMA also seeks to enhance the public’s understanding of the financial industry and raise the young generation’s interest in pursuing a career in the industry.  Following positive feedback to the online drama series “STEPS” in 2020, the HKMA launched a new series titled “Four Faces of Talents in Central” featuring four growing areas of the financial industry: data science, fintech, green and sustainable finance, and wealth management.  In the video series, the characters of the market practitioners were portrayed in a humorous manner, and seasoned industry players and young talents shared first-hand information on the nature and requirements of jobs, career opportunities and prospects across the above four growing areas.\n\n“Four Faces of Talents in Central” series keeps the young generation abreast of career opportunities in the financial market\n\nThe “Online Parenting and Educational Campaign” launched in 2020 was recognised with a Silver Award in the “Best Event — Corporate Social Responsibility” category of the MarketingInteractive’s Marketing Events Awards 2021.  Building on the campaign’s success and to sustain momentum, the HKMA rolled out additional initiatives, including a parenting financial education workshop where child education experts shared tips on how to teach kids good money sense and demonstrated a DIY (do-it-yourself) financial educational toy, as well as an animated virtual tour of the HKMA Information Centre.\n\nThe “Online Parenting and Educational Campaign” wins an award at the Marketing Events Awards 2021.  The campaign promotes money management concept and skills to let parents and kids learn in an amusing and entertaining way.\n\nTo enhance financial literacy among secondary school students, the HKMA and various stakeholders co-organised the “Hong Kong Financial Literacy Championship”, which featured a fintech theme.  Apart from an online quiz, a new financial design thinking workshop on personal financial management was added to train the participating students to develop innovative proposals on money management tools.  This initiative won the “Highest Student Participation Award” offered by the Business-School Partnership Programme under the Education Bureau, and the “Investor and Financial Education Award (Corporate) — Gold Award” offered by the Investor and Financial Education Council2 (IFEC).\n\nThe “Hong Kong Financial Literacy Championship” educates students on fintech and design thinking concepts and achieves record-high participation\n\nOther community engagement initiatives included talks or webinars for students and retirees.  The HKMA also participated in a teacher training webinar on economic security organised by the Education Bureau.  Online educational materials offering smart tips on using automated teller machines (ATMs) are available in eight languages3 to cater for people of different backgrounds living in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA supports the IFEC in promoting financial literacy and capacity in Hong Kong, and will explore further collaboration with stakeholders to maximise the impact of community engagement.\n\n# Financial disclosure\n\nTo maintain a high level of transparency, the HKMA adopts international standards in financial disclosure insofar as these are applicable to central banking operations.  These include the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and other applicable reporting requirements, for example, the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard.  The Finance Division works with external auditors and other accounting professionals to prepare and present the Exchange Fund’s financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards.  The HKMA also provides detailed disclosures and thorough analyses of a wide range of expense items and budgetary information in its Annual Report.\n\n# ACCOUNTABILITY AND CONTROLS\n\n# Risk management\n\nOne of the HKMA’s most important tasks is to manage risks to the monetary and banking systems.  Risk management is undertaken both at a working level in the day-to-day operations and at a higher level through strategic planning. Under the HKMA’s risk management framework, there are two high-level committees — the Macro Surveillance Committee and the Risk Committee — both of which are chaired by the Chief Executive of the HKMA.\n\nThe terms of reference of the Macro Surveillance Committee are:\n\n- to identify potential risks and threats to the monetary and financial system in Hong Kong and discuss possible measures to address such risks;\n- to review existing measures for managing risks in the monetary and financial system to identify possible gaps and ensure the adequacy of these measures; and\n- to encourage cross-departmental sharing of relevant information on macro surveillance with a view to enhancing the macro surveillance capability of the HKMA.\n\nThe terms of reference of the Risk Committee are:\n\n- to identify potential risks and threats to the organisation and devise strategies to reduce the impact of such events;\n- to review the existing system for managing risks across different departments to identify possible gaps and significant risks and ensure the adequacy of measures to address them;\n- to harmonise the criteria and methods of risk measurement and prioritise the resources management of risks identified; and\n- to encourage a stronger risk management culture institutionally which promotes the proper levels of authorisation and controls.\n\nA robust operational risk management framework is in place covering organisational risks at two levels: the entity level and the department level.  Entity-level risks refer mainly to those which concern the entire organisation in the medium term, or which might call for a cross-departmental response. Potential and emerging risks identified by business units, and the adequacy of the control measures and mitigating strategies they devise, are reviewed and reported every quarter.  This is supplemented by a top-down approach to manage entity-level risks, in which senior colleagues heading different business units actively identify risks of wider impact and propose mitigating measures.  The Risk Committee discusses these assessments and decides on appropriate follow-up actions.\n","terms":{"12-month expected credit losses":["12個月預期信用虧損"],"2022–23 Budget":["2022至23年度財政預算案"],"24\/7

媒體關係及社交媒體\n\n金管局與媒體緊密合作，以提升透明度並促進大眾對其政策及運作的了解。2021年，金管局舉辦或參與了169場實體及虛擬活動，包括八場記者會、八場站立式訪問及153場其他公開活動，另安排了27場媒體訪問。全年共發出632份雙語新聞稿，並每日處理大量媒體查詢。\n\n為提升大眾對金管局主要職能的認識，金管局為本地、內地及海外媒體舉辦了記者會及簡報會。議題包括「互聯互通」計畫、金融科技及利率基準改革。\n\n為及時與大眾溝通及互動，金管局設有五個社交媒體頻道（Facebook、Instagram、LinkedIn、Twitter及YouTube），擁有超過80,000名追蹤者。金管局利用社交媒體頻道提升大眾對多項議題的認識，尤其是網路釣魚詐騙，此類詐騙在疫情期間大幅增加。此外，金管局透過社交媒體進行多項推廣活動，涵蓋綠色金融、金融科技及「互聯互通」計畫等，讓大眾掌握最新發展趨勢。\n\n金管局總裁余偉文先生於2021年香港金融科技周主持了一場虛擬小組討論會。\n\n金管局副總裁李達志先生就金管局的「金融科技2025」策略主持了一場媒體簡報會。\n\n金管局副總裁阮國恒先生就香港銀行業為過渡至倫敦銀行同業拆息作出的準備工作主持了一場媒體簡報會。\n\n金管局副總裁劉應彬先生接受了一家國際新聞頻道的訪問。\n\n# 公眾查詢\n\n公眾查詢服務為大眾提供有效途徑，以更深入了解金管局的主要職能及運作。2021年，該服務共處理了9,781宗查詢。當中約一半查詢與銀行業政策及規例、銀行消費者事宜、紙幣及硬幣，以及金融基礎建設及債券市場發展有關。部分較突出的查詢涉及硬幣收集計畫、銀行產品及服務、與銀行業相關的指引及通告，以及零售債券發行計畫。\n\n圖表1顯示自2018年以來收到的公眾查詢宗數，而圖表2則按2021年查詢性質作分類。\n\n圖表1 公眾查詢總宗數\n\n圖表2 2021年收到的查詢性質\n\n#

機構網站\n\n機構網站（www.hkma.gov.hk）提供超過44,000頁的內容，涵蓋英文、繁體中文及簡體中文，是大眾獲取金管局最新資訊的門戶。網站載有根據《銀行業條例》第20條存置的認可機構（AIs）及本地代表辦事處名冊，以及認可機構證券業務從業員名冊，並載有根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》存置的儲值支付工具持牌人名冊。\n\n自2018年起，金管局分階段透過開放應用程式介面（Open

{"en":"# Sustainability\n\nThe HKMA is publishing its first sustainability report, as an integral part of its Annual Report 2021, to set out its strategy on sustainability and document its own efforts, as well as its joint efforts with the financial industry, to support the Government’s climate strategies and contribute to a more climate resilient and sustainable world.\n\nThe HKMA embeds sustainability considerations across its main roles and functions, whether as a banking supervisor, a market facilitator, a responsible investor, or in maintaining financial and monetary stability.  Moreover, the HKMA collaborates with local and overseas counterparts in strengthening the management and disclosures of climate risks, as well as the development of the green and sustainable finance market.\n\nIn addition, the HKMA is committed to fulfilling its corporate social responsibility, and aims to be a responsible and sustainable organisation. This commitment is manifested in various areas, including promoting a sustainable, financially inclusive and environmentally friendly marketplace, supporting the wider community, protecting the environment and nurturing a caring workplace.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nClimate change is one of the most pressing challenges facing the world today.  To combat climate change, countries agreed, under the Paris Agreement1, to take actions to cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and eventually achieve carbon neutrality within this century.  Meeting the Paris Agreement climate change target will require investments of an estimated US$1–2 trillion a year globally2, making sustainability one of the biggest drivers of capital flows in the decades ahead.\n\nHong Kong is determined to be at the forefront of this transition.  The Government announced that it will strive to achieve carbon neutrality before 2050, in line with developed economies globally.  Hong Kong is also the first Asian jurisdiction that has committed to specifically aligning disclosure requirements with recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) by 2025 across relevant sectors.\n\nTo the financial sector, climate change is both a source of risk and opportunity.  While the financial sector cannot be spared from the threats posed by climate change, it has a key role to play in the transition by channelling more financing to activities that are consistent with a pathway towards lower GHG emissions and climate-resilient developments.\n\nThe HKMA is committed to strengthening Hong Kong’s financial system to support a greener and more sustainable future, driving actions to support the Government’s climate goal and contributing to the global agenda.  In doing so, the HKMA incorporates sustainability considerations in carrying out its main functions and in running its operations.\n\nFirst, as a banking supervisor, the HKMA aims to strengthen resilience of the banking system against climate risks and to accelerate banks’ efforts in supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy.  To accomplish this, the HKMA has formulated a regulatory framework setting out supervisory requirements for banks to manage and disclose climate risks.  A pilot exercise on climate risk stress test to assess the resilience of the banking sector was also concluded successfully in 2021.  Meanwhile, on an ongoing basis, the HKMA takes into account climate change in monitoring financial stability risks.\n\nSecondly, in its market development role, the HKMA is focusing its efforts in enhancing Hong Kong’s role as a green and sustainable finance hub in the region, including the Greater Bay Area (GBA).  Hong Kong, being Mainland’s offshore financial centre, is well-positioned to channel global investments into Mainland’s plans to achieve peak carbon emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060.  The HKMA is also working through the Green and Sustainable Finance Cross-Agency Steering Group (CASG)3, which the HKMA co-chairs, to build industry capacity, address data gaps and explore the development of a local green classification framework.\n\nIn fact, Hong Kong is a leader in green finance solutions, having established the world’s first government Global Medium Term Note Programme dedicated to green bond issuances under the Government Green Bond Programme, and increased gradually the diversity of its issuances since 2019, both in terms of currencies and tenors.  To support the issuance of green and sustainable bonds and loans in the private sector, the Government set up the Green and Sustainable Finance Grant Scheme in May 2021. Administered by the HKMA, this scheme has incentivised more corporates to seek green and sustainable financing in Hong Kong, and encouraged more green advisers and external reviewers to establish or expand their presence here.\n\nThirdly, as the manager of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA has ensured that environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations are an integral part of its investment process and asset allocation decisions.  In the latter part of this report, the HKMA makes its inaugural disclosures on its climate scenario analysis and carbon footprint metrics of the Exchange Fund’s portfolios.\n\nFourthly, the HKMA is stepping up its own green office initiatives to ensure its own operations conform to best practices in the management and mitigation of climate risks.  As a start, the HKMA has established its carbon profile across Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions4, and made corresponding disclosures.  At the same time, the HKMA has implemented measures to enhance industry-wide operational efficiency and minimise resource consumption.  In addition, the HKMA holds itself to high standards of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and works with its stakeholders to promote financial inclusion and financial literacy.\n\nGreening the financial system requires close collaboration amongst central banks and supervisors.  The HKMA is an active member of the international community in global policymaking and alignment of sustainability standards. The HKMA has also issued a statement to support the Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) Glasgow Declaration5, reaffirming its commitment to delivering on the NGFS recommendations in taking the necessary measures to foster a greener financial system.\n\nIn driving these sustainability initiatives and assessing climaterelated opportunities and risks, sustainability and green considerations are embedded in the HKMA’s governance and risk management frameworks, in which the leadership is actively involved in setting the overarching objectives and guiding principles, in consultation with the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) and its sub-committees. The HKMA’s CSR and Sustainability Committee (CSC) also assesses the potential impacts of sustainability and climate-related issues on the organisation, and devises strategies to reduce the impacts.  Execution of the relevant strategies and initiatives is closely monitored and reported to the top management regularly.  In addition, external consultants have been engaged to advise the HKMA in selected areas of work.\n\nThe subsequent sections of this chapter will delve into the HKMA’s governance, strategies and risk management measures in undertaking green finance and sustainability work in each of its roles.\n\nThis report is prepared with reference to the disclosure elements recommended in the NGFS’s Guide on Climaterelated Disclosure for Central Banks, published in December 2021.  In addition, information in relation to the HKMA’s office operations makes broad reference to the reporting principles under the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards6 and the ESG Reporting Guide promulgated by the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited.\n\n# Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System\n\nThe NGFS provides a platform for central banks and prudential supervisory authorities to exchange experiences, share best practices, contribute to the development of environmental and climate risk management in the financial sector, and mobilise mainstream finance to support the transition towards a sustainable economy.  Its purpose is to define and promote best practices to be implemented within and outside of the membership of the NGFS, and to conduct or commission analytical work on green finance.\n\n# Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures\n\nIn December 2015, the Financial Stability Board created the TCFD to develop recommendations for more effective climate-related disclosures by companies to investors, lenders and insurance underwriters that could promote more informed decisions.  The TCFD’s recommendations are structured around four thematic areas that represent the core elements of how organisations operate: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets.\n\n# BANKING SUPERVISOR\n\nAs the core part of the financial system, banks should be proactive in managing climate risks, and support channelling more capital to green and sustainable activities.  As a banking supervisor, the HKMA focuses on building banks’ resilience against climate risks and accelerating banks’ efforts in supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\n# Overview of the HKMA’s three-phased approach\n\nSince May 2019, the HKMA has been promoting green and sustainable banking in three phases:\n\n# Phase I\n\nDeveloping a common framework to assess the “greenness baseline” of individual banks, and collaborating with international bodies to provide technical support to banks in Hong Kong.\n\n# Phase II\n\nConsulting the industry and other stakeholders on the supervisory expectations and requirements of green and sustainable banking.\n\n# Phase III\n\nFocusing on the implementation of supervisory requirements, monitoring and evaluation of banks’ progress in green and sustainable banking.\n\n# Guidance\n\n# Supervisory requirements on climate risk management\n\nIn 2020, the HKMA developed a common framework for assessing the “greenness baseline” of individual banks in collaboration with the industry.  The HKMA also conducted the first greenness assessment of banks, which marked the completion of Phase I.  To help banks prepare for the new supervisory requirements, a white paper was published in June 2020, which outlined the HKMA’s initial thinking on supervisory expectations for climate risk management.\n\nIn December 2021, following an industry consultation, the HKMA issued the supervisory requirements for banks to incorporate climate considerations into governance, strategy, risk management and disclosure.  In particular, specific requirements and concrete timeline were set out in mandating climate-related disclosures based on the recommendations of the TCFD before 2025. The requirements will set a benchmark to help banks upgrade their risk management capability.\n\nThe next step is for the HKMA to monitor banks’ implementation of the relevant requirements.  In this regard, the HKMA has stepped up its supervisory capacity by setting up a new dedicated team within its Banking Supervision Department to carry out climate risk supervision.\n\nThis three-phased approach is an iterative and evolving process.  Further to the first round of greenness assessment conducted in 2020, the HKMA is reviewing the framework to encompass the new supervisory requirements on climate risk management and potentially cover a wider scope, such as other environmental risks and measures for supporting the net zero transition.   The HKMA intends to launch an updated framework in the second half of 2022.\n\n# Sound practices supporting the transition to carbon neutrality\n\nApart from incorporating climate risk considerations into the risk management framework, some banks have devoted resources and taken measures to support the goals of the Paris Agreement and contribute to achieving global net zero emissions.  The HKMA issued a circular in December 2021 to share with the industry the sound practices of these banks which would be of reference value to other banks in the industry in formulating their climate strategies.  These sound practices are grouped into four areas: reducing GHG emissions of the banks’ own operations, reducing financed emissions through portfolio alignment, assisting clients to transition, and promoting collective efforts to assist the economy to achieve a net-zero transition.\n\n# Green classification framework to facilitate green finance flows\n\nTo increase transparency across the financial markets and enable consistent policy making on green finance, the HKMA has been working with other financial regulators to explore a local green classification framework, which will facilitate navigation among the Common Ground Taxonomy (CGT) developed by the International Platform on Sustainable Finance (IPSF)8 and the green definitions adopted by China and European Union, for adoption across different financial sectors.  The work will be guided by the principles of interoperability, comparability and inclusiveness, taking into account other definitions of green, transitional activities and local considerations.  This initiative will reduce the risk of green washing, improve product comparability and ultimately enhance investor protection.\n\n# Assessment: climate risk stress test\n\nTo assess the banking sector’s ability to cope with potential shocks brought about by climate change, the HKMA undertook a pilot exercise on climate risk stress test (CRST), which included the participation of 20 major retail banks and seven branches of international banking groups.  A report summarising the results of the pilot CRST exercise was published in December 2021.  The results showed that the banking sector remained resilient even in the face of extreme climate-related shocks, although these shocks could potentially give rise to significant adverse impacts on banks’ financials.  The CRST exercise helped to enhance banks’ capabilities for measuring and assessing climate risks. In light of the CRST results, the participating banks have devised plans to strengthen their climate strategies and risk governance frameworks.  The HKMA will continue to engage the industry to strengthen banks’ capability and enhance the CRST framework, taking into account the lessons learnt from the pilot exercise.\n","terms":{"12-month

可持續發展\n\n金管局正發表其首份可持續發展報告，作為《2021年年報》的一部分，以闡述其可持續發展策略，並記錄其自身努力，以及與金融業界共同努力，支持政府的氣候策略，並為建立一個更具氣候韌性及可持續的世界作出貢獻。\n\n金管局將可持續發展因素融入其主要職責和功能之中，無論是作為銀行業監管機構、市場促進者、負責任的投資者，或在維持金融及貨幣穩定方面，均是如此。此外，金管局與本地及海外監管機構合作，以強化氣候風險的管理及披露，以及發展綠色和可持續金融市場。\n\n此外，金管局致力履行企業社會責任，並致力成為一個負責任及可持續發展的機構。這項承諾體現在多個層面，包括促進可持續、金融普惠及環境友善的市場、支持更廣泛的社區、保護環境及建立關懷的工作環境。\n\n# 概述\n\n氣候變化是當今世界面臨的最緊迫挑戰之一。為應對氣候變化，各國在《巴黎協定》1下同意採取行動，削減溫室氣體排放，並最終在本世紀內實現碳中和。要實現《巴黎協定》的氣候變化目標，全球每年估計需要投資1至2兆美元2，因此可持續發展將成為未來數十年資本流動的最大驅動因素之一。\n\n香港決心在這一轉型中領先一步。政府宣布，將與全球發達經濟體一樣，致力在2050年前實現碳中和。香港亦成為首個亞洲司法管轄區，承諾在2025年前於相關行業中，將披露要求與氣候相關財務披露工作小組（TCFD）的建議明確對齊。\n\n對於金融業而言，氣候變化既是風險的來源，也是機遇。雖然金融業無法避免氣候變化帶來的威脅，但在轉型過程中，它可以發揮關鍵作用，將更多資金引導至與降低溫室氣體排放和具氣候韌性發展的路徑一致的活動。\n\n金管局致力強化香港金融體系，以支持更綠色及可持續的未來，推動行動以支持政府的氣候目標，並為全球議程作出貢獻。在這樣做的時候，金管局在履行其主要職能及運作時，均會考慮可持續發展因素。\n\n首先，作為銀行業監管機構，金管局的目標是強化銀行體系抵禦氣候風險的能力，並加快銀行支持轉型至低碳經濟的努力。為達致此目標，金管局已制定監管框架，訂明銀行管理及披露氣候風險的監管要求。此外，於2021年成功完成了一項氣候風險壓力測試試點計劃，以評估銀行業的韌性。同時，金管局在持續監察金融穩定風險時，亦會考慮氣候變化因素。\n\n其次，在市場發展方面，金管局集中努力強化香港作為區域綠色和可持續金融樞紐的角色，包括在大灣區。香港作為內地的離岸金融中心，具有優勢將全球投資引導至內地的計劃，以在2030年前實現碳排放達峰，及在2060年前實現碳中和。金管局亦透過由金管局共同主持的綠色和可持續金融跨機構督導小組（CASG）3，建立業界能力、解決數據缺口，以及探索發展本地綠色分類框架。\n\n事實上，香港在綠色金融方案方面處於領先地位，建立了全球首個由政府發行的全球中期票據計劃，專注於在政府綠色債券計劃下發行綠色債券，並自2019年起逐步增加其發行的多元性，包括貨幣及年期方面。為支持私人市場發行綠色及可持續債券及貸款，政府於2021年5月設立了綠色和可持續金融資助計劃。該計劃由金管局管理，已鼓勵更多企業在香港尋求綠色及可持續融資，並鼓勵更多綠色顧問公司及外部評審機構在此設立或擴展業務。\n\n第三，作為外匯基金的經理，金管局確保環境、社會及管治（ESG）因素成為其投資流程及資產配置決策的重要部分。在本報告的後半部分，金管局首次披露其對外匯基金投資組合的氣候情境分析及碳足跡指標。\n\n第四，金管局正加強其綠色辦公室措施，以確保其運作符合管理及減緩氣候風險的最佳實務。作為起點，金管局已建立其範圍1及範圍2排放4的碳分布，並作出相應披露。同時，金管局已實施措施，以提升業界整體運作效率及減少資源消耗。此外，金管局對自身訂立高標準的企業社會責任（CSR），並與利益相關者合作，以促進金融普惠及提升金融知識。\n\n要綠化金融體系，需要央行及監管機構之間的緊密合作。金管局是國際社會在全球政策制定及協調可持續發展標準方面的活躍成員。金管局亦發表聲明，支持央行與監管機構綠色金融網絡（NGFS）的《格拉斯哥宣言》5，重申其承諾落實NGFS的建議，採取必要措施以建立更綠色的金融體系。\n\n在推動這些可持續發展措施及評估與氣候相關的機遇及風險時，可持續發展及綠色因素已融入金管局的治理及風險管理框架之中，其中領導層與外匯基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）及其小組委員會諮詢，積極參與制定總體目標及指導原則。金管局的企業社會責任及可持續發展委員會（CSC）亦評估可持續發展及與氣候相關議題對機構的潛在影響，並制定策略以減輕影響。相關策略及措施的執行情況受到密切監察，並定期向高層管理人員匯報。此外，金管局亦聘請外部顧問，就特定工作領域提供意見。\n\n本章節的後續部分將深入探討金管局在履行其各項職能時，在綠色金融及可持續發展工作方面的治理、策略及風險管理措施。\n\n本報告的編製參考了NGFS於2021年12月發表的《央行氣候相關披露指南》中建議的披露要素。此外，有關金管局辦公室運作的資訊，廣泛參考了全球報告倡議組織標準（GRI）6下的報告原則，以及香港聯合交易所有限公司頒佈的《環境、社會及管治報告指引》。\n\n# 央行與監管機構綠色金融網絡\n\nNGFS為央行及審慎監管機構提供一個平台，以交流經驗、分享最佳實務、促進金融業環境及氣候風險管理的發展，以及動員主流融資以支持轉型至可持續經濟。其目的是界定及推廣最佳實務，供NGFS成員內外實施，並就綠色金融進行或委託分析工作。\n\n# 氣候相關財務披露工作小組\n\n金融穩定理事會於2015年12月成立TCFD，以制定建議，讓公司向投資者、貸款機構及承保公司作出更有效的氣候相關披露，以促進更知情的決策。TCFD的建議圍繞四個主題領域而構建，這四個領域代表了組織運作的核心要素：治理、策略、風險管理，以及指標及目標。\n\n# 銀行業監管機構\n\n作為金融體系的核心部分，銀行應主動管理氣候風險，並支持將更多資本引導至綠色及可持續發展的活動。作為銀行業監管機構，金管局集中強化銀行抵禦氣候風險的能力，並加快銀行支持轉型至低碳經濟的努力。\n\n# 金管局三階段模式概述\n\n自2019年5月起，金管局分三階段推動綠色及可持續銀行業：\n\n# 第一階段\n\n制定一個共同框架，以評估個別銀行的「綠色基準」，並與國際組織合作，為香港銀行提供技術支援。\n\n# 第二階段\n\n就綠色及可持續銀行業的監管期望及要求，諮詢業界及其他利益相關者。\n\n# 第三階段\n\n集中落實監管要求，監察及評估銀行在綠色及可持續銀行業方面的進展。\n\n# 指引\n\n# 氣候風險管理的監管要求\n\n2020年，金管局與業界合作，制定了一個共同框架，以評估個別銀行的「綠色基準」。金管局亦進行了首次銀行綠色評估，標誌著第一階段的完成。為協助銀行為新監管要求作好準備，金管局於2020年6月發表了一份白皮書，概述了金管局對氣候風險管理監管期望的初步想法。\n\n2021年12月，經過業界諮詢後，金管局發出監管要求，規定銀行將氣候因素納入治理、策略、風險管理及披露之中。尤其是，根據TCFD的建議，訂立了具體的要求及時間表，規定在2025年前進行與氣候相關的披露。這些要求將設定基準，協助銀行提升其風險管理能力。\n\n下一步是金管局監察銀行落實相關要求的情況。在這方面，金管局已強化其監管能力，在銀行監理部內成立了一個新的專責團隊，以進行氣候風險監管。\n\n這個三階段模式是一個反覆及演進的過程。在2020年進行首輪綠色評估後，金管局正檢視該框架，以涵蓋新的氣候風險管理監管要求，並可能覆蓋更廣泛的範疇，例如其他環境風險及支持淨零排放轉型的措施。金管局打算在2022年下半年推出經更新的框架。\n\n# 支持轉型至碳中和的良好實務\n\n除了將氣候風險因素納入風險管理框架外，部分銀行亦投入資源及採取措施，以支持《巴黎協定》的目標，並為實現全球淨零排放作出貢獻。金管局於2021年12月發出通告，與業界分享這些銀行的良好實務，供業界其他銀行在制定其氣候策略時參考。這些良好實務分為四個領域：減少銀行自身運作的溫室氣體排放、透過調整融資組合以減少融資排放、協助客戶轉型，以及促進業界合作以協助經濟體實現淨零排放的轉型。\n\n# 綠色分類框架以促進綠色金融流動\n\n為提升金融市場的透明度，並促進綠色金融政策的連貫性，金管局一直與其他金融監管機構合作，探索一個本地的綠色分類框架，以促進在國際可持續金融平台（IPSF）8制定的共通綠色分類目錄（CGT）及中國及歐盟採納的綠色定義之間的導航，供不同金融行業採用。這項工作將以互操作性、可比性及包容性原則為指引，並考慮其他綠色定義、過渡性活動及本地因素。這項措施將減低綠色洗白的風險、提升產品的可比性，並最終強化投資者保護。\n\n# 評估：氣候風險壓力測試\n\n為評估銀行業應對氣候變化帶來的潛在衝擊的能力，金管局進行了一項氣候風險壓力測試試點計劃（CRST），共有20間主要零售銀行及7間國際銀行集團的分支機構參與。一篇總結該試點計劃結果的報告於2021年12月發表。結果顯示，即使面對與氣候相關的極端衝擊，銀行業仍保持韌性，但這些衝擊可能對銀行的財務造成重大不利影響。CRST試點計劃有助提升銀行衡量及評估氣候風險的能力。根據CRST的結果，參與銀行已制定計劃，以強化其氣候策略及風險治理框架。金管局將繼續與業界合作，強化銀行的能力及提升CRST框架，並考慮從試點計劃中汲取的經驗。"}
{"en":"# The Exchange Fund\n\nReport of the Director of Audit Exchange Fund Financial Statements\n\n# Audit Commission The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 217 to 319, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2021, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2021, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards.  My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report.  I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards.  I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021.  These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.5, 2.6 and 38.1 to the financial statements.\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, the Group had financial assets totalling HK$4,502,475 million and financial liabilities totalling HK$1,150,861 million valued at fair value.\n\nFor 89% of these financial assets and all these financial liabilities, their fair values were quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 inputs) or were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data (Level 2 inputs).\n\nFor the remaining 11% of these financial assets, their fair values were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data (Level 3 inputs).  Such financial assets totalled HK$517,316 million, including mainly unlisted investment funds.\n\nGiven the substantial amount and the estimations involved, valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value was a key audit matter.\n\nThe audit procedures on valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value included:\n\n- obtaining an understanding of the procedures, including relevant controls, for valuing different categories of financial assets and financial liabilities;\n- evaluating and testing the controls, including relevant application controls of the computer systems;\n- obtaining external confirmations on the valuation, existence, rights and obligations and completeness of the financial assets and financial liabilities;\n- where quoted market prices were used, verifying the prices to independent sources;\n- where valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions, and verifying the inputs to independent sources; and\n- where valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Valuation of investment properties at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.11, 18 and 19 to the financial statements.\n\nThe Group’s investment properties were stated at their fair values, totalling HK$27,089 million as at 31 December 2021. The Group also had interests in one associate and twenty one joint ventures totalling HK$45,172 million, whose principal activities were holding overseas investment properties.  The fair values of these investment properties, whether held by the Group directly or by associate or joint ventures, were mainly determined based on valuations by independent professional valuers.  Such valuations involved significant judgments and estimates, including the valuation methodologies and the assumptions used.\n\nThe audit procedures on valuation of investment properties at fair value included:\n\n- obtaining and reviewing the valuation reports of investment properties held by the Group directly or by associate or joint ventures, and verifying that the fair values were based on the valuations stated in the valuation reports;\n- assessing the independence and qualifications of the valuers; and\n- evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information.  The other information comprises all the information included in the 2021 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.  If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact.  I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.  I also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.  The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.  If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion.  My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report.  However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and\n- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements.  I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit.  I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.  I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nJohn Chu Director of

意見\n\n我已審計了外匯基金及其附屬公司（簡稱「該集團」）的財務報表，該報表載於第217至319頁，包括外匯基金及該集團截至2021年12月31日的資產負債表，以及該年度的收支帳目、全面收益表、權益變動表和現金流量表，還有財務報表附註，包括重要會計政策概要。\n\n我認為，該財務報表根據香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》，真實而公允地反映了該基金及該集團截至2021年12月31日的財務狀況，以及該年度的財務表現和現金流量，並已按照行政長官根據《外匯基金條例》（第66章）第7條發出的指示妥善編製。\n\n# 意見依據\n\n我依據行政長官按照《外匯基金條例》第7條發出的指示及審計署的審計準則進行審計。我根據這些準則所承擔的責任，在我報告中的「審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任」一節中作了進一步說明。我依據這些準則，獨立於該集團之外，並已履行了根據這些準則應盡的其他道德責任。我相信，我所獲取的審計憑證足以作為我發表意見的依據。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項是指我在專業判斷中，認為對2021年12月31日止年度財務報表審計最具重大性的事項。這些事項是在我對財務報表整體進行審計的背景下考慮的，我在形成審計意見時亦考慮了這些事項，但我不會就這些事項單獨發表意見。\n\n# 以公允價值計量金融資產及金融負債\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.5、2.6及38.1。\n\n截至2021年12月31日，該集團持有以公允價值計量的金融資產共4,502,475百萬港元，金融負債共1,150,861百萬港元。\n\n其中，89%的金融資產及所有金融負債的公允價值，為相同資產或負債在活躍市場上的報價（第1級參數），或以可觀察市場數據為依據的估值方法估計得出（第2級參數）。\n\n餘下11%的金融資產的公允價值，是以非以可觀察市場數據為依據的估值方法估計得出（第3級參數）。這些金融資產總額為517,316百萬港元，主要包括非上市投資基金。\n\n鑑於涉及的金額龐大及需要作出估計，以公允價值計量金融資產及金融負債是關鍵審計事項。\n\n以公允價值計量金融資產及金融負債的審計程序包括：\n\n- 了解計量不同類別金融資產及金融負債的程序，包括相關的控制措施；\n- 評估及測試控制措施，包括電腦系統的相關應用控制措施；\n- 取得外部確認，以確認金融資產及金融負債的估值、存在、權利及義務和完整性；\n- 若使用市場報價，則向獨立來源核實該價格；\n- 若使用以可觀察市場數據為依據的估值方法，則評估估值方法的適用性及假設的合理性，並向獨立來源核實該輸入值；\n- 若使用非以可觀察市場數據為依據的估值方法，則評估估值方法的適用性及假設和輸入值的合理性。\n\n# 以公允價值計量投資物業\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.11、18及19。\n\n該集團的投資物業按公允價值列報，截至2021年12月31日總額為270.89億港元。該集團亦在一間聯營公司及二十一間合營公司持有權益，總額為451.72億港元，其主要業務為持有海外投資物業。這些投資物業的公允價值，不論由該集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有，主要根據獨立專業估值師的估值而釐定。該等估值涉及重大的判斷及估計，包括所用的估值方法及假設。\n\n以公允價值計量投資物業的審計程序包括：\n\n- 取得及審閱該集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有的投資物業的估值報告，並核實公允價值是否以估值報告所述的估值為依據；\n- 評估估值師的獨立性及資格；\n- 評估估值方法的適用性及假設和輸入值的合理性。\n\n# 其他資訊\n\n其他資訊由金融管理專員負責。其他資訊包括香港金融管理局2021年年報中，除財務報表及我就該報表所發表的審計師報告外的所有資訊。\n\n我對財務報表發表的意見不涵蓋其他資訊，我亦不會就其他資訊發表任何形式的鑒證結論。\n\n在審計財務報表時，我的責任是閱讀其他資訊，並考慮其他資訊是否與財務報表或我在審計中獲取的知識有重大不一致，或是否似乎有重大誤報。若我根據已執行的工作得出結論，認為其他資訊存在重大誤報，我有責任報告該事實。我在此方面沒有任何報告。\n\n# 金融管理專員及外匯基金諮詢委員會審核小組委員會就財務報表所承擔的責任\n\n金融管理專員負責按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》及行政長官根據《外匯基金條例》第7條發出的指示，編製真實而公允的財務報表，並負責制定金融管理專員認為必要的內部控制，以使編製的財務報表不存在因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大誤報。\n\n在編製財務報表時，金融管理專員負責評估該集團作為持續經營的能力，酌情披露與持續經營有關的事項，並採用持續經營作為會計基礎。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會審核小組委員會負責監督該集團的財務報告過程。\n\n# 審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任\n\n我的目標是取得合理保證，以確定財務報表整體是否不存在因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大誤報，並就財務報表發表審計師報告，包括我的意見。合理保證是高水平的保證，但並不能保證按照審計署的審計準則進行的審計，在任何時候都能發現財務報表中存在的重大誤報。誤報可能因欺詐或錯誤而產生，若其個別或總體上能合理地預期會影響用戶依據這些財務報表作出的經濟決策，則視為重大誤報。\n\n在按照審計署的審計準則進行審計時，我在整個審計過程中運用專業判斷並保持職業懷疑態度。我亦：\n\n- 識別及評估財務報表因欺詐或錯誤而出現重大誤報的風險，設計及執行審計程序以應對這些風險，並取得充分及適當的審計憑證，作為我發表意見的依據。因欺詐而導致的重大誤報未獲發現的風險，高於因錯誤而導致的重大誤報，因為欺詐可能涉及串通、偽造、故意遺漏、虛假陳述或凌駕於內部控制之上；\n- 了解與審計相關的內部控制，以設計適當的審計程序，但目的並非對該集團的內部控制有效性發表意見；\n- 評估金融管理專員所採用的會計政策是否適當，會計估計是否合理，以及相關披露是否充分；\n- 就金融管理專員採用持續經營作為會計基礎的適當性作出結論，並根據所獲取的審計憑證，確定是否存在與可能對該集團作為持續經營的能力造成重大疑慮的事件或情況有關的重大不確定性。若我得出結論認為存在重大不確定性，我須在審計師報告中提請注意財務報表中的相關披露，或若該披露不充分，則須修改我的意見。我的結論是根據截至我發表審計師報告之日所獲取的審計憑證作出的。然而，未來事件或情況可能導致該集團不再持續經營；\n- 評估財務報表的整體呈列、結構及內容，包括披露，以及財務報表是否以達成公允呈列的方式反映基礎交易及事件；\n- 取得有關該集團內實體或業務活動的財務資訊的充分及適當審計憑證，以對財務報表發表意見。我負責指導、監督及執行集團審計。我對我的審計意見負全部責任。\n\n我就審計的計劃範圍和時間安排及重大審計發現等事項，與外匯基金諮詢委員會審核小組委員會進行溝通，包括我在審計期間查出的任何重大內部控制缺陷。\n\n我亦向外匯基金諮詢委員會審核小組委員會提供一份聲明，表明我已遵守有關獨立性的相關道德要求，並向他們溝通所有可能合理地被視為影響我獨立性的關係及其他事項，以及相關保障措施（如適用）。\n\n從與外匯基金諮詢委員會審核小組委員會溝通的事項中，我確定了在本期財務報表審計中最為重大因而構成關鍵審計事項的事項。除非法律或法規禁止公開披露該事項，或在極罕見的情況下，我確定若在報告中溝通該事項會導致不利後果，而這些後果合理地預期會超過該溝通對公眾利益的好處，我會在審計師報告中描述這些事項。\n\n審計署署長　朱乃璋"}

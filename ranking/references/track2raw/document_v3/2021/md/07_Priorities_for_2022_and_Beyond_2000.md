# Priorities for 2022 and Beyond

Global and local conditions deteriorated notably entering 2022. On the one hand, the escalation of the Ukraine situation and expectations of rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve triggered market volatility. On the other hand, the local economy took a hit from the new wave of COVID-19 pandemic. That said, Hong Kong’s financial system remains well-positioned to withstand adverse shocks given its resilience and buffers built up over the years. Looking ahead, the HKMA will continue to attach high importance to safeguarding monetary and financial stability. In doing so, we will endeavour to stay ahead of the curve by identifying emerging risks and responding to them in an agile manner. At the same time, the HKMA will seek opportunities that would help bolster Hong Kong’s status as a leading international financial centre. In managing the Exchange Fund in this complicated investment environment, the HKMA will continue to invest prudently, while remaining flexible, implementing defensive measures as appropriate, and maintaining a high degree of liquidity.

# STABILITY AND INTEGRITY OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM

The global economic outlook remains subject to significant uncertainties.  The HKMA will keep abreast of latest developments and stay vigilant against potential risks, with the aim of upholding the resilience and stability of the financial system, which are essential for the ongoing provision of critical financial services that support the functioning of the Hong Kong economy.

# Staying vigilant against potential risks

Looking ahead, markets may be subject to heightened volatilities amid increased uncertainties on various fronts. On the one hand, the US Federal Reserve’s monetary policy normalisation, if continuing at a fast pace, may tighten global financial conditions visibly ahead and increase the global debt-servicing burden.  On the other hand, following the escalation of the Ukraine situation in early 2022, geopolitical uncertainties including the China–US tension may continue to stay high and trigger bouts of financial market volatility again.  Last but not least, with the evolving pandemic developments, there might be a potential downside scenario where lockdowns were to be re-imposed at a large scale, leading to persistent global supply bottlenecks and adversely affecting global growth and inflation.  Having said that, Hong Kong’s financial system is well-positioned to withstand adverse shocks given the resilience and buffers built up over the years.  The HKMA also has the capability, resources and commitment to safeguard Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.

The HKMA will continue to closely monitor risks and vulnerabilities in the domestic and external environments and stand ready to deploy appropriate measures where necessary to maintain Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. Research programmes in 2022 will study issues affecting the Hong Kong economy and assess their potential risks. Meanwhile, the HKMA’s ongoing Digitalisation Programme will help enhance its surveillance capabilities to support more holistic surveillance and comprehensive analysis of the financial system.

# Maintaining banking stability

As developed markets tighten monetary policies and the impact of the pandemic lingers, the credit landscape facing the banking sector is expected to remain challenging. At the same time, rapid technological advancement and digitalisation present both opportunities and challenges to the banking sector.  Facing an ever-changing financial landscape, the HKMA strives to ensure banks’ ability to withstand shocks through its ongoing supervisory efforts. At the same time, the HKMA will also continue to enhance and refine its banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account international standards and best practices.

# A risk-based supervisory focus

# Credit risk

In 2022, the HKMA will step up the surveillance of banks’ credit risk exposures and take proactive steps to ensure that overall risk levels remain well contained.

The HKMA will also continue to monitor the development of the pandemic and its effect on the operating conditions of corporates, as well as maintain close dialogue with the banking and commercial sectors while keeping the various relief measures under review.

# Operational and technology risks

With the issuance of the new Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module on “Operational Resilience” in May 2022, the HKMA will continue to engage the industry and understand authorized institutions’ (AIs’) progress in developing their operational resilience frameworks.  In parallel, the HKMA will seek to raise the banking sector’s cyber resilience by following up with AIs on issues revealed by the assessments under the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 and monitoring AIs’ implementation of secure tertiary data backup.  Another key supervisory focus will be evaluating and addressing the risks from AIs’ growing dependency on technology service providers.

With enhanced digital capabilities and extensive remote working experience accumulated during the pandemic, some AIs are planning to transition to a hybrid working model on a business-as-usual basis.  The HKMA will keep track of this development and assess whether the associated risks are adequately addressed by the industry.

# Liquidity and market risks

The HKMA will focus on the supervision of AIs’ liquidity and market risk management in 2022.  In particular, the HKMA will continue to monitor AIs’ progress in transitioning away from the remaining London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) settings before these settings cease to be published by 30 June 2023.

# Combating money laundering and terrorist financing

In 2022, the HKMA’s work on anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) will continue to focus on strengthening response to fraud and financial crime through collaboration and information sharing, pursuing closer co-operation with various stakeholders in the AML/CFT ecosystem.  Other priorities are to implement a wider range of risk-sensitive supervisory techniques, by leveraging enhanced data and supervisory technology (Suptech) capabilities, and promote the use of Regtech by banks, including transaction monitoring systems.

The HKMA will also keep working closely with the Government, the banking and stored value facility (SVF) sectors to publish an updated Hong Kong money laundering and terrorist financing risk assessment, and assist the industry in combatting new and emerging risks.  Work will also continue on understanding evolving money laundering and terrorist financing risks, implementing changes to AML law and related guidance to align with international standards, and maintaining proactive engagement with other regulators and international standard setters.

# Wealth management and mandatory provident fund-related businesses

In 2022, the HKMA will carry out on-site examinations and off-site surveillance of AIs’ conduct in relation to wealth management and the selling of securities, mandatory provident fund (MPF) and other investment and insurance products, with a focus on the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) Scheme in the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area, digital advisory platforms, complex products, virtual assets and non-investment-linked long term insurance products.

While maintaining close communication with other regulators and the banking industry, the HKMA will provide further guidance on regulatory standards in relation to the sale of investment, insurance and MPF products.  This will cover, among other things, investment services related to virtual assets and the selling of Protection Linked Plans, a new subset of investment-linked assurance scheme products with high level of insurance protection.  The HKMA, the Insurance Authority and the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority will jointly launch a mystery shopping programme on the selling practices of intermediaries in respect of Qualifying Deferred Annuity Policies and Tax-deductible Voluntary Contributions.

Following the smooth launch of the Cross-boundary WMC, the HKMA will continue engaging the industry and relevant regulatory authorities to enhance the scheme.

Moreover, the HKMA will embark on preparation work for supervising AIs’ trust business under a new SPM module and a new Code of Practice.

# Oversight of financial market infrastructures

The HKMA will continue to promote the safety and efficiency of the financial market infrastructures (FMIs) under its oversight, in accordance with the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO), the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMI)1, and the various guidances issued by the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI).  It will fine-tune the FMI oversight framework taking into account the latest technological and market developments.

The HKMA will work with the FMIs on their observance of the PFMI, conducting and updating assessments as appropriate. In addition, the HKMA will continue to participate in the CPMI-IOSCO PFMI implementation monitoring and assessment exercise.  The HKMA will also participate in the work of international standard setting bodies and strengthen its oversight requirements in response to market and technology developments and in line with international practices.  The HKMA will work with relevant authorities to further strengthen co-operative oversight arrangements where appropriate.

# Policy development

The HKMA will continue to enhance and refine its banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account international standards and best practices.

# Implementation of Basel standards in Hong Kong

# Capital standards

The HKMA will continue to enhance the capital framework with the implementation of the standards published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) in recent years, which include the following:

The Capital Requirements for Banks’ Equity Investments in Funds of December 2013 (EIF standard), which will come into effect on 1 July 2022 with the Banking (Capital) (Amendment) Rules 2022 commencing operation after negative vetting by the Legislative Council.

The revised capital standards set out in the Basel III Finalising Post-crisis Reforms of December 2017, the Minimum Capital Requirements for Market Risk of January 2019 (revised in February 2019), and the Targeted Revisions to the Credit Valuation Adjustment Risk Framework of July 2020, which are collectively referred to as the “Basel III final reform package”.  These revised capital standards set out the revised capital treatment of credit risk, market risk, credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk and operational risk, introduce an output floor requirement, and enhance the leverage ratio framework.  Amendments to the Banking (Capital) Rules (BCR) are being prepared in consultation with the industry with a view to them taking effect from 1 July 2023 as minimum requirements (except for those on market risk and CVA risk2).

Given that the capital treatment for sovereign concentration risk under the BCR was designed to complement the Basel Committee’s large exposure framework as implemented by the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules, the HKMA will propose amendments to the capital rules in parallel with relevant changes to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules.

# Exposure limits

The HKMA will continue its work on the proposed amendments to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules in consultation with the industry and the Department of Justice with a target implementation date aligned with the one for the Basel III final reform package, i.e. 1 July 2023.

# Disclosure standards

New or revised disclosure requirements associated with the revised capital standards in the Basel III final reform package are mainly set out in the Pillar 33 Disclosure Requirements – Updated Framework and the Revisions to Market Risk Disclosure Requirements, published by the Basel Committee in December 2018 and November 2021 respectively.  The Basel Committee also published the Revisions to Leverage Ratio Disclosure Requirements in June 2019 amending the disclosure requirements for leverage ratio to address concerns regarding potential “window-dressing” (i.e. banks reducing the volumes of certain transactions around reporting dates to artificially inflate their leverage ratios for reporting and public disclosure).  Corresponding amendments to the Banking (Disclosure) Rules to implement these new or revised disclosure requirements are also being prepared, with a view to having them take effect in Hong Kong along the same timelines as their associated revised capital standards.

# Other supervisory policies and risk management guidelines

To reflect developments in regulatory requirements and international standards, the HKMA plans to update certain SPM modules, including those relevant to the implementation of the revised capital and disclosure standards in the Basel III final reform package, “Countercyclical Capital Buffer – Approach to its Implementation”, “Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book”, “New Share Subscription and Share Margin Financing” and “Stress Testing”.  The HKMA will also continue to work on the revised SPM modules on “Code of Conduct” and “Reporting Requirements Relating to Authorized Institutions’ External Auditors under the Banking Ordinance”, with an aim to finalising the revisions within 2022. Consequential to the proposed amendments to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules, the related Code of Practice and SPM modules, e.g. CR-G-8 on “Large Exposures and Risk Concentrations” and CR-G-9 on “Exposures to Connected Parties”, will be updated accordingly.

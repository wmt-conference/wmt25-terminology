# International Financial Centre

During 2021, the HKMA achieved good progress in strengthening Hong Kong’s status as a globally competitive international financial centre through a multi-pronged approach.

The HKMA unveiled “Fintech 2025” strategy to promote the wide adoption of fintech by the financial sector and bolster Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub more broadly.  On the Faster Payment System, it has seen a surge in turnover during the year amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

On enhancing connectivity, significant progress was made during the year with the addition of the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect and Southbound Trading under Bond Connect to the suite of Connect schemes.  Thanks to its world-class market infrastructure and the Connect schemes, Hong Kong is the favoured platform for Mainland funds to tap into global markets and for international investors to access the fast-growing Mainland markets.

Also during 2021, the HKMA devoted significant efforts in creating new business opportunities to strengthen the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, in areas including bond issuance, asset and wealth management, corporate treasury centres, and green and sustainable finance.  To promote Hong Kong’s financial services, the HKMA stepped up market outreach to overseas and Mainland stakeholders to keep them informed about the resilience of Hong Kong’s financial system and the prospects it presents.

Meanwhile, the HKMA is active in international and regional central banking and regulatory forums, contributing to global efforts in maintaining financial stability and promoting financial market developments.

# OVERVIEW

The HKMA announced its “Fintech 2025” strategy, covering a series of initiatives to promote wide adoption of financial technology (fintech) and strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia.  The HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO), together with the banking departments, played a pivotal role in driving various key initiatives during the year including the following:

- Promoting regulatory technology (Regtech) adoption
- Rolling out the Tech Baseline Assessment to understand banks' adoption of fintech

Hong Kong’s position as an offshore renminbi hub remained firm, with offshore renminbi businesses registering robust growth during the year.  Inflows into renminbi assets continued to gather pace as the inclusion of onshore securities in major financial market indices continued. Hong Kong plays an indispensable role in facilitating international investors’ increased allocation to renminbi assets, with the Mainland–Hong Kong Connect schemes being widely accepted as the channels of choice for international investors to access onshore capital markets. In 2021, daily turnover under Northbound Bond Connect increased 34% to around RMB25.8 billion.

Following the success of Northbound Bond Connect, Southbound Bond Connect was launched in September, completing the two-way connection between the Mainland and international bond markets.  In the same month, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), the HKMA and the Monetary Authority of Macao promulgated the implementation details for the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Crossboundary WMC) Scheme in the Guangdong–Hong Kong– Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA).  In October, eligible banks in Hong Kong started providing Cross-boundary WMC services together with their Mainland partner banks.



To enhance Hong Kong’s role as a key offshore renminbi centre, a working group comprising the HKMA, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) was formed to conduct a feasibility study on promoting trading of renminbi-denominated equity securities in Hong Kong.  A joint seminar was also co-organised by the PBoC and the HKMA in December, showcasing Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre and a leading renminbi business hub.

The HKMA continues to make progress towards strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform.  In particular, to increase Hong Kong’s appeal as a preferred fund domicile, the HKMA worked closely with the Government and the financial industry to provide a more facilitating tax and regulatory environment for fund formation.  Significant strides were also made in further elevating Hong Kong’s position as a regional green and sustainable finance hub, and as a bond issuance centre. At the same time, the HKMA stepped up market outreach to promote Hong Kong’s financial services to overseas and Mainland stakeholders.

Safe and efficient operation of financial infrastructure is fundamental for reinforcing Hong Kong’s position as a leading international financial centre.  In 2021, the four interbank Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) and the Hong Kong Trade Repository achieved 100%1 system availability, outperforming the target of 99.95%.  Following the launch of Southbound Bond Connect in September, the CMU became the settlement and custodian service provider for transactions conducted under both Northbound and Southbound Bond Connect.

Adoption of the FPS continued to expand in 2021. The number of registrations grew to 9.6 million at the end of 2021 and the average daily turnover for the year rose by 90% from 2020.  Increased use of the FPS for settling Government bills, making merchant payments and topping up stored value facility (SVF) e-wallets or bank accounts were the key drivers for the continued rise in transaction volume, on top of a steady growth in person-to-person and business payments.

To promote the safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA oversees six designated retail payment systems (RPSs) and supervises 15 licensed SVFs under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO).  During the year, the HKMA facilitated the smooth implementation of the Government’s Consumption Voucher Scheme by co-ordinating and promoting dialogues and co-operation between the relevant Government parties and the SVF licensees appointed for the scheme.

In January 2022, the HKMA issued a discussion paper on crypto-assets and stablecoins, setting out the HKMA’s thinking on the relevant regulatory approach and inviting views from stakeholders.  Relevant factors, including feedback to this discussion paper and recommendations of relevant international bodies, will be taken into account when drawing up the appropriate regulatory regime.

Internationally, the HKMA is an active member of the central banking community and plays a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees.  For example, the HKMA chairs the Working Group on Financial Markets (WGFM) established under the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP)2.  The HKMA also co-chairs the Policy and Standards Group of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), the Non-Bank Monitoring Experts Group and the Financial Innovation Network of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), and leads a team that looks into supervisory issues associated with financial benchmark transition.

# Fintech Adoption in the Banking Sector

To support the “All banks go fintech” initiative of the “Fintech 2025” strategy, the HKMA rolled out the Tech Baseline Assessment in June 2021.  The assessment aims to help the HKMA develop a better understanding of the current fintech landscape in the banking sector, and identify which fintech areas may warrant the HKMA’s support.  All licensed banks with significant operations in Hong Kong were requested to develop a three-year plan for fintech adoption by the end of 2021.

During the year, the HKMA also continued to implement its two-year roadmap to promote Regtech adoption by banks in Hong Kong, and incorporate technology in its own supervisory processes to improve efficiency and effectiveness.  See page 98 of the Banking Stability chapter for more details.

# Wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency

The HKMA and the Bank of Thailand expanded the scope of their joint research project with the joining of the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates and the Digital Currency Institute of the PBoC in February 2021.  Renamed as “Multiple Central Bank Digital Currency Bridge (mBridge)” and strongly supported by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Innovation Hub Centre in Hong Kong, the project further explores the capabilities of distributed ledger technology to facilitate real-time cross-border foreign exchange payment-versus-payment (PvP) transactions in a multi-jurisdictional context and on a 24/7 basis.  A joint report was published in September to deliver the interim findings, followed by the publication of potential use cases and a future roadmap in November.

# Retail Central Bank Digital Currency

To future-proof Hong Kong in terms of CBDC readiness, the HKMA started a study on the prospect of issuing retail CBDC in Hong Kong, i.e. e-HKD, covering both technical and policy considerations.  In collaboration with the BIS Innovation Hub Centre in Hong Kong, the HKMA embarked on a study called Project Aurum to explore the technical aspect of issuing retail CBDC.  Separately, an internal cross-departmental working group was set up to study the relevant technical, policy and legal issues.  In October, the HKMA released a technical white paper titled e-HKD: A technical perspective to explore and invite comments on potential technical design options for issuing and distributing retail CBDC.

Furthermore, the HKMA supports the Digital Currency Institute of the PBoC on the technical pilot testing of using e-CNY for cross-boundary payments.  This will help promote interconnection in the GBA and bring greater convenience to Hong Kong and Mainland tourists by enhancing the efficiency and user experience of cross-boundary payments.

# Commercial Data Interchange

In July, the HKMA hosted a virtual symposium to encourage banks and SVF operators to join the CDI, a next-generation financial data infrastructure that aims to enable more efficient financial intermediation in the banking system.  To further facilitate development and adoption, the launch of the CDI Innovation Hub was announced during the symposium. To facilitate small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) financing, the HKMA completed two phases of proof-of-concept study examining the technical feasibility of the CDI.  Applying alternative data to facilitate credit assessment and the underwriting of loans, more than 550 SME loans exceeding HK$900 million in total were approved by the participating banks during the study.  Based on the encouraging results, the HKMA announced the pilot launch of the CDI in November.

# Talent development

To expand the fintech talent pool, the HKMA continued to run the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme 2.0 in collaboration with its strategic partners3 to nurture young talent at various stages of their career development. More than 180 students benefitted from the scheme in 2021. Separately, the Industry Project Masters Network scheme was piloted in September to provide opportunities for master’s degree students majoring in fintech to work on real-life fintech projects.  To form strategic partnerships and foster collaboration in areas including fintech talent development, the HKMA entered into memorandums of understanding (MoUs) with four local universities in October.

# Fintech Supervisory Sandbox

The use of Fintech Supervisory Sandbox (FSS) continued to rise during the year.  As of end-December 2021, a total of 234 pilot trials of fintech initiatives had been allowed in the FSS since its launch in 2016, compared with 193 as of end-2020.  As of end-December 2021, the HKMA had also received in total 666 requests to access the FSS Chatroom for supervisory feedback at the early stage of fintech projects since the introduction of the Chatroom in 2017.  Over 63% of the Chatroom requests were made by technology firms (tech firms) .

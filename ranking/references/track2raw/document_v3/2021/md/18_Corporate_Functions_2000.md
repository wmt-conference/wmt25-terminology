# Community engagement and public education

To reach out to the community and raise public awareness of the HKMA’s work, a public education programme has been running since 1998.  In 2021, a webinar was organised for over 2,300 students and teachers from 84 secondary schools.  The webinar covered an overview of the HKMA’s work, the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, protection of personal digital keys, the Deposit Protection Scheme and career opportunities in the banking industry.  To date, more than 63,000 people have participated in the public education programme.

The HKMA educates and engages the public on how to be smart and responsible financial consumers.  In view of the increase in phishing scams, the HKMA conducted a public awareness campaign themed “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!” with cross-media promotion to urge the public to stay vigilant against fraudulent hyperlinks embedded in SMS messages and emails purportedly from banks.

The HKMA also seeks to enhance the public’s understanding of the financial industry and raise the young generation’s interest in pursuing a career in the industry.  Following positive feedback to the online drama series “STEPS” in 2020, the HKMA launched a new series titled “Four Faces of Talents in Central” featuring four growing areas of the financial industry: data science, fintech, green and sustainable finance, and wealth management.  In the video series, the characters of the market practitioners were portrayed in a humorous manner, and seasoned industry players and young talents shared first-hand information on the nature and requirements of jobs, career opportunities and prospects across the above four growing areas.

# Financial disclosure

To maintain a high level of transparency, the HKMA adopts international standards in financial disclosure insofar as these are applicable to central banking operations.  These include the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and other applicable reporting requirements, for example, the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard.  The Finance Division works with external auditors and other accounting professionals to prepare and present the Exchange Fund’s financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards.  The HKMA also provides detailed disclosures and thorough analyses of a wide range of expense items and budgetary information in its Annual Report.

# ACCOUNTABILITY AND CONTROLS

# Risk management

One of the HKMA’s most important tasks is to manage risks to the monetary and banking systems.  Risk management is undertaken both at a working level in the day-to-day operations and at a higher level through strategic planning. Under the HKMA’s risk management framework, there are two high-level committees — the Macro Surveillance Committee and the Risk Committee — both of which are chaired by the Chief Executive of the HKMA.

The terms of reference of the Macro Surveillance Committee are:

- to identify potential risks and threats to the monetary and financial system in Hong Kong and discuss possible measures to address such risks;
- to review existing measures for managing risks in the monetary and financial system to identify possible gaps and ensure the adequacy of these measures; and
- to encourage cross-departmental sharing of relevant information on macro surveillance with a view to enhancing the macro surveillance capability of the HKMA.

The terms of reference of the Risk Committee are:

- to identify potential risks and threats to the organisation and devise strategies to reduce the impact of such events;
- to review the existing system for managing risks across different departments to identify possible gaps and significant risks and ensure the adequacy of measures to address them;
- to harmonise the criteria and methods of risk measurement and prioritise the resources management of risks identified; and
- to encourage a stronger risk management culture institutionally which promotes the proper levels of authorisation and controls.

A robust operational risk management framework is in place covering organisational risks at two levels: the entity level and the department level.  Entity-level risks refer mainly to those which concern the entire organisation in the medium term, or which might call for a cross-departmental response. Potential and emerging risks identified by business units, and the adequacy of the control measures and mitigating strategies they devise, are reviewed and reported every quarter.  This is supplemented by a top-down approach to manage entity-level risks, in which senior colleagues heading different business units actively identify risks of wider impact and propose mitigating measures.  The Risk Committee discusses these assessments and decides on appropriate follow-up actions.

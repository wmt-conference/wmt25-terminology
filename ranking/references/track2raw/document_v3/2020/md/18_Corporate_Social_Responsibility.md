# Corporate Social Responsibility

The HKMA is committed to fulfilling its corporate social responsibility, and aims to be a responsible and sustainable organisation. This commitment is manifested in various areas, including promoting a sustainable and environment-friendly marketplace, supporting the wider community, protecting the environment and nurturing a caring workplace.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the HKMA introduced a number of measures to support individuals and enterprises in need to help Hong Kong’s economy ride out these difficult times.

# MARKETPLACE

# Green and sustainable finance

Climate change is one of the major risks threatening the well-being of mankind and the sustainability of the world economy. The financial sector in which banks operate, being an integral part of society, will not be spared and hence should be more proactive in managing climate risks. The HKMA is committed to exploring ways to address this challenge. It is undertaking a number of measures unveiled in May 2019 for promoting the development of green finance in Hong Kong, including a three-phased approach to promote green and sustainable banking:

# Phase I

developing a common framework to assess the “Greenness Baseline” of individual banks, and collaborating with international bodies to provide technical support to banks in Hong Kong;

# Phase II

consulting the industry and other stakeholders on the supervisory expectations and requirements of green and sustainable banking; and

# Phase III

focusing on the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of banks’ progress in this regard.

On the international front, the HKMA participates in a number of forums such as the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s high-level Task Force on Climate-related Financial Risks, the Interest Group on Sustainable Finance of the Working Group on Banking Supervision of the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks and the International Platform on Sustainable Finance. The HKMA’s participation provides an opportunity for it to contribute to the central banking and regulatory community in addressing climate change, while benefitting from the experience and insights of other jurisdictions when developing its local framework.

Specifically, the HKMA participates in various NGFS workstreams, including the workstream on microprudential and supervision (WS1), the workstream on macrofinancial (WS2) and the workstream on scaling up green finance (WS3). The HKMA also joined the two new workstreams — the workstream on research and the workstream on bridging the data gap. The former focuses on research work and the latter aims to develop a detailed list of data items that are currently lacking but are needed by authorities and financial institutions to assess climate-related risks and opportunities. See the Banking Stability chapter for more details about the progress on promoting green and sustainable banking during the year.

In November, the HKMA and the International Finance Corporation (IFC) jointly launched the Alliance for Green Commercial Banks to help banks develop solutions needed to address climate change across emerging markets. As the founding member and the first regional anchor of the Alliance, the HKMA i) promotes the development of Green Commercial Banks in the global financial market; ii) serves as a peer-to-peer learning platform for commercial banks to acquire knowledge, tools and business information to develop their green finance road maps and transform themselves into credible green banks; iii) facilitates dialogue and provides thought leadership to advance the green finance agenda globally; and iv) helps members of the Alliance to collaborate and take advantage of an estimated US$23 trillion in green and climate-related investment opportunities identified by the IFC across emerging markets in the next decade.

Locally, the HKMA is working with other financial regulators in Hong Kong to coordinate the management of climate and environmental risks to the financial sector. In addition to assisting the Government in implementing the Government Green Bond Programme, the HKMA co-initiated the establishment of the Green and Sustainable Finance CrossAgency Steering Group (CASG) with the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) to address cross-sectoral regulatory and market development issues. See the International Financial Centre chapter for more details about the HKMA’s work on developing Hong Kong as a green and sustainable finance hub during the year.

# Green and Sustainable Finance Cross-Agency Steering Group

The CASG aims to coordinate the management of climate and environmental risks to the financial sector, accelerate the growth of green and sustainable finance in Hong Kong and support the Government’s climate strategies. It was formed in May at the initiation of the HKMA and the SFC. The other CASG members are the Environment Bureau, the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, the Insurance Authority and the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority.

Since its formation, the CASG has set up two work streams: to study and address cross-sectoral regulatory issues; and coordinate cross-agency market development efforts.

In December, the CASG launched its green and sustainable finance strategy for Hong Kong which comprises six key longer-term focus areas for strengthening Hong Kong’s financial ecosystem to support a greener and more sustainable future. The CASG also announced five nearterm action points to address some of the most pressing issues that are hindering development of the sector.

# Responsible investment

The HKMA supports responsible investment (RI), which is defined as the incorporation of environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors in investment activities. As a large asset owner, the HKMA’s increasing focus on RI will affect how its asset managers carry out its investment activities.

# HKMA beliefs

The HKMA believes that, by putting appropriate emphasis on RI and sustainable long-term performance, it can better achieve the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund and reduce risks associated with the ESG-related matters of its underlying investments.

# HKMA principles

The HKMA’s guiding principle is that priority will generally be given to ESG investments if the long-term risk-adjusted return is comparable with other investments. Where appropriate, the HKMA adopts in its investment process the following RI principles that underpin its beliefs as a responsible long-term investor:

# Integration

The HKMA incorporates ESG factors into its investment analysis to identify risks and opportunities, as it believes that these factors can materially affect the long-term value of its investments. ESG factors are integrated into the HKMA’s investment process for both public and private market investments.

# Active ownership

The HKMA exercises shareholder rights in its public equity holdings in a manner that helps safeguard the long-term value of its investments. The HKMA believes that responsible corporate behaviour guided by ESG factors will help create shareholder value in the long run. The HKMA’s asset managers are expected to help the HKMA discharge its ownership responsibilities in the underlying investments by adopting active ownership through exercising voting rights and engaging with investee companies.

# Collaboration

The HKMA seeks to join hands with like-minded investors and regulators to promote good practices for the long-term management of investments. It participates in and speaks at public events to share better ESG practices and encourage the investment community to adopt RI.

See the Reserves Management chapter for more details about the HKMA’s work on RI during the year.

# HKMA as an Active Responsible Investor Monitoring External Managers’ ESG Practices

# HKMA expectations

The HKMA attaches high importance to the incorporation of ESG factors in investment decisions and to the notion of active ownership. To this end, it takes ESG factors into account in selecting, appointing and monitoring external managers. The appointed external managers are also required to take active ownership seriously, as the HKMA sees exercising shareholder rights in public equity holdings as a fundamental means of safeguarding the long-term value of equity investments.

# HKMA monitoring

The external managers are subject to assessment of their ESG performance in managing the HKMA’s listed equity portfolios. This is carried out through an engagement programme that systematically examines various aspects of their ESG practices, such as their ESG assessment framework, engagement with investee companies, and work on proxy voting. In 2020, a group of selected external managers became the first to undergo the programme. They were gauged not only by their ESG performance, but also whether they had properly discharged ownership responsibilities on behalf of the HKMA.

# Engagement outcomes

The programme identified external managers with questionable practices that necessitated follow-up action. Two examples are set out below:

# Case 1

The HKMA detected that an equity manager A had room for improvement in its ESG framework, specifically in establishing a more systematic approach to assess investee companies. The HKMA followed up on this with the manager, which embarked on a company-wide review to implement a more robust ESG framework. In particular, the manager engaged an external consultant to provide advice in the ESG process, demonstrating the manager’s determination to expedite implementation of the improved framework. The manager also set up a new ESG committee comprising senior management, affirming both its commitment to ESG and the backing from its senior management of the endeavour.

# Case 2

Having reviewed the voting practices of an equity manager B, the HKMA identified areas for improvement in the manager’s voting policy and brought these up with B’s Head of ESG for review. Specifically, the manager’s voting decision was 100% in favour of the management’s proposal and deviated from its own proxy voting guidelines. The manager later undertook to enhance the company’s voting policy by incorporating the expectation that there would be greater involvement of its ESG team members and the possibility of voting against the management where governance issues are material.

For private market investments, the HKMA realises RI through its general partners’ commitment to working with underlying portfolio companies on ESG matters. The HKMA has noted consistent ESG commitment among the general partners as they consider it to be aligned with the long-term value creation and sustainability of returns of their portfolio companies. The two examples below show that climate change risks can be managed through (i) design changes and adoption of innovative operational techniques and (ii) carbon reduction considerations being integrated in the construction and operation of green and sustainable warehouses. Both examples have seen significant positive impact to the environment with lower carbon emissions; harmful products are avoided and operational efficiency is gained through cost and energy savings.

(i) The HKMA has investment in a pest control company which adopts environmentally friendly solutions. While traditional pesticides and chemicals can exterminate pests effectively, dead pests have adverse implications for public hygiene if not promptly or properly disposed of, and environmental concerns can also arise from the seepage and disposal of chemical ingredients. The company’s biocide-free solution is to deploy physical pest traps, thereby avoiding the use of harmful chemicals. The company also uses internetlinked motion sensors to remotely detect whether pests have been trapped. With this new technology, the company can optimise route planning to collect trapped pests and reduce the mileage travelled, thereby lowering carbon emissions. The net effect on carbon as measured on a company-wide basis has shown an encouraging low reading of 0.36 kg/CO2e/$ net sales, which is close to the industry average for low-carbon-emitting sectors such as legal services and software publishing.

(ii) The HKMA has investment exposure to green and sustainable warehouses. While the construction industry is a major contributor to carbon emissions, the warehouse developer adopts a net zero carbon process in its overall construction and operation of warehouses. Standards and metrics for measuring the baseline of net zero carbon are in place, and construction planning takes into consideration the sustainability of materials and components used. The resulting warehouse is carbon-efficient and designed with sustainable features, including solar thermal systems, electric vehicle charging portals, natural lighting and rainwater harvesting.

The carbon footprint of the warehouse construction has net 25.8% lower carbon emissions than a standard logistics building, according to measurements by an independent consultant. To further offset carbon emissions from the construction work, 32,799 net trees were planted during the process. Post-construction, the warehouse reduced carbon emissions by 26.9% in its daily operations compared with a standard warehouse.

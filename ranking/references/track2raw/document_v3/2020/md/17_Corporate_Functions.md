# HKMA Information Centre

The HKMA Information Centre on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre is an important facility introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters. It consists of an exhibition area and a library. The exhibition area provides an overview of the HKMA’s work and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong in an interactive manner. It also contains information and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs. The library, situated next to the exhibition area, houses more than 26,000 books, journals and other publications on Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs as well as central banking topics. It also maintains the register of AIs and local representative offices, and the register of securities staff of AIs, as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.

In recognition of its thoughtful design and unique ambience, the HKMA Information Centre was named one of the Platinum Winners of the 2020 MUSE Design Awards in Interior Design category among over 1,000 entries from around the world.

During the temporary closure of the Information Centre in 2020 amid the pandemic, the opportunity was taken to enhance the facilities at the Policy Section, which explains the work of the HKMA and related financial concepts. The enhancements, which took into account visitors’ feedback, aimed to further improve the visiting experience by making the interactive facilities more user-friendly, engaging and durable.

To ensure equal access to its services by all members of the public regardless of race, the Information Centre has implemented procedures to provide language services assistance to visitors and to enquirers who called the Centre’s hotline.

The opening and service hours of the HKMA Information Centre have been affected by the ongoing pandemic situation. To safeguard public safety and to maintain a high standard of hygiene during the pandemic, special opening arrangements and precautionary measures have been implemented during the year. Cleansing and disinfection were stepped up, and facilities and exhibits were sanitised regularly with anti-microbial coating.

# Public and consumer education

To reach out to the community and raise public awareness of the HKMA’s work, a webinar was organised for over 1,600 students and teachers from 61 secondary schools in 2020. The webinar covered an introduction to the work of the HKMA, the LERS, Hong Kong banknotes, protection of personal digital keys and the Deposit Protection Scheme. This was the first time for the public education programme to be held virtually since its launch in 1998. To date, the programme registered more than 61,000 participants.

Over 1,600 students and teachers from 61 secondary schools participate in the HKMA Public Education Webinar.

The HKMA educates and engages the public on how to be smart and responsible financial consumers. An ongoing topic of focus has been “Protection of personal digital keys”. During the year, the HKMA produced a series of short videos urging the public to properly safeguard their financial accounts and personal information no matter when and where. In view of prevailing online scams amid COVID-19, the public were reminded to stay vigilant against fraud when shopping or using personal credentials online.

The HKMA seeks to raise the interest of the young generation in joining the organisation. It launched an online drama series “STEPS” and a collection of related posts on social media in 2020, covering the HKMA’s work in areas including currency, the LERS, fintech, financial inclusion, banking supervision and international collaboration.

The drama series “STEPS” introduces the HKMA’s major functions in a light-hearted manner through the story of a young new recruit.

Protection of personal digital keys is extensively promoted on digital platforms and out-of-home media.

The HKMA also collaborated with stakeholders through a number of community engagement programmes, one of which being an online parenting and educational campaign to teach kindergarten and junior primary school pupils about money management concepts and banking and payment services. The campaign featured animation videos, webbased games, DIY toys, downloadable worksheets and a colouring competition.

Animation videos featuring mascot Dollar Pig and the Kam family bring out messages on five themes.

Other initiatives on youth education included an online financial literacy quiz and a webinar for secondary school students and teachers, producing comic storybooks for primary school pupils and parents jointly with a professional association, and delivering online talks to tertiary students.

The HKMA supports the Investor and Financial Education Council in promoting financial literacy and capacity in Hong Kong, and will explore further collaboration with stakeholders to maximise the impact of community engagement.

# OUR PEOPLE

While the HKMA is an integral part of the Government, it employs staff on terms different from those of the civil service to attract people with the right experience and expertise. The HKMA recruits, develops and maintains a highly professional workforce to support its policy objectives and respond flexibly to changing work priorities.

The establishment of the HKMA in 2020 was 1,005. The HKMA made strong efforts to support new initiatives and the increasing complexity and volume of existing work through flexible redeployment of existing resources, efficiency enhancement and streamlining of work processes. In 2021, the HKMA will maintain its establishment at 1,005 and redeploy existing resources for the following new and expanded tasks:

# Banking and Financial Stability
- Support the policy development of Wealth Management Connect (WMC), and other Greater Bay Area (GBA) and private wealth management initiatives, and undertake ongoing supervision of WMC activities
- Handle licensing work under the Insurance Ordinance and the new over-the-counter derivatives regime, and undertake conduct supervision of virtual banks
- Implement new supervisory requirements on climate risks, and step up prudential supervision of banks

# Reserves Management
- Strengthen investment and risk management and other necessary support for the further expansion and diversification of the Exchange Fund’s investment activities

# Hong Kong as an International Financial Centre
- Support increased participation in activities of the Financial Stability Board and other international working groups
- Administer the newly proposed tax concession regime for carried interest and validate the eligibility of funds for various tax concessions

# Remuneration policies and pay review mechanism

The Financial Secretary (FS) determines the pay and conditions of service for HKMA staff on the advice of the Governance Sub-Committee (GSC) through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC), taking into account the prevailing market rates and practices. Remuneration comprises a total cash package and a provident fund scheme, with minimal benefits in kind. The cash package consists of monthly fixed pay (or basic pay) and variable pay that may be awarded to individual staff members as a lump sum once a year, depending on performance.

Pay for HKMA staff is reviewed annually by the FS in the light of recommendations made to him by the GSC through the EFAC, taking into account the GSC’s assessment of the performance of the HKMA in the preceding year, the paysurvey findings of the financial sector conducted by independent human resources consultants, and any other relevant factors. Special pay adjustments may be made from time to time to reward individual meritorious staff members and to maintain the competitiveness of their pay.

Any approved annual adjustments to the fixed pay and any variable pay awards are distributed to individual staff members based on their performance. Investment staff members are subject to a variable pay system that seeks to strengthen the link between their investment performance and remuneration award. The pay adjustments and awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Executive Director and above are approved by the FS on the advice of the GSC. The staff members concerned are not present at the meetings when their pay is discussed. The pay adjustments and awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Division Head and below are determined by the Chief Executive of the HKMA under delegated authority from the FS within the approved overall pay awards.

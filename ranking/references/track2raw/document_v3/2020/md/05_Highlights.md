# Highlights of 2020

# Economic & Financial Environment

In 2020, the Hong Kong economy contracts by the most severe magnitude on record amid the COVID-19 pandemic, with consumption and tourism-related sectors particularly hard-hit. The labour market deteriorates sharply while inflation moderates. Amid the challenging environment, the Government and the HKMA roll out relief measures to support the economy.

Despite the significant headwinds, the Hong Kong banking sector remains resilient, with solid financial positions and growing deposits. The capital and liquidity positions remain strong, while asset quality stays at healthy levels.

# Monetary Stability

Despite the heightened uncertainty amid the pandemic, Hong Kong’s monetary system remains resilient, as evidenced by the smooth functioning of the Hong Kong dollar foreign exchange and money markets. The Hong Kong dollar firms throughout most of 2020, with repeated triggering of the strong-side Convertibility Undertaking. This demonstrates the confidence in, and robustness of, the Linked Exchange Rate System.

# Banking Stability

The HKMA closely monitors the impact of the pandemic on banking operations, while maintaining its focus on the supervision of the credit and liquidity risk management of banks. In the face of increasing cyber risks and the industry’s accelerated technology adoption, the HKMA strengthens the supervision of banks’ technology risk management and operational resilience while enhancing consumer protection in digital financial services.

The HKMA also continues to promote information sharing through public-private partnership and support Regtech adoption in the banking industry.

New rules and regulations are rolled out to enhance the banking regulatory regime in line with the latest international standards. On green and sustainable banking, the HKMA moves forward with Phase II of the three-phased approach to formulate supervisory expectations. The HKMA also advances its work in establishing resolution standards, undertaking resolution planning and developing resolution execution capability to ensure a credible resolution regime for banks.

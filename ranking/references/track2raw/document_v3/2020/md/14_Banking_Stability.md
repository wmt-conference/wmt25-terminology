# Banking Stability

The banking sector in Hong Kong remained sound and stable in 2020, notwithstanding the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic causing significant headwinds to the economy. During the year, the HKMA monitored closely and responded in an agile manner to the impact of the pandemic on banking operations and supervisory activities, while maintaining its focus on the supervision of the credit and liquidity risk management of authorized institutions. In view of escalating cyber threats and the industry’s growing adoption of technology, the HKMA stepped up the supervision of authorized institutions’ technology risk management and operational resilience. The HKMA also worked closely with banks and international bodies to facilitate the transition to alternative reference rates.

On conduct supervision, the HKMA provided regulatory flexibilities and guidance to facilitate banks’ operations and continued services to customers, while safeguarding protection to investors and consumers amid the pandemic. Together with relevant authorities, the HKMA developed and consulted the industry on the proposed implementation details for the crossboundary wealth management connect pilot scheme. Working with the Securities and Futures Commission, guidance was provided on streamlining the selling processes for family offices and high net worth investors with financial sophistication. In addition, the HKMA enhanced consumer protection in digital financial services and continued to promote a customer-centric corporate culture.

On anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT), the HKMA has acted swiftly to clarify how the risk-based approach and technology could help authorized institutions better respond to the COVID-19 situation, while also carefully managing the impact of rising geopolitical tensions on the banking sector. The HKMA continued to champion initiatives to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of AML/CFT work, including expanding the number of authorized institutions involved in information sharing in the public-private partnership, as well as supporting Regtech adoption in the banking industry. The HKMA has also embarked on a programme to further enhance AML/CFT surveillance capability to respond to the international trend of leveraging technology and data.

Meanwhile, the HKMA has worked closely with the banking industry in optimisin supervisory policies and processes and in carrying out capacity-building initiatives to facilitate talent development. Good progress was made on the local implementation of international supervisory standards, including capital adequacy standards and disclosure standards. On promoting green and sustainable banking, the HKMA has moved forward with phase two of the three-phased approach in formulating relevant supervisory requirements. The HKMA also continued to advance its work to ensure a credible resolution regime for authorized institutions, including developing new resolution standards and implementing rules on loss-absorbing capacity requirements to enhance authorized institutions’ resolvability.

# OBJECTIVES

The HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this objective is contingent upon the financial system being highly resilient and capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.

Banks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their businesses and, in extremis, by failing in a disorderly manner. The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring banks are resilient to shocks and able to recover their positions in response to crises, ultimately helping to prevent failures. The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks in Hong Kong. It is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs). The Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs).

However, the Monetary Authority cannot ensure, nor is the Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework designed to ensure, a zero-risk financial system. Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that, in the event of an AI becoming non-viable, its failure can be managed in an orderly manner. To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong has been established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs, amongst other types of institutions. To operationalise the resolution regime in Hong Kong, it is important to lay down resolution rules and policy standards, undertake resolution planning to remove impediments to AIs’ resolvability and develop the HKMA’s operational capability to resolve a failing AI. In order to carry out these tasks effectively, the HKMA adopts an internationally harmonised and coordinated approach.

# REVIEW OF 2020

# Overview of supervisory activities

In 2020, 186 off-site reviews were conducted covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL rating assessment, corporate governance, risk management and fintech strategies. As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance, 30 meetings were held with the boards of directors, independent non-executive directors or board-level committees of AIs. Furthermore, 30 tripartite meetings were held among the HKMA, the AIs and their external auditors.

Apart from off-site activities, the HKMA conducts regular on-site examinations supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk. A total of 610 on-site examinations and thematic reviews were conducted during the year. Credit risk management remained a key focus of these examinations and reviews. Another major focus was operational risk and technology risk management under COVID-19. The HKMA also increased the number of on-site examinations and thematic reviews targeted at liquidity and market risk management. At the same time, specialist teams performed on-site examinations and thematic reviews of AIs’ activities in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses.

Despite the pandemic, the HKMA maintained its supervisory intensity by adopting flexible methods in an agile manner to discharge its supervisory duties in an effective manner, including exercising flexibility around submission of returns and conduct of onsite examinations, stepping up collection of data to supplement onsite examinations, and making use of virtual meeting platforms.

Table 1 contains an overall summary of the HKMA’s supervisory activities in 2020.

# Credit growth and asset quality

Total loans increased by 1.2% in 2020, compared with a growth of 6.7% in 2019. Table 2 shows the breakdown of growth in loans and advances.

Table 2 Growth in loans and advances

Mainland-related lending decreased slightly by 0.2% to HK$4,553 billion in 2020 (Table 3).

Table 3 Growth in Mainland-related lending

The asset quality of AIs deteriorated modestly, reflecting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The banking industry’s classified loan ratio increased from 0.57% to 0.90% during the year, remaining at a healthy level well below the long-run historical average of 1.8% since 2000. In terms of Mainlandrelated lending, the ratio also rose to 0.96% from 0.75% a year ago.

In view of the uncertainties arising from the COVID-19 pandemic causing significant headwinds to the economy, the HKMA conducted a deep-dive review of AIs’ asset quality to assess emerging trends of deterioration. In particular, the HKMA stepped up its surveillance of large borrowers as well as vulnerable sectors in the current environment through collecting more granular data on banks’ credit exposures at sectoral- and borrower-levels. An ad-hoc stress test analysis confirmed banks’ resilience to the economic stress caused by the COVID-19 outbreak.

During the year, targeted and thematic examinations were conducted to evaluate the credit risk management practices of AIs in different areas, such as Mainland-related lending, interbank lending, and collateralised lending to private banking and wealth management customers.

# Measures to alleviate cash flow pressure faced by customers

In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, the Banking Sector Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) Lending Coordination Mechanism, established by the HKMA in October 2019, rolled out several rounds of relief measures for both corporate and retail customers with a view to encouraging banks to continue to support borrowers’ financing needs to the extent permitted by prudent risk management principles. Most notably, the Mechanism launched the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme in May to defer all loan principal payments of eligible corporates by six months. After a six-month extension in November, the Scheme was further extended by six months in March 2021 to end-October 2021. Around 100 banks participated in the Scheme, covering 120,000 eligible corporate customers. By end-December, banks had approved over 58,000 cases for loan tenor extension and other forms of relief, involving an aggregate amount of over HK$740 billion. For personal customers, banks rolled out principal payment holiday programmes for residential mortgages, including those related to subsidised housing under the Home Ownership Scheme. Banks also offered relief loans to employees in hard-hit sectors, extended loan tenor for personal lending, and reduced charges on various forms of personal credit. As at end-December, banks had approved more than 28,000 cases of principal payment holiday for residential mortgages and other personal relief loans, amounting to over HK$44 billion.

# Property mortgage lending

The successive rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures introduced by the HKMA since 2009 have strengthened the risk management of banks and the resilience of the Hong Kong banking sector to cope with a possible abrupt downturn in the local property market. The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of new residential mortgage loans (RMLs) approved in December 2020 was 57%, compared with 64% in September 2009 before the countercyclical measures were first introduced. The increase in the average LTV ratio of newly approved RMLs in 2020 was primarily due to a larger proportion of RMLs with mortgage insurance, which generally had a higher LTV ratio. The average debt servicing ratio (DSR) of new mortgages remained low at 37% in December, compared with 41% in August 2010 when a cap on DSR was first applied (Chart 1).

In August, the HKMA relaxed the countercyclical macroprudential measures for mortgage loans on nonresidential properties after taking into account factors such as the price trends and transaction volumes of these properties, economic fundamentals, and the external environment. The applicable LTV ratio caps for mortgage loans for these properties were adjusted upward by 10 percentage points, from 40% to 50% for typical cases.

# Supervision of operational and technology risk

In response to the outbreak of COVID-19 in early 2020, the HKMA undertook a series of steps to mitigate the outbreak’s impact on banking operations. These steps included requiring AIs to review their business continuity plans (BCPs) and take appropriate precautionary measures to safeguard the health of their staff and customers, while maintaining essential banking services. The HKMA also reminded AIs to enhance communication with staff and customers, prepare for the possibility of infection cases at their premises, and develop BCPs for more severe but plausible risk scenarios. The HKMA maintained close dialogue with the industry and asked AIs to stay vigilant and keep their BCPs under review, having regard to the development of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Government’s social distancing measures.

Following a holistic review of the Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative (CFI) and extensive industry consultation, the HKMA introduced CFI 2.0 in November. The CFI was enhanced to reflect the latest developments in overseas cyber practices. Specifically, recent international sound practices on cyber incident response and recovery were incorporated into the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework (C-RAF). As regards the Professional Development Programme under the CFI, the certification list was expanded to include equivalent qualifications in major overseas jurisdictions. The HKMA also put forward a series of recommendations to the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB) to make the Cyber Intelligence Sharing Platform more user-friendly. CFI 2.0 came into effect on 1 January 2021.

# Smart Banking

All the eight virtual banks which obtained a banking licence in 2019 launched their business during the year, after rigorous testing and pilot trials in the Fintech Supervisory Sandbox. They adopted innovative technologies to provide new customer experience. One example is the use of big data analytics in the credit assessment of SME loans to expedite the loan approval process. To increase customer engagement and build brand loyalty, some virtual banks introduced gamification in their services such as time deposits and reward schemes.

# Supervision of liquidity and market risk

The HKMA introduced a series of measures in April to ensure the continued smooth operation of the interbank market and the banking system amid the pandemic. These measures included clarifying the operational parameters of the HKMA Liquidity Facilities Framework, launching a temporary US dollar liquidity facility and reiterating the flexibility in the usage of liquidity buffers under the regulatory framework. The HKMA performed drills with AIs to ensure they were ready for utilising these measures when needed.

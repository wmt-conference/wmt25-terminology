# Priorities for 2023 and Beyond

While Hong Kong’s economy has shown signs of recovery entering 2023, the external environment remains full of challenges and uncertainties. The recent emergence of banking stress in the US and Europe with a failure of a few domestic US banks in March 2023 have sent ripples through global markets, while monetary policy tightening by major central banks is likely to translate into slower global growth or even recession in 2023. Meanwhile, geopolitical tensions and ongoing threats of de-globalisation are likely to continue to weigh on global trade and spark volatility in global financial markets from time to time. That said, Hong Kong’s financial system remains well-positioned to weather adverse shocks given its sound resilience and ample buffers built up over the years.

The HKMA attaches great importance to safeguarding Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. Looking ahead, we will stay vigilant in the face of the uncertain macroeconomic environment, seeking to promptly identify emerging risks and respond to them in an agile manner. At the same time, we will seek opportunities and create policy headroom to help further enhance Hong Kong’s status as a leading international financial centre. In managing the Exchange Fund in this challenging investment environment, the HKMA will continue to invest prudently, while remaining flexible, taking defensive measures as appropriate, and maintaining a high degree of liquidity.

# Stability and integrity of the financial system

The global economic outlook remains subject to significant uncertainties. The HKMA will keep abreast of latest developments and stay vigilant against potential risks, with the aim of upholding the resilience and stability of the financial system, which are essential for the ongoing provision of critical financial services that support the functioning of the Hong Kong economy.

# Staying vigilant against potential risks

In 2023, uncertainties on the interest rate path in the US and the emergence of banking stress in advanced economies may pose potential downside risks to the growth outlook for major advanced economies. Moreover, lingering geopolitical risks are likely to continue to weigh on global trade and spark volatility in global financial markets from time to time. Nevertheless, Hong Kong’s financial system is well-positioned to withstand adverse shocks given the resilience and buffers built up over the years. The HKMA also has the capability, resources and commitment to safeguard Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.

The HKMA will continue to closely monitor risks and vulnerabilities in the domestic and external environments, and deploy appropriate measures where necessary to maintain Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. We will also conduct research into issues affecting the Hong Kong economy and assess the potential risks associated with these issues.

# Maintaining banking stability

Given escalating geopolitical tensions and aggressive interest rate hikes by major central banks globally to tame rising inflation, the business environment facing the banking sector is expected to remain challenging in 2023. At the same time, rapid technological advances and digitalisation are presenting both opportunities and challenges to the banking sector. Facing an ever-changing financial landscape, the HKMA strives to ensure banks’ ability to withstand shocks through its ongoing supervisory efforts. At the same time, the HKMA will also continue to enhance and refine its banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account international standards and best practices.

# A risk-based supervisory focus

# Credit, liquidity and market risks

In 2023, the HKMA will continue to closely monitor the asset quality of authorized institutions (AIs), focusing on their classification and provisioning practices and their management of vulnerable borrowers. The HKMA will also enhance its surveillance system and take proactive steps to ensure that the overall credit risk level of the banking sector remains manageable.

Meanwhile, the HKMA will also keep track of the operating environment of corporates and maintain close dialogue with the banking and commercial sectors to prepare for an eventual exit of the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme, while ensuring customers facing temporary difficulty will continue to get appropriate credit support.

The HKMA will also step up its supervision of AIs’ liquidity and market risk management in 2023 against the backdrop of an uncertain macroeconomic environment.

# Operational and technology risk

The HKMA will seek to enhance the operational and cyber resilience of the banking sector as banks increasingly adopt technologies in their operations. Following the issuance of the new Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module on “Operational Resilience” in May, the HKMA will maintain a close dialogue with the industry and review the progress being made by AIs in building their operational resilience frameworks. In parallel, the HKMA will look to raise the banking sector’s cyber resilience by following up with AIs on issues revealed by the assessments made under the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0, and by monitoring AIs’ implementation of the secure tertiary data backup arrangement.

With accelerating digitalisation, other supervisory focuses of the HKMA include stepping up supervision of banks’ third-party risk management and strengthening the banking sector’s data governance capabilities.

# Combating money laundering and terrorist financing 

In 2023, the HKMA will prioritise regulatory updates, strengthen the collaborative eco-system response to money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF) risks, and further efforts in anti-money laundering (AML) supervisory technology (Suptech) and regulatory technology (Regtech). Amendments will be made to the HKMA’s Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT), complemented by specific guidance on a proportionate approach to the Politically Exposed Person (PEP) requirements, with the aim of supporting effective, risk-based industry implementation of key legislative changes. Meanwhile, information-sharing will be scaled up by broadening the scope of existing public-private partnerships and supporting the launch of bank-to-bank information sharing. These will enable faster detection of suspicious accounts and deter abuses, as well as increasing protection for victims of fraud and facilitating recovery of their losses. The HKMA will also focus further on Regtech adoption (including data analytics) through AML Regtech Labs and other AML/CFT Regtech initiatives, and work towards developing a macro analytics capability to complement its data-driven AML/CFT supervision. Collectively, these initiatives will enable the HKMA to take quicker action in response to systemic ML/TF risks such as mule account networks, and stay agile in responding to evolving threats.

# Wealth management businesses

In 2023, the HKMA will step up both on-site examinations and off-site surveillance of AIs’ conduct in relation to wealth management and the selling of securities, Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) and other investment and insurance products. Our focus in 2023 will be on the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) Scheme, digital distribution and advisory platforms, virtual assets, environmental, social and governance (ESG) investment products and long term insurance products, taking into account the latest market developments and evolving international standards.

The HKMA will communicate closely with other regulators and with the banking industry, and provide AIs with guidance on regulatory standards in relation to the sale of investment, insurance and MPF products as appropriate. Such guidance will also cover the provision of investment services related to virtual assets. In relation to this, in support of the sustainable and responsible development of the virtual asset sector, the HKMA will participate actively in international fora and work with the Government and with other financial regulators on developing a comprehensive regulatory framework for virtual assets.

Following the smooth launch of the Cross-boundary WMC, the HKMA will engage with the industry and relevant regulatory authorities to enhance the scheme. It will also work with the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the industry to streamline the selling process of investment products including for sophisticated investors, and commence the supervision of AIs’ trust business under the new SPM module and Code of Practice.

# Oversight of financial market infrastructures

The HKMA aims to promote the safety and efficiency of the financial market infrastructures (FMIs) under its oversight in accordance with the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO), the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMI), and the various guidance issued by the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI), by conducting assessments of the systems against the latest international standards as appropriate. The HKMA will participate in the CPMI-IOSCO1 PFMI implementation monitoring and assessment exercise. It will also take part in the work of international standard-setting bodies, and review and strengthen its oversight requirements to reflect international practices or in response to market and technology developments. At the same time, the HKMA will work with relevant authorities to further strengthen co-operative oversight arrangements where appropriate.

# Policy development

The HKMA will continue to strengthen and refine its banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account international standards and best practices.

# Implementation of Basel standards in Hong Kong 

# Capital standards

The HKMA will further enhance the capital framework through implementing the standards published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) in recent years, which include the following:
- The revised capital standards set out in the Basel III: Finalising Post-crisis Reforms of December 2017, the Minimum Capital Requirements for Market Risk of January 2019 (revised in February 2019), and the Targeted Revisions to the Credit Valuation Adjustment Risk Framework of July 2020, collectively referred to as the “Basel III final reform package”. These revised capital standards set out the new regulatory treatment of credit risk, market risk, credit valuation adjustment risk and operational risk, introduce an output floor requirement, and enhance the leverage ratio framework. Following several rounds of industry consultation in 2022, the HKMA plans to conduct a statutory consultation on proposed amendments to the Banking (Capital) Rules (BCR) in 2023 that will implement the above requirements and the Positive Neutral Countercyclical Capital Buffer. The amendments are expected to be introduced into the Legislative Council for negative vetting within the same year, and become effective as minimum requirements no earlier than 1 January 2024.
- The Prudential treatment of cryptoasset exposures of December 2022: the local implementation of the standard is planned for 1 January 2025 in accordance with the timeline set by the Basel Committee, and the HKMA plans to consult the industry on its related proposals in 2023.

# Exposure limits

In March 2023, the HKMA issued the proposed amendments to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules for industry consultation. The amendment proposals were largely consequential to the HKMA’s implementation of revised capital standards under the Basel III final reform package mentioned above. The consultation package also includes further consequential amendments to the treatment of sovereign concentration risk under the BCR. The target implementation date of the amended rules will be aligned with that for the credit risk parts of the amended BCR for implementing the Basel III final reform package, i.e. no earlier than 1 January 2024.

# Liquidity standards

The HKMA intends to consult the industry in 2023 on proposed amendments to the Banking (Liquidity) Rules by way of the Banking (Liquidity) (Amendment) Rules 2023 (BLAR 2023). Since the amendments are consequential changes arising from the concurrent proposed amendments to the BCR, the target implementation date of the BLAR 2023 will be aligned with that of the credit risk parts of the amended BCR for implementing the Basel III final reform package, i.e. no earlier than 1 January 2024.

# Disclosure standards

New and revised disclosure requirements associated with the revised capital standards in the Basel III final reform package are mainly set out in the Pillar 32 Disclosure Requirements — Updated Framework and the Revisions to Market Risk Disclosure Requirements, published by the Basel Committee in December 2018 and November 2021 respectively. The Basel Committee also published the Revisions to Leverage Ratio Disclosure Requirements in June 2019, which amended the leverage ratio disclosure requirements to address concerns regarding potential “window-dressing” (i.e. banks reducing the volumes of certain transactions around reporting dates to artificially inflate their leverage ratios for reporting and public disclosure). To implement these new and revised disclosure requirements in Hong Kong, the HKMA is in the process of preparing the corresponding amendments to the Banking (Disclosure) Rules (BDR), as well as a revised package of standard disclosure templates and tables in consultation with the industry. The amendments to the BDR are expected to be tabled at the Legislative Council for negative vetting along with the amendments to the BCR in 2023.

# Banking Stability

The banking sector in Hong Kong continued to be resilient in 2022, despite the uncertain and challenging macro-environment, and heightened volatilities in the financial markets. During the year, the HKMA stepped up the supervision of authorized institutions’ credit and market risk management. The HKMA also worked closely with authorized institutions to enhance their operational and cyber resilience in light of escalating cyber threats and accelerating digital transformation in the banking sector.

On conduct supervision, the HKMA stepped up consumer protection in respect of “Buy Now, Pay Later” products, and introduced an additional payment arrangement for property refinancing. The HKMA also worked with fellow regulators on a regulatory framework for sustainable development of virtual assets, streamlined the investment product selling process and introduced a new regulatory regime on trust business. The Credit Reference Platform under the Multiple Credit Reference Agencies Model for consumer credit data was launched, and a new mandatory reference checking scheme was introduced to tackle the “rolling bad apples” phenomenon. Meanwhile, the HKMA helped facilitate the reactivation of bank accounts amid travel restrictions under the pandemic.

Following the updated Hong Kong money laundering and terrorist financing risk assessment, the HKMA worked with banks to strengthen Hong Kong’s anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) ecosystem through public-private partnerships, including the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce, and enhance the response to scams. In addition, the HKMA worked with strategic partners to better understand and manage risks and vulnerabilities amid an increasingly complex geopolitical environment. Further efforts were made to promote the use of data and technology through the AML Regtech Lab series while accelerating the adoption of supervisory technology in the HKMA’s AML work. Internationally, the HKMA participates actively in the work of the Financial Action Task Force.

In 2022, good progress was made on implementing international supervisory standards locally, including those on capital adequacy and disclosure. In addition, notable efforts were also made in the area of soft infrastructure, including working with the banking industry to build a sustainable pipeline of future talents and to upskill existing practitioners. Throughout the year, the HKMA worked closely with the banking industry in refining and streamlining supervisory policies and processes.

The HKMA also continued to advance its local and international work to ensure a credible resolution regime. In particular, a new resolution standard was developed, a regional crisis simulation exercise was conducted, and a new layer of loss-absorbing capacity resources was built up at all domestic systemically important banks, representing a milestone in enhancing resolvability.

# Objectives

The HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this objective is contingent upon a highly resilient financial system that is capable of providing the critical financial services that the Hong Kong economy needs.

Banks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their business and, in extreme cases, by failing in a disorderly manner. The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring that banks are resilient to shocks and able to recover their positions in response to crises, ultimately helping to prevent failures. The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks and is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs).

The Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework is not designed to ensure a zero-risk financial system. Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that, in the event of an AI becoming non-viable, its failure can be managed in an orderly manner. To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong has been established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs, among other types of institutions. To operationalise the resolution regime in Hong Kong, it is important to lay down resolution rules and policy standards, undertake resolution planning to remove impediments to AIs’ resolvability and develop the HKMA’s operational capability to resolve a failing AI. In order to carry out these tasks effectively, the HKMA adopts an internationally harmonised and co-ordinated approach.

The Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs). In overseeing FMIs, the HKMA aims to promote their general safety and efficiency, limit systemic risk and foster transparency. Making FMIs more resilient protects the monetary and financial systems in Hong Kong from possible destabilising effects arising from disruption to the FMIs.

# Licensing

During the year, the HKMA granted money broker approval to six foreign trading platform operators. The authorizations of five licensed banks and one restricted licence bank were revoked during the year.

More information about the AIs and local representative offices in Hong Kong can be found in the Annex and Tables D to F on pages 283 to 286 and 292 to 295 respectively.

# Overview of supervisory activities

In 2022, 183 off-site reviews were conducted covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL rating assessment, corporate governance, risk management and financial technology (fintech) adoption. As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance, 36 meetings were held with the boards of directors, independent non-executive directors or board-level committees of AIs. Furthermore, 38 tripartite meetings were held among the HKMA, AIs and their external auditors.

Apart from off-site activities, the HKMA conducted regular on-site examinations on a wide range of AIs’ activities. Credit risk management was a key focus from a prudential supervision perspective, while the management of operational risk and technology risk was another major focus amid the growing adoption of technology by banks. Meanwhile, a round of thematic examinations focused on climate risk management was also conducted amid the rapid development of green and sustainable banking in Hong Kong. On conduct supervision, on-site examinations in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses were carried out, supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk.

# Credit risk

# Credit growth and asset quality

Total loans decreased by 3.0% in 2022, compared with a growth of 3.8% in 2021. Table 2 shows the breakdown of growth in loans and advances. Mainland-related lending also decreased by 4.4% to HK$4,522 billion in 2022 (Table 3).

During the year, the banking sector was buffeted by challenges from various fronts, including the fifth wave of COVID-19 infections, rising geopolitical tensions, aggressive rate hikes by major central banks and worsening financial conditions of certain Mainland property developers. Despite these challenges, the banking sector remained stable and resilient.

The asset quality of the banking sector deteriorated during the year but remained at a healthy level. The classified loan ratio of the industry was 1.38% at the end of 2022, up from 0.89% at the end of 2021. The classified loan ratio for Mainland-related lending increased to 2.21% from 0.89% a year ago.

Over the year, the HKMA enhanced the breadth and depth of its risk surveillance, and maintained close communication with AIs to facilitate up-to-date assessment of the impact of economic and market developments as well as the adequacy of AIs’ risk management measures. The overall credit risk facing the banking sector remained manageable. The results of the HKMA’s solvency stress tests indicated that the banking sector continued to maintain sufficient capital buffers to withstand extreme stress.

Targeted and thematic examinations were conducted during the year to evaluate AIs’ credit risk management focusing on asset quality, exposures to vulnerable sectors, oversight of credit risks at branches outside Hong Kong, and collateralised lending to private banking and wealth management customers.

Meanwhile, as more corporates ran into financial difficulty against the challenging macroeconomic backdrop, the HKMA encouraged AIs to follow the principles under the “Hong Kong Approach to Corporate Difficulties” in dealing with corporates encountering repayment problems, so that individual AIs acted collaboratively in the common interest of the lenders involved.

# Alleviating cash flow pressure faced by customers

The HKMA and the Banking Sector Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) Lending Coordination Mechanism extended the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme until the end of July 2023, given the difficult operating environment for corporates in the wake of the fifth wave of COVID-19 infections and continued uncertainties surrounding the external and domestic economy. To help customers prepare for an eventual resumption of normal repayment, a partial principal repayment option under the Scheme was introduced and subsequently enhanced.

By the end of 2022, banks had approved loan tenor extensions and other forms of relief in over 108,000 cases, involving an aggregate amount of over HK$1.1 trillion. For personal customers, banks had approved more than 81,000 cases of principal payment holidays for residential mortgages and other personal relief loans, amounting to over HK$65 billion.

# Property mortgage lending

The successive rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures introduced by the HKMA since 2009 have strengthened banks’ risk management and the banking sector’s resilience to a possible abrupt downturn in the local property market. The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of new residential mortgage loans (RMLs) approved in December 2022 was 57%, compared with 64% in September 2009 before the countercyclical measures were first introduced. The average debt servicing ratio (DSR) of new mortgages remained low at 39% in December 2022, compared with 41% in August 2010, when a cap on DSR was first applied (Chart 1).

In September, the HKMA lowered the stress testing requirement for property mortgage lending from a 300-basis point increase in interest rate to a 200-basis point increase. The decision was made taking into account factors including the prevailing interest rate environment, the trend of mortgage rates and their long-term historical average. This level was considered to be sufficiently prudent from the perspective of effective risk management of banks’ property lending business.

# Operational and technology risk

A number of initiatives were taken to strengthen the operational resilience of the banking sector over the year. A new Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module on “Operational Resilience” was issued in May to set out the HKMA’s supervisory expectations with respect to the governance and control framework that AIs should maintain to become operationally resilient. Two industry dialogues were organised to promote understanding of the new standards and to facilitate experience sharing within the industry (Figure 1).

The HKMA also provided detailed supervisory guidance on specific areas of banking operations, including customer data protection, payment system operations, cloud computing, payment card security and anti-distributed denial of service (anti-DDoS) protection.

In light of the evolving cyber threat landscape, the HKMA sought to enhance the cyber resilience of the banking sector by promoting the adoption of a secure tertiary data backup arrangement, monitoring AIs’ implementation of the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 and evaluating the effectiveness of banks’ management of cyber risks arising from supply chain attacks.

In response to heightened risks of phishing scams and other online fraud, in September the HKMA and the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB) jointly launched a new public awareness campaign with the slogan “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!”. In July, a workshop was also organised together with the Hong Kong Police Force to update banks on the latest modus operandi of fraudsters.

# Liquidity and market risk

The HKMA stepped up its surveillance of banks’ market and liquidity risk exposures amid the heightened market volatilities brought about by the aggressive tightening of monetary policies amongst the major economies. The HKMA conducted reviews to assess the adequacy of AIs’ liquidity risk management, focusing on systems and controls for funding diversification and intragroup liquidity risk management. Examinations were also carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of AIs’ market risk management frameworks and operational controls over treasury activities.

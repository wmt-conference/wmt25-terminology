# Media relations and social media

The HKMA works closely with the media to enhance transparency and promote public understanding of its policies and operations. In 2022, the HKMA held or participated in 112 physical and virtual events, comprising eight press conferences, 11 stand-up interviews and 93 other public functions. A further 46 media interviews were arranged. A total of 492 bilingual press releases were issued over the course of the year, and a large number of media enquiries were handled on a daily basis.

To raise awareness of the HKMA’s key functions, press conferences and media briefings were organised for local, Mainland and foreign media. Topics included the Currency Board operations, green and sustainable finance, and Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC).

Media actively took part in events organised by the HKMA during 2022, including the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit. The three-day event was well received by the media. More than 200 journalists from 87 media outlets were present, and the event generated around 1,000 pieces of news coverage in local, regional and international media. Separately, live streaming signals were arranged for 30 media outlets.

To effectively engage with the public, the HKMA operates six social media channels (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, WeChat, and YouTube) with over 100,000 followers. In 2022, the HKMA established a WeChat channel to reach an even wider audience. The HKMA utilises its social media channels to promote major events and initiatives, including the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit and the Government Green Bond Programme, and to raise public awareness on a range of topics, including the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), financial technology (fintech) and scam protection.

The HKMA also published 17 inSight articles to introduce its major new initiatives and policies and discuss topical issues of interest.

The HKMA Annual Report 2021 received a Silver Award in the “Non-profit Making and Charitable Organizations” category, and a Certificate of Excellence in Environmental, Social and Governance Reporting at the Hong Kong Management Association’s 2022 Best Annual Reports Awards.

# Corporate website

The corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk) presents more than 46,000 pages of content in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, and is the public gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It contains the register of authorized institutions (AIs) and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance (BO), as well as the register of stored value facility licensees under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance.

The HKMA has been releasing financial data and important information on its website via Open Application Programming Interface (Open API) in phases since 2018. By end-2022, the HKMA had opened up 148 sets of Open APIs on its website, in line with the targeted schedule.

# Information Centre

The HKMA Information Centre, located on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre, is an important facility introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters. It consists of an exhibition area and a library. The exhibition area presents an overview of the HKMA’s work and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong in an interactive manner. It also contains information and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs. The library, situated next to the exhibition area, houses more than 26,000 books, journals and other publications on Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs as well as central banking topics. It also maintains the register of AIs and local representative offices, as well as the register of securities staff of AIs, for public access as required by section 20 of the BO.

The Information Centre gradually resumes its guided tour services for visitors in the second half of 2022 following the subsidence of the COVID-19 pandemic

The library is re-opened to the public in March 2023 with its fresh new look after renovation

# Community engagement and public education

To reach out to the community and raise public awareness of the HKMA’s work, a public education programme has been running since 1998. In 2022, a webinar was organised for over 2,200 students and teachers from 82 secondary schools. The webinar covered an overview of the HKMA’s work, the LERS, Hong Kong banknotes, protection of personal digital keys, the Deposit Protection Scheme and career opportunities in the banking industry. To date, more than 65,000 people have participated in the public education programme.

The HKMA educates and engages the public on how to be smart and responsible financial consumers. In light of the rising number of phishing scams, the HKMA launched a cross-media awareness campaign to further remind the public to stay vigilant against fraudulent hyperlinks embedded in SMS messages and emails purportedly from banks, and to beware of other types of scams, such as deposit and credit cards scams. Radio and social media promotions were also conducted to convey other smart tips on credit cards, personal loans, online shopping and different payment options (including “Buy New, Pay Later” products).

New videos themed “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!”

To help the public keep pace with technological advancements in financial services, the HKMA encouraged the public to use electronic lai sees during the Chinese New Year through social media and radio promotions. Animated videos were aired to explain Open API and to pinpoint issues to note when accessing banking services through smartphone applications of third-party service providers such as online shopping platforms and mortgage agencies. The animated videos also introduced the App-to-App/Web-to-App payment function of the Faster Payment System and its benefits.

The HKMA also seeks to enhance the public’s understanding of the financial industry and raise young people’s interest in pursuing a career in the HKMA and the industry. New interview videos featuring discussions with graduates of the HKMA’s Manager Trainee (MT) Programme not only promoted the programme to potential applicants but also enriched their understanding of the HKMA’s work.

To enhance financial literacy among secondary school students, the HKMA and various stakeholders co-organised the “Hong Kong Financial Literacy Championship” for the eighth consecutive year. Under the theme of green and sustainable finance, students acquired new knowledge through an online quiz (which received a record number of submissions), webinars and a design thinking competition.

An online parenting educational campaign was rolled out during the special vacation in March and summer vacation in August in the 2021/22 academic year. Kindergarten and junior primary school students learnt about notes and coins, basic concepts of banking and payment services, and money management via animated videos, story-telling, making of simple toys and sharing sessions with financial and childhood education experts.

# Financial disclosure

To maintain a high level of transparency, the HKMA adopts international standards in financial disclosure insofar as these are applicable to central banking operations. These include the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and other applicable reporting requirements, for example, the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard. The Finance Division works with external auditors and other accounting professionals to prepare and present the Exchange Fund’s financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards. The HKMA also provides detailed disclosures and thorough analyses of a wide range of expense items and budgetary information in its Annual Report.

# Accountability and controls

# Risk management

One of the HKMA’s most important tasks is to manage risks to the monetary and banking systems. Risk management is undertaken both at a working level in day-to-day operations and at a higher level through strategic planning. Under the HKMA’s risk management framework, there are two high-level committees — the Macro Surveillance Committee and the Risk Committee — both of which are chaired by the Chief Executive of the HKMA.

The terms of reference of the Macro Surveillance Committee are to: 
- identify potential risks and threats to the monetary and financial system in Hong Kong and discuss possible measures to address such risks;
- review existing measures for managing risks in the monetary and financial system to identify possible gaps and ensure the adequacy of these measures; and
- encourage cross-departmental sharing of relevant information on macro surveillance with a view to enhancing the macro surveillance capability of the HKMA.

The terms of reference of the Risk Committee are to:
- identify potential risks and threats to the organisation and devise strategies to reduce the impact of such events;
- review the existing system for managing risks across different departments to identify possible gaps and significant risks and ensure the adequacy of measures to address them;
- harmonise the criteria and methods of risk measurement and prioritise the resources management of risks identified; and
- encourage a stronger risk management culture institutionally which promotes the proper levels of authorisation and controls.

A robust operational risk management framework is in place covering organisational risks at two levels: the entity level and the department level. Entity-level risks refer mainly to those which concern the entire organisation in the medium term, or which might call for a cross-departmental response. Potential and emerging risks identified by business units, and the adequacy of the control measures and mitigating strategies they devise, are reviewed and reported every quarter. This is supplemented by a top-down approach to manage entity-level risks, in which senior colleagues heading different business units actively identify risks of wider impact and propose mitigating measures. The Risk Committee discusses these assessments and decides on appropriate follow-up actions.

# Internal audit

The Internal Audit Division (IAD) provides independent and objective assurance on the adequacy and effectiveness of the HKMA’s governance, risk management and control processes. The IAD reports functionally to the Audit SubCommittee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) and administratively to the Chief Executive of the HKMA. Adopting a risk-based approach, the IAD conducts operational and information system audits to review significant risk areas. During 2022, 28 audits were conducted on the HKMA’s reserves management, banking supervisory activities, monetary and financial development, information technology and other corporate functions. The audit results showed that adequate and effective control systems were in place to manage risks arising from the HKMA’s business operations.

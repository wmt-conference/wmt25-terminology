In 2024, we held or participated in a total of 207 events, which included 14 press conferences, four media briefings, 14 stand-up interviews and 175 other public functions. We organised press conferences and media briefings to raise awareness of our key functions among local, Mainland and foreign media.

We develop creative social media content to raise public awareness on a range of topics and initiatives, such as scam prevention, fintech, green and sustainable finance, supporting SMEs, and major events of the HKMA. We also livestreamed the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit on social media channels to enhance participation from the public and the industry.

# Corporate website

The corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk), with over 73,000 pages of content in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, is the public gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It contains the register of authorized institutions (AIs) and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance (BO), as well as the register of stored value facility (SVF) licensees under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance.

We have been releasing financial data and important information on our website via an Open Application Programming Interface (Open API) in phases since 2018. By the end of 2024, the HKMA had opened up 177 sets of Open APIs, in line with its target schedule. For more information, please visit the HKMA’s Open API portal (https://apidocs.hkma.gov.hk/).

# Information Centre

Located on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre, the HKMA Information Centre consists of an exhibition area and a library designed to introduce the work of the HKMA to the community and enhance public awareness of monetary and banking matters. The interactive exhibition area presents an overview of the HKMA’s work and of the development of money and banking in Hong Kong, along with information and exhibits useful for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.

During the year, the Information Centre welcomed more than 68,000 visitors, up around 120% compared with 2023. It hosted over 570 guided tours for schools and other groups.

The library, next to the exhibition area, houses over 26,000 books, journals and other publications on Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs as well as central banking topics. It also maintains the register of AIs and local representative offices, as well as the register of securities staff of AIs, for public access as required by section 20 of the BO.

# Community engagement and public education

Since 1998, the HKMA has been running a public education programme aimed at raising public awareness of its work. To date, more than 68,000 people have participated in the programme. In 2024, we organised a webinar for over 800 students and teachers from 41 secondary schools. The webinar topics included an overview of the HKMA’s work, the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, anti-scam, the Deposit Protection Scheme, green finance, and career opportunities in the banking industry.

Through different channels, we engage and educate the public on being smart and responsible financial consumers. The 2024 activities attracted over 67,000 participations.

To dovetail with the trend of digital payment and going green in daily life, we encouraged the public to give out electronic lai sees (e-laisees) and to consider using good-asnew banknotes for physical lai sees during the Chinese New Year through social media and radio promotion.

# Anti-scam song — “Don’t Click Links Indiscriminately”

To further its anti-scam efforts, we launched an anti-scam song, featuring Mr Jackson Wan Kwong, a singer, and Mr Arthur Yuen, Deputy Chief Executive of the HKMA, to remind the public “not to be fooled by fake links”, and properly safeguard their sensitive personal and credit card information. The effectiveness of the campaign’s cross-media promotion was recognised with an international marketing award.

# Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect TV video series

The HKMA collaborated with a local TV station to produce a video series to help the public to further understand the opportunities and the flexibility given to individual retail investors in cross-boundary investment via the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) Scheme in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA). Promoted through TV, digital and social media platforms, the videos featured “classic scenes” of five iconic Hong Kong movies to explain the Cross-boundary WMC framework, investor eligibility and products offered in the Northbound and Southbound Schemes, risk management, and matters to note in cross-boundary investment.

# Hong Kong Financial Literacy Championship

To promote financial literacy at secondary schools, the HKMA co-operated with various stakeholders to co-organise the “Hong Kong Financial Literacy Championship”. Celebrating its 10th anniversary in 2024, the Championship was themed “Next-gen Finance”, aiming at equipping secondary school students with knowledge about the integration of artificial intelligence, digitalisation, fintech innovation, and raising their commitment to sustainability and environmental, social and governance principles.

The first component of the Championship was an online quiz that tested students’ knowledge about money management and hot financial topics. Students from 290 secondary schools made a total of 32,000 submissions to the online quiz in 2024, setting a record high. From 2015 to 2024, students from 440 secondary schools entered a total of around 125,000 submissions to the quiz as part of the annual Championship. The second component, the Young Financial Talent Runway, operated under a mentorship framework, with seasoned practitioners from across different areas acting as mentors to train participating students to prepare for the Design Thinking Challenge. In 2024, a special “GBA Invitation Match” was added, enhancing interaction among students in the GBA.

# Education board games

We launched “$mart Money Management 321”, our first financial education board game, in 2023. In 2024, we further promoted the game to expand its reach and enhance its use as an educational tool to help primary school students learn about different payment methods, money management concepts, fintech and cybersecurity in a simulated setting.

At the community level, we restaged the award-winning board game at our booth at the Hong Kong Book Fair 2024, and through trial workshops at community centres and parenting workshops on the HKMA premises during the Christmas and the Chinese New Year holidays. In addition, we organised trial sessions at primary schools, as well as a train-the-trainer workshop to encourage secondary school teachers to use the board game as part of the teaching kit for the module on financial education in the new “Citizenship, Economics and Society” subject for junior secondary school students. Moreover, in recognition of the board game as a good educational tool, the Education Bureau presented the board game as a gift to winning schools in its Financial Education School Award Scheme (2023/24). In total, the HKMA organised around 40 board game workshops throughout 2024, reaching over 3,600 students, parents, teachers and social workers.

Leveraging the experience in developing the “$mart Money Management 321” board game, we launched a strategy board game named “企業綠化大變身” as a souvenir for visitors to its booth at the Hong Kong Book Fair 2024. This board game, the first of its kind in Hong Kong, teaches children lessons on green financing.

Furthermore, we continued to support the work of the Investor and Financial Education Council in promoting financial literacy and financial capacity in Hong Kong. We will explore further collaboration with different stakeholders to maximise the impact of our community engagement work.

# Financial disclosure

To maintain a high level of transparency, the HKMA adopts international standards in financial disclosure insofar as they are applicable to central banking operations. These include the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and the Special Data Dissemination Standard of the International Monetary Fund. The Finance Division works with external auditors and other accounting professionals to prepare and present the Exchange Fund’s financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards. The HKMA also provides detailed disclosures and thorough analyses of budgetary and expenditure information in its Annual Report (See Budgeting and Financial Controls on pages 193 to 194).

# Economic and Financial Environment

The Hong Kong economy registered moderate growth in 2024, driven primarily by the rebound in goods exports amid improved external demand and the global tech cycle recovery. The labour market stayed solid, while inflation remained mild as external price pressures eased further. The local stock market experienced a significant turnaround, while the property market remained generally soft as persistently high interest rates continued to weigh on market sentiment. For 2025, the economy is expected to face a challenging external environment due to escalating trade tensions. Nevertheless, Mainland’s proactive economic stimulus measures, together with the multifaceted support provided to local enterprises, are expected to reinforce business confidence. Hong Kong will also continue to strengthen international exchanges and deepen regional ties and co-operation.

# The economy in review

# Real activities

The Hong Kong economy expanded at a moderate pace in 2024, with its real gross domestic product (GDP) rising by 2.5% year on year, following growth of 3.2% in 2023 (Table 1 and Chart 1). Externally, exports of goods resumed positive growth on the back of improved external demand and the recovery of the global tech cycle, providing the major impetus for overall economic growth. Exports of services also grew further alongside the ongoing recovery of inbound tourism, as well as a surge in cross-border financial and fundraising activities during the second half of the year. Nevertheless, its positive impact on overall economic growth was more than offset by a substantial increase in imports of services, primarily driven by the continued increase in outbound tourism. Domestically, private consumption expenditure softened as local residents adjusted their consumption patterns. In contrast, overall investment expenditure experienced modest growth, supported by the increase in property transactions, as well as improved business sentiment in tandem with the gradually easing monetary conditions.

# Inflation and the labour market

Local inflation remained mild in 2024 as external price pressures eased further, while domestic cost pressures remained broadly in check despite the gradual feed-through of rising fresh-letting private residential rentals (Chart 2). For 2024 as a whole, the underlying and headline inflation rates were 1.1% and 1.7% respectively.

The labour market demonstrated resilience in 2024, with the unemployment rate staying within a low range of 2.9%–3.1% throughout the year (Chart 3). Both labour demand and supply remained largely stable, as reflected respectively by the gradual increase in total employment (Chart 3) and the growth of the labour force since the first quarter. Meanwhile, nominal wages and labour earnings recorded solid increases alongside the ongoing economic growth. In tandem, the Government announced further enhancements to Hong Kong’s talent attraction schemes in the 2024 Policy Address, aiming to alleviate the manpower shortage across different industries and rejuvenate the local population by attracting more young people.

# Stock market

The local stock market staged a notable turnaround in 2024, fuelled by a strong rebound from mid-September onwards. Specifically, market sentiment improved significantly alongside the US Federal Reserve (Fed)’s interest rate cuts and Mainland’s proactive economic stimulus measures, driving the Hang Seng Index to a year-high daily close of 23,100 on 7 October (Chart 4). Nevertheless, the market experienced a slight retreat following the US presidential election in early November, which triggered concerns over the global economic outlook and the pace of the US Fed’s monetary easing. Despite the setback, the Hang Seng Index concluded the year on a positive note, closing at 20,060. This marked a substantial increase of 17.7% from the end of 2023, ending a four-year streak of annual decline.

# Property market

The residential property market was generally soft in the first three quarters of 2024 before showing signs of stabilisation in the final quarter. Supported by relevant policy relaxations in late February and mid-October, as well as the initiation of the interest rate cut cycle in September, housing transactions surged by 23.5% from a record-low of 43,002 units in 2023 to 53,099 units in 2024. Nevertheless, the still-high mortgage rates and the accumulated inventories in the primary market continued to exert downward pressure on housing prices. As a result, housing prices fell by 7.1% year on year in 2024, leading to a slight improvement in housing affordability, although it remained stretched. The non-residential property markets remained subdued. Notably, the office segment continued to grapple with high vacancy rates amid current ample supply, while the retail premises segment encountered challenges stemming from shifting consumption patterns among both visitors and local residents.

# Outlook for the economy

# Economic environment

The Hong Kong economy is expected to face a challenging external environment in 2025 due to escalating trade tensions that are likely to disrupt international trade and investment flows. Nevertheless, continued, multifaceted support by the authorities and the banking sector will strengthen the resilience of local enterprises. Mainland’s proactive economic stimulus measures and significant breakthroughs in cutting-edge technologies should also provide support to business sentiment. Meanwhile, Hong Kong will further deepen its regional ties and increase its engagement with emerging markets. Inbound tourism is also anticipated to experience further growth on the back of the tourism-related policy support from Mainland authorities as well as the Government’s dedicated efforts to revitalise the tourism industry.

# Inflation and the labour market

Local inflation is expected to stay mild in 2025. Domestic costs may face subtle upward pressure, driven by the gradual pass-through of rising housing rentals to consumer prices, while external price pressures may remain soft although uncertainties surrounding the global economic outlook have increased. Meanwhile, the labour market may face challenges stemming from escalating trade tensions. Yet, the various talent attraction schemes should continue to foster the build-up of a high-quality talent pool, supporting longer-term economic development.

# Performance of the banking sector

The Hong Kong banking sector continued to be safe and sound in 2024, underpinned by strong capital and liquidity positions of banks. Against the backdrop of a challenging macroeconomic environment, the credit risk faced by the banking sector increased during the year, although the overall asset quality of banks remained manageable. The profitability of retail banks improved compared to 2023 on the back of higher income from investments held for trading as well as income from fees and commissions.

# Asset quality

The classified loan ratio of the banking sector increased to 1.96% at the end of 2024 from 1.57% at the end of 2023, with the overdue and rescheduled loan ratio increasing to 1.55% from 1.24% during the same period (Chart 5). The increase in the classified loan ratio was mainly due to downgrades of exposures to some Mainland property developers and small and medium-sized local property developers and investors. Nevertheless, the classified loan ratio of Mainland-related lending decreased to 2.38% at the end of 2024 from 2.58% at the end of 2023. Provisions set aside by banks remained sufficient. The provision coverage ratio (i.e. total provisions to classified loans) stood at about 65% at the end of 2024. Taking into account the market value of collateral held against the classified loans, the adjusted provision coverage ratio was about 145%. Meanwhile, the delinquency ratios of residential mortgage lending and credit card lending remained low, at 0.11% and 0.35% respectively, at the end of 2024 (Chart 6).

# Profitability trends

The aggregate pre-tax operating profit of retail banks increased by 8.4% in 2024, while the post-tax return on average assets rose to 0.93% from 0.88% during the same period (Chart 7). The profit growth was mainly driven by increases in income from investments held for trading (+97.0%) and income from fees and commissions (+15.4%), which were partly offset by a decrease in net interest income (-5.2%). The net interest margin of retail banks narrowed to 1.52% in 2024 from 1.67% a year ago (Chart 8). Meanwhile, retail banks’ cost-to-income ratio edged up to 39.2% in 2024 from 38.9% in 2023 (Chart 9).

# Balance sheet trends

The banking sector’s balance sheet grew by 4.3% in 2024, mainly due to an increase in negotiable debt instruments held (+13.4%). Given the subdued loan demand amid high borrowing costs, total loans decreased by 2.8% in 2024. Of the total loans, loans for use in Hong Kong and loans for use outside Hong Kong decreased by 2.1% and 5.7% respectively, while trade finance increased by 4.6%. Mainland-related lending decreased by 8.7% in 2024.

On the liability side, total deposits rose by 7.1% in 2024, compared with growth of 5.1% in 2023. As total loans declined while total deposits grew, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio decreased to 57.0% at the end of 2024 from 62.8% a year before (Chart 10).

# Capital adequacy

The banking sector remained well capitalised in 2024. The consolidated total capital ratio of locally incorporated authorized institutions (AIs) stood at 21.8% at the end of 2024, compared with 21.1% a year before. The Tier 1 capital ratio was 19.9% (Chart 11). Both ratios were well above their respective international minimum requirements. The Basel III leverage ratio was 8.0% at the end of 2024 (Chart 12).

# Liquidity conditions

The banking sector maintained a strong liquidity position. The quarterly average Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) of category 1 institutions was 178.4% in the fourth quarter of 2024, and the quarterly average Liquidity Maintenance Ratio (LMR) of category 2 institutions was 67.0% (Chart 13). Customer deposits remained the main source of funding for the banking sector. The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) of category 1 institutions and the Core Funding Ratio (CFR) of category 2A institutions were 143.4% and 186.7% at the end of 2024 respectively (Chart 14). All four ratios were well above the statutory minimum requirements.

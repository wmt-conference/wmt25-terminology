# International Financial Centre

In 2024, the HKMA made notable progress in strengthening Hong Kong’s position as a globally competitive international financial centre.

Together with its Mainland and Hong Kong counterparts, the HKMA launched a range of initiatives to deepen and widen mutual access between the financial markets of Hong Kong and the Mainland. These included enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Scheme in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area; expansion of the scope of eligible collateral for the HKMA’s RMB Liquidity Facility and Northbound Swap Connect; refinements to the Northbound Trading of Swap Connect; and enhancements to the Primary Liquidity Providers scheme. These initiatives underpinned Hong Kong’s gateway position and reinforced the city’s status as a global hub for offshore renminbi business.

The HKMA also made headway in reinforcing the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform in such areas as bond issuance, asset and wealth management, green and sustainable finance, and corporate treasury centres. To promote Hong Kong’s financial services, the HKMA stepped up its market outreach activities to overseas and Mainland stakeholders, keeping them well informed about the opportunities in Hong Kong’s financial market and its resilience. The success of the third Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit and various other events helped burnish Hong Kong’s image as a leading international financial centre and created positive ripple effects. As an active member of many international and regional central banking and regulatory forums, the HKMA continued to contribute to global efforts to maintain financial stabilit and promote financial market developments.

Significant progress was made on all fronts of the HKMA’s “Fintech 2025” strategy, notably in areas such as Central Bank Digital Currency and data infrastructure.

The number of registrations and turnover for the Faster Payment System continued to grow steadily, with 15.8 million registrations reached by the end of 2024 and the average daily number of Hong Kong dollar real-time transactions for the year rising to 1.65 million. The HKMA is working closely with the People’s Bank of China to push forward a linkage between Hong Kong’s Faster Payment System and Mainland’s Internet Banking Payment System to support cross-boundary payments.

# Overview

Throughout 2024, the HKMA maintained its efforts to strengthen Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre.

Various expansions and enhancements to the Mainland-Hong Kong Connect schemes were introduced, reinforcing the city’s role as a bridge between the Mainland and international financial markets. During the year, enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) scheme were introduced to facilitate cross-boundary retail investment in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA). In February, the HKMA expanded the list of eligible collateral for the RMB Liquidity Facility to include onshore bonds issued by the Ministry of Finance of the People’s Republic of China (CMOF) and policy banks on the Mainland. Relevant authorities in Hong Kong and the Mainland announced further support for offshore investors to use onshore bonds held under Bond Connect as margin collateral for Northbound Swap Connect transactions in July and implemented the measure in January 2025. Furthermore, Northbound Trading of Swap Connect was enhanced in the year, providing investors with more flexibility and efficiency in their hedging strategies and portfolio management.

Hong Kong’s offshore renminbi businesses saw robust growth during 2024. The HKMA made enhancements to the Primary Liquidity Providers (PLP) scheme by increasing the number of PLPs and the size of the scheme. Towards the end of the year, the night-time cross-boundary service capability of Hong Kong’s renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS) was enhanced to better support cross-border renminbi payment needs around the world.

Facilitative measures to aid businesses and Hong Kong residents under GBA financial co-operation were implemented, including the pilot cases for cross-boundary credit referencing initiative for corporates’ cross-boundary financing activities and remittance arrangements for Hong Kong residents’ property purchases in the GBA.

The HKMA continued its efforts to enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s broader financial platform. Specifically, to raise Hong Kong’s appeal as a preferred fund management centre and family office hub, we worked closely with the Government and the financial industry to provide a more facilitative tax and regulatory environment. In addition, we continued to promote innovation in Hong Kong’s bond market through a second tokenised bond issuance under Project Evergreen, the introduction of EvergreenHub, a one-stop digital bond knowledge repository, and a grant scheme for digital bond issuances. In October, we launched the Sustainable Finance Action Agenda, which set out concrete goals to further consolidate Hong Kong’s position as a regional hub for green and sustainable finance.

Meanwhile, we continued our market outreach activities to promote Hong Kong’s financial services to overseas and Mainland stakeholders. In November, we organised the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit for the third year. This three-day event brought together prominent financial leaders from around the world to share their unique perspectives under the theme of “Sailing through Changes”. The Summit commenced with a keynote address by Mr He Lifeng, Vice Premier of the State Council, followed by a session with the three Mainland financial regulators and panel discussions featuring leaders in global finance. With over 350 participants from more than 120 international financial institutions, the Summit demonstrated the global financial sector’s commitment to and confidence in Hong Kong.

The HKMA also hosted a number of other conferences and meetings during the year, including:

- the HKMA-Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) Joint Climate Finance Conference in September;
- the 15th Global Risk Forum co-hosted by the HKMA and the Global Association of Risk Professionals in October;
- the HKMA-Bank for International Settlements (BIS) International Financial Conference, also in October; and
- the Financial Stability Board (FSB) Plenary Meeting in December, which was the first such gathering held in Asia since 2016, bringing together over 50 leaders and senior officials from national financial authorities and 12 international standards-setting bodies.

During the year, the HKMA also proactively strengthened bilateral connections with other jurisdictions. In December, we held bilateral meetings with the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates (CBUAE) and the Saudi Central Bank (SAMA) in Hong Kong to promote investment and financial market connectivity between the Middle East and Asia. A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed with the CBUAE to develop connectivity between our bond market infrastructures and facilitate cross-border debt securities issuance and investment activities in the two markets. Earlier, the HKMA visited Doha, Qatar, in October to enhance collaboration between the financial services sectors of the two jurisdictions.

Additionally, the HKMA hosted the seventh Hong KongSwitzerland Financial Dialogue in December. The discussion covered topics on regional and domestic outlook and policy challenges, as well as latest developments and potential collaboration in the areas of sustainable finance, financial technology (fintech) and market connectivity.

In addition, the HKMA visited Thailand in January and Malaysia in May to meet with central banks, financial institutions and corporates to promote Hong Kong’s position as an international financial centre and further strengthen bilateral financial linkages and collaboration. One focus area was the broader use of renminbi and local currencies for cross-border investment and trade settlements along with Hong Kong’s value propositions.

Internationally, the HKMA has remained an active member of the central banking community and continued to play a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees. Currently, it co-chairs the Policy and Standards Group of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), as well as the FSB Regional Consultative Group for Asia, and it co-chaired the Financial Innovation Network of the FSB (until July 2024). The HKMA also chairs the BIS Meeting of Governors from Major Emerging Market Economies (EMEs) and the FSB Crypto Framework peer review team. Between 2018 and 2024, the HKMA served consecutive terms as the chair of the Working Group on Financial Markets established under the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP).

Both the Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO) and the banking departments of the HKMA continued to implement the “Fintech 2025” strategy to promote wide adoption of fintech and strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia. Key initiatives implemented during the year included:

- promoting further fintech adoption by banks in five focus areas, including Wealthtech, Insurtech, Greentech, artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology (DLT);
- advancing work on Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) to understand their benefits and potential applications, including:
    - advancing the Multiple CBDC Bridge (mBridge) to improve cross-border payments;
    - furthering Hong Kong’s study of the prospects of issuing an e-HKD, and
    - commencing the exploration of CBDC to support tokenisation market development in Hong Kong;
- facilitating lending to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) through Commercial Data Interchange (CDI);
- strengthening cross-border collaboration in fintech; and
- expanding adoption of the Faster Payment System (FPS).

Adoption of the FPS continued to expand in 2024, with its number of registrations and turnover having grown steadily over the past six years. By the end of 2024, the number of registrations had reached 15.8 million, while the average daily number of transactions in 2024 rose 33% from the previous year. Key drivers for the continued rise in transaction volume included increased use of the FPS for settling Government bills, making merchant payments and topping up Stored Value Facility (SVF) e-wallets or bank accounts, in addition to steady growth in person-to-person and business payments.

To ensure the safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA oversees six designated retail payment systems (RPSs) and supervises 15 licensed SVFs (four of which are SVFs issued by licensed banks) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO). During the year, we continued to work closely with the industry to step up controls and customer protection against rising fraud risks.

Following a two-month public consultation ending in February on legislative proposals to implement a regulatory regime for stablecoin issuers in Hong Kong, the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau and the HKMA jointly published the conclusions in July. The Stablecoins Bill was subsequently introduced into the Legislative Council in December. To better understand the business models of stablecoin issuers and formulate a fit-for-purpose regulatory regime, we also launched a Stablecoin Issuer Sandbox and admitted three participants in July. At the same time, we continued our active participation in the work of international bodies on digital asset-related topics including stablecoins and tokenisation, with a view to ensuring alignment of the relevant regulatory frameworks with global standards and best practices.

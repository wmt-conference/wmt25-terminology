# Priorities for 2025 and Beyond

The global outlook for 2025 remains unclear, with considerable uncertainty surrounding the US economic and trade policies alongside upside risks to US inflation, leading to concerns about the future path of the US policy rate. Meanwhile, economic stimulus measures announced and being rolled out in Mainland China have led to improved sentiment both in the Mainland and in Hong Kong, while inbound tourism should improve further on the back of various tourism-related supportive measures by the Government. Hong Kong’s financial system remains well-positioned to withstand adverse shocks given its sound resilience and ample buffers built up over the years.

The HKMA will continue to play its part in promoting the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s financial system and infrastructure. We will remain vigilant regarding the uncertain macroeconomic environment, seeking to promptly identify emerging risks and respond to them in an agile manner. Meanwhile, we will actively seek opportunities and create policy headroom to further enhance Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre. In managing the Exchange Fund, we will continue to invest with prudence and flexibility, implement appropriate defensive measures, and maintain a high degree of liquidity. We will also continue to diversify our investments to strive for higher long-term returns, ensuring that the Exchange Fund remains effective in achieving its purpose of maintaining monetary and financial stability of Hong Kong.

# Stability and integrity of the financial system

Global uncertainties are expected to persist in 2025, driven largely by new and uncharted policy directions under the new US administration and the resulting geoeconomic fragmentation. With the responsibility of promoting the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s financial system, the HKMA will remain vigilant against potential risks, ensuring that it stays at the forefront of latest developments and is ready to act in support of the Hong Kong economy when necessary.

# Staying vigilant against potential risks

Looking ahead to 2025, uncertainties surrounding the macroeconomic environment may create volatility in global financial markets. Nevertheless, Hong Kong’s financial system is well-positioned to withstand adverse shocks, given its resilience and the buffers built up over the years. The HKMA also has the capability, resources and commitment to safeguard Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.

The HKMA will continue to closely monitor risks and vulnerabilities in the domestic and external environments, and deploy appropriate measures where necessary to maintain Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. We will also carry out research into issues affecting the Hong Kong economy and assess the potential risks associated with these issues.

# Maintaining banking stability

The uncertainty surrounding the macroeconomic environment is likely to present challenges to the banking sector. At the same time, ongoing digitalisation advances and the adoption of innovative technology, such as generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), while bringing many benefits, are also introducing new operational and technological risks to banks. Against this backdrop, the HKMA will strive to further enhance banks’ ability to withstand various shocks by providing policy and practical guidance, as well as undertaking ongoing supervisory engagement with individual banks and the sector as a whole. In parallel, we will continue to strengthen and adapt our banking regulatory frameworks and supervisory approaches, taking into account technological developments, changes in customer expectations, and international standards and best practices.

# A risk-based supervisory focus

# Credit, liquidity and market risks

Amid pressures on the credit landscape, the HKMA will continue to focus on monitoring the asset quality of authorized institutions (AIs) and assessing the effectiveness of their credit risk management practices, particularly with respect to loan classification and provisioning as well as problem loans management. Meanwhile, we will maintain close communication with the banking and commercial sectors and encourage AIs to continue supporting the real economy under the overarching principle of prudent risk management.

The HKMA will continue to take a proactive approach to supervising the market risk management of AIs, amid heightened volatilities in global financial markets stemming from the uncertain interest rate outlook in major advanced economies and elevated geopolitical tensions. In light of the uncertain macroeconomic environment, as well as the growing digitalisation of banking services, we will also review how AIs manage liquidity risk with a view to enhancing their capabilities in handling abrupt fund flows.

# Operational and technology risk

The HKMA will continue its work in enhancing the overall operational resilience of the banking sector by reviewing banks’ progress in identifying and remediating vulnerabilities in delivering their critical operations as part of the implementation of their operational resilience frameworks.

Given the growing dependence of the banking industry on third-party service providers, the HKMA will further strengthen banks’ management of third-party risks by developing new guidance for implementing the international standards set out by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee).

On cyber resilience, the HKMA will assess systemic cyber risks through the cross-sectoral Cyber Mapping exercise together with other domestic financial authorities as recommended by the International Monetary Fund. Additionally, we will drive banks to enhance their ability to recover critical operations in the face of severe cyber incidents by reviewing their implementation of secure tertiary data backup arrangements and introducing a cyber resilience testing framework.

While we are seeing the benefits from the banking industry’s wider adoption of advanced technologies such as GenAI, we will remain vigilant to emerging risks and provide guidance relating to the use of these technologies as appropriate.

We will also strengthen banks’ capabilities in combatting digital fraud and countering evolving fraud tactics through agile and pre-emptive collaboration with the industry and relevant stakeholders.

# Combatting money laundering and terrorist financing

In 2025, the HKMA will introduce system reforms, innovations and other initiatives to enhance the overall resilience of Hong Kong’s anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism ecosystem, reduce threats from illicit fund flows, and keep pace with the latest international standards and best practices.

As part of collaborative efforts across the Government to deepen understanding of potential weak spots created by technological advances, we will help develop the third comprehensive assessment of money laundering and terrorist financing risk in Hong Kong, and use the insights gained from it to develop effective, proportionate guidance to support the implementation of the new regulatory regime for stablecoin issuers.

We will continue our efforts to champion and promote the responsible use of technology, including artificial intelligence, where it can deliver public value. This will include strengthening the monitoring of suspicious activity to enable banks to identify and interdict more fraud and mule accounts, thereby further increasing the amount of high quality, actionable intelligence shared with law-enforcement bodies.

To strengthen our efforts to combat fraud and other financial crimes, we will propose the legislative changes needed to create essential gateways and safeguards relating to bank-to-bank information sharing on personal accounts. To improve the speed and volume in detecting illicit flows, we will commence work on an analytics platform for payments data.

# Wealth management and Mandatory Provident Fund-related businesses

In 2025, the HKMA will carry out both on-site examinations and off-site surveillance of the conduct of AIs in relation to securities, investment products, trust, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses. We will specifically focus on high-yield complex products, digital assets (DA) and related investment products, Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) business, digital distribution and advisory platforms, long term insurance products, and premium financing activities, while taking into account the latest market developments and evolving international standards.

The HKMA will also communicate closely with fellow regulators and the banking industry to provide guidance on regulatory standards in relation to the sale of securities, investment, insurance, and MPF products as appropriate. In particular, to support the sustainable and responsible development of the DA sector, we will continue to work with the Government and fellow regulators to ensure that the regulatory regime in place for the DA sector is robust, comprehensive, and well-balanced.

In addition, the HKMA will facilitate and monitor the industry’s implementation of enhancements to the Cross-boundary WMC, and continue to engage with the industry and relevant regulatory authorities in efforts to further enhance the scheme and other cross-boundary banking initiatives.

We will also consolidate and clarify existing guidance on wealth management and MPF-related businesses, as appropriate, in order to further improve the accessibility of the HKMA’s regulatory requirements and facilitate compliance by the industry.

# Policy development

# Implementation of Basel standards in Hong Kong

The Basel III Final Reform Package came into effect in Hong Kong on 1 January 2025. The HKMA will provide AIs with ongoing guidance and clarification on common interpretative issues relating to the Final Reform Package to ensure its consistent adoption within the industry.

In December 2022, the Basel Committee introduced a new standard for the prudential treatment of banks’ cryptoasset exposures. This was followed by targeted amendments in July 2024 to provide further clarity on the criteria for stablecoins to receive preferential regulatory treatment. Concurrently, the Basel Committee also published a document entitled Disclosure of cryptoasset exposures, which set out updated disclosure requirements for cryptoasset exposures. To implement these standards in Hong Kong, the HKMA will work on potential legislative amendments to various sets of rules, including the Banking (Capital) Rules, the Banking (Disclosure) Rules, the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules (BELR), and the Banking (Liquidity) Rules. The HKMA will also propose certain refinements to the BELR based on implementation experience and industry feedback. A statutory consultation on the amendments will be conducted in the first half of 2025, with the aim of implementing the new standards by 1 January 2026, in accordance with the Basel timeline. The HKMA will prepare the relevant banking returns and supporting guidance to facilitate banks’ implementation of the new standards.

# Other supervisory policies and risk management guidelines

To stay abreast of the latest international standards, supervisory practices and developments in the industry, the HKMA plans to update certain Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) modules. These include CA-G-5 on “Supervisory Review Process”, CA-B-2 on “Systemically Important Banks”, IC-5 on “Stress-testing”, IR-1 on “Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book”, and IC-3 on “Reporting Requirements Relating to Authorized Institutions’ External Auditors under the Banking Ordinance”. The SPM module CR-G-13 on “Counterparty Credit Risk Management” will be revised to reflect the sound practices introduced by the “Guidelines for counterparty credit risk management” issued by the Basel Committee in December 2024.

# Basel Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision

The Basel Committee published the revised Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision (BCP) in April 2024. The revised BCP reflects supervisory and regulatory developments since the last revision in 2012, as well as the impact of recent structural trends on banks and banking systems. In 2025, the HKMA will conduct a detailed self-assessment to ensure that its regulatory and supervisory frameworks comply with the revised BCP.

# Accounting standards

The International Accounting Standards Board plans to issue an Exposure Draft on Dynamic Risk Management (DRM) in 2025. The HKMA will collaborate with other relevant authorities to consider the implications of the proposed DRM accounting model on existing prudential requirements.

# Enforcement

During 2024, the HKMA carried out a consultation with the banking industry on proposals to expand the investigation and enforcement powers of the Monetary Authority, ensuring the availability of necessary powers to effectively perform the functions under the Banking Ordinance. Having taken into account feedback received from the consultation, the HKMA will refine its proposals and develop the necessary legislative amendments for further consultation with various stakeholders.

# Resolution

The HKMA is continuing its multi-year programme to build an operational resolution regime for AIs. For 2025, we will prioritise the following areas (Table 1).

Table 1 Forward priorities on resolution in 2025

# Resolution policy and standards

- Consult and finalise the Code of Practice chapters on the HKMA’s approach to valuations in resolution, as well as the ex-ante capabilities and arrangements that an AI should put in place to support timely and robust resolution valuations
- Advance the development of policy standards for resolution restructuring

# International and cross-border co-operation

- Contribute to international resolution policy developments and their effective implementation, particularly the 12 initiatives on resolution reform planned for 2025 by the Financial Stability Board, through its Resolution Steering Group and sub-groups

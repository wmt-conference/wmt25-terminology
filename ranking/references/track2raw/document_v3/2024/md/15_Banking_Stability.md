# Banking Stability

The banking sector in Hong Kong remained resilient in 2024, despite macroeconomic challenges and geopolitical uncertainties. The HKMA took prompt measures to support local small and medium-sized enterprises and safeguarded banking stability through risk-based supervision and contingency planning. We enhanced the banking sector’s operational and cyber resilience by providing supervisory guidance and supporting the industry in combating emerging risks. To encourage fintech adoption, we launched a series of cross-sectoral initiatives, including a Generative Artificial Intelligence Sandbox.

To strengthen bank consumer protection, the HKMA launched the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter 2.0. We also introduced Money Safe to empower depositors to protect their funds, and cooling-off period for banks’ unsecured consumer credit products to reduce the risk of impulsive and excessive borrowing. Additionally, we provided guidance to banks on the use of generative artificial intelligence in customer-facing applications, and worked closely with the industry on an alternative Payment Arrangements for Property Transactions in the secondary market. The HKMA also enhanced customer experience while ensuring investor protection by providing guidance on digital asset-related activities, implementing enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Pilot Scheme, and streamlining processes for the sale of investment and insurance products. Full migration of consumer credit reference services to Credit Data Smart was completed during the year.

The HKMA plays a pivotal role in Hong Kong’s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist-financing regime. By enhancing the speed and volume of intelligence exchanged through the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce, intelligence-led suspicious transaction reporting increased b 303% compared with 2023, resulting in a 34% increase in criminal proceeds restrained or confiscated. Consultation on legislative changes to support bank-to-bank information sharing in order to aid in detecting and preventing financial crime received general support. In April, we provided guidance based on findings from a thematic review of transaction monitoring systems, and in September, we launched a programme to promote the use of artificial intelligence in suspicious activity monitoring. We also enhanced the pre-transaction alert mechanism and publicity efforts in collaboration with the banking industry and the Hong Kong Police Force, and issued guidance to banks on measures to prevent, detect and disrupt authorized payment scams.

Good progress was made on implementing international supervisory standards locally, including those on capital adequacy and disclosure. The Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board strengthened depositor protection by enhancing various aspects of the Deposit Protection Scheme.

To ensure a credible resolution regime, the HKMA implemented resolution standards requiring banks to update their financial contracts with counterparties to mitigate the risk of disorderly early termination in resolution. Notable progress was made in devising preferred resolution strategies for banks, addressing resolvability barriers to ensure sufficient financial resources and operational continuity in resolution, as well as enhancing resolution execution capabilities.

# Objectives

One of the HKMA’s objectives is to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this objective is contingent upon a highly resilient financial system, capable of providing the critical financial services that the Hong Kong economy needs.

Banks can affect the stability of the financial system through the way they carry out their businesses and, in extreme cases, if they fail in a disorderly manner. As a supervisory authority, the Monetary Authority plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring that banks are resilient to shocks and crises, ultimately helping to prevent failures. The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks and is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs).

Hong Kong’s prudential regulatory framework is not designed to ensure a zero-risk financial system. Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that in the event of an AI becoming non-viable, its failure can be managed in an orderly manner. To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong has been established under which the Monetary Authority serves as the resolution authority for AIs. To implement the resolution regime in Hong Kong, it is important to lay down resolution rules and policy standards, undertake resolution planning to remove impediments to AIs’ resolvability, and develop the HKMA’s operational capability to resolve a failing AI. In order to carry out these tasks effectively, we adopt an internationally harmonised and co-ordinated approach.

The Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs). In overseeing FMIs, the HKMA aims to promote their general safety and efficiency, mitigate systemic risk and foster transparency. By enhancing the resilience of FMIs to financial crises, we can safeguard Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems against any destabilising effects arising from disruption to the FMIs.

# Review of 2024

# Licensing

During the year, the HKMA granted banking licences to one bank incorporated in Hong Kong and one incorporated outside Hong Kong. The HKMA also granted money broker approval to one inter-dealer broker outside Hong Kong. The authorizations of three licensed banks, one restricted licence bank and one deposit-taking company were revoked during the year.

More information about the AIs and local representative offices in Hong Kong can be found in the Annex and Tables D to F on pages 311 to 314 and 320 to 323 respectively.

# Review of the three-tier banking system

During 2024, the HKMA completed a public consultation exercise on simplifying the three-tier banking system into two tiers. Feedback from the respondents showed that they were broadly supportive of the proposed simplification. Having considered the responses received, we introduced new parameters to the proposal with a view to streamlining the transition and minimising the impact on existing customers of the deposit-taking companies.

# Renaming of “Virtual Bank”

The HKMA also carried out a public consultation on the renaming of “Virtual Bank” as “Digital Bank”. With broad support received for the renaming proposal, it was put into effect in October by the issuance of a revised statutory Guideline on Authorization of Digital Banks.

# Review of digital banks

Another initiative completed in 2024 was a comprehensive review of digital banks (DBs), with a report published in August. It revealed that the development of DBs in Hong Kong had so far achieved the three key policy objectives of introducing digital banking, namely promoting fintech and innovation, offering new customer experience, and promoting financial inclusion. Given the diversity of DBs and incumbent banks, the HKMA considers that the current number of digital banking licences is optimal and does not see any strong justification for introducing more new players to the market at this juncture. The revised Guideline on Authorization of Digital Banks issued in October has relaxed several restrictions for the sector, including allowing DBs to engage in banking business beyond retail banking, and to establish physical branches where justified from customer experience and business strategy’s perspectives, provided that they continue to offer banking services primarily via digital channels.

# Review of bank licence fees

The HKMA completed a review of licence fees during the year and introduced a fee level increase in June.

# Company re-domiciliation regime in Hong Kong

The HKMA provided support to the Government for introducing a company re-domiciliation regime in Hong Kong, including the legislative process to amend the Banking Ordinance (BO) and its subsidiary legislation, along with other legislation pertaining to the HKMA.

# Overview of supervisory activities

During the year, HKMA staff conducted 174 off-site reviews covering a broad range of issues, including the CAMEL rating assessment, corporate governance and risk management. As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance, 36 meetings were held with boards of directors, independent non-executive directors or board-level committees of AIs. Another 38 tripartite meetings were held between the HKMA, AIs and their external auditors. In addition, we conducted on-site examinations on a wide range of AIs’ activities including governance and practices in the areas of credit, market and liquidity risk management.

Operational and technology risk was another major supervisory focus given that the adoption of technology by AIs gathered further momentum. The HKMA further strengthened the supervision of AIs’ climate risk management to enhance their resilience against climate change. In recognition of the HKMA’s work, including the maintenance of financial stability amid global economic uncertainties and the promotion of robust economic growth, the HKMA was honoured with the Best Macroeconomic Regulator in Asia Pacific award by The Asian Banker.

In the area of conduct supervision, the HKMA carried out on-site examinations on securities, investment products, trust, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses, as well as consumer protection matters. These efforts were supplemented with our thematic reviews on new initiatives and areas assessed to be of higher risk.

Table 1 contains a summary of the HKMA’s supervisory activities in 2024.

a. Additional supervisory activities focused on operational resilience included an HKMA survey and AIs’ self-assessment exercises to take stock of implementation progress and identify enhancement areas, as well as extensive outreach at both the bilateral and industry levels on framework development and practices.
b. In addition, supervisory activities focused on evaluations of AIs’ strategies and practices related to the granting of credit and the ongoing risk management of selected portfolios such as commercial real estate and small and medium-sized enterprise lending.
c. Including consultative sessions with AIs to review their implementation of the HKMA’s Supervisory Policy Manual module GS-1 on “Climate Risk Management”.

# Credit risk

# Credit growth and asset quality

Total loans decreased by 2.8% in 2024, compared with a decline of 3.6% in 2023. Table 2 shows the breakdown of growth in loans and advances. Mainland-related lending decreased by 8.7% to HK$3,859 billion in 2024 (Table 3).

The HKMA continued to closely monitor AIs’ asset quality in 2024 and assess their credit risk management practices given the continued high interest rate environment, the ongoing debt problems of some Mainland property developers, and the subdued local commercial real estate market. The asset quality of the banking sector faced continued pressure during the year but the risk landscape remained manageable. The classified loan ratio of the banking sector increased from 1.57% at the end of 2023 to 1.96% at the end of 2024, while the classified loan ratio for Mainland-related lending decreased to 2.38% from 2.58% during the same period.

During the year, the HKMA conducted targeted and thematic examinations to evaluate the credit risk management of AIs, focusing on their exposures to vulnerable sectors, collateralised lending to private banking and wealth management customers, unsecured retail lending, oversight of credit risks at operations outside Hong Kong, and exposures to non-bank financial institutions.

# Alleviating cash flow pressure faced by bank customers

# Support for local small and mediumsized enterprises

Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are the bedrock of the Hong Kong economy and the HKMA has been paying close attention to their access to bank financing. Since the establishment of the Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism by the HKMA and the banking sector in 2019, several rounds of SME support measures have been rolled out, including the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme to tide SMEs over the difficult times during COVID-19.

In 2024, the HKMA and the banking sector introduced further measures and initiatives to support SMEs that are still facing challenges in their business operations as the economic transformation continues, as well as to assist SMEs in their continued development, upgrading and transformation.

# New SME support measures

Through the Coordination Mechanism, the HKMA introduced nine measures in March to help SMEs obtain financing from banks and support their ongoing development.

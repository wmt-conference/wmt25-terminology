# Corporate Social Responsibility

The HKMA is committed to fulfilling its corporate social responsibility, and aims to be a responsible and sustainable organisation. This commitment is manifested in various areas, including promoting a sustainable and environment-friendly marketplace, supporting the wider community, protecting the environment and nurturing a caring workplace.

# MARKETPLACE

# Green and sustainable banking

Climate change is one of the major risks threatening the well-being of mankind and the sustainability of the world economy. The financial sector in which banks operate, being an integral part of the society, will also be impacted and hence should be more proactive in managing climate risks. The HKMA is committed to exploring ways to address this challenge. Against this background, the HKMA unveiled in May a number of measures for promoting the development of green finance in Hong Kong, including the adoption of a three-phased approach to promote green and sustainable banking.

# Responsible investment

As the investment manager of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA believes that the concept of responsible investment (RI) is highly relevant to its investment work. As the HKMA is one of the world’s largest asset owners, it will have a major impact on how fund managers pick assets.

# Our Beliefs

The HKMA sees RI as an investment approach that takes into account the impact of various environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors on long-term investment returns and their sustainability. The HKMA believes that, by putting an appropriate emphasis on RI and sustainable long-term economic performance, it can better achieve the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund and reduce risks associated with the ESG-related matters of its underlying investments.

# Our Principles

The HKMA’s guiding principle is that priority will generally be given to ESG investments if the long-term risk-adjusted return is comparable with other investments. Where appropriate, the HKMA adopts in its investment process the following RI principles that underpin its beliefs as a responsible long-term investor:

# Integration

The HKMA incorporates ESG factors into its investment analysis processes to identify risks and opportunities, as it believes that these factors can materially affect the long-term value of its investments. Specifically, the HKMA has been integrating ESG factors into its investment process for both public and private market investments. For public market investments, the HKMA incorporates ESG factors in its credit risk analysis of bond investment. External managers that share the HKMA’s RI beliefs are selected and appointed. The HKMA communicates its RI beliefs to all its external managers and expects them to align in such a way that the overall sustainable long-term economic performance target is attainable. For private market investments, the ESG policies and practices of the HKMA’s general partners are examined as part of its due diligence process.

# Active ownership

The HKMA exercises shareholder rights in its public equity holding in a manner that helps safeguard the long-term value of its investments. The HKMA believes that responsible corporate behaviour guided by ESG factors will help create shareholder value in the long term. The HKMA’s asset managers are expected to help the HKMA discharge its ownership responsibilities in the underlying investments by adopting active ownership through exercising voting rights and engaging with the corporates concerned.

# Collaboration

The HKMA seeks to join hands with like-minded investors and regulators to promote good practices for the long-term management of investments. It participates in and speaks at public events to share views and encourage the investment community to adopt RI.

See the Reserves Management chapter for more details about the HKMA’s work on RI during the year.

# Promoting financial inclusion

The HKMA attaches great importance to financial inclusion and has been making significant effort in promoting access to basic banking services by different segments of the society to meet the basic daily needs of the general public and the operational needs of legitimate businesses. In particular, the HKMA has been working closely with the banking industry on the following priority areas:

- Encouraging banks to launch more physical banking facilities and develop digital and innovative channels for the delivery of basic banking services to serve the general public, particularly residents of remote areas and public housing estates, and the elderly;

- Facilitating and monitoring the accessibility of bank accounts to individuals and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs);

- Enhancing the accessibility of banking services to specific customer groups, for example, customers with disabilities and ethnic minorities;

- Facilitating and monitoring the accessibility of bank credit to SMEs; and

- Granting authorization to eight virtual banks, which will play an active role in promoting financial inclusion in delivering their banking services.

# COMMUNITY

# Promoting financial literacy

The HKMA promotes financial literacy through various channels. Apart from running educational programmes to promote smart and responsible use of banking and financial services by the public, the HKMA features on its revamped official website a new dedicated section on “Smart Consumers”, where the public can find useful information and smart tips on a wide range of banking and related products and services. Social media platforms such as Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube, Instagram and Twitter are used in addition to the HKMA official website and publications to provide up-to-date information on banking and financial affairs.

The HKMA Information Centre, serving as the HKMA’s major public education and research resource since 2003, introduces the work of the HKMA to the community and promotes public awareness of monetary and banking matters. Educational guided tours are offered daily for group visitors from schools and non-profit making organisations. public education seminars and other activities are also organised for students to enhance their financial knowledge and literacy. In addition, the HKMA works closely with the Investor and Financial Education Council to promote financial literacy in Hong Kong via its financial education platform, The Chin Family.

See the Corporate Functions chapter for more details about the HKMA’s work on promoting financial literacy during the year. See the Banking Stability chapter for more details about the HKMA’s work on promoting financial inclusion during the year.

# Addressing the needs of special groups 

# Accessibility of Hong Kong banknotes

The 2018 Series of Banknotes retains accessibility features used in the previous series of banknotes to help the visually impaired differentiate between the denominations. These accessibility features include Braille, tactile lines and high-tactility numerals.

To help the visually impaired differentiate between the denomination of the banknotes, a mobile app, sponsored by the HKMA and developed by the Hong Kong Society for the Blind, uses the phone’s camera to scan the banknote patterns for the denomination. The app is available for download from Apple App Store and Google play Store for free. A note-measuring template sponsored by the HKMA and the three note-issuing banks has also been introduced to measure the length of the note. It can measure both the 2018 Series and the notes currently in circulation. The template is embossed with Braille on one side and symbols on the other. It is freely distributed at voluntary agencies serving the visually impaired community.

# Coin Collection Programme

Under the Coin Collection programme, the HKMA collaborates with the Hong Kong Council of Social Service to deploy the Coin Carts to collect coins on flag days for non-governmental organisations.

# Accessibility of public information

The revamped HKMA official website was launched in September. The revamped website has enhanced navigation structure to facilitate easy and convenient search by users based on their own preferences. In particular, the website contains a dedicated webpage “Information in Other Languages” under the “Smart Consumers” section, which provides useful information on banking services in seven languages commonly used by the ethnic minority community, namely Bahasa Indonesia, Hindi, Nepali, Punjabi, Tagalog, Thai and Urdu.

The HKMA is committed to ensuring that its website conforms to the maximum extent possible to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 Level AA standard, to facilitate barrier-free access to its online information by people with special needs.

# volunteer and charitable activities

The HKMA supports community services by taking part in volunteer and charitable activities. The Senior Citizen Home Safety Association awarded the Community Engagement Crystal Award to the HKMA for participating in the 2018 Love & Peace of Mind Corporate Engagement Programme.

To cater for projected operational needs, the HKMA renovated the offices during the year to create an open layout, increase capacity and allow for more efficient use of space. Breakout areas and ergonomic furniture are part of the new office design. To enhance the staff’s physical health, height-adjustable desks were offered to staff members, allowing them to change their postures easily throughout the day between sitting and standing.

Height-adjustable desks improve office ergonomics.

The HKMA promotes work-life balance and cares about the health and work safety of the staff. Regular talks on healthy lifestyles, stress management and workplace safety are organised and indoor air quality is monitored. Annual on-site medical check-ups and flu vaccinations are arranged. The HKMA also sponsors a professional counselling service comprising experienced psychologists and social workers.

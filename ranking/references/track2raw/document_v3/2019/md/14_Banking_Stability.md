# Banking Stability

The banking sector in Hong Kong remained sound and stable in 2019, notwithstanding the headwinds brought by the weakening global and local economies. Thanks to the concerted efforts of the industry, the banking sector continued to operate normally amidst the social events. Efforts were taken to ensure that inconvenience caused to the public was kept to a minimum. During the year, the HKMA focused its supervision on the credit and liquidity risk management of authorized institutions. In view of escalating cyber threats and the industry’s growing dependency on technology, the HKMA stepped up the supervision of authorized institutions’ technology risk management. On conduct supervision, the HKMA streamlined its investor protection measures to enhance customer experience while according protection to customers. We also enhanced consumer protection in digital financial services and continued to promote a customer-centric corporate culture.

On anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT), 2019 marked the conclusion of the Financial Action Task Force’s Fourth Round Mutual Evaluation of Hong Kong’s AML/CFT regime, which was assessed as compliant and effective overall, and earned positive recognition particularly for the banking sector’s good understanding of risks and the HKMA’s risk-based supervisory work in AML/CFT. The HKMA has continued to participate in the public-private partnership for intelligence sharing on fraud and money laundering, and its active support for the adoption of AML/CFT regulatory technology in the banking sector.

On banking development, the HKMA granted banking licences to eight virtual banks in 2019 and announced a three-phased approach to facilitate the development of green and sustainable banking in Hong Kong. The HKMA has been in close collaboration with the banking industry to optimise supervisory policies and processes and to carry out capacity-building initiatives that facilitate talent development.

Meanwhile, substantial progress was made on the local implementation of international supervisory standards, including capital adequacy standards, disclosure standards, liquidity standards and large exposure standards. The HKMA also continued its work to ensure there would be a credible resolution regime for authorized institutions, including implementing rules on loss-absorbing capacity requirements to enhance the resolvability of authorized institutions.

# OBJECTIVES

The HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this objective is contingent upon the financial system being highly resilient and capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.

Banks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their businesses and, in extremis, by failing in a disorderly manner. The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring banks are resilient to shocks and are able to recover their positions in response to crises, ultimately helping to prevent failures. The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks in Hong Kong. It is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs). The Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs).

However, the Monetary Authority cannot ensure, nor is the Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework designed to ensure, a zero-risk financial system. Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that, in the event of an AI becoming non-viable, its failure can be managed in an orderly manner. To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong has been established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs. To ensure that the resolution regime in Hong Kong is operational, it is important to lay down resolution legislation and policy standards, undertake resolution planning to remove impediments to AIs’ resolvability and develop the HKMA’s operational capability to resolve a failing AI. In order to carry out these tasks effectively, the HKMA adopts an internationally harmonised and co-ordinated approach.

# REVIEW OF 2019

# Overview of supervisory activities

In 2019, 196 off-site reviews were conducted covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL rating assessment, corporate governance, risk management and fintech strategies. As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance, 26 meetings were held with the boards of directors or board-level committees of AIs. Furthermore, 32 tripartite meetings were held among the HKMA, the AIs and their external auditors.

Apart from off-site activities, the HKMA conducts regular on-site examinations supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk. A total of 405 on-site examinations and thematic reviews were conducted during the year. Credit risk management remained a key focus of these examinations and reviews. Another major focus was in technology risk and operational risk management. The HKMA also increased the number of on-site examinations and thematic reviews targeted at liquidity and market risk management as well as the implementation of the Basel capital adequacy framework. At the same time, specialist teams performed on-site examinations and thematic reviews of AIs’ activities in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses.

Table 1 contains an overall summary of the HKMA’s supervisory activities in 2019.

# Supervision of credit risk

# Credit growth and asset quality

Bank lending increased moderately in 2019. Total loans grew by 6.7%, compared with 4.4% in 2018. As shown in Table 2, loans for use in Hong Kong and loans for use outside Hong Kong registered growth of 7.7% and 5.8% respectively.

Mainland-related lending grew by 7.4% to HK$4,564 billion as at the end of 2019 (Table 3).

The asset quality of AIs remained healthy. Retail banks’ classified loan ratio edged down from 0.51% at the end of 2018 to 0.48% at the end of 2019, well below the long-run historical average of 2% since 2000. For the banking industry as a whole, the classified loan ratio increased slightly from 0.55% to 0.57%. Specifically in terms of Mainland-related lending, retail banks’ classified loan ratio increased from 0.63% in 2018 to 0.79% in 2019, which was still low by historical standard. For the banking industry as a whole, the ratio increased to 0.75% from 0.55% a year ago.

During the year, the HKMA devoted increased supervisory efforts in ensuring that AIs continued to adopt prudent credit risk management standards amid the uncertain economic environment. Solvency stress tests were enhanced to incorporate more comprehensive risk coverage and more severe stress assumptions. The results of the enhanced stress tests continued to indicate that banks generally had sufficient capital buffers to withstand extreme shocks. Targeted and thematic examinations were conducted to evaluate the credit risk management practices of AIs in different areas, such as lending to corporates engaged in high-risk business, complex financing arrangements, and collateralised lending to private banking and wealth management customers. Recognising that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) would more likely face greater challenges during economic downturns, the HKMA established a Banking Sector SME Lending Co-ordination Mechanism in October, with a view to encouraging banks to continue to support SMEs’ financing needs to the extent permitted by prudent risk management principles.

# Property mortgage lending

The resilience of the Hong Kong banking sector to withstand a downturn in the property market has been strengthened significantly by the eight rounds of countercyclical macro-prudential measures introduced by the HKMA since 2009. The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of new residential mortgage loans fell to 53% in December 2019 from 64% in September 2009, before the countercyclical measures were first introduced. The average debt servicing ratio (DSR) of new mortgages also decreased to 36% in December 2019 from 41% in August 2010, when a cap on DSR was first applied (Chart 1).

# Supervision of operational and technology risk

The HKMA adopts a three-phased approach to implement the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework under the Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative (CFI). phase One assessment, involving all the major banks, was completed in 2018. The remaining AIs covered in the second and third phases have substantially completed the assessment as scheduled. The HKMA has also embarked on a comprehensive review of the CFI to fine-tune the initiative given the experience gained in the past years.

In October, the HKMA issued a revised Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module on “Risk Management of E-banking”. The revision sought to provide the industry with greater flexibility to meet changing customer expectations on electronic banking services. The HKMA also published a set of high-level principles on the use of artificial intelligence in order to provide guidance for the industry.

Since the social events started in June, the HKMA have maintained close dialogue with the industry to monitor the impact on banking operations and services. Banks were requested to replenish automated teller machines (ATMs) more frequently and repair vandalised facilities as soon as practicable. The HKMA also acted quickly to refute malicious rumours that sought to undermine the public’s confidence in the banking system. Thanks to concerted efforts by the banking industry, the affected bank branches and facilities quickly resumed normal services and the inconvenience caused to the public was kept to a minimum. In view of the rising operational risk posed by the social events, banks were asked to take additional precautionary measures to strengthen their operational resilience.

# Supervision of liquidity and market risk management

During the year, a round of thematic reviews was conducted to assess AIs’ capability to cope with liquidity shocks. The reviews focused on the robustness of AIs’ liquidity stress testing programmes and contingency funding management. The HKMA also assessed AIs’ compliance with the regulatory requirements on the calculation of the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) to ensure the prudence and accuracy of the inputs used for the calculation.

As algorithmic trading gained popularity in the banking industry, the HKMA conducted a round of thematic reviews to evaluate AIs’ risk management practices in this area. Considering that the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) might cease to be published after end-2021, the HKMA reminded AIs to get prepared for the transition to alternative reference rates and conducted a survey to monitor their preparedness for the transition.

# Combating money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF)

The HKMA carries out risk-based supervision of AIs’ AML/CFT systems. During the year, 18 on-site examinations and 61 off-site reviews were conducted, including targeted thematic reviews on private banking and the governance of the use of new technology. The HKMA shared with the industry the observations and best practices drawn from a thematic review of AIs’ application of risk-based AML/CFT controls for SMEs, in order to assist AIs to adopt appropriate account opening processes and delivery of services for SMEs.

# Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Mutual Evaluation (ME) Report on Hong Kong

A highlight of 2019 for the HKMA and Hong Kong’s overall AML/CFT regime was the publication of the FATF ME Report on Hong Kong in September. The Report represents one of the best overall results to date in the FATF’s fourth-round ME of its member jurisdictions. Hong Kong scored six “Substantial” ratings out of 11 “Immediate Outcomes” in the assessment of the effectiveness of its AML/CFT regime, and a high mark for the technical compliance aspect of the ME.

The Report favourably assessed the HKMA’s risk-based approach to AML/CFT supervision, noting that the HKMA had a good understanding of ML/TF risks in the banking sector and a reasonable understanding of risks in the stored value facility (SVF) sector. The Report also positively assessed the collective AML/CFT efforts of the banking sector, such as the increased use of data analytics by larger AIs, the fact that the great majority of suspicious transaction reports were filed by AIs, and the sector’s proactive participation in the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce (FMLIT).

The Report recommended several areas for improvement, including the understanding of some higher-risk areas, such as foreign corruption and tax crimes, and developing sectors such as SVFs. Work has already started to address these recommendations; the HKMA published an updated ML/TF Risk Assessment on the SVF sector in July and has commenced thematic on-site examinations on private banking and the governance of the use of new technology.

# International Financial Centre

Hong Kong is a globally competitive international financial centre. The implementation of the Smart Banking initiatives has been in good progress to further develop Hong Kong as a fintech hub. Capitalising on opportunities arising from the opening up of the Mainland financial markets, much headway has been made to promote financial collaboration in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, especially in easing Hong Kong residents’ cross-border access to financial and banking services in the Area.

At the same time, much effort has been made to open up new opportunities to further strengthen the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, including infrastructure investment and financing, green finance and private equity funds. The Hong Kong Academy of Finance was set up to enhance Hong Kong’s soft power in a sustainable manner.

In the central banking and regulatory community, the HKMA plays a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees, which is a clear recognition of Hong Kong’s expertise and commitment to international work.

# OVERVIEW

To strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia, the HKMA puts great effort into implementing the seven Smart Banking initiatives that were announced in September 2017, with an aim to facilitate the development and use of fintech in the banking and payment industries. The key progress of these initiatives during the year included:

- expanding the adoption of the Faster Payment System (FPS);
- facilitating the implementation of phases I and II of the Open Application programming Interface (Open API) Framework in the banking sector;
- further enhancing fintech research and talent
development;
- stepping up cross-border collaboration in fintech; granting eight virtual bank licences;
- facilitating the industry’s increasing use of Fintech Supervisory Sandbox (FSS) 2.0 for launching fintech initiatives; and
- further facilitating the adoption of regulatory technology (Regtech) through the Banking Made Easy initiative.

The HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO), together with the banking departments of the HKMA, plays a pivotal role in driving the implementation of these initiatives.

Hong Kong plays an indispensable role in facilitating international investors’ allocation of renminbi assets, with its unparalleled access to the onshore markets through the Stock Connect and Bond Connect schemes. This was evident by the tripling of the number of registered investors and daily turnover under Bond Connect over the past year. Further enhancements have been introduced to both Bond Connect and Stock Connect, providing more convenience and flexibility for international investors to invest in onshore securities in the Mainland. The HKMA also worked closely with Mainland authorities to explore and implement a series of financial facilitation measures for Hong Kong residents to access financial and banking services across the border in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), including a prospective, two-way wealth management connect scheme. Hong Kong maintains a firm foothold as the global hub for offshore renminbi business. According to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Triennial Survey of Foreign Exchange (FX) and Derivatives Market Turnover, Hong Kong continued to be the largest offshore renminbi FX centre in the world.

Continuous efforts were put into opening up new opportunities to further enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. To promote the development of the fund business in Hong Kong, the HKMA worked closely with the Government and industry to provide a more favourable tax and regulatory environment for fund formation. A number of large-scale events and targeted outreach activities were organised to promote Hong Kong as a hub for green finance, infrastructure investment and financing and corporate treasury centres (CTCs). In an effort to enhance Hong Kong’s soft power, the Hong Kong Academy of Finance (AoF) was set up in June to develop financial leadership and promote research collaboration.

In the central banking and regulatory community, the HKMA plays a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees. The HKMA chaired the Standing Committee on Supervisory and Regulatory Cooperation (SRC) of the Financial Stability Board (FSB) until 31 August 2019. Currently, the HKMA is chairing the Supervision and Implementation Group (SIG) of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), and the Working Group on Financial Markets (WGFM) established under the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP). The HKMA is also co-chairing the Non-Bank Monitoring Experts Group (NMEG) of the FSB with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

The safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure lays a solid foundation for Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre. The four interbank Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) and the Hong Kong Trade Repository (HKTR) achieved 100% system availability in 2019, beating the target of 99.95%. Through its accounts set up with the two Mainland central securities depositories, the CMU facilitates the settlement of transactions conducted under Bond Connect Northbound Trading and the holding of Mainland debt securities on behalf of relevant CMU members.

The FPS, which serves as an extension of Hong Kong dollar RTGS system to enable the public to make instant retail fund transfers and payments across different banks and stored value facilities (SVFs) on a round-the-clock basis, ran smoothly in its first year of operation. Users’ adoption of the facility had increased steadily, as manifested in the four million registrations and tripling of transaction volumes by the end of 2019. The FPS brings new opportunities to the retail payment industry and promotes fintech innovation.

To ensure the general safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA has designated and is overseeing a total of six retail payment systems (RPSs) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO). The HKMA also issued two new SVF licences in May, bringing the total number of SVF licensees to 18. SVF licensees continued to launch new products and services actively during the year to diversify customer choices and enhance user experience.

# REVIEW OF 2019

# Hong Kong as a Fintech Hub in Asia

# Smart Banking initiatives

The seven Smart Banking initiatives were announced by the HKMA in September 2017 with the aim of helping the banking sector achieve higher standards of operation and embrace the enormous opportunities brought about by the convergence of banking and technology. During the year, considerable progress was made in implementing these initiatives and transforming the fintech ecosystem of Hong Kong.

# Faster Payment System

The launch of the FPS in September 2018 was a major milestone in the financial infrastructure development of Hong Kong in the digital era. The FPS further promotes the adoption of e-payment in Hong Kong by providing efficient and convenient payment services to the general public and corporates. Since the launch of the FPS, the number of participating service providers had increased to 30 banks and 11 SVFs, with the addition of nine banks and one SVF, by the end of 2019.

Usage of the FPS has also grown steadily. As of 31 December 2019, the FPS recorded four million registrations (Chart 1) and processed 44 million transactions involving an aggregate amount of HK$748.5 billion and RMB17 billion. In December 2019, average daily turnover reached 168,000 transactions worth HK$2.4 billion and RMB38 million (Chart 2), as compared with 51,000 transactions during its first full month of operation in October 2018.

Faster payment System recorded: 
- 4 million registrations as of 31 December 2019
- 44 million transactions as of 31 December 2019
- 168,000 transactions worth HK$2.4 billion and RMB38 million of average daily turnover in December 2019

The HKMA works with the industry to extend FPS usage from person-to-person payments to bill payments and other merchant payments. For example, enhancements were made to enable merchants to use a variety of proxy identifiers and accept partial or over-payments via a QR code. A technical specification was developed to facilitate the invocation of a mobile banking or SVF e-wallet mobile application (app) from a business mobile app for FPS payment. This would greatly improve customer experience in making merchant and business payments via the FPS using mobile devices.

The HKMA also works closely with relevant Government departments to assist them in using the FPS to accept bill payments from the public. From 1 November, bills issued by the Inland Revenue Department, the Rating and Valuation Department and the Water Supplies Department were printed with an FPS QR code so that the public could scan the QR code easily with supporting mobile banking or SVF e-wallet apps to make payment. The HKMA will continue working with various Government departments and public bodies to explore other potential use cases which can make it convenient for the public to make payment via the FPS.

To raise public awareness of the FPS, the HKMA has developed a new series of education and publicity materials, such as Announcements in the public Interest for broadcast on television and radio, as well as videos and electronic banners for digital platforms. The HKMA also participated in trade fairs to promote the FPS to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and corporates. Various FPS participating banks and SVFs launched promotion campaigns and offered incentives to encourage customers to register with the FPS and to use it for fund transfer and bill payment.

In addition, the HKMA engaged a number of industry organisations and institutions to provide briefings on the FPS so as to introduce its functionalities and the potential benefits it may bring to different businesses in collecting and making payment.

The Government has adopted FPS for bill payments on taxes, rates and Government rent and water charges.

# Open Application Programming Interface

The HKMA continued to facilitate the banking sector’s development and adoption of Open API in accordance with the four-phase approach of the Open API Framework. Under phase I, 20 retail banks opened up over 500 Open API endpoints in January, covering information of banking products and services. Under phase II, the banks opened up in October over 300 APIs to support applications for banking products and services.

# Research and talent development

On trade finance, a proof-of-concept (PoC) study on linking up eTradeConnect and we.trade was completed in the first quarter of the year. In November, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between the subsidiaries of Hong Kong Interbank Clearing Limited and the Institute of Digital Currency of the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) to conduct a PoC study on linking up eTradeConnect and the PBoC Trade Finance platform to provide firms in both Hong Kong and Mainland China with more convenient trade finance services.

On Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), the HKMA and the Bank of Thailand embarked on a joint research project named project Inthanon-LionRock to study the application of CBDC to cross-border payments, with a view to facilitating HKD-THB payment-versus-payment (pvp) among banks in Hong Kong and Thailand.

The MoU is signed between Chief Executive Officer of the Hong Kong Trade Finance Platform Company Limited, Ms Haster Tang (second from left), and Deputy Director-General of the Institute of Digital Currency of the PBoC and Director of the Shenzhen Fintech Institute, Mr Di Gang (second from right).

On artificial intelligence (AI), the HKMA carried out a study on the application of AI technology in the Hong Kong banking industry. Key findings of an industry-wide AI survey were published in November, followed by the issuance of the full report, titled “Reshaping Banking with Artificial Intelligence”, in December.

The report “Reshaping Banking with Artificial Intelligence” is published in December.

A fact sheet is published to highlight the key facts and figures derived from a survey on the use of AI in the Hong Kong banking industry.

In an effort to enlarge the fintech talent pool, the HKMA continued to run the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme 2.0 in collaboration with its strategic partners to nurture young talent at various stages of their career development. Over 220 students benefited from the programme last year.

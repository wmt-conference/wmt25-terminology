# Priorities for 2024 and Beyond

Entering 2024, the Hong Kong economy is expected to continue to recover at a moderate pace, riding on the ongoing revival of inbound tourism, public infrastructure projects and stable private consumption. However, the external environment is fraught with risks and uncertainties, especially those relating to the future US policy rate path, the global growth prospects, and the evolving geopolitical tensions. That said, Hong Kong’s financial system remains well-positioned to weather adverse shocks given its resilience and ample buffers built up over the years.

The HKMA attaches great importance to safeguarding Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. Looking ahead, we will stay vigilant in the face of the uncertain macroeconomic environment, seeking to promptly identify emerging risks and respond to them in an agile manner. At the same time, we will seek opportunities and create policy headroom to help further enhance Hong Kong’s status as a leading international financial centre. In managing the Exchange Fund in this challenging investment environment, we will continue to invest prudently, while remaining flexible, taking defensive measures as appropriate, and maintaining a high degree of liquidity.

# Stability and integrity of the financial system

The global economic uncertainties of recent years look set to continue in 2024. The HKMA will keep abreast of latest developments and stay vigilant against potential risks, with the aim of upholding the resilience and stability of the financial system, which are essential for the ongoing provision of critical financial services that support the functioning of the Hong Kong economy.

# Staying vigilant against potential risks

Looking into 2024, global financial markets could experience volatility as a result of uncertainties surrounding the US monetary policy outlook, evolving geopolitical risks, and an uneven global economic recovery. 2024 is also a key election year as many major elections are scheduled to be held across the world. The outcome of these elections could further increase market uncertainties. Nevertheless, Hong Kong’s financial system is well-positioned to withstand adverse shocks given its resilience and buffers built up over the years. The HKMA also has the capability, the resources and the commitment to safeguard Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.

The HKMA will continue its efforts to closely monitor any risks and vulnerabilities arising in the domestic and external environments, and will deploy appropriate measures where necessary to maintain Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. We will also conduct research into issues affecting the Hong Kong economy, assessing and addressing any potential risks associated with these issues.

# Maintaining banking stability

In 2023, new geopolitical tensions across the world broke out while others remained unresolved, contributing to political uncertainty and instability that looks set to continue into 2024. Economic pressures in the form of high interest rates were a feature of the global landscape, and rates remain high entering 2024. Within the banking sector, the continued drive towards digitalisation and the implementation of new technology, including artificial intelligence, have brought many advantages but are also posing new operational and cyber security risks as well as supervisory challenges. In such a volatile political, economic and technological landscape, the HKMA strives to ensure banks’ ability to withstand shocks through its ongoing supervisory efforts. At the same time, we will continue to enhance and refine our banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account technological developments, changes in customer expectations, as well as international standards and best practices.

# A risk-based supervisory focus

# Credit, liquidity and market risks

In light of the increasingly challenging macroeconomic landscape, a special focus of the HKMA will be on monitoring the asset quality of authorized institutions (AIs) and assessing the effectiveness of their credit risk management and controls, particularly with respect to loan classification and provisioning practices and problem loans management. We will also maintain close dialogue with the banking and commercial sectors with a view to ensuring that AIs are striking an appropriate balance between undertaking prudent credit risk management and fulfilling their financial intermediation function throughout economic cycles. In particular, we will follow up with banks through the Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism on the nine new measures rolled out in March 2024 to assist small and medium-sized enterprises in obtaining financing from banks.

Uncertainties in the global economic outlook as well as elevated geopolitical tensions may increase the volatility of both asset prices and cross-border fund flows. The HKMA will make vigilance a priority, and will continue to effectively supervise the liquidity and market risk management of AIs.

# Follow-up actions on lessons drawn from the 2023 banking turmoil

The HKMA will implement the follow-up actions identified in the internal review that it undertook in response to the 2023 banking turmoil in the US and Europe. These are actions that will further strengthen supervisory effectiveness and enhance its ability to handle a banking crisis should one arise. They include enhancing the risk capture of AIs’ interest rate risk in the banking book in the context of the HKMA’s supervisory review process, improving the preparedness of AIs for dealing with liquidity stresses given the continuing digitalisation of banking services, streamlining the HKMA’s crisis management processes, and further enhancing interagency and cross-border supervisory co-ordination.

# Operational and technology risk

The HKMA will continue to monitor AIs’ progress towards achieving full compliance with the HKMA Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module OR-2 on “Operational Resilience”, and assess and benchmark banks’ tolerance limits for plausible disruptions, with a view to enhancing the overall resilience of the banking system. With respect to cyber risk, we will oversee a new round of self-assessments by AIs under the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 and monitor AIs’ implementation of a secure tertiary data backup to enhance their data recovery capabilities if faced with destructive cyber attacks.

Given the accelerating pace of digitalisation in banking operations, the HKMA will keep a close watch on emerging risks arising from the use of advanced technologies such as generative artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology. We will also collaborate with banks and other relevant stakeholders in operating an agile and pre-emptive mechanism to counter the growing trend of digital fraud.

# Combatting money laundering and terrorist financing

In 2024, to uphold the integrity of the banking system and build customer confidence, the HKMA will target high-risk areas and prioritise risk-based regulatory updates, including issuing guidance to support an effective, risk-based implementation of changes to requirements for politically exposed persons, and supporting the implementation of the regulatory regime for stablecoin issuers. We will also issue guidance to help AIs optimise their transaction monitoring systems and to promote the responsible use of artificial intelligence, and focus on controls targeting high-end money laundering through our thematic work. To strengthen the ecosystem response to digital fraud and reduce losses to victims, we will further consult the public and the industry on a proposal to expand the scope of bank-to-bank information sharing from corporate accounts to personal accounts and, based on the feedback received, pursue necessary legislative amendments. We will move to a full build of Macro Analytics 3.0 by pooling data relevant to anti-money laundering across multiple banks and interfacing this with existing ecosystem fraud analysis. This will deliver more rapid cross-bank responses and further enhance our datadriven anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism supervision, enabling us to take quicker, more decisive action against systemic money laundering and terrorist financing risks.

# Wealth management and Mandatory Provident Fundrelated businesses

In 2024, the HKMA will step up both its on-site examinations and off-site surveillance of AIs’ conduct in relation to wealth management and the selling of securities, investment products, and insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses. More specifically, we will focus on Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) business, digital distribution and advisory platforms, virtual asset (VA)-related products, long term insurance products and premium financing activities, taking into account the latest market developments as well as evolving international standards.

The HKMA will communicate closely with fellow regulators and the banking industry to provide guidance on regulatory standards in relation to the sale of investment, insurance and MPF products as appropriate. In particular, to support the sustainable and responsible development of the VA sector, we will continue to work with the Government and fellow regulators to ensure that the regulatory regime in place for the VA sector is robust, comprehensive and well-balanced.

The HKMA will facilitate and monitor the industry’s implementation of enhancements to Cross-boundary WMC, and continue to engage with the industry and relevant regulatory authorities in order to further enhance the scheme. We will also continue to work with fellow regulators and the industry to streamline the selling process for investment products, and will consolidate and clarify guidance, as appropriate, to facilitate industry compliance. In addition to trust business, we will also commence the supervision of new Type 13 regulated activity under the Securities and Futures Ordinance for AIs providing depositary services for collective investment schemes authorised by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), which will come into operation on 2 October 2024.

# Oversight of financial market infrastructures

The HKMA aims to promote the safety and efficiency of the financial market infrastructures (FMIs) under its oversight in accordance with the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO), the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMI) and the various guidance issued by the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI). We will continue to participate in the CPMI-IOSCO1 PFMI implementation monitoring and assessment exercise, and in other international working groups to discuss the implementation of new and innovative FMI-related initiatives. We will also participate in the work of international standard-setting bodies, and will review and strengthen our oversight requirements as appropriate to reflect the latest international practices as well as market and technology developments.

# Policy development

The HKMA will continue to strengthen and refine its banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account international standards and best practices.

# Implementation of Basel standards in Hong Kong

The proposed amendments to the Banking (Capital) Rules (BCR) and the Banking (Disclosure) Rules (BDR) for implementing the Basel III final reform package (Final Package) are expected to take effect on 1 January 2025 following the passage of the amended Rules in the Legislative Council. In 2024, the HKMA will continue to prepare the supporting guidance, banking returns and standard disclosure templates and tables needed to facilitate the application of the Rules. In particular, we plan to:
- consult the industry in the second quarter of 2024 on the revisions to the SPM module CA-B-3 on “Countercyclical Capital Buffer (CCyB)–Geographic Allocation of Private Sector Credit Exposures” and Return MA(BS)25 “Quarterly reporting on the Countercyclical Capital Buffer”, reflecting the consequential changes arising from the implementation of the Final Package and the revised Return of International Banking Statistics; and
- finalise the package for effecting the reporting-only requirement for the new standards on market and credit valuation adjustment risks, which starts on 1 July 2024.

Those parts of the proposed amendments to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules (BELR) and the Banking (Liquidity) Rules (BLR) that are largely consequential to the implementation of the Final Package under the amended BCR are also targeted to take effect on 1 January 2025. The HKMA plans to finalise the proposed consequential amendments to the related regulatory returns in 2024.

Meanwhile, with a new standard on the prudential treatment of banks’ crypto-asset exposures and subsequent targeted revisions to the standard having been issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December 2022 and December 2023 respectively, local implementation of the standard is planned for 2025. The HKMA will examine the need for potential legislative amendments to various sets of rules, including the BCR, the BDR, the BELR and the BLR, and conduct the statutory consultation on the necessary rule amendments in the first half of 2025.

# Other supervisory policies and risk management guidelines

The HKMA plans to update a number of SPM modules in response to lessons learned from the banking turmoil in the US and Europe of March 2023, as well as developments in regulatory requirements and international standards. These modules include:

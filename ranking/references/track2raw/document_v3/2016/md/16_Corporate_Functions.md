# Public Education Programme

The HKMA Information Centre on the 55th Floor of two International Finance Centre is an important resource for introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters. The Centre consists of an exhibition area and a library, and is open to the public six days a week. The exhibition area introduces the work of the HKMA and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong. It also contains reading materials and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.

In the fourth quarter of 2016, the policy section of the Information Centre, which introduces the work of the HKMA and related financial concepts, commenced refurbishment with the aim of enhancing the experience of visitors by enriching the contents of the exhibitions and introducing various interactive elements. In particular, interactive games are introduced to integrate play into learning and illustrate complicated financial concepts in a simple way. There are also touchscreen panels to explain the work of the HKMA in a more comprehensive and in-depth manner. In addition, there is a mosaic artwork of the Victoria Harbour which is made up of more than 130,000 pieces of Hong Kong coins. The new look of the policy section was re-opened to the public on 24 February 2017.

# The HKMA website

The HKMA corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk), with over 50,000 pages in english and traditional and simplified Chinese, is the public access gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It also contains the Register of Securities Staff of Authorized Institutions (AIs) and the Register of AIs and local Representative offices, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking ordinance, as well as the Register of SVF licensees under the payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities ordinance. Dedicated webpages and eye-catching short-cut links have been provided to draw public attention to the new initiatives of the HKMA, such as the regulatory regime for SVFs, IFFO and FFO, as well as important and timely information, such as reminders on the need to remain vigilant against bogus phone calls and the location of Coin Carts under the Coin Collection programme.

# HUMAN RESOURCES

The HKMA recruits, develops and maintains a highly professional workforce to support its policy objectives and respond flexibly to changing work priorities. While the HKMA is an integral part of the government, it employs staff on terms different from those of the civil service to attract personnel with the right experience and expertise. As a public organisation, the HKMA aims to maintain a lean and flexible structure and, where possible, to redeploy staff resources to undertake new initiatives and meet the increasing workload.

# Staffing

The establishment of the HKMA at the beginning of 2016 was 875. In the second half of 2016, 12 posts were created to carry out the HKMA’s regulatory functions under the new insurance regulatory regime. The establishment of the HKMA therefore stood at 887 at the end of 2016.

In 2017, the establishment is increased by 40 to 927 (an increase of 4.5%) to ensure that sufficient resources are provided to cope with (i) the implementation of new legislation and initiatives, (ii) the continuation of pilot projects proven necessary on an on-going basis, and (iii) the increasing complexity and volume of existing work. The new posts are deployed to the following functions:
- Enhancing banking and financial stability, which includes:
    - enhancing supervisory capacity to manage growing technology risk and new fintech initiatives of banks, and to deal with the regional and business expansion of banks;
    - strengthening supervisory and enforcement efforts in anti-money laundering and counterterrorist financing and preparing for the 2018 Financial Action task Force Mutual evaluation;
    - gearing up the planning and preparatory work for the implementation of the Financial Institutions (Resolution) ordinance, which applies international standards to address the “too big to fail” problem of the financial industry; and
    - strengthening supervisory capacity for new international standards on capital and market risks, and enhancing resources for handling consumer protection issues and banking complaints.
- Strengthening investment, risk management and other related support to the expanding investment activities resulting from the further diversification of the exchange Fund’s investment products, and enhancing strategic asset allocation and investment processes in the light of an increasingly challenging investment environment.
- Developing and implementing talent development programmes and enhancing related resources to ensure the HKMA has the necessary human capital to keep pace with market developments and meet the challenges ahead.
- Stepping up research capacity on monetary issues and handling of monetary statistics, and providing resources for handling enquiries and complaints relating to the licensing/designation and supervision of SVFs and RpSs.

Temporary resources are deployed to meet other work demands. The HKMA also transfers staff on secondment to other international or local organisations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Services Development Council to assist in activities or policy initiatives in which Hong Kong or the HKMA has an interest. Some staff members are deployed on a full-time or part-time basis to provide operational support to the Hong Kong Deposit protection Board and the treasury Markets Association.

# Remuneration policies and pay review mechanism

The Financial Secretary (FS) determines the pay and conditions of service for HKMA staff on the advice of the Governance Sub-Committee (GSC) through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC), taking into account the prevailing market rates and practices. Remuneration comprises a total cash package and a provident fund scheme, with minimal benefits in kind. The cash package consists of monthly fixed pay (or basic pay) and variable pay, which may be awarded to individual staff members as a lump sum once a year depending on performance.

Pay for HKMA staff is reviewed annually by the FS in the light of recommendations made to him by the GSC through EFAC, taking into account the GSC’s assessment of the performance of the HKMA in the preceding year, the pay-survey findings of the financial sector conducted by independent human resources consultants and any other relevant factors. Special pay adjustments may be made from time to time for individual meritorious staff to maintain their pay competitiveness.

Any approved annual adjustments to the fixed pay or any variable pay awards for the HKMA are distributed to individual staff based on their performance. Investment professionals in the HKMA are subject to a variable pay system that seeks to strengthen the linkage between their investment performance and remuneration award. The pay adjustments or awards for individual staff members at the ranks of executive Director or above are approved by the FS on the advice of the GSC. The staff members concerned are not present at the meetings when their pay is discussed. The pay adjustments or awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Division Head and below are determined by the Chief executive of the HKMA under delegated authority from the FS and within the approved overall pay awards.

# Remuneration of senior staff

The remuneration packages of the senior staff in 2016 are shown in table 2.

1. Except for annual leave accrued, the actual remuneration received by staff who did not serve out a full year is annualised for the purpose of calculating the average annual package for the rank. 2.

# Opinion

I certify that I have audited the financial statements of the exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 149 to 237, which comprise the balance sheets of the exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2016, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.

In my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2016, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified public Accountants (“HKICpA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief executive made under section 7 of the exchange Fund ordinance (Cap. 66).

# Basis for opinion

I conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief executive made under section 7 of the exchange Fund ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards. My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report. I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.

# Key audit matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2016. These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

# Key audit matter

How the matter was addressed in my audit

# Valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value

Refer to notes 2.5, 2.6 and 36.1 to the financial statements.

As at 31 December 2016, the Group had financial assets totalling HK$3,198,975 million and financial liabilities totalling HK$963,977 million valued at fair value.

For 95% of these financial assets and all these financial liabilities, their fair values were quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 inputs) or were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data (level 2 inputs).

For the remaining 5% of these financial assets, their fair values were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data (level 3 inputs). Such financial assets totalled HK$175,886 million, including mainly unlisted investment funds.

Given the substantial amount and the estimations involved, valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value was a key audit matter.

The audit procedures on valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value included:
- obtaining an understanding of the procedures, including relevant controls, for valuing different categories of financial assets and financial liabilities;
- evaluating and testing the controls, including relevant application controls of the computer systems;
- obtaining external confirmations on the valuation, existence, rights and obligations and completeness of the financial assets and financial liabilities;
- where quoted market prices were used, verifying the prices to independent sources;
- where valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions, and verifying the inputs to independent sources; and
- where valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.

# Placements by the Future Fund

Refer to notes 2.6, 2.16.1, 4(b), 23 and 28 to the financial statements.

In prior years, substantially all placements by Fiscal Reserves were repayable on demand, with interest payable at a fixed rate determined annually with reference to past investment returns of the Investment portfolio.

On 1 January 2016, the Government established the Future Fund within Fiscal Reserves. Placements by the Future Fund comprise an initial endowment from the balance of the land Fund, amounting to HK$219,730 million, and periodic top-ups from the General Revenue Account as directed by the Financial Secretary. Interest on placements by the Future Fund is payable at a composite rate, computed annually on a weighted average basis with reference to the fixed rate linked with the performance of the Investment portfolio mentioned above and the annual rate of return linked with the performance of the long-term Growth portfolio, which holds private equity and real estate investments. Placements by the Future Fund, together with the interest thereon, shall only be repaid on 31 December 2025 unless otherwise directed by the Financial Secretary.

As at 31 December 2016, placements by the Future Fund totalled HK$224,530 million. Accrued interest on the placements amounted to HK$10,071 million. Given the substantial amount involved and the significant changes in the terms of placements, the measurement, presentation and disclosures of the placements and the interest thereon required additional attention.

The audit procedures on placements by the Future Fund included:
- evaluating the appropriateness of the accounting policy used for measuring the placements and the accrued interest;
- reviewing the methodology for calculating the annual rate of return linked with the performance of the long-term Growth portfolio;
- verifying the computation of the fixed rate with reference to past investment returns of the Investment portfolio, the annual rate of return linked with the performance of the long-term Growth portfolio, and the composite rate with reference to these two rates;
- verifying the amount of interest accrued using the composite rate; and
- reviewing the presentation and disclosures of the placements and the accrued interest in the financial statements.

# Valuation of investment properties at fair value

Refer to notes 2.12, 17 and 18 to the financial statements.

The Group’s investment properties were stated at their fair values, totalling HK$22,723 million as at 31 December 2016. The Group also had interests in three associates and fourteen joint ventures totalling HK$32,083 million, whose principal activities were holding overseas investment properties. The fair values of these investment properties, whether held by the Group directly or by associates or joint ventures, were mainly determined based on valuations by independent professional valuers. Such valuations involved significant judgments and estimates, including the valuation methodologies and the assumptions used.

The audit procedures on valuation of investment properties at fair value included:
- obtaining and reviewing the valuation reports of investment properties held by the Group directly or by associates or joint ventures, and verifying that the fair values were based on the valuations stated in the valuation reports;
- assessing the independence and qualifications of the valuers; and
- evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.

# Other information

The Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises all the information included in the 2016 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.

My opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in this regard.

# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements

The Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICpA and the directive of the Chief executive made under section 7 of the exchange Fund ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.

The Audit Sub-Committee of the exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.

# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

My objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. I also:
- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;
- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;
- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;
- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;
- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and
- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.

I communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.

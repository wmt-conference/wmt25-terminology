# International Financial Centre

Hong Kong remained the global hub for offshore renminbi business. The tax changes last year helped create a conducive environment to attract multinational companies to establish their corporate treasury centres in Hong Kong. The Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office and the Fintech Facilitation Office were established last year as part of our efforts to develop Hong Kong as an infrastructure financing centre and a fintech hub respectively. During the year, the HKMA granted 13 licences to stored value facility issuers. Hong Kong’s robust fiscal performance and strong external positions continued to be recognised by credit rating agencies, with Standard & poor’s maintaining its AAA rating for Hong Kong.

# OVERVIEW

Offshore renminbi business moderated globally in 2016 due to volatilities in global financial markets and uncertainties surrounding the renminbi exchange rate outlook. Despite this, Hong Kong remained the global hub for offshore renminbi business, processing about 70% of renminbi payment activities worldwide. The Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect was launched in December, representing another milestone in Mainland’s capital account liberalisation and a key step in enhancing Hong Kong’s position as an international financial centre. The HKMA also strengthened financial infrastructure by expanding renminbi liquidity support to the market and introducing measures to enhance the transparency of renminbi market liquidity.

The HKMA set up the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO) in July to build and work with a cluster of key stakeholders to promote infrastructure development and develop Hong Kong as an infrastructure financing centre. As at the end of January 2017, more than 60 organisations have joined IFFO as partners. During the year, the HKMA also secured the passage of legislative changes to remove tax asymmetry and provide tax incentives to encourage multinational and Mainland companies to establish their corporate treasury centres in Hong Kong, thereby bringing more business opportunities to the financial and professional service sectors. There are also a growing number of asset owners setting up footprints in Hong Kong. In particular, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, the third largest sovereign wealth fund in the world, announced that it had set up an overseas office in Hong Kong in october, its only office outside Abu Dhabi.

In the Article IV Consultation last year, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) spoke positively on our efforts to develop Hong Kong as an international financial centre. During the year, the HKMA actively contributed to international efforts to advance global and regional financial stability. It also maintained close dialogue with international credit rating agencies. Its efforts contributed to the affirmation of Hong Kong’s credit rating by major credit rating agencies in 2016.

The safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure and its continued development play a significant role in reinforcing the competitive edge of Hong Kong as an international financial centre and the global offshore renminbi business hub. The four interbank Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems and the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) achieved 100% system availability in 2016, as compared to the target of 99.95%.

Hong Kong’s retail payment financial infrastructure was further enhanced by the HKMA in 2016. A total of 13 stored value facility (SVF) licences were granted under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO), which commenced full operation in november 2016. The coverage of e-Cheque was also expanded to include crossboundary payments between Hong Kong and guangdong province (including Shenzhen).

To facilitate the development of fintech in Hong Kong, the HKMA set up the Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO) in March. A number of important initiatives were implemented with encouraging progress.

The HKMA implemented several initiatives to strengthen the soft power of the banking industry, which included (i) the launch of the Director empowerment programme, (ii) the development of an industry-wide Enhanced Competency Framework (ECF) for banking practitioners, and (iii) the implementation of a Consumer education programme.

# REVIEW OF 2016

# Offshore renminbi business

Financial market volatilities and uncertain outlook for the renminbi exchange rate weighed on offshore renminbi business globally in 2016. At the end of the year, renminbi customer deposits and outstanding certificates of deposit in Hong Kong stood at RMB625.1 billion, representing a year-onyear reduction of 38% (Chart 1). Offshore renminbi bond issuance moderated to RMB52.8 billion in the year, while renminbi trade settlement handled by Hong Kong banks dropped to RMB4,542.1 billion. On the other hand, renminbi lending by banks in Hong Kong amounted to RMB294.8 billion at the end of the year, similar to the level a year before (Chart 2). Turnover in the renminbi RtgS system remained at high levels, averaging RMB863.6 billion daily in 2016. This demonstrates that Hong Kong continued to support a large amount of renminbi financial intermediation activities despite the shrinkage of the renminbi liquidity pool. According to SWIFt statistics, Hong Kong processed some 70% of renminbi payment activities in 2016, a testament to Hong Kong’s position as the global hub for offshore renminbi business.

During the year the HKMA worked closely with the relevant Mainland authorities to gain more policy headroom for renminbi business in Hong Kong. New policy measures were rolled out, including further opening of Mainland’s onshore interbank bond and foreign exchange markets to foreign participants, and the launch of Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect in December. To cater for the increasing crossborder investment channels and liquidity management needs, the HKMA expanded the renminbi liquidity facilities. In october, it increased the number of Primary Liquidity Providers (PLPs) from seven to nine and the overall amount available under the PLP scheme from RMB14 billion to RMB18 billion. Transparency in the use of the HKMA’s renminbi liquidity facilities was also enhanced, thereby facilitating more effective liquidity management by the participating banks.

In the national 13th Five-year plan promulgated in March, Hong Kong’s status as the global offshore renminbi business hub is reaffirmed, demonstrating support of the Central government for Hong Kong to further develop its offshore renminbi business.

At the same time, the HKMA continued to strengthen collaboration with other economies in the development of offshore renminbi business. It also actively participated in events to promote Hong Kong as the global hub for offshore renminbi business, as well as the key springboard in Mainland’s “go global” strategy, including through local events organised by industry associations and the private sector, and events outside Hong Kong, such as in Mainland China, germany, Kazakhstan and the uK.

# Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA)

The agreement to achieve basic liberalisation of trade in services between Mainland China and Hong Kong was signed in 2015 under the framework of the CEPE. The HKMA continued to monitor implementation of the existing CEPE measures and worked with the Administration to explore room for further liberalisation and facilitation measures for Hong Kong’s financial industry to enter the Mainland market.

# Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO)

# Mission of IFFO

The mission of IFFO is to facilitate infrastructure investments and their financing by working with a cluster of key stakeholders. The functions of IFFO are to:
- provide a platform for information exchange and experience sharing;
- build capacity and knowledge on infrastructure investments and financing;
- promote market and product development; and
- facilitate infrastructure investment and financing flows.

In July, the HKMA set up IFFO with a mission to facilitate infrastructure investments and their financing by building and working with a cluster of key stakeholders. As at the end of January 2017, more than 60 organisations from Mainland China, Hong Kong and overseas have joined IFFO as partners. They include multilateral financial agencies and development banks, public sector investors, private sector investors, asset managers, banks, insurance companies, project developers and operators, professional service firms and an international business council (table 1).

IFFO has made good progress since its launch. As part of capacity building, it hosted an executive workshop coorganised with International Finance Corporation (IFC) under the World Bank group and eastspring Investments in october with the theme “private participation in Infrastructure project Finance in emerging Markets”. The workshop received very positive feedback from participants in terms of helping to build knowledge and networking. A business seminar was held in november featuring Jin liqun, president of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, to share experience in project planning, operation and management to build capacity for the business sector. In July, IFFO entered into Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) with IFC and Global Infrastructure Hub (GIH) to establish frameworks of co-operation. Two more MOUs were signed in December with China Development Bank (CDB) and export-Import Bank of China to facilitate the financing of infrastructure projects by these banks via the IFFO platform. These activities served to strengthen Hong Kong’s role and international profile as an infrastructure financing centre.

# Corporate treasury centres (CTCs)

To further attract multinational companies to establish their CTCs in Hong Kong, the HKMA worked with the Administration to create a conducive tax environment for CTCs. Specifically, the Inland Revenue (Amendment) (No. 2) ordinance 2016 (Revised tax Regime), enacted in June, allows, under specified conditions, the deduction of interest expenses in calculating profits tax for the intra-group financing business of corporations, and reduces profits tax rate for specified treasury activities by 50% (i.e. to 8.25%) for qualifying CTCs. Table 2 summarises some key features of the Revised tax Regime.

In addition to the legislative work, the HKMA has been actively promoting Hong Kong as the preferred location for CTCs to multinational and Mainland corporates. By the end of the year, the HKMA had reached out to nearly 400 corporations, financial institutions and industry associations. In november, the HKMA signed an Mou with the Hong Kong Chinese enterprises Association to help Chinese enterprises in Hong Kong to better understand and make more use of our CTC platform.

# Promotion of asset management business

The HKMA continued its efforts to promote Hong Kong as an asset management hub. According to the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), the number of licensed corporations in asset management increased nearly 15% yearon-year to 1,300 as of the end of 2016. According to the Asian Venture Capital Journal, the number of private equity firms in Hong Kong (including SFC licensed and non-SFC licensed corporations) also increased by 4.6% to 431 in 2016. To date, close to 70 out of the top 100 global asset managers and the majority of Mainland’s top 20 mutual fund companies have presence or associated companies in Hong Kong. There are also a growing number of asset owners setting up footprints in Hong Kong. In particular, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, the third largest sovereign wealth fund in the world, announced that it had set up an overseas office in Hong Kong in october, its only office outside Abu Dhabi.

# Introduction of an open-ended fund company structure

The HKMA continued to work with the Administration and industry to provide a more favourable tax and regulatory environment for fund domiciliation. In June, the Securities and Futures (Amendment) Bill 2016 was passed to introduce an open-ended fund company structure to diversify the fund domiciliation platform of Hong Kong and create a more flexible business environment for fund managers with a view to enhancing Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international asset management centre.

# Islamic finance

The HKMA continued to raise market awareness and knowledge of Islamic finance by organising and participating in Islamic finance conferences and seminars in collaboration with industry associations, and sharing its sukuk issuance experience with market players to encourage them to use the local platform. Following the success of the past two sukuk issuances, the HKMA has been working with the Administration to look for opportunities to launch the third sukuk when market conditions are conducive.

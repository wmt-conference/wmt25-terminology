# About the HKMA

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is Hong Kong’s central banking institution. The HKMA has four main functions: maintaining currency stability within the framework of the Linked Exchange Rate System; promoting the stability and integrity of the financial system, including the banking system; helping to maintain Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre, including the maintenance and development of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure; and managing the Exchange Fund.

# THE HKMA’S LEGAL MANDATE

The HKMA was established on 1 April 1993 after the Legislative Council passed amendments to the Exchange Fund Ordinance in 1992 empowering the Financial Secretary to appoint a Monetary Authority.

The powers, functions and responsibilities of the Monetary Authority are set out in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the Banking Ordinance, the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance, the Deposit Protection Scheme Ordinance, the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, and other relevant Ordinances. The division of functions and responsibilities in monetary and financial affairs between the Financial Secretary and the Monetary Authority is set out in an Exchange of Letters dated 25 June 2003.  The Exchange of Letters discloses delegations made by the Financial Secretary to the Monetary Authority under these Ordinances. The letters are public documents and can be found on the HKMA website.

The Exchange Fund Ordinance establishes the Exchange Fund under the control of the Financial Secretary. According to the Ordinance, the Fund shall be used primarily for affecting the exchange value of the Hong Kong dollar. It may also be used for maintaining the stability and integrity of the monetary and financial systems of Hong Kong, with a view to maintaining Hong Kong as an international financial centre.

The Monetary Authority is appointed under the Exchange Fund Ordinance to assist the Financial Secretary in performing his functions under the Exchange Fund Ordinance and to perform such other functions as are assigned by other Ordinances or by the Financial Secretary. The office of the Monetary Authority is known as the HKMA, and the Monetary Authority is the Chief Executive of the HKMA.

The Banking Ordinance provides the Monetary Authority with the responsibility and powers for regulating and supervising banking business and the business of taking deposits. Under the Ordinance, the Monetary Authority is responsible for the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong.

The Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance designates the Monetary Authority as the resolution authority for banking sector entities. Under the Ordinance, the Monetary Authority is vested with a range of powers to effect their orderly resolution with a view to mitigating the risks posed by their non-viability to the stability and effective working of the financial system of Hong Kong.

The Securities and Futures Ordinance and the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Ordinance provide certain powers to the Monetary Authority regarding banks’ securities and mandatory provident fund businesses.

The Insurance Ordinance provides that the Monetary Authority may be delegated inspection and investigation powers in respect of insurance activities of banks.

The Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance empowers the Monetary Authority to supervise banks’ compliance with the requirements under the Ordinance.

The Deposit Protection Scheme Ordinance confers responsibility on the Monetary Authority to assist in the operation of the Deposit Protection Scheme and to trigger payment of compensation from the Deposit Protection Scheme Fund to depositors of a failed bank.

The Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance provides a statutory regime for the Monetary Authority to designate and oversee clearing and settlement systems that are material to the monetary or financial stability of Hong Kong or to the functioning of Hong Kong as an international financial centre. It also empowers the Monetary Authority to administer a licensing regime for stored value facilities, and to designate retail payment systems and oversee their operations are safe and efficient.

# THE HKMA AND THE HONG KONG SPECIAL ADMINISTRATIVE REGION GOVERNMENT

The HKMA is an integral part of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, but is able to employ staff on terms different from those of the civil service in order to attract personnel of the right experience and expertise. The Chief Executive of the HKMA and his staff are public officers. In its day-to-day work the HKMA operates with a high degree of autonomy within the relevant statutory powers conferred upon, or delegated to, the Monetary Authority.

The Financial Secretary is responsible for determining the monetary policy objective and the structure of the monetary system of Hong Kong: a letter from the Financial Secretary to the Monetary Authority dated 25 June 2003 specifies that these should be currency stability defined as a stable exchange value at around HK$7.80 to one US dollar maintained by Currency Board arrangements. The Monetary Authority is on his own responsible for achieving the monetary policy objective, including determining the strategy, instruments and operational means for doing so. He is also responsible for maintaining the stability and integrity of the monetary system of Hong Kong.

The Financial Secretary, assisted by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, has responsibility for policies for maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s financial system and the status of Hong Kong as an international financial centre. In support of these policies, the Monetary Authority’s responsibilities include:
- promoting the general stability and effective working of the banking system
- promoting the development of the debt market, in co-operation with other relevant bodies
- matters relating to the issuance and circulation of legal tender notes and coins
- promoting the safety and efficiency of the financial infrastructure through the development of payment, clearing and settlement systems and, where appropriate, the operation of these systems
- seeking to promote, in co-operation with other relevant bodies, confidence in Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems, and market development initiatives to help strengthen the international competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial services.

The Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary. The Monetary Authority, under delegation from the Financial Secretary, is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the use of the Exchange Fund, and for the investment management of the Fund.

# ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY

The autonomy given to the HKMA in its day-to-day operations, and in the methods it uses to pursue policy objectives determined by the Government, is complemented by a high degree of accountability and transparency.

The HKMA serves Hong Kong by promoting monetary and banking stability, by managing the official reserves effectively, and by developing and overseeing a robust and diverse financial infrastructure. These processes help to strengthen Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre and to foster Hong Kong’s economic well-being.

The HKMA must have the confidence of the community if it is to perform its duties well. The HKMA therefore takes seriously the duty of explaining its policies and work to the general public and makes every effort to address any concerns within the community relevant to the HKMA’s responsibilities.

The HKMA is accountable to the people of Hong Kong through the Financial Secretary, who appoints the Monetary Authority, and through the laws passed by the Legislative Council that set out the Monetary Authority’s powers and responsibilities. The HKMA also recognises a broader responsibility to promote a better understanding of its roles and objectives and to keep itself informed of community concerns. In its day-to-day operations and in its wider contacts with the community, the HKMA pursues a policy of transparency and accessibility. This policy has two main objectives:
- to keep the financial industry and the public as fully informed about the work of the HKMA as possible, subject to considerations of market sensitivity, commercial confidentiality and statutory restrictions on disclosure of confidential information
- to ensure that the HKMA is in touch with, and responsive to, the community it serves.

The HKMA seeks to follow international best practices in its transparency arrangements. It maintains extensive relations with the mass media and produces a range of regular and special publications in both English and Chinese. The HKMA’s bilingual website (www.hkma.gov.hk) carries a large number of HKMA publications, press releases, speeches and presentations, in addition to special sections on research, statistics, consumer information and other topics. Social media platforms are also used to communicate with the public more efficiently in the digital era. The HKMA maintains an Information Centre at its offices, consisting of a Library and an Exhibition Area, which is open to the public six days a week. The HKMA also organises public education programmes to inform the public, and in particular students, about the work of the HKMA and enhance their financial literacy through seminars and guided tours at the Information Centre. Further information on the HKMA’s media work, publications and public education programmes is contained in the chapter on Corporate Functions.

Over the years the HKMA has progressively increased the detail and frequency of its disclosure of information on the Exchange Fund and Currency Board Accounts. Since 1999 the HKMA has participated in the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard project for central banks. The HKMA publishes records of meetings of the Currency Board Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee and the reports on Currency Board operations. The supervisory policies and guidelines on banking have been published on the website since 1996.

The relations between the HKMA and the Legislative Council play an important part in promoting accountability and transparency. There is a formal commitment from the Chief Executive of the HKMA to appear before the Panel on Financial Affairs of the Legislative Council three times a year to brief Members and to answer questions on the HKMA’s work. Representatives from the HKMA attend Legislative Council Panel meetings from time to time to explain and discuss particular issues, and committee meetings to assist Members in their scrutiny of draft legislation.

# ADVISORY AND OTHER COMMITTEES

# Exchange Fund Advisory Committee

In his control of the Exchange Fund, the Financial Secretary is advised by EFAC. EFAC is established under section 3(1) of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, which requires the Financial Secretary to consult the Committee in his exercise of control of the Exchange Fund. The Financial Secretary is ex officio Chairman of EFAC. Other members, including the Monetary Authority, are appointed in a personal capacity by the Financial Secretary under the delegated authority of the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. Members of EFAC are appointed for the expertise and experience that they can bring to the committee. Such expertise and experience include knowledge of monetary, financial and economic affairs and of investment issues, as well as of accounting, management, business and legal matters.

EFAC is assisted in its work by five Sub-Committees, which monitor specific areas of the HKMA’s work and report and make recommendations to the Financial Secretary through EFAC. The Committee held five meetings in 2018 to discuss a full range of issues relating to the work of the HKMA, most of which had been previously discussed by the relevant Sub-Committees.

The Governance Sub-Committee monitors the performance of the HKMA and makes recommendations on remuneration and human resources policies, and on budgetary, administrative and governance issues. The Sub-Committee met five times in 2018 to consider a range of subjects including the HKMA’s expenditure budget, the HKMA’s performance assessment, the annual pay review and strategic planning matters. The Sub-Committee also received regular reports on the work of the HKMA.

The Audit Sub-Committee reviews and reports on the HKMA’s financial reporting process and the adequacy and effectiveness of the internal control systems of the HKMA. The Sub-Committee reviews the HKMA’s financial statements, and the composition and accounting principles adopted in such statements. It also examines and reviews with both the external and internal auditors the scope and results of their audits. None of the members of the Sub-Committee performs any executive functions in the HKMA. The Sub-Committee met two times in 2018 and received reports on the work of the Risk Committee and the Internal Audit Division.

The Currency Board Sub-Committee monitors and reports on the Currency Board arrangements that underpin Hong Kong’s Linked Exchange Rate System. It is responsible for ensuring that Currency Board operations are in accordance with established policy, recommending improvements to the Currency Board system, and ensuring a high degree of transparency in the operation of the system. Records of the Sub-Committee’s meetings and the reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the Sub-Committee are published. In 2018, the Sub-Committee met four times.

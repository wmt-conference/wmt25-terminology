# International Financial Centre

One of the key responsibilities of the HKMA is to maintain Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre. During the year, good progress was made on the seven initiatives that are aimed at facilitating the development and use of fintech in the banking and payment industries. The successful launch of the Faster Payment System was a case in point.

Hong Kong’s unique role as the dominant gateway to Mainland China was further strengthened with the implementation of major enhancements to the mutual access schemes for the capital markets between Mainland China and Hong Kong, and the development of the Greater Bay Area. Hong Kong’s status as the global offshore renminbi business hub was also firmly secured, as demonstrated by the vibrant renminbi financial activities taking place in Hong Kong.

At the same time, great effort had been put on opening up new opportunities to further enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, including infrastructure financing, corporate treasury centres and green bond market. The HKMA’s marketing campaign to promote Hong Kong’s strengths to overseas and Mainland stakeholders had also been stepped up. At an international level, the HKMA is playing a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees, which is a clear recognition of Hong Kong’s expertise and commitment to international work.

# OVERVIEW

To strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia, the HKMA put great effort on implementing the seven initiatives that were announced in September 2017 and aimed at facilitating the development and use of fintech in the banking and payment industries. The key progress of these seven Smart Banking initiatives during the year included:

- successfully launching the Faster Payment System (FPS) to achieve full connectivity among banks and stored value facilities (SVFs), commonly known as e-wallets; 
- publishing an Open Application Programming Interface (Open API) framework and facilitating the implementation of Open API in the banking sector;
- enhancing fintech research and talent development;
- stepping up cross-border collaboration in fintech;
- updating the Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks and processing virtual bank licence applications;
- operating the upgraded Fintech Supervisory Sandbox 2.0 (FSS 2.0) smoothly; and
- expanding the Banking Made Easy initiative to facilitate the adoption of regulatory technology (Regtech).

The HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO), together with the banking departments of the HKMA, has been playing a pivotal role in driving the implementation of these initiatives.

Hong Kong’s unique role as the dominant gateway to Mainland China was further strengthened with the implementation of major enhancements to the mutual access schemes for the capital markets between Mainland China and Hong Kong. In particular, the introduction of real-time Delivery versus Payment (DvP) settlement and the State Council’s announcement of tax waiver for overseas bond investors further enhanced the efficiency and appeal of the scheme. The HKMA also worked closely with Mainland authorities to develop and implement a series of financial facilitation measures for residents and corporates living, working and doing business in the Guangdong-Hong KongMacao Greater Bay Area (GBA). Offshore renminbi business in Hong Kong remained vibrant, with the size of the renminbi deposit pool up by 6% to RMB657.7 billion and the average daily turnover of the renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system recording a high level of RMB1,010.1 billion.

Great effort had been put on opening up new opportunities to further enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. To promote the development of bond market in Hong Kong, the HKMA launched the Pilot Bond Grant Scheme (PBGS), which is a Budget initiative offering a subsidy to attract first-time bond issuers to Hong Kong, and worked closely with the Government on legislative changes to expand the scope of tax exemptions on bond investment income under the Qualifying Debt Instrument scheme. The HKMA’s marketing campaign to promote Hong Kong’s strengths to overseas and Mainland stakeholders had also been stepped up. A number of large-scale events and targeted outreach activities were organised to promote Hong Kong as a hub for green finance, infrastructure financing and corporate treasury centres (CTCs).

At an international level, the HKMA is playing a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees. Currently, the HKMA is chairing the Standing Committee on Supervisory and Regulatory Cooperation (SRC) of the Financial Stability Board1 (FSB), the Supervision and Implementation Group (SIG) of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (“Basel Committee”), and the Working Group on Financial Markets (WGFM) established under the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP).

The safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure lays a solid foundation for Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre. The four interbank RTGS systems, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) and the Hong Kong Trade Repository (HKTR) achieved 100% system availability in 2018, as compared to the target of 99.95%. Through its accounts set up with the two Mainland central securities depositories (CSDs), the CMU continued to facilitate the settlement of transactions under Bond Connect Northbound Trading and the holding of Mainland debt securities on behalf of relevant CMU members.

To promote the general safety and efficiency of the retail payment industry, the HKMA designated two more retail payment systems (RPSs) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO) in August to bring their operations under the HKMA’s oversight. As a result, there are a total of six designated RPSs under the oversight of the HKMA. The HKMA has also been supervising 16 SVF licensees which actively launch new products and services that sought to offer customers more choices and better user experience. Meanwhile, the coverage of the e-Cheque and Electronic Bill Presentment and Payment service was further expanded to include cross-border payments between Hong Kong and the entire Guangdong Province.

# Smart Banking initiatives

The seven Smart Banking initiatives were announced by the HKMA in September 2017 with the aim to help the banking sector rise to a higher level and embrace the enormous opportunities brought about by the convergence of banking and technology. During the year, considerable progress was made in implementing these initiatives and transforming the financial ecosystem of Hong Kong.

# Faster Payment System

The FPS was successfully launched in September, enabling real-time fund transfers in the Hong Kong dollar and renminbi anytime and anywhere among users of banks and SVFs with the use of mobile phone numbers or email addresses as account proxy for receiving funds. A total of 21 banks, including most retail banks, and 10 SVF operators in Hong Kong have participated in the system to provide real-time payment services and/or addressing service for their customers.

Within 3.5 months, FPS had received over 2 million registrations, representing a ratio of 27% to total population size in Hong Kong. Since its launch, the FPS had processed over 4.8 million transactions involving an aggregate amount of over HK$104.9 billion and RMB2.75 billion.

In the same month, the HKMA launched the Common QR Code Standard for Retail Payments in Hong Kong and a mobile application (“app”) tool “Hong Kong Common QR Code” (HKQR). The app is the world’s first mobile app for converting multiple QR codes into a single code. It facilitates merchants, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), in using a single QR code to accept different payment schemes, instead of displaying multiple QR codes to their customers.

# Open Application Programming Interface

Open API allows banks’ data to be accessed by third-party service providers to facilitate better and easier integration of services offered by banks and other API businesses. Users can therefore stay conveniently on one system to enjoy integrated services in a secure environment. To facilitate the development and adoption of Open API by the banking sector, the HKMA published an Open API Framework in July. The Framework adopts a riskbased principle and a four-phase approach to implement various Open API functions. Under Phase 1, 20 banks had opened up some 500 Open API endpoints in January 2019, covering information of over 1,000 products and services.

# Research and talent development

Leveraging the trade finance proof-of-concept work led by the HKMA, a consortium of banks in Hong Kong launched eTradeConnect, a distributed ledger technology-based trade finance platform, in October. The platform aims to reduce error and risk of fraud by digitising paper-based documents and automating trade finance process. As of end-2018, 12 banks had joined as members of the consortium. In October, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between eTradeConnect and we.trade, a European digital trade finance platform, to conduct a proof-of-concept on connecting the two platforms. In parallel, the HKMA has been exploring opportunities to expand the connectivity of eTradeConnect with other regions, including working with the Monetary Authority of Singapore to implement the Global Trade Connectivity Network.

In an effort to enlarge the talent pool in the fintech industry, the HKMA launched the Fintech Career Acceleration Scheme (FCAS) 2.0, an upgraded version of FCAS, in collaboration with the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute in January. FCAS 2.0 comprises four programmes targeting young talent at various stages of their career development. Over 200 students benefited from the programmes under FCAS 2.0.

# Cross-border collaboration

The HKMA continued to strengthen fintech collaboration with Shenzhen after signing an MoU with the Office of Financial Development Service (OFDS) of the People’s Government of Shenzhen Municipality in 2017. In particular, the HKMA sponsored the Shenzhen Summer Internship Programme, which enabled 50 students to work in renowned firms in Shenzhen for six weeks to experience the fintech ecosystem there, and coorganised with OFDS the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Fintech Award for the second time.

The HKMA also signed fintech co-operation agreements with four other jurisdictions in 2018, namely the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA), the Polish Financial Supervision Authority, the Financial Services Regulatory Authority of Abu Dhabi Global Market, and the Central Bank of Brazil, to facilitate fintech collaboration.

In collaboration with 11 financial regulators and related organisations, the HKMA announced in August the initiative of the Global Financial Innovation Network, which seeks to provide an efficient way for innovative firms to interact with regulators, and for co-operation among financial services regulators on innovation-related topics.

# Virtual banking

The introduction of virtual banking will provide additional impetus to the application of fintech in Hong Kong and offer new customer experience in digital banking. Virtual banks will also help promote financial inclusion as they would target the retail segment, whether the clients are individuals or SMEs. The HKMA updated the Guideline on Authorization for this purpose after public consultation in May, and received around 30 applications by end-August.

# Fintech Supervisory Sandbox

Usage of the FSS continued to increase steadily during the year. To help develop the Regtech ecosystem, the FSS was open to Regtech projects starting from September.

Up to end-2018, pilot trials of 42 fintech or technology products in the FSS had been allowed. Among these cases, 28 pilot trials were completed, and the products were rolled out to the market subsequently. The HKMA also received 220 requests to access the FSS Chatroom to seek regulatory feedback at the early stage of fintech projects. About 70% of these requests were made by technology firms.

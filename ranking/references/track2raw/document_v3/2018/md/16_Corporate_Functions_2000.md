# Corporate Functions

The HKMA maintains effective communication with the community and the market through the media, website, public education programmes and other various channels to facilitate public understanding about its policies and operations. During the year, the HKMA continued to improve corporate governance by supporting professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline and enhancing IT security to cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives and the increasing complexity of work.

# ENGAGING THE COMMUNITY

# Media relations and social media

The HKMA works closely with the media to enhance transparency and promote public understanding about its policies and work. In 2018, 96 open press events were held, comprising 21 press conferences, 11 stand-up interviews and 64 other public functions. A further 39 media interviews were arranged. A total of 462 bilingual press releases were issued and a large number of media enquiries were handled every day.

To raise awareness of the HKMA’s key functions, in-depth media briefings and educational workshops were conducted for local and overseas media on a wide range of topics, such as the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), fintech development, green finance, and infrastructure financing. The HKMA further strengthened its capability in public communications through the use of social media by launching its official Facebook page in July while enhancing the content of the existing YouTube channel and LinkedIn page.

A total of 9,950 enquiries were handled in 2018, about half of which were related to banking policies and regulations, consumer banking issues as well as notes and coins. Notable examples included the Coin Collection Programme, banking products and services, banking-related guidelines and circulars, Faster Payment System (FPS), virtual banks, and the 2018 New Series Hong Kong Banknotes.

# Publications

Apart from the HKMA Annual Report, in 2018 the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report, four issues of the Quarterly Bulletin and regular updates of the Monthly Statistical Bulletin to provide up-to-date and thematic information and analyses on monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. In addition, the HKMA published a total of 13 inSight articles, covering various topical issues related to its work.

# HKMA website

The HKMA corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk), with more than 60,000 pages in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, is the public access gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It also contains the register of authorized institutions (AIs) and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of Als, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the register of stored value facility (SVF) licensees under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance. Dedicated webpages and eye-catching short-cut links are designed to draw public attention to the new initiatives of the HKMA, such as the FPS, and important and timely information, such as reminders on the need to remain vigilant against bogus telephone calls and the location of Coin Carts under the Coin Collection Programme.

Setting an example for the adoption of Open Application Programming Interface (Open API) in the banking sector, the HKMA launched Open APIs on its corporate website in July to provide convenient access by the public to the HKMA’s important information. The first batch of 50 sets of Open API were launched successfully in July, covering the information most frequently accessed by the public, such as statistics on the banking sector and the Exchange Fund, as well as press releases and Coin Cart Schedule. The remaining 80 sets will be developed and rolled out by phases by mid-2019. As a further step to facilitate the public to obtain the HKMA’s latest news and information from the website more easily, the HKMA is overhauling the layout and content of its corporate website to make it more user-friendly. The newly designed website is expected to be launched in 2019.

The HKMA embraces the development and application of Open API.

# Public Education Programme

The HKMA Information Centre on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre is an important resource for introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters. It consists of an exhibition area and a library, and is open to the public six days a week. The exhibition area introduces the work of the HKMA and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong. It also contains reading materials and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.

In the first quarter of 2018, the Information Centre commenced a refurbishment of its currency section, which introduces the design, security features, production process and other fun facts about Hong Kong notes and coins. Various interactive elements, such as games that integrate playing into learning, were introduced to enhance the experience of visitors. In addition, an artistic Bauhinia tree made up of 2,018 pieces of see-through cubes filled with shredded currency notes that are no longer fit for circulation was installed alongside a mosaic artwork made of Hong Kong coins. The currency section, with its new look, was re-opened to the public on 16 August.

The Information Centre organises guided tours for visitors. During the year, it received more than 59,000 visitors and hosted over 580 guided tours for schools and other groups (Chart 3). More than 705,000 people have visited the Information Centre since it opened in December 2003. The library, situated next to the exhibition area, houses more than 26,000 books, journals and other publications for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs and central banking topics. It also maintains the register of AIs and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.

Interactive games are introduced to explain the production process of Hong Kong notes.

The artistic Bauhinia tree is suspended in mid-air, with lighting effects that feature its beauty in different seasons.

Guided tours of the Information Centre are organised for schools and other groups.

Secondary school students and teachers from different districts participate in the public education seminar.

To reach out to the community and raise public awareness of the HKMA’s work, the HKMA organised three public education seminars for about 1,500 secondary school students and teachers in 2018. Topics covered in the seminars included the LERS, Hong Kong banknotes, banking stability, the Deposit Protection Scheme, FPS, SVFs, fintech, consumer protection and careers in the financial industry. Close to 60,000 teachers and students have participated in this public education programme since its launch in 1998.

The HKMA is an equal opportunities employer. It ensures that everyone works in an environment free of discrimination. Its equal opportunities policy applies to employment, compensation and benefits, performance assessment, promotion, posting/training opportunities, and general conduct.

The HKMA recruits, develops and maintains a highly professional workforce to support its policy objectives and respond flexibly to changing work priorities.

# Organisational changes in 2018

The Exchange Fund Investment Office (EFIO) was established on 1 August to house the investment and related risk management functions of the HKMA previously undertaken by the Reserves Management Department and the Risk & Compliance Department. The establishment of the EFIO creates a distinct identity for the HKMA’s investment function, raises its institutional profile and makes it more agile and responsive to market changes. These are important to support the continued expansion and diversification of the Exchange Fund’s investment activities.

Table 1 gives a breakdown of the establishment and strength of the HKMA.

# Remuneration policies and pay review mechanism

The Financial Secretary (FS) determines the pay and conditions of service for HKMA staff on the advice of the Governance Sub-Committee (GSC) through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC), taking into account the prevailing market rates and practices. Remuneration comprises a total cash package and a provident fund scheme, with minimal benefits in kind. The cash package consists of monthly fixed pay (or basic pay) and variable pay, which may be awarded to individual staff members as a lump sum once a year, depending on performance.

Pay for HKMA staff is reviewed annually by the FS in the light of recommendations made to him by the GSC through the EFAC, taking into account the GSC’s assessment of the performance of the HKMA in the preceding year, the paysurvey findings of the financial sector conducted by independent human resources consultants, and any other relevant factors. Special pay adjustments may be made from time to time for individual meritorious staff members to maintain their pay competitiveness.

Any approved annual adjustments to the fixed pay and any variable pay awards for the HKMA are distributed to individual staff members based on their performance. Investment staff members are subject to a variable pay system that seeks to strengthen the link between their investment performance and remuneration award. The pay adjustments and awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Executive Director and above are approved by the FS on the advice of the GSC. The staff members concerned are not present at the meetings when their pay is discussed. The pay adjustments and awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Division Head and below are determined by the Chief Executive of the HKMA under delegated authority from the FS and within the approved overall pay awards.

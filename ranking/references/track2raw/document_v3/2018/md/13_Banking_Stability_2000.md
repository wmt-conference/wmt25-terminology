# Banking Stability

The Hong Kong banking system remained sound in 2018, notwithstanding increased uncertainties in the global economy and the financial markets. During the year, the HKMA continued to focus its supervisory efforts on reviewing the effectiveness of authorized institutions’ liquidity and credit risk management systems. In view of growing cybersecurity threats and increasing adoption of fintech in the banking industry, the HKMA stepped up the supervision of authorized institutions’ technology risk management and operational resilience. The HKMA also published a revised Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks in May, and began to process applications for authorization as virtual banks. On conduct supervision, the HKMA took further steps to enhance the supervision of authorized institutions’ sales practices for investment and insurance products, facilitate access to barrier-free banking services to customers with disabilities, and promote a customer-centric corporate culture.

As financial crime has become more sophisticated and globalised, the HKMA continues to strengthen the resilience of Hong Kong’s anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism regime through harnessing new technology and risk-based approaches. Substantial progress was made on the local implementation of international regulatory standards, including capital adequacy standards, disclosure standards, liquidity standards and large exposure limits. The HKMA’s interface with the banking industry was enhanced to ensure an appropriate balance between supervisory effectiveness and market development.

Meanwhile, the HKMA continued its work to ensure there is a credible resolution regime for authorized institutions, including introducing rules on minimum loss-absorbing capacity requirements to address a significant impediment to authorized institutions’ resolvability.

# OBJECTIVES

The HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this objective is contingent upon the financial system being highly resilient and capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.

Banks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their business and, in extremis, by failing in a disorderly manner. The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring banks are resilient to shocks and are able to recover their positions in response to crises, which ultimately helps prevent failures. The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks in Hong Kong. It is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs). The Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs).

However, the Monetary Authority cannot ensure, nor is the Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework designed to ensure, a zero risk financial system. Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that, in the event of an AI becoming non-viable, its failure can be managed in an orderly manner. To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong has been established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs, amongst others. To ensure that the resolution regime in Hong Kong is operational, it is important to put in place resolution legislation and policy standards, undertake resolution planning to remove impediments to AIs’ resolvability and develop the HKMA’s operational capability to resolve a failing AI. In order to carry out these tasks effectively, the HKMA needs to adopt an internationally harmonised and co-ordinated approach.

# REVIEW OF 2018

# Overview of supervisory activities

In 2018, 187 off-site reviews were conducted covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL ratings, corporate governance, business operations and risk management of AIs, as well as their business strategies in response to fintech development. As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance, 27 meetings were held with the boards of directors or board-level committees of AIs. The HKMA also followed up AIs’ progress in adopting its guidance on corporate governance. Twenty-eight tripartite meetings among the HKMA, AIs and their external auditors were held.

Apart from off-site activities, the HKMA continued to conduct regular on-site examinations supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk. A total of 392 on-site examinations and thematic reviews were conducted during the year. Credit risk management remained a key focus of these examinations and reviews. Other major focuses were technology risk and operational risk management, as well as anti-money laundering and counterfinancing of terrorism (AML/CFT) controls. The HKMA also increased the number of on-site examinations and thematic reviews targeted at liquidity and market risk management and at the implementation of the Basel capital adequacy framework. On-site examinations of AIs’ activities in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses were also conducted by specialist teams.

Table 1 contains an overall summary of the HKMA’s supervisory activities in 2018.

# Credit growth and asset quality

Credit growth moderated in 2018. Total loans grew by 4.4% in 2018, compared with a growth of 16.1% in 2017 (Table 2). Trade finance recorded a decline of 7.6% in 2018. The slowdown in loan growth was mainly due to a reduction in credit demand given the increasingly uncertain global economic and trade environment.

Table 2 Growth in loans and advances

Mainland-related lending grew by 1.4% to HK$4,249 billion at the end of 2018. The growth was slower than that in 2017 (Table 3).

The asset quality of AIs remained healthy in 2018. Retail banks’ classified loan ratio edged down from 0.56% at the end of 2017 to 0.50% at the end of 2018, well below the long-run historical average of 2.1% since 2000. For the banking industry as a whole, the classified loan ratio decreased from 0.68% to 0.55%. As for Mainland-related lending, retail banks’ classified loan ratio of such lending edged down to 0.63% in 2018 from 0.75%. For the banking industry as a whole, the ratio decreased to 0.54% from 0.67% a year ago.

During the year, the HKMA stepped up its supervisory efforts to ensure that AIs continued to adopt prudent credit risk management standards. In particular, the HKMA strengthened the surveillance framework for corporate credit risk by taking a more proactive approach in understanding the background and structure of large corporates. Targeted thematic examinations were conducted, focusing on key credit risk management controls such as new loan underwriting and risk management for lending to large corporates, the loan classification and provisioning system, the credit risk governance framework, risk management for lending to property developers, asset-backed financing, and insurance premium financing.

# Property mortgage lending

Residential property prices reached a historical peak in July 2018, but showed signs of moderation in the second half of the year. The eight rounds of countercyclical macro-prudential measures, introduced by the HKMA since October 2009, have strengthened the resilience of the Hong Kong banking sector to cope with a possible downturn in the local property market. The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of new residential mortgage loans fell to 46% in December 2018 from 64% in September 2009, before the countercyclical measures were first introduced. The average debt servicing ratio (DSR) also decreased to 34% in December 2018 from 41% in August 2010, when a cap on DSR was first introduced (Chart 1).

# Supervision of operational and technology risk

Technology risk in the banking industry remained elevated. The HKMA rolled out the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework (C-RAF) in 2016. Thirty AIs covered in the first phase of the implementation, including all major banks, completed the three stages of the assessment, namely the Inherent Risk Assessment, the Maturity Assessment, and, where appropriate, the intelligence-led Cyber Attack Simulation Testing (iCAST). The exercise assisted AIs in identifying areas of operation that require enhancement and taking remediation actions to strengthen their cyber defence. Meanwhile, the HKMA formulated a timeline for the second and third phases of the implementation to cover the remaining AIs. During the year, the HKMA conducted on-site examinations focusing on AIs’ cybersecurity controls, outsourcing arrangements, and information technology governance.

# Smart Banking

The HKMA continued to work with the banking industry on the seven Smart Banking initiatives, unveiled in September 2017, to promote fintech development in Hong Kong. On the supervisory front, a revised Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks was published in May. Under the Banking Made Easy initiative, the HKMA streamlined regulatory requirements in relation to remote onboarding, online finance, and online wealth management. These enhancements have made it easier for banks to offer better user experience in the online banking environment. The scope of the Banking Made Easy initiative was expanded in September to facilitate the adoption of regulatory technology (Regtech) by banks. Three new workstreams focusing on surveillance technologies for AML/CFT, Regtech for prudential risk management and compliance, and machine-readable regulations were created.

# Supervision of liquidity and market risks

Amid the continued normalisation of US monetary policy, the HKMA stepped up its supervisory efforts to ensure that AIs managed their liquidity risk prudently and effectively. A round of thematic reviews was conducted to assess AIs’ preparedness for a possible tightening of US dollar liquidity and their internal liquidity stress testing capability. The HKMA also monitored AIs’ compliance with the new Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) requirement, which came into effect in January.

In addition, the HKMA reviewed AIs’ market risk management for their debt securities portfolios. Thematic on-site examinations were undertaken to evaluate AIs’ compliance with new international standards on treasury activities, including the Foreign Exchange Global Code, and the margining and risk mitigation standards on non-centrally cleared over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives.

# Combating money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF)

Like other international financial centres, the banking sector of Hong Kong faces high ML threats that reflect the increased globalisation and sophistication of financial services, as highlighted in the Hong Kong Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment Report published by the Government in April. Threats arise from domestic activities and, to a greater extent, external activities. These external activities include illicit funds from external corruption, fraud perpetrated by transnational syndicates, tax evasion, and sanctions-related risks arising from Hong Kong’s status as a payment and trading hub. With the HKMA’s contribution, the Government’s AML/CFT policy statement sets out the response to these threats with the objective being to increase the resilience of the AML/CFT regime while also attracting and facilitating bona fide businesses.

The Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) (Amendment) Ordinance 2018 came into operation on 1 March. It introduced amendments for AIs, such as flexibility in measures permitted to verify a customer’s identity, which are important in the light of technological development in the methods used by AIs for customer onboarding. The new legislation also extends AML/CFT obligations to solicitors, accountants, estate agents and trust or company service providers, which will strengthen the overall AML/CFT regime. These legislative amendments, together with amendments made to the Companies Ordinance to enhance transparency of corporate beneficial ownership, assist AIs in their AML/CFT work.

To consolidate and further enhance communication on the HKMA’s overall policy and supervisory approach to AML/CFT, the HKMA published a Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) “Supervisory Approach on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism” and an updated Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions) in October to align with changes made in the legislation, support better implementation of the risk-based approach and reduce barriers to the use of technology in AIs’ AML/CFT systems.

Information sharing played an increasingly important role in the AML/CFT system through the active participation of the banking sector, supported by the HKMA and the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB), in the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce (FMLIT), which has already shown concrete results. A review of the FMLIT pilot initiative commenced in late 2018 and will be concluded in early 2019.

{"en": "# Chief Executive’s Statement\n\nIn 2017, the global economy and financial markets performed much better than expected: the real economy saw steady growth; inflation remained subdued; the three interest rate hikes and the reduction in the balance sheet by the US Federal Reserve during the year did not result in capital outflows from emerging market economies or a strengthening of the US dollar. Amid bullish sentiment, global stock markets, including the three major US stock indices, kept hitting new highs. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index surged by 34%. The Hang Seng Index gained nearly 8,000 points (or 36%) in 2017 and surpassed the 30,000-point level to reach an all-time high in January 2018.\n\nMany investors were filled with optimism, even exuberance, in such a favourable environment. However, this was until early February this year when the latest data showed a higher than expected wage increase in the US, prompting investors to reappraise inflation risks and triggering significant corrections to global stock markets. The Dow Jones Index fell more than 1,000 points in two days during the second week of February, and the Hang Seng Index dropped more than 3,000 points in the same week. The 10-year US Treasury yield surged to as high as 2.95%. The swift reversal of fund flows indicated that the record high market valuation was not built on a solid foundation. It also reminded us of the importance of a sound and robust financial system for Hong Kong to meet the challenges brought by asset market volatility and capital outflows.\n\n# Banking system resilience boosted by precautionary measures\n\nAs the saying goes, “prevention is better than cure”. The HKMA implemented further risk mitigation measures in 2017 to safeguard the stability of Hong Kong’s banking and financial systems. In May, we introduced the eighth round of countercyclical measures for banks’ mortgage loans and strengthened banks’ credit risk management on lending to property developers, with the aim of enhancing the banking system’s resilience to shocks arising from any downturn in the property market. With the several rounds of measures, the average loan-to-value ratio of new residential mortgage loans fell to 49% at the end of 2017 from 64% in September 2009, while the average debt servicing ratio also declined to 35% from 41% in August 2010.\n\nIn 2017, we established the Resolution Office to implement international standards on the resolution of non-viable financial institutions that are considered “too big to fail”. This will help prevent a recurrence of a global financial crisis similar to the one in 2008 where public money was used to save failing financial institutions, and will minimise the impact of their closures on the financial system, the economy and the community at large.\n\nRobust risk management is the cornerstone of steady and sustainable development of the banking sector. The liquidity ratio and capital adequacy ratio of Hong Kong’s banking system are well above the applicable statutory requirements and among the highest in the world. This undoubtedly reflects the high resilience of Hong Kong’s banking system. Indeed, the banking sector registered strong growth in 2017, with total loans increasing by 16%, while the asset quality also held up well. The classified loan ratio of retail banks fell to 0.54% from 0.72% in 2016, well below the long-term average of 2.2% since 2000. The banking industry’s overall return on equity (based on pre-tax operating profits) reached 11.74% in 2017, a very healthy level compared with other international financial centres.\n\n# Sound banking the key to long-term financial stability\n\nThe 2008 global financial crisis revealed the limitations of relying solely on rules and regulations to restrain the financial industry from pursuing profitability without regard to their primary responsibilities. In light of this, the HKMA has stepped up the promotion of “sound banking” practices in recent years, encouraging banks to develop and pursue good corporate culture and values. In particular, to address the issue of bank staff pursuing short-term profits at the expense of the long-term interests of their customers or banks, we are encouraging banks to put in place appropriate incentive systems that are in line with their corporate culture and values. As part of this campaign, we arranged the inaugural Annual Conference for Independent Non-Executive Directors (INEDs) in March 2017 to highlight the importance of establishing a good banking culture and to empower the INEDs to perform their oversight and monitoring roles more effectively.\n\nWith the support of the banking industry, 2017 was a successful year for the HKMA in the advancement of financial inclusion. Six physical bank branches and three mobile branches began operating in remote areas. The Hong Kong Association of Banks worked out an arrangement with EPS and a convenience store chain to launch a pilot scheme allowing the elderly to withdraw cash from the stores in remote areas without the need to make purchases. Hongkong Post is also launching this year a cash withdrawal service for the elderly at seven Post Offices mainly on outlying islands and in the New Territories. Regarding account opening, the HKMA last year set up a webpage and an email account with a dedicated team to follow up public enquiries or complaints relating to the opening of bank accounts. Thanks to the concerted efforts of various stakeholders, there has been a significant improvement in customer experience in opening individual and corporate bank accounts.\n\n# Fintech a game changer for the banking industry\n\nIn an era of rapid technological advancement, fintech has been gradually integrated into our daily lives. In this ever changing technological environment, banks must embrace new developments and pursue innovation in their application of fintech. With the new era of Smart Banking, the HKMA launched seven initiatives in September (see page 106 for details) promoting the adoption of fintech in banking to improve the quality of banking products and services for customers. While these initiatives are independent of one another, they are complementary and will be a game changer for the future landscape of payment and banking services in Hong Kong. Customers will not only enjoy more convenient, efficient and secure payment and banking services, they will also have more choices and greater control over their financial transactions. Fintech will be the key to banks’ future business success, and moving into the new era of Smart Banking will be a great opportunity for the banks to upgrade and transform themselves.\n\n# Enormous opportunities created by the Belt and Road and the Bay Area Initiatives\n\nWith competition among international financial centres becoming more intense, a diversified financial industry is of paramount importance to Hong Kong. In 2017, the HKMA stepped up its work on enhancing Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre. Given Hong Kong’s unparalleled advantage of “having the Mainland as our hinterland while maintaining an international outlook”, the Belt and Road Initiative and the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Bay Area (Bay Area) will offer enormous opportunities for the financial and banking sectors and give new impetus to the economic growth of Hong Kong. The HKMA Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office, which was established in response to the Belt and Road Initiative, saw the number of its partners grow to around 90 since launch, laying a solid foundation for promoting Hong Kong as a financing hub for infrastructure investments. The issuance of the first Belt and Road bond in Hong Kong by the China Development Bank in 2017 highlighted the pivotal role Hong Kong can play in facilitating the financing of these infrastructure projects.\n\nIn addition to infrastructure financing, we are actively involved in the development of Hong Kong as a hub for corporate treasury centres, private equity funds and Asian derivatives businesses, by attracting multinational corporations and major financial institutions to manage their funds, assets and various financial risks in the city. These initiatives will further consolidate and upgrade Hong Kong’s financial and related professional services sectors. The HKMA also maintains close dialogue with the relevant authorities responsible for the development of the Bay Area to strengthen collaboration with a view to contributing to the financial development of the area as a world-class city cluster.\n\nOver the years, Hong Kong’s financial industry has been developing under the theme of “leveraging Hong Kong’s advantages, meeting the country’s needs”. With the introduction of the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect in 2014, the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect in 2016 and the Northbound Trading of Bond Connect in July last year, the mutual market access between the Mainland and the rest of the world through Hong Kong’s financial platform has been expanded from stock markets to bond markets. This underscores Hong Kong’s unique role as a financial intermediary in facilitating global investors’ access to the Mainland’s financial markets. In 2017, Hong Kong maintained its position as the leading global hub for offshore renminbi business. Average daily turnover of the renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement system stood at RMB900 billion. In addition, according to SWIFT statistics, more than 70% of global renminbi payment transactions were handled through Hong Kong during the year. The offshore renminbi market continued to operate smoothly and develop steadily.\n\n# Nurturing talent to strengthen the soft power of the banking industry\n\nWith the continuing growth of the financial industry, nurturing talent is crucial to its sustainable development. The HKMA attaches great importance to the soft power of the banking industry, and we have been encouraging and supporting ongoing capacity building of banking practitioners. Following the introduction of two modules on anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism and cybersecurity under the Enhanced Competency Framework, we expanded its coverage last year by including retail wealth management and treasury management to enhance the level of core competence of banking practitioners through continuing professional development. The HKMA is also committed to nurturing young talent for the banking industry. In 2017, we launched the Pilot Apprenticeship Programme for Private Wealth Management and the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme in collaboration with the industry. Given the overwhelming response, the coverage of these programmes will be further expanded in the future.\n\n# Prudent investment strategy achieving a reasonable and stable return over the medium to long term\n\nOn the back of strong global economic growth, the Exchange Fund achieved a record high investment income of HK$264 billion last year with gains across the board, including equities, bonds and foreign exchange. The overall investment return was 7.4%. The Investment Portfolio achieved a rate of return of 12.1%, while the Backing Portfolio gained 1.8%. The Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP)’s annualised internal rate of return since its inception in 2009 reached as high as 13.7%. While the investment performance last year was satisfactory, the increasingly complex investment environment requires the HKMA to continue its prudent management of the Exchange Fund. We will remain agile and nimble, monitor market developments closely and deploy defensive measures as and when appropriate. Investments under the LTGP will also be further expanded. As always, the investment principle of “capital preservation first, long-term growth next” within acceptable risk levels will be adhered to when managing the wealth for the people of Hong Kong.\n\nWhile the global real economy is extending last year’s growth momentum, uncertainties and risks still abound in 2018. These include a faster-than-expected pace of US interest rate hikes in case inflation picks up, escalating trade frictions and a deteriorating geopolitical landscape. Should these downside risks materialise, they will have significant and widespread implications for global financial markets, and knock-on effects for Hong Kong’s fund flows, asset prices and real economy. It is therefore advisable that we should all manage the risks prudently.\n\nIn the coming months, it is likely Hong Kong dollar interest rate movements will remain in the spotlight. The US Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times since December 2015. With widening spreads between Hong Kong dollar interest rates and their US dollar counterparts, there is a greater incentive for funds to flow from the Hong Kong dollar into the US dollar. The Hong Kong dollar has been under weakening pressure recently and the 7.85 weak-side Convertibility Undertaking (CU) has been triggered. As we have repeatedly stated, when the 7.85 weak-side CU is triggered, the HKMA will act as a “super money changer” by buying Hong Kong dollars and selling US dollars in the market to ensure that the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate will not weaken beyond the 7.85 level. Such operations are normal and in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System. This should not cause any concern. Indeed, the Exchange Fund currently holds more than HK$4 trillion worth of assets, of which the Hong Kong dollar Monetary Base amounts to about HK$1.7 trillion, providing a strong buffer in the event of fund outflows. Over the years, the HKMA has put in place various lines of defence to safeguard the stability of the banking and financial systems. From a positive perspective, capital outflows will lead to a gradual increase in Hong Kong dollar interest rates, which will be conducive to the normalisation of the interest rate environment in Hong Kong and hence the sustainable development of the local economy and asset markets. During this process, the HKMA will stay vigilant and make every effort to maintain monetary and banking stability in Hong Kong.\n", "terms": {"10-year US Treasury yield": ["美國十年期國庫債券收益率"], "Annual Conference for Independent Non-Executive Directors": ["獨立非執行董事研討會"], "Asian derivatives businesses": ["亞洲衍生工具業務中心"], "Backing Portfolio": ["支持組合"], "Banking system": ["銀行體系"], "Bay Area": ["灣區"], "Belt and Road": ["一帶一路"], "Belt and Road Initiative": ["一帶一路"], "Belt and Road bond": ["一帶一路債券"], "Bond Connect": ["債券通"], "CU": ["兌換保證"], "China Development Bank": ["國家開發銀行"], "Convertibility Undertaking": ["兌換保證"], "Dow Jones Index": ["道指"], "EPS": ["易辦事"], "Exchange Fund": ["外匯基金"], "Fintech": ["金融科技"], "Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme": ["金融科技人才培育計劃"], "Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Bay Area": ["粵港澳大灣區"], "HKMA": ["金管局"], "Hang Seng Index": ["恒生指數"], "Hong Kong dollar Monetary Base": ["港元貨幣基礎"], "Hong Kong dollar interest rate": ["香港利率"], "Hongkong Post": ["香港郵政"], "INED": ["獨立非執行董事"], "INEDs": ["獨立董事"], "Independent Non-Executive Directors": ["獨立非執行董事"], "Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office": ["基建融資促進辦公室"], "Investment Portfolio": ["投資組合"], "LTGP": ["長期增長組合"], "Long-Term Growth Portfolio": ["長期增長組合"], "MSCI Emerging Markets Index": ["MSCI新興市場指數"], "Monetary Base": ["貨幣基礎"], "New Territories": ["新界"], "Northbound Trading": ["北向通"], "Northbound Trading of Bond Connect": ["債券通─北向通"], "Nurturing talent": ["培育人才"], "Post Offices": ["郵政局"], "Prudent investment strategy": ["穩健投資"], "Resolution Office": ["處置機制辦公室"], "Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect": ["滬港通"], "Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect": ["深港通"], "Sound banking": ["穩善金融"], "US Treasury": ["美國國庫券"], "annualised internal rate of return": ["內部回報率年率"], "anti-money laundering": ["打擊洗錢"], "asset market volatility": ["資產市場波動"], "asset prices": ["資產價格"], "asset quality": ["資產質素"], "balance sheet": ["資產負債表"], "bank branches": ["實體分行"], "banking industry": ["銀行業"], "banking products and services": ["銀行產品及服務"], "banking stability": ["銀行體系穩定"], "capital adequacy": ["資本充足"], "capital adequacy ratio": ["資本充足率"], "capital outflows": ["資金外流"], "capital preservation": ["保本"], "corporate culture": ["企業文化"], "corporate treasury centres": ["企業財資中心"], "counter-financing of terrorism": ["恐怖份子資金籌集"], "countercyclical measures": ["逆周期措施"], "credit risk": ["信用風險"], "cybersecurity": ["網絡安全"], "debt servicing ratio": ["供款與入息比率"], "dedicated team": ["專責小組"], "emerging market economies": ["新興經濟體"], "equity funds": ["集資總額"], "financial inclusion": ["普及金融"], "financial institutions": ["金融機構"], "financial intermediary": ["中介"], "financial risks": ["金融風險"], "financial stability": ["金融穩定"], "financial system": ["金融體系"], "financial transactions": ["金融交易"], "fintech": ["金融科技"], "fund flows": ["資金流向"], "global financial crisis": ["環球金融危機"], "incentive systems": ["獎勵制度"], "inception": ["開展投資以來"], "infrastructure financing": ["基建投融資"], "infrastructure projects": ["基建項目"], "international financial centre": ["國際金融中心"], "international financial centres": ["國際金融中心"], "international standards": ["國際訂立的標準"], "investment performance": ["投資表現"], "investment return": ["投資回報率"], "lines of defence": ["防波堤"], "liquidity": ["流動性"], "liquidity ratio": ["流動性比率"], "loan-to-value ratio": ["按揭成數"], "long-term growth": ["長期增值"], "market valuation": ["市場估值"], "mobile branches": ["流動銀行車"], "multinational corporations": ["跨國企業"], "mutual market access": ["互聯互通"], "offshore renminbi business": ["離岸人民幣業務"], "offshore renminbi market": ["離岸人民幣市場"], "overall investment return": ["整體投資回報率"], "payment and banking services": ["支付和銀行服務"], "pilot scheme": ["試點計劃"], "pre-tax operating profits": ["除稅前經營溢利"], "private equity": ["私募股權"], "private equity funds": ["私募基金中心"], "professional development": ["專業能力"], "professional services sectors": ["專業服務"], "profitability": ["盈利"], "property market": ["樓市"], "prudent management": ["小心謹慎管理"], "real economy": ["實體經濟"], "renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement system": ["人民幣即時支付結算"], "retail banks": ["零售銀行"], "retail wealth management": ["零售財富管理"], "return on equity": ["股東權益回報率"], "risk mitigation measures": ["風險管控措施"], "statutory requirements": ["法定要求"], "stock markets": ["股市"], "super money changer": ["超級找換店"], "total loans": ["貸款總額"], "treasury centres": ["企業財資中心"], "treasury management": ["財資管理"], "weak-side CU": ["弱方兌換保證匯率"], "weak-side Convertibility Undertaking": ["弱方兌換保證"], "Enhanced Competency Framework": ["資歷架構"], "Executive Director": ["助理總裁（銀行監理）"], "HKMA Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office": ["基建融資促進辦公室(IFFO)"], "Hong Kong Association of Banks": ["香港銀行公會"]}}

{"en": "# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nAgainst the backdrop of a more synchronised expansion of the global economy, Hong Kong saw faster economic growth, tighter labour market conditions and subdued inflationary pressures in 2017. Economic growth for 2018 is expected to remain solid.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Real activities\n\nAmid a more synchronised expansion of the global economy, the Hong Kong economy grew faster in 2017. Growth in real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increased to 3.8%, much higher than the 2.1% growth in 2016 and the long-term growth of about 3% over the past decade (Chart 1 and Table 1). Domestic demand firmed up, with private consumption growth accelerating and overall investment spending reviving. Stronger domestic demand reflected favourable job and income conditions, booming asset prices and improved business sentiment. Externally, Hong Kong’s exports of goods expanded at a faster pace due to increased global trade flows, and exports of services recovered because of vibrant trade and cargo flows and improving inbound tourism. Imports of goods recorded stronger growth on export-induced demand, and imports of services increased steadily amid strong travel interest among residents. On a net basis, the overall trade surplus shrank, making a negative contribution to GDP growth.\n\n\n# Monetary conditions\n\nOn the monetary front, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate generally eased against the US dollar driven primarily by interest rate arbitrage activities amid the negative interest rate differentials between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar. This reflected the normal functioning of the Linked Exchange Rate System in accordance with its design. While still at relatively low levels, Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates faced more upward pressures towards the end of 2017 due to Initial Public Offeringrelated funding demand and banks’ year-end liquidity needs. For credit growth, after two years of single-digit growth, total bank loans increased at a notably faster pace of 16.1% in 2017, reflecting improving economic conditions and positive financial market sentiment. Despite faster loan growth, there were no signs of loosening of banks’ credit underwriting standards, and overall loan quality remained good.\n\n# Inflation\n\nInflationary pressures remained well contained throughout 2017 (Chart 2). Netting out the effects of the Government’s one-off relief measures, the underlying inflation rate declined to 1.7%, down from 2.3% in 2016. In particular, the housing component of the price index increased at a milder pace, reflecting the filter-through of slower increases in fresh-letting private residential rentals in 2016. More broadly, milder increases in nominal wages and earnings amid strong output growth helped keep local cost pressures in check. Import price inflation was also tame, in line with low inflation in Hong Kong’s major import sources despite a weaker US dollar.\n\n# Labour market\n\nThe labour market tightened in 2017 along with above-par economic growth. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell from 3.4% in 2016 to 2.9% towards the end of 2017, below 3% for the first time in nearly 20 years (Chart 3). Most major economic sectors registered decreases in their respective unemployment rates, with more notable declines seen in the retail, financing and professional and business services sectors. As total employment grew faster and the number of private-sector vacancies picked up, overall labour demand continued to strengthen. The labour force also expanded, partly reflecting more active participation of older-age workers (aged 55 and above). Consistent with tighter labour market conditions and lower inflation, real wages and earnings saw faster increases.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe Hong Kong stock market had an almost uninterrupted rally in 2017. The Hang Seng Index rose by 36%, the largest annual gain since 2010 (Chart 4). The rally reflected optimism about the global economy and corporate earnings, and was in part supported by substantial fund inflows from Mainland investors through the Stock Connects. The Hang Seng Index hit a ten-year high in November and remained at high levels towards the end of 2017. Average daily turnover expanded to HK$88.3 billion from HK$66.9 billion in the previous year, and overall equity funds raised from the local market also increased to HK$581.4 billion, compared with HK$490.1 billion a year earlier.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market maintained its upward momentum throughout the year (Chart 4). Transaction volume expanded from 54,701 units a year ago to 61,591 units and housing prices increased by 14.8% in 2017. Housing affordability stretched further, with a price-toincome ratio of 16.4, higher than the previous peak in 1997, and an income-gearing ratio of 74.1, far above its long-term average.1 In view of rising property prices and the intensifying competition for mortgage business among banks, the HKMA introduced the eighth round of prudential measures in May to strengthen banks’ risk management and safeguard banking stability. Housing price growth moderated temporarily following these measures before accelerating in the fourth quarter. As for the commercial and industrial property markets, trading activities increased significantly during the year, with both transaction value and volume registering double-digit growth. With the pick-up in non-residential property prices, corresponding rental yields fell slightly compared to the previous year.\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nEconomic growth for 2018 is expected to remain solid. The Government forecasts growth in the range of 3–4%, while private-sector analysts project the economy to expand at an average rate of 3.2%. Externally, Hong Kong’s export performance will continue to benefit from the improving global growth outlook and the gradual recovery in inbound tourism. Domestically, private consumption growth is expected to hold up mainly as a result of favourable labour market conditions. As for fixed capital formation, building and construction activity should progress steadily on the back of rising housing supply and continuing infrastructure projects. While improved economic conditions will support business capital spending, headwinds may come from potential rises in interest rates.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nWith still-moderate global inflation and steady increase in local costs, inflationary pressures in Hong Kong are anticipated to remain moderate in 2018, but the inflation rate is likely to pick up gradually from the low in 2017. For example, the rental component of inflation may gather momentum in the latter part of 2018 because of feedthrough from increases in fresh-letting private residential rentals. Market consensus predicts the headline inflation rate to be a still-moderate 2.2% for 2018, and the Government projects the underlying inflation rate to be 2.5%. On the other hand, sustained economic growth, expanding building and construction activity and the gradual recovery in inbound tourism are expected to keep the labour market tight in the near future. Private-sector analysts forecast the unemployment rate to stay at about 3.0% in 2018.\n\n# Uncertainties and risks\n\nThe economic outlook for 2018 is subject to a number of uncertainties and risks including those relating to major central banks’ monetary policy normalisation and global financial market stability, as well as heightened protectionist sentiment and deteriorating geopolitical tensions. In particular, if such risks materialise to trigger reversal of fund flows in Hong Kong, local monetary conditions could tighten faster than expected, putting downward pressures on the real economy and asset prices.\n\nThe outlook for the residential property market remains uncertain. In the near term, the current favourable domestic economic conditions, perceived housing shortage, low mortgage rates and alternative sources of home financing (including mortgage loans provided by property developers and financial support from parents), will continue to support the demand for properties. However, the recent sell-off in global financial markets may dampen sentiments. Over the longer term, the property market will continue to face a number of headwinds. In particular, as the US monetary policy normalisation continues, domestic mortgage rates will rise eventually. In addition, on the back of the Government’s effort to increase the supply of land and residential properties, the housing demand-supply gap is expected to narrow gradually, which would ease the upward pressure on property prices in the longer term.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector continued to be safe and sound in 2017 notwithstanding uncertainties surrounding the global economy. The capital and liquidity positions of authorized institutions (AIs) remained strong, asset quality stayed at healthy levels, and profitability improved notably thanks to increased interest margins and robust credit growth.\n\n# Interest rate trends\n\nAs the US interest rate normalisation continued, the onemonth and three-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) fixings increased by 49 basis points and 39 basis points respectively in 2017. More notable rises were observed in the fourth quarter. Nevertheless, the Hong Kong dollar funding cost of retail banks, as measured by the composite interest rate, remained broadly stable over the year (Chart 5).\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe aggregate pre-tax operating profits of retail banks’ Hong Kong offices grew by 15.8% in 2017. The improved performance was mainly due to increases in net interest income (+20.3%) and fee and commission income (+9.4%). However, these increases were partially offset by a decline in income from foreign exchange and derivatives operations (-29.9%) and a growth in operating expenses (+8.4%). The aggregate post-tax profit of retail banks dropped by 18.1% because of certain non-recurring items recorded in 2016. The post-tax return on average assets of retail banks dropped to 1.07% from 1.44% in 2016 (Chart 6).\n\nRetail banks’ net interest margin widened to 1.45% in 2017 from 1.32% in 2016 (Chart 7) mainly due to rising market interest rates.\n\nThe proportion of retail banks’ non-interest income to total operating income decreased to 40% from 44.3% in 2016. While fee and commission income increased by 9.4%, income originated from foreign exchange and derivatives operations dropped by 29.9%.\n\nRetail banks’ cost-to-income ratio declined to 41.9% in 2017 from 43.2% in 2016, as operating costs (+8.4%) increased at a slower pace than operating income (+11.8%) (Chart 8). Retail banks’ loan impairment charges decreased to HK$7.3 billion from HK$8 billion in 2016.\n\n# Asset quality\n\nLoan quality of retail banks improved during the year, with the classified loan ratio decreasing to 0.54% from 0.72% a year earlier. The overdue and rescheduled loan ratio also decreased to 0.4% from 0.53% in 2016 (Chart 9). Similarly, the classified loan ratio and the overdue and rescheduled loan ratio of the whole banking sector decreased to 0.67% and 0.52%, from 0.85% and 0.67% respectively.\n\nThe quality of banks’ residential mortgage lending portfolios remained good, with the delinquency ratio staying at a low level of 0.03% at the end of 2017 (Chart 10). The rescheduled loan ratio was close to 0%. There was no residential mortgage loan in negative equity at the end of the year, as compared with four cases a year ago.\n\nThe delinquency ratio of credit card lending stayed low at 0.22% at the end of 2017, compared with 0.24% a year ago (Chart 10). The combined delinquent and rescheduled loan ratio edged down to 0.31% from 0.33% during the period. The charge-off ratio also fell slightly to 1.75% from 1.92% in 2016.\n\n# Balance sheet trends\n\nTotal loans of the banking sector grew by 16.1% in 2017, compared with 6.5% in 2016. Demand for credit increased, driven by optimism about the global economic outlook. As total deposits increased at a slower pace than total loans, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio rose to 73% at the end of 2017 from 68.4% a year earlier. The Hong Kong-dollar loan-to-deposit ratio also increased to 82.7% from 77.1% during the same period (Chart 11).\n\nMainland-related lending (including loans booked in Mainland subsidiaries of locally incorporated banks) increased by 17.5% in 2017, compared with a growth of 7% recorded in 2016.\n\n# Holdings of negotiable debt securities\n", "terms": {"Balance sheet trends": ["資產負債表走勢"], "GDP": ["本地生產總值"], "Gross Domestic Product": ["本地生產總值"], "HIBOR": ["香港銀行同業拆息"], "HKMA": ["金管局"], "Hang Seng Index": ["恒生指數"], "Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate": ["香港銀行同業拆息"], "Hong Kong banking sector": ["香港銀行體系"], "Initial Public Offering": ["新股集資"], "Interest rate trends": ["利率走勢"], "Mainland investors": ["內地投資者"], "Stock Connects": ["滬港通及深港通"], "asset prices": ["資產價格"], "asset quality": ["資產質素"], "authorized institutions": ["認可機構"], "bank loans": ["銀行貸款"], "banking stability": ["銀行體系穩定"], "building and construction activity": ["樓宇及建造活動"], "business sentiment": ["營商氣氛"], "capital and liquidity positions": ["資本及流動性狀況"], "capital spending": ["資本開支"], "cargo flows": ["貨運"], "charge-off ratio": ["撇帳率"], "commercial and industrial property markets": ["工商物業市場"], "composite interest rate": ["綜合利率"], "corporate earnings": ["企業盈利"], "cost-to-income ratio": ["成本與收入比率"], "credit card lending": ["信用卡貸款"], "credit growth": ["信貸增長"], "credit underwriting standards": ["信貸審批標準"], "delinquency ratio": ["拖欠比率"], "demand-supply gap": ["供求缺口"], "derivatives operations": ["衍生工具業務"], "domestic demand": ["本地需求"], "equity funds": ["集資總額"], "exports of goods": ["貨品出口"], "exports of services": ["服務輸出"], "fee and commission income": ["費用和佣金收入"], "financial market stability": ["金融市場穩定性"], "financial support": ["財務支持"], "fixed capital formation": ["固定資本形成"], "fund flows": ["資金流向"], "geopolitical tensions": ["地緣政治緊張局勢"], "headline inflation rate": ["整體通脹率"], "home financing": ["置業所需資金"], "housing prices": ["樓價"], "imports of services": ["服務輸入"], "inbound tourism": ["訪港旅遊業"], "income-gearing ratio": ["收入槓桿比率"], "inflationary pressures": ["通脹壓力"], "infrastructure projects": ["基建項目"], "interbank interest rates": ["銀行同業拆息"], "interest margins": ["息差"], "interest rate arbitrage": ["套息活動"], "interest rate differentials": ["息差"], "investment spending": ["投資支出"], "labour force": ["勞動人口"], "liquidity": ["流動性"], "liquidity positions": ["流動性狀況"], "loan growth": ["貸款增速"], "loan impairment charges": ["貸款減值撥備"], "loan-to-deposit ratio": ["貸存比率"], "long-term growth": ["長期增值"], "monetary policy": ["貨幣政策"], "monetary policy normalisation": ["貨幣政策正常化"], "mortgage rates": ["按揭利率"], "negative equity": ["負資產"], "negotiable debt securities": ["可轉讓債務證券"], "net interest income": ["淨利息收入"], "net interest margin": ["淨息差"], "nominal wages": ["名義工資"], "non-interest income": ["非利息收入"], "operating expenses": ["經營支出"], "overdue and rescheduled loan ratio": ["逾期及經重組貸款比率"], "post-tax profit": ["除稅後溢利"], "post-tax return on average assets": ["除稅後平均資產回報率"], "pre-tax operating profits": ["除稅前經營溢利"], "private residential rentals": ["私人住宅租金"], "private-sector analysts": ["私營機構分析員"], "private-sector vacancies": ["私營機構職位空缺"], "professional and business services": ["專業與商用服務"], "profitability": ["盈利"], "property market": ["樓市"], "protectionist sentiment": ["保護主義情緒"], "prudential measures": ["審慎監管措施"], "real economy": ["實體經濟"], "rental yields": ["租金收益率"], "residential property market": ["住宅物業市場"], "retail banks": ["零售銀行"], "seasonally adjusted unemployment rate": ["經季節因素調整失業率"], "supply of land and residential properties": ["土地及房屋供應"], "total loans": ["貸款總額"], "trade surplus": ["貿易順差"], "transaction value": ["成交額"], "underlying inflation rate": ["基本通脹率"], "unemployment rate": ["失業率"], "BO": ["《銀行業條例》"], "AIs": ["認可機構"]}}
{"en": "# Monetary Stability\n\nDespite weakening pressure on the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to operate in an orderly manner with ample liquidity. The Linked Exchange Rate System has served as a strong anchor for Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability and proved to be highly resilient against various shocks.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability. This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n- Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three noteissuing banks\n- Government-issued notes and coins in circulation\n- the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of the clearing account balances of banks kept with the HKMA\n- Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the HKMA’s firm commitment to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs). When the demand for Hong Kong dollars is greater than the supply and the market exchange rate strengthens to the strong-side CU of HK$7.75 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to sell Hong Kong dollars to banks for US dollars. The Aggregate Balance will then expand to push down Hong Kong dollar interest rates, creating monetary conditions that move the Hong Kong dollar away from the strong-side limit to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if the supply of Hong Kong dollars is greater than the demand and the market exchange rate weakens to the weak-side CU of HK$7.85 to one US dollar, the HKMA will buy Hong Kong dollars from banks. The Aggregate Balance will then contract to drive Hong Kong dollar interest rates up, pushing the Hong Kong dollar away from the weak-side limit to stay within the Convertibility Zone.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2017\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate generally saw weakening pressure in 2017 (Chart 1). Driven mainly by interest carry trade activities amid widened negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates, the Hong Kong dollar eased gradually against the US dollar, from 7.7566 on 3 January to the year-low of 7.8265 on 22 August. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate gained some strength between late September and early November, underpinned by a tightening of Hong Kong dollar liquidity due to initial public offering (IPO)-related funding demand, and traded steadily within a narrow range of 7.80–7.81. Weakening pressures on the Hong Kong dollar were seen again towards the end of the year, partly reflecting slightly improved Hong Kong dollar liquidity conditions as well as increased year-end commercial demand for the US dollar. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market functioned normally throughout 2017.\n\nAs the CUs were not triggered, the total of the Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs remained virtually unchanged at around HK$1,225.3 billion in 2017 (Chart 2). During the year, the HKMA issued a total of HK$80 billion additional Exchange Fund Bills to meet banks’ increased demand for liquidity management. This led to a contraction of the Aggregate Balance to HK$179.8 billion at the end of 2017. The issuance of additional Exchange Fund Bills was consistent with Currency Board principles, as it only represented a change in the composition of the Monetary Base, with a shift from the Aggregate Balance to the outstanding EFBNs. The Monetary Base remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\n# Money market\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates stayed soft in the first eight months of 2017 before facing more upward pressure towards the end of the year (Chart 3). Despite concerns about the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes and balance sheet normalisation, the Hong Kong dollar interbank rates generally remained soft for the first eight months. As such, the negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates widened between January and August. From September onward, the shortdated Hong Kong dollar interbank rates witnessed large pick-ups, driven mainly by IPO-related and year-end funding demand. Correspondingly, the negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates narrowed in the short-dated segment. Overall, the short-dated interbank rates traded mostly below the Base Rate in 2017.\n\nThe Base Rate was adjusted upwards on 16 March, 15 June and 14 December, by a total of 75 basis points from 1.00% to 1.75%, as the target range for the US federal funds rate moved upward three times by a total of 75 basis points from 0.50–0.75% to 1.25–1.50% during the year. The adjustment of the Base Rate was in accordance with the revised formula announced on 26 March 2009, in which the Base Rate is set at either 50 basis points above the lower bound of the prevailing target range for the US federal funds rate or the average of the five-day moving averages of the overnight and one-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs), whichever is the higher.\n\nRoughly tracking the movements of the Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads, the discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points widened gradually during the first three quarters, with the 12-month Hong Kong dollar forward points reaching about -615 pips in midSeptember (Chart 4). In the fourth quarter, the discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points narrowed slightly along with the narrowing of the negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates. Overall, Hong Kong’s money market continued to operate in an orderly manner and interbank liquidity remained ample. Discount Window borrowing increased from HK$5.3 billion in 2016 to HK$10.3 billion in 2017.\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nSince its establishment in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has served as a strong anchor for Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, and proved to be highly resilient in a series of regional and global financial crises. The Government has reasserted its full commitment to the LERS and the credibility of its commitment was further reinforced by the stability in the foreign exchange and money markets. There is also continued strong public confidence in the Hong Kong dollar as a means of payment and a storage of value. In its 2017 Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund reaffirmed its support for the LERS, commenting that the LERS remained the best exchange rate arrangement for Hong Kong. Combined with robust financial supervision and regulation, prudent fiscal management, and flexible markets, the LERS has worked well to help Hong Kong navigate successfully through both external and domestic challenges.\n\nInternational Monetary Fund: “The Linked Exchange Rate System remains the best arrangement for Hong Kong.”\n\nA sound banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS. During 2017, the HKMA continued to monitor closely banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and stepped up its supervisory efforts on corporate, property-related and mainland-related lending to bolster the resilience of the banking sector. As the US Federal Reserve continues to normalise its monetary policy, the Hong Kong dollar interest rates will gradually normalise as well. The HKMA reiterated that, under the design of the LERS, the outflow of capital, the weakening of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, the triggering of the weak-side CU and the reduction of the Monetary Base are part of the necessary process of the normalisation of Hong Kong dollar interest rates. The HKMA also reminded the public to manage their risks prudently and be well prepared for potential financial turbulence.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio, defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base, moved within a range of 106.7–108.2% during 2017, without touching the Upper or Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 108.1% on 31 December (Chart 5). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. In the event of abrupt shocks, the sizeable amount of financial resources of the Exchange Fund will provide a powerful backstop in protecting Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\n# Other activities\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to the monetary and financial stability of Hong Kong. In 2017, the CBC considered various issues, including the drivers of short-run dynamics in Hong Kong’s housing prices, the determinants of HIBOR-London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) spreads, the effect of property valuation changes on corporate borrowing in Mainland China, and the effect of mortgage debt service burden on private consumption in Hong Kong. Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and the reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research (HKIMR) continued to sponsor research in the fields of monetary policy, banking and finance. Over the past three years, the HKIMR has been re-orienting its activities towards higher policy relevance. This is reflected, in particular, in its conference activities and visiting fellowship programmes. The HKIMR has been collaborating with major central banks and policy institutions to jointly organise more policyfocused conferences. Meanwhile, a thematic research fellowship programme introduced in 2016 has been supporting more research projects related to policy issues that are of importance to the HKMA.\n\nIn 2017, the HKIMR hosted 18 research fellows and published 29 working papers. It also organised four international conferences and workshops during the year:\n- The Eighth Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy, titled “China’s Economic Rebalancing: Where is it Heading?”, was held in January in Hong Kong. The conference provided a forum for academics, policy makers and business economists to discuss important analytical and policy issues related to the Mainland economy. 11 highquality research papers were presented, covering a wide variety of issues including Mainland’s economic rebalancing, structural reform and international spillovers, issues on the renminbi exchange rate, and Mainland’s monetary policy framework and transmission.\n- The 15th HKIMR Summer Workshop was held in July. The workshop was intended to provide an opportunity for staff members of the HKIMR and the HKMA to present their research papers, and to enhance interaction between research staff and visiting fellows.\n- A joint conference organised by the HKMA and the Bank for International Settlements, titled “The Price, Real and Financial Effects of Exchange Rates”, was held in August. The conference provided a platform for in-depth and insightful discussion. A wide range of important topics were covered, including the exchange rate system, the pricing system of international trade, risk taking in the accumulation of foreign currency reserves, and foreign exchange market behaviour.\n- A conference jointly sponsored by the HKMA, the US Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta on “Unconventional Monetary Policy: Lessons Learned” was held in October. The conference reviewed lessons learned from the unconventional monetary policies (UMP) of major central banks over the past ten years. The topics included monetary policy in a low interest rate environment, UMP and its spillovers to emerging economies, UMP and bank lending, and UMP and its effects on the real economy and financial stability.\n", "terms": {"Aggregate Balance": ["總結餘"], "Article IV consultation": ["第四條磋商"], "Backing Assets": ["支持資產"], "Backing Portfolio": ["支持組合"], "Backing Ratio": ["支持比率"], "Bank for International Settlements": ["國際結算銀行"], "Base Rate": ["基本利率"], "CU": ["兌換保證"], "CUs": ["兌換保證"], "Certificates of Indebtedness": ["負債證明書"], "Convertibility Undertaking": ["兌換保證"], "Convertibility Undertakings": ["兌換保證"], "Convertibility Zone": ["兌換範圍"], "Currency Board": ["貨幣發行局"], "Currency Board Account": ["貨幣發行局帳目"], "Currency Board Sub-Committee": ["貨幣發行委員會"], "Currency Board arrangements": ["貨幣發行局制度"], "Discount Window": ["貼現窗"], "Discount Window borrowing": ["貼現窗借貸"], "EFBNs": ["外匯基金票據及債券"], "Exchange Fund": ["外匯基金"], "Exchange Fund Advisory Committee": ["外匯基金諮詢委員會"], "Exchange Fund Bills": ["外匯基金票據"], "Exchange Fund Bills and Notes": ["外匯基金票據及債券"], "Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta": ["亞特蘭大聯邦儲備銀行"], "Federal Reserve Board": ["美國聯邦儲備局"], "Government-issued notes and coins": ["政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣"], "HIBOR": ["香港銀行同業拆息"], "HKIMR": ["研究中心"], "HKMA": ["金管局"], "Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research": ["香港金融研究中心"], "Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate": ["香港銀行同業拆息"], "Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates": ["香港銀行同業拆息"], "Hong Kong dollar interest rate": ["香港利率"], "IP": ["投資組合"], "IPO": ["新股集資活動"], "International Monetary Fund": ["國際貨幣基金組織"], "LERS": ["聯匯制度"], "LIBOR": ["倫敦銀行同業拆息"], "Monetary Base": ["貨幣基礎"], "Monetary Policy": ["貨幣政策"], "UMP": ["非常規貨幣政策"], "US federal funds rate": ["聯邦基金利率"], "Unconventional Monetary Policy": ["非常規貨幣政策"], "balance sheet": ["資產負債表"], "bank lending": ["銀行借貸"], "banknotes": ["銀行紙幣"], "corporate borrowing": ["企業貸款"], "currency stability": ["貨幣穩定"], "exchange rate system": ["匯率制度"], "federal funds rate": ["聯邦基金利率"], "fellowship programmes": ["學者計劃"], "financial crises": ["金融危機"], "financial stability": ["金融穩定"], "financial supervision and regulation": ["金融監管與規管"], "foreign currency reserves": ["外匯儲備"], "foreign exchange market": ["外匯市場"], "foreign exchange reserves": ["外匯儲備"], "forward points": ["遠期匯率點子"], "housing prices": ["樓價"], "interbank interest rates": ["銀行同業拆息"], "interbank liquidity": ["銀行同業流動資金"], "interest carry trade": ["套息活動"], "interest rate risk": ["利率風險"], "international trade": ["國際貿易"], "liquidity": ["流動性"], "liquidity management": ["流動性管理"], "mainland-related lending": ["內地相關貸款"], "monetary and financial stability": ["貨幣及金融穩定"], "monetary policies": ["貨幣政策"], "monetary policy": ["貨幣政策"], "money market": ["貨幣市場"], "money markets": ["貨幣市場"], "mortgage debt service burden": ["按揭供款負擔"], "policy institutions": ["政策研究機構"], "policy relevance": ["政策相關性"], "pricing system": ["定價制度"], "prudent fiscal management": ["審慎的財政管理"], "real economy": ["實體經濟"], "short-dated": ["短期／短香港銀行同業拆息"], "stress-test": ["壓力測試"], "strong-side CU": ["強方兌換保證匯率"], "target range for the US federal funds rate": ["美國聯邦基金利率目標區間"], "thematic research fellowship programme": ["專題研究學者計劃"], "weak-side CU": ["弱方兌換保證匯率"], "BO": ["《銀行業條例》"], "EFBN": ["外匯基金票據及債券"]}}
{"en": "# Banking Stability\n\nIn 2017, the HKMA continued to place its supervisory focus on the effectiveness of authorized institutions’ risk governance framework, including credit and liquidity risk management systems. During the year, another round of countercyclical macro-prudential measures was introduced to strengthen the resilience of the banking sector to cope with any downturn in the property market. With cyber threats on the rise, the HKMA stepped up the supervision of authorized institutions’ technology risk management. At the same time, the HKMA launched seven initiatives that prepare Hong Kong to move into a New Era of Smart Banking. The effectiveness of authorized institutions’ anti-money laundering and counterterrorist financing controls remained a key supervisory focus of the HKMA as part of its efforts to combat financial crimes. On conduct supervision, the HKMA took further steps to promote a customer-centric corporate culture, foster financial inclusion, and address difficulties encountered by small and medium-sized enterprises and start-up companies in opening and maintaining bank accounts in Hong Kong. Efforts were also made to enhance the supervision of authorized institutions’ sales practices for investment and insurance products to further strengthen customer protection.\n\nSubstantial progress was made on the local implementation of international supervisory and accounting standards, including capital adequacy standards, disclosure standards, the Net Stable Funding Ratio, large exposure limits, recovery planning and International Financial Reporting Standard 9. In support of the need for capacity building amid an ever-changing banking environment and evolving risk landscape, the HKMA co-ordinated with the industry to develop director empowerment programmes and the Enhanced Competency Framework for banking practitioners.\n\nThe Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance came into operation on 7 July 2017, making Hong Kong one of the few Financial Stability Board member jurisdictions with a fully cross-sectoral resolution regime for financial institutions. The Ordinance, establishing a new line of defence for financial stability, confers necessary powers on the Monetary Authority to manage, in an orderly manner, failure of a financial institution in circumstances where such failure could have adverse systemic consequences.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this objective is contingent upon the financial system being highly resilient and capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their business and, in extremis, by failing in a disorderly manner. The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring banks are resilient to shocks and are able to recover their positions in response to crises, which ultimately helps prevent failures. The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banking business, which includes the business of taking deposits, in Hong Kong. It is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposittaking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs). The Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs).\n\nHowever, the Monetary Authority cannot ensure, nor is the Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework designed to ensure, a zero-risk financial system. Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that in the event of an AI’s failure, resolution may be conducted in an orderly manner such that continuity in critical financial services provided by AIs to their customers can be maintained. To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong is established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs, amongst other financial institutions.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2017\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nIn 2017, 192 off-site reviews were conducted covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL ratings1, corporate governance, business operations and risk management of AIs. As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance at AIs, 30 meetings were held with the boards of directors or board-level committees of AIs, with the discussions focused on important risk management issues. The HKMA also conducted a survey to monitor the adoption of its recent guidance on corporate governance. 27 tripartite meetings among the HKMA, AIs and their external auditors were also held.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA continued to conduct regular on-site examinations supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk. This approach has allowed the HKMA to prioritise its supervisory resources to focus on emerging and more significant risks faced by AIs. The HKMA conducted 401 on-site examinations and thematic reviews during the year. Credit risk management and controls remained the key focus of these examinations and reviews. Another major focus was technology risk and operational risk management. The HKMA also increased the number of overseas examinations and the number of on-site examinations and thematic reviews targeted at liquidity and market risk management as well as anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML/CFT) controls. On-site examinations of AIs’ activities in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses were also conducted by specialist teams.\n\n# Supervision of credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nTotal bank lending grew by 16.1%, compared with a growth of 6.5% in 2016. As shown in Table 2, the loan growth was broad-based.\n\nSpecifically, Mainland-related lending grew by 17.5% to HK$4,188 billion at the end of 2017 (Table 3). This included HK$644 billion of loans booked with Mainland subsidiaries of banks incorporated in Hong Kong.\n\nThe asset quality of AIs remained healthy in 2017. Retail banks’ classified loan ratio edged down from 0.72% at the end of 2016 to 0.54% at the end of 2017, well below the long-run historical average of 2.2% since 2000. For the banking industry as a whole, the classified loan ratio decreased from 0.85% to 0.67%. As regards Mainlandrelated lending, retail banks’ classified loan ratio of such lending edged down to 0.75% in 2017 from 0.82%. For the banking industry as a whole, the ratio decreased to 0.67% from 0.80% a year ago.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA stepped up its supervisory efforts to ensure that AIs continued to adopt prudent credit risk management standards. In particular, the surveillance of AIs’ exposures to major corporates was enhanced. Targeted thematic examinations were conducted, focusing on key credit risk management controls such as loan underwriting standards, the loan classification and provisioning system, credit risk governance framework and risk management for lending to property developers, asset-backed financing and insurance premium financing.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nProperty prices continued to rise in 2017. There were more loans extended by AIs involving borrowers with multiple mortgages or with income derived from outside of Hong Kong. In view of these developments, the HKMA introduced another round of countercyclical macroprudential measures on 19 May. The eighth round of measures included raising the risk-weight floor for the calculation of capital charges for new residential mortgage loans granted by AIs, lowering the applicable loan-to-value (LTV) ratio cap for property mortgage loans extended to borrowers with pre-existing mortgages, and lowering the applicable debt servicing ratio (DSR) limit for property mortgage loans extended to borrowers whose income is derived mainly from outside of Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA’s macro-prudential measures on property mortgage loans, introduced since 2009, have enhanced banks’ resilience to risks associated with the property market. The average LTV ratio of new residential mortgage loans fell to 49% in December 2017 from 64% in September 2009, before the countercyclical measures were first introduced. The average DSR also decreased to 35% in December 2017 from 41% in August 2010, when a cap on DSR was first applied (Chart 1).\n\nThe HKMA observed that some developers financed their property development projects with high gearing and some of them provided mortgages with high LTV ratios to buyers of properties. To address the risks associated with these developments, the HKMA introduced new risk management measures for lending to property developers on 12 May. These included requiring AIs to lower the financing caps for construction financing; requiring AIs to set aside more capital for their lending to property developers with a higher proportion of mortgage loans relative to equity; and performing a round of thematic examinations to ensure that banks continue to follow prudent underwriting standards in their lending to property developers.\n\nSeparately, the HKMA worked with the Land Registry in launching an e-Alert service in February. The e-Alert service provides a notification to the AI concerned whenever a further mortgage in respect of the mortgaged property is lodged with the Land Registry for registration, so that the mortgagee bank can take appropriate risk mitigating actions as appropriate.\n\n# Supervision of operational and technology risks\n\nCybersecurity threats continued to increase over the year. The HKMA stepped up its supervisory efforts in a bid to enhance the cyber resilience of the banking sector. As part of the Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative (CFI) rolled out by the HKMA in 2016, 30 AIs completed an assessment of the maturity of their cyber defences. Separately, the HKMA and the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), after extensive consultation with the banking and securities industry, jointly decided to introduce a mandatory twofactor authentication for online share trading. A round of on-site examinations focused on banks’ cybersecurity controls and operational resilience was also conducted. The HKMA further completed a round of discussions with the senior management of major banks to assess how the banks were managing strategic risks posed by potential new market entrants powered by technological advancement.\n\n# Smart Banking\n\nIn September, the HKMA announced a package of measures to assist Hong Kong’s banking sector in migrating to a new era of Smart Banking. On the supervisory front, the HKMA enhanced the Fintech Supervisory Sandbox to version 2.0, with new features including a Chatroom facility accessible by both banks and technology firms and the establishment of linkages among the sandboxes of the HKMA, the SFC and the Insurance Authority (IA), so as to provide a single point of entry for conducting trials of cross-sector fintech products.\n\nThe HKMA also launched a Banking Made Easy initiative to identify and minimise regulatory frictions with the aim of further improving customers’ experience in using fintech and digital banking services. A taskforce has been set up with the current focus on remote onboarding and account maintenance, online finance and online wealth management.\n\nA review of the existing Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks has commenced to facilitate the introduction of virtual banking in Hong Kong.\n\n# Supervision of treasury activities and liquidity risk\n\nAs the US continued to normalise its monetary policy, global fund flows might become increasingly volatile. In consideration of this, the HKMA placed increased focus on the supervision of liquidity risk during the year. The HKMA enhanced its supervisory liquidity stress testing with additional scenarios, including a more stressful but plausible scenario of fund outflows and a short-term, confidencedriven bank run scenario. The HKMA also stepped up the monitoring and analysis of individual AIs’ liquidity profiles and required selected AIs to strengthen their liquidity risk management capability.\n\nSeparately, the HKMA conducted more on-site examinations of AIs’ market risk management in respect of their debt securities portfolios. A round of thematic reviews were carried out to evaluate potential risks arising from AIs’ increased investment activities in foreign currency bonds and to assess the effectiveness of the corresponding risk management, including hedging practices.\n\n# Prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF)\n\nThe Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) (Amendment) Bill 2017 was gazetted on 23 June and will come into operation in 2018. The amendment is intended to update Hong Kong’s regulatory regime for AML/CFT in line with the latest international requirements as promulgated by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). These changes, together with updates to the statutory guideline on AML/CFT, will help clarify and implement the risk-based approach in customer due diligence (CDD) processes for account opening and the maintenance of bona fide customers, and encourage innovation where such processes are carried out remotely.\n", "terms": {"AML/CFT": ["打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集"], "Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) (Amendment) Bill 2017": ["《2017年打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集（金融機構）（修訂）條例草案》"], "CAMEL ratings": ["CAMEL評級"], "Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative": ["網絡防衛計劃"], "Financial Reporting Standard": ["財務報告準則"], "Financial Stability Board": ["金融穩定理事會"], "Fintech": ["金融科技"], "Fintech Supervisory Sandbox": ["金融科技監管沙盒"], "Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks": ["《虛擬銀行的認可》指引"], "HKMA": ["金管局"], "Insurance Authority": ["保險業監管局"], "International Financial Reporting Standard 9": ["國際財務報告準則第9號"], "Land Registry": ["土地註冊處"], "Monetary Authority": ["金融管理專員"], "Net Stable Funding Ratio": ["穩定資金淨額比率"], "New Era of Smart Banking": ["智慧銀行新紀元"], "SFC": ["證監會"], "Securities and Futures Commission": ["證券及期貨事務監察委員會"], "account maintenance": ["維持銀行帳戶 / 維持戶口"], "anti-money laundering": ["打擊洗錢"], "anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML/CFT) controls": ["打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集監控措施"], "anti-money laundering and counterterrorist financing controls": ["打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集管控措施"], "asset quality": ["資產質素"], "asset-backed financing": ["有抵押貸款"], "authorized institutions": ["認可機構"], "bank lending": ["銀行借貸"], "bank run": ["銀行擠提"], "banking industry": ["銀行業"], "boards of directors": ["董事局"], "business operations": ["業務運作"], "capital adequacy": ["資本充足"], "capital adequacy standards": ["資本充足標準"], "conduct supervision": ["操守監管"], "corporate culture": ["企業文化"], "countercyclical macroprudential measures": ["逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施"], "countercyclical measures": ["逆周期措施"], "credit risk": ["信用風險"], "customer protection": ["客戶保障"], "customer-centric corporate culture": ["以客為本的企業文化"], "cyber defences": ["網絡防衛能力"], "cyber resilience": ["防範網絡威脅的能力"], "cyber threats": ["網絡威脅"], "cybersecurity": ["網絡安全"], "debt securities portfolios": ["債務證券組合"], "debt servicing ratio": ["供款與入息比率"], "digital banking services": ["數碼銀行服務"], "director empowerment programmes": ["提升董事專業能力計劃"], "disclosure standards": ["披露標準"], "e-Alert service": ["電子提示服務"], "external auditor": ["獨立審計師"], "external auditors": ["外聘核數師"], "financial crimes": ["金融罪行"], "financial inclusion": ["普及金融"], "financial institutions": ["金融機構"], "financial market infrastructures": ["金融市場基建"], "financial stability": ["金融穩定"], "financial system": ["金融體系"], "fintech": ["金融科技"], "foreign currency bonds": ["外幣債券"], "fund flows": ["資金流向"], "insurance premium financing": ["保險保費融資"], "international supervisory and accounting standards": ["國際監管及會計標準"], "investment and insurance products": ["投資及保險產品"], "large exposure limits": ["大額風險承擔限額"], "licensed banks": ["持牌銀行"], "liquidity": ["流動性"], "liquidity profiles": ["流動性狀況"], "liquidity risk": ["流動性風險"], "liquidity risk management": ["流動性風險管理"], "liquidity stress testing": ["流動性壓力測試"], "loan classification and provisioning system": ["貸款分類及撥備制度"], "loan growth": ["貸款增速"], "loan underwriting standards": ["貸款批核準則"], "loan-to-value (LTV) ratio": ["按揭成數"], "market risk": ["市場風險"], "market risk management": ["市場風險管理"], "monetary policy": ["貨幣政策"], "mortgagee bank": ["承按銀行"], "on-site examinations": ["現場審查"], "operational risk": ["業務運作風險"], "operational risk management": ["業務操作風險管理"], "overseas examinations": ["境外審查"], "property market": ["樓市"], "property mortgage loans": ["按揭貸款"], "prudential measures": ["審慎監管措施"], "prudential regulatory framework": ["審慎監管制度"], "prudential supervision": ["審慎監管"], "recovery planning": ["恢復規劃"], "regulatory frictions": ["監管要求"], "remote onboarding": ["遙距開設 / 遙距開戶"], "resolution authority": ["處置機制當局"], "resolution regime": ["處置機制"], "restricted licence banks": ["有限制牌照銀行"], "retail banks": ["零售銀行"], "risk governance framework": ["風險管治架構"], "risk-based approach": ["風險為本方法"], "senior management": ["高級管理層"], "small and medium-sized enterprises": ["中小企"], "start-up companies": ["初創企業"], "statutory guideline": ["法定指引"], "strategic risks": ["策略風險"], "technology risk management": ["科技風險管理"], "thematic reviews": ["專題評估"], "twofactor authentication": ["雙重認證"], "virtual banking": ["虛擬銀行"], "CFI": ["網絡防衛計劃"], "Enhanced Competency Framework": ["資歷架構"], "Financial Action Task Force": ["財務行動特別組織（特別組織）"], "FATF": ["財務行動特別組織（特別組織）"], "IA": ["保險業監管局（保監局）"], "Mandatory Provident Fund": ["強制性公積金（強積金）"], "MPF": ["強制性公積金（強積金）"], "AIs": ["認可機構"], "customer due diligence": ["客戶盡職審查"], "CDD": ["客戶盡職審查"], "DSR": ["供款與入息比率"], "FMIs": ["金融市場基建"]}}
{"en": "# International Financial Centre\n\nTo consolidate Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre, the HKMA strives to enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. On fintech, the seven new initiatives aimed at facilitating the development and use of fintech in the banking and payment industries were well received by stakeholders and the public. Hong Kong’s international profile as a financing hub for infrastructure investments was raised further, thanks to a series of efforts on network and capacity building on this front. The launch of Bond Connect reinforced Hong Kong’s position as the main gateway to opportunities in Mainland China. The HKMA’s efforts on other areas such as corporate treasury centres were also bearing fruits.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nIn view of the rapid technological advancements, the HKMA in September announced the launch of seven initiatives to prepare Hong Kong to move into a new era of Smart Banking. These initiatives included:\n- developing the Faster Payment System (FPS) to achieve full connectivity of digital retail payments;\n- introducing an Open Application Programming Interface (Open API) framework;\n- enhancing fintech research and talent development;\n- stepping up cross-border collaboration in fintech;\n- upgrading our existing Fintech Supervisory Sandbox (FSS) 1.0 to Version 2.0;\n- facilitating the introduction of virtual banking; and\n- promoting a new Banking Made Easy initiative to minimise regulatory frictions in customers’ digital experience.\n\nThe HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO), together with the banking departments of the HKMA, played a pivotal role in driving the implementation of these initiatives to strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia.\n\nHong Kong’s international profile as a financing hub for infrastructure investments was raised further, as the number of partners of the HKMA Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO) grew to 87 as at 31 January 2018 from about 40 at inception. During the year, IFFO organised and participated in more than 10 seminars and workshops to facilitate experience sharing and collaborative networking among key stakeholders. In particular, IFFO steered the development of an infrastructure equity investment reference term sheet in its inaugural Debt Financing and Investors’ Roundtables with a view to enhancing infrastructure projects’ bankability and investability.\n\nBond Connect was launched in July, marking another major milestone in mutual access between the Hong Kong and Mainland capital markets, and further solidifying our gateway position for international investors seeking to enter the Mainland market. During the year, Hong Kong’s Renminbi Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (RQFII) quota was increased to RMB500 billion from RMB270 billion. Hong Kong maintained the world’s largest offshore renminbi liquidity pool, with vibrant renminbi financial intermediation activities as evidenced by a high turnover of our renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system and the lion’s share of Hong Kong’s renminbi payment activities in the world.\n\nFollowing the introduction of the tax regime for corporate treasury centres (CTCs) in 2016, the HKMA stepped up its outreach efforts with a view to attracting more multinational corporates to set up treasury centres in Hong Kong. By the end of 2017, more than 40 corporates reflected to the HKMA that they were actively planning to set up, or had set up, treasury centre operations in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA actively contributed to international discussions on issues of significance to global and regional financial stability. The Chief Executive of the HKMA became the Chair of the Standing Committee on Supervisory and Regulatory Co-operation (SRC) of the Financial Stability Board (FSB)1 in April to lead discussions on key financial stability issues.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure lays a solid foundation for Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre and global offshore renminbi business hub. The four interbank RTGS systems and the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) achieved 100% system availability in 2017, as compared to the target of 99.95%. To support Northbound Trading of Bond Connect, CMU has set up accounts with the two Mainland central securities depositories (CSDs) to facilitate the settlement of Bond Connect transactions and holding of Mainland debt securities on behalf of relevant CMU members.\n\nTo promote the general safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA designated four retail payment systems (RPSs) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO) in August to bring their operations under the HKMA’s oversight. The HKMA also conducted supervision of 16 stored value facility (SVF) licensees which actively launched new products and services that sought to offer customers more choices and better user experience. Separately, the coverage of e-Cheque and Electronic Bill Presentment and Payment (EBPP) service was further expanded to include crossboundary payments between Hong Kong and the entire Guangdong Province.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2017\n\n# Hong Kong as a fintech hub in Asia\n\n# Smart Banking Initiatives\n\nIn light of the rapid technological advancements, the HKMA in September announced seven initiatives that would prepare Hong Kong to move into a new era of Smart Banking. The initiatives aimed to help the banking sector to rise to a higher level and embrace the enormous opportunities brought about by the convergence of banking and technology.\n\n“Smart Banking would offer full interconnectivity amongst retail and corporate customers and allow financial services and transactions to be undertaken with great mobility, speed, ease and safety.”\n\nThe HKMA has been working closely with the banking industry and the fintech community, and made good progress in implementing the seven initiatives.\n\n# Faster Payment System\n\nThe FPS is a multi-currency platform that would enable the public to make round-the-clock funds transfers in a real-time manner with ease, through using mobile phone numbers or email addresses. It can support payments in Hong Kong dollars and renminbi. Banks and non-bank payment service providers can participate in the FPS, enabling full connectivity among all payment participants. With system development work close to completion, the FPS is scheduled to launch in September 2018.\n\nFurthermore, the HKMA led a working group, comprising major credit card scheme operators, banks, licensed SVF operators and merchant acquirers, to establish a common QR code standard for retail payments in Hong Kong. A common QR code standard would facilitate merchants in using a single QR code to accept QR code payment solutions from multiple payment service providers, providing greater convenience to customers and merchants. The working group has finalised the relevant technical specification, and would work out the implementation arrangements.\n\n# Open Application Programming Interface\n\nOpen API allows banks’ data to be accessed by third parties to facilitate better and easier integration of services offered by banks and other industries. Users can therefore conveniently stay on one system to enjoy integrated services in a secure environment. To facilitate the development and adoption of Open API by the banking sector, the HKMA has come up with a draft Open API framework, comprising a selection of Open API functions and deployment time frame, technical standards, third-party service provider governance, facilitation measures and maintenance models, for a two-month industry consultation.\n\n# Research and talent development\n\nOne of the major research projects was on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). Following the first DLT whitepaper in 2016, the second whitepaper on DLT was published in October 2017. The second whitepaper further explores the three Proof-of-Concept works, namely trade finance, digital identity management and mortgage application. It also offers advice on the implementation issues relating to governance, legal and compliance, and general control principles on deploying DLT for the banking and payment industries.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan, announces the release of the second whitepaper on DLT at the HKMA Fintech Day.\n\nRiding on the success of the Proof-of-Concept work on trade finance led by the HKMA, seven banks in Hong Kong decided to commercialise the prototype into a production system named Hong Kong Trade Finance Platform (HKTFP) to digitise and share trade documents and automate processes with a view to improving the overall trade process and reducing risks and fraud in the trade finance business.\n\nIn an effort to enlarge the talent pool in the fintech industry, the HKMA launched the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme in collaboration with the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute in December 2016. Response from students was positive. More than 3,000 applications from 421 applicants were received. Finally, 74 students accepted internship offers from the HKMA and 12 banks to work on fintech-related projects for six months or one year starting from July.\n\n# Cross-border collaboration\n\nAs the first step of strengthening our collaboration within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Bay Area, we are partnering with Shenzhen to promote fintech and talent developments. Specifically, the HKMA and the Office of Financial Development Service, the People’s Government of Shenzhen Municipality (OFDS) entered into an agreement in June to (i) provide reciprocal soft-landing support for fintech firms, (ii) co-organise the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Fintech Award in October to recognise and reward outstanding fintech products and solutions in the two cities; and (iii) arrange summer internships at Shenzhen fintech and techfin firms for Hong Kong students.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan (middle), signs and exchanges Memoranda of Understanding on softlanding arrangements with OFDS Director-General, Mr He Xiaojun (left), and Cyberport Chairman, Dr Lee George Lam, at the HKMA Fintech Day.\n\nE-leaflet for the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Fintech Award.\n\nThe HKMA also signed fintech co-operation agreements with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Dubai Financial Services Authority on innovation projects, referrals of innovative businesses, information sharing and exchange of expertise.\n\nIn November, the HKMA further signed a Memorandum of Understanding with MAS to jointly build the Global Trade Connectivity Network (GTCN), which would connect Singapore’s National Trade Platform to the HKTFP to form a cross-border DLT infrastructure in order to digitalise cross-border trade and trade finance processes, making them safer, more efficient and costeffective. It will be an open platform that allows other interested jurisdictions to participate in the future. The GTCN is expected to be launched in the first quarter of 2019.\n\n# Fintech Supervisory Sandbox\n\nThe FSS launched by the HKMA in September 2016 was upgraded to FSS 2.0 to expedite communication with banks and tech firms to facilitate new ideas and initiatives. Specifically, FSS 2.0 has the following new features:\n- A Fintech Supervisory Chatroom is set up to provide feedback to banks and tech firms at an early stage of their fintech projects.\n- Tech firms can access the FSS by seeking feedback from the Chatroom without going through a bank.\n- The sandboxes of the HKMA, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Insurance Authority are linked up so that there is a single point of entry for pilot trials of cross-sector fintech products.\n\nAs of end-2017, 28 new technology products have been tested in the FSS. Out of these cases, 14 pilot trials have been completed, and the relevant products have been rolled out to the market subsequently.\n\n# Banking Made Easy initiative\n\nA Banking Made Easy initiative was launched to minimise regulatory frictions hindering technological innovations. A taskforce has been set up with current focus on the following areas:\n- Remote onboarding and account maintenance\n- Online finance\n- Online wealth management\n\n# Virtual Banking\n\nVirtual banks, which operate without physical branches, are expected to provide additional impetus to the application of fintech in Hong Kong and offer a new kind of customer experience in mobile and digital banking. They may also help promote financial inclusion as they normally target the retail segment, be they individuals or small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The HKMA has commenced the review of the existing Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks with a view to facilitating the introduction of virtual banking in Hong Kong.\n\n# A New Era of Smart Banking\n\n# Supervision and Innovation\n\nThe seven initiatives unveiled by the HKMA last year to prepare Hong Kong for a new era of Smart Banking are a large-scale project involving cooperation among various departments within the HKMA. With fintech becoming an unstoppable force, Mr Raymond Chan, Executive Director (Banking Supervision) of the HKMA, indicated that the HKMA, as a regulator, must embrace this new trend by keeping abreast of the latest technological developments and adjusting its supervisory mindset and approach as appropriate, in order to take bank services and customer experience to a new level.\n", "terms": {"BP": ["支持組合"], "Bay Area": ["灣區"], "Bond Connect": ["債券通"], "Bond Connect transactions": ["債券通交易"], "Central Moneymarkets Unit": ["CMU系統"], "Chief Executive of the HKMA": ["金管局總裁"], "Cyberport": ["數碼港"], "DLT": ["DLT"], "DLT whitepaper": ["DLT白皮書"], "Debt Financing and Investors’ Roundtables": ["債權融資及投資者圓桌會議"], "Dubai Financial Services Authority": ["迪拜金融服務管理局"], "Electronic Bill Presentment and Payment": ["電子帳單及繳費服務"], "FSS 2.0": ["沙盒2.0升級版"], "Faster Payment System": ["快速支付系統"], "Financial Stability Board": ["金融穩定理事會"], "Fintech": ["金融科技"], "Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme": ["金融科技人才培育計劃"], "Fintech Facilitation Office": ["金融科技促進辦公室"], "Fintech Supervisory Chatroom": ["金融科技監管聊天室"], "Fintech Supervisory Sandbox": ["金融科技監管沙盒"], "Global Trade Connectivity Network": ["全球貿易連接網絡"], "Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Bay Area": ["粵港澳大灣區"], "Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks": ["《虛擬銀行的認可》指引"], "HKMA": ["金管局"], "HKMA Fintech Day": ["金管局金融科技日"], "Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute": ["香港應用科技研究院"], "IFFO": ["IFFO"], "Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office": ["基建融資促進辦公室"], "Insurance Authority": ["保險業監管局"], "International Financial Centre": ["國際金融中心"], "MAS": ["新加坡金管局"], "Memorandum of Understanding": ["諒解備忘錄"], "Monetary Authority": ["金融管理專員"], "Monetary Authority of Singapore": ["新加坡金融管理局"], "New Era of Smart Banking": ["智慧銀行新紀元"], "Norman Chan": ["陳德霖"], "Northbound Trading": ["北向通"], "Northbound Trading of Bond Connect": ["債券通─北向通"], "OFDS": ["深圳金融辦"], "Office of Financial Development Service, the People’s Government of Shenzhen Municipality": ["深圳市人民政府金融發展服務辦公室"], "Online wealth management": ["網上財富管理"], "Open API": ["開放API"], "Open Application Programming Interface (Open API) framework": ["開放應用程式介面（開放API）框架"], "Proof-of-Concept": ["概念驗證"], "SFC": ["證監會"], "SMEs": ["中小企"], "Securities and Futures Commission": ["證券及期貨事務監察委員會"], "Shenzhen-Hong Kong Fintech Award": ["深港金融科技創新獎"], "Singapore’s National Trade Platform": ["新加坡全國貿易平台"], "Standing Committee on Supervisory and Regulatory Co-operation": ["監管合作常設委員會"], "Virtual Banking": ["虛擬銀行"], "account maintenance": ["維持銀行帳戶 / 維持戶口"], "banking industry": ["銀行業"], "central securities depositories": ["中央證券託管機構"], "convergence of banking and technology": ["銀行業與科技結合"], "corporate treasury centres": ["企業財資中心"], "cross-border collaboration": ["跨境合作"], "crossboundary payments": ["跨境支付交易"], "digital identity management": ["數碼身分管理"], "financial inclusion": ["普及金融"], "financial infrastructure": ["金融基建"], "financial stability": ["金融穩定"], "fintech": ["金融科技"], "fintech hub in Asia": ["亞洲金融科技樞紐"], "fintech research and talent development": ["金融科技研究和人才培訓"], "inception": ["開展投資以來"], "infrastructure equity investment reference term sheet": ["基建股權投資參考清單"], "infrastructure projects": ["基建項目"], "interbank RTGS systems": ["銀行同業交易的RTGS系統"], "international financial centre": ["國際金融中心"], "liquidity": ["流動性"], "mortgage application": ["按揭申請"], "network and capacity building": ["構建網絡及提升技能"], "offshore renminbi business": ["離岸人民幣業務"], "offshore renminbi liquidity pool": ["離岸人民幣資金池"], "pilot trials": ["試行"], "reciprocal soft-landing support": ["軟落地支援"], "regulatory frictions": ["監管要求"], "renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system": ["人民幣即時支付結算(RTGS)系統"], "retail payment systems": ["零售支付系統"], "seven new initiatives": ["7項新措施"], "small and medium-sized enterprises": ["中小企"], "tax regime for corporate treasury centres": ["企業財資中心稅務優惠"], "techfin": ["科技金融"], "trade finance": ["貿易融資"], "treasury centres": ["企業財資中心"], "virtual banking": ["虛擬銀行"], "whitepaper": ["白皮書"], "CMU": ["債務工具中央結算系統（CMU系統）"], "Distributed Ledger Technology": ["分布式分類帳技術(DLT)"], "EBPP": ["電子帳單及繳費服務"], "Executive Director": ["助理總裁（銀行監理）"], "Banking Supervision": ["助理總裁（銀行監理）"], "FPS": ["快速支付系統"], "FS": ["財政司司長"], "FSB": ["金融穩定理事會"], "FSS": ["金融科技監管沙盒"], "GTCN": ["全球貿易連接網絡"], "HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office": ["金融科技促進辦公室(FFO)"], "FFO": ["金融科技促進辦公室(FFO)"], "HKMA Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office": ["基建融資促進辦公室(IFFO)"], "Hong Kong Trade Finance Platform": ["香港貿易融資平台"], "HKTFP": ["香港貿易融資平台"], "Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance": ["《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（《支付條例》）"], "PSSVFO": ["《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（《支付條例》）"], "Renminbi Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor": ["人民幣合格境外機構投資者(RQFII)"], "RQFII": ["人民幣合格境外機構投資者(RQFII)"], "SRC": ["監管合作常設委員會"], "CSDs": ["中央證券託管機構"], "CTCs": ["企業財資中心"], "RPSs": ["零售支付系統"], "stored value facility": ["儲值支付工具"], "SVF": ["儲值支付工具"]}}
{"en": "# Reserves Management\n\nThe global economy and financial markets performed better than expected in 2017. Global equity markets went up on the back of synchronised economic growth in major developed and emerging market economies, strong corporate earnings, and market expectation of slow and gradual tightening of monetary policies by major central banks. While the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates three times as expected, and began to reduce its balance sheet in October, the 10- Year US Treasury yield remained stable and the US dollar weakened (rather than strengthened) against other major currencies. Under such a favourable environment, the Exchange Fund’s investment income reached a record high of HK$264 billion in 2017, representing an investment return of 7.4%.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary and may be invested in securities or other assets he considers appropriate, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC).\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nEFAC has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n(a) to preserve capital;\n(b) to ensure the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(c) to ensure sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) subject to (a)–(c), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the Fund’s long-term purchasing power.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund.\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP). The BP holds highly liquid US dollardenominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The IP is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of the assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA has been diversifying part of the Exchange Fund’s investments, in a prudent and incremental manner, into a wider variety of asset classes, including emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity and real estate. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The cap for the market value of investments under the LTGP is set at onethird of the accumulated surplus of the Exchange Fund, with further capacity arising from the allocation of part of the Future Fund to long-term assets.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007 to hold shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that were acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes, is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of the unique nature of this Portfolio.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by fiscal reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP1, with the exception of the Future Fund which links its interest rate to both the IP and the LTGP depending on the portfolio mix. As at the end of 2017, the portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 65:35. The portion of the Future Fund linked with the LTGP is expected to gradually build up to around 50% by 2018.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation. The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents the long-term optimal asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark, or strategic allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and tracking error limit are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may take positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nHKMA staff in the Reserves Management Department directly manage about 73% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, which includes the entire BP and part of the IP. This part of the IP includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 27% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes. The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to capture sustainable returns, to benefit from diverse and complementary investment styles and to share market insights and technical expertise with the Exchange Fund.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is primarily determined by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe high volatility of the financial markets subsequent to the 2008/09 global financial crisis has highlighted the importance of risk management. Stringent controls and investment guidelines have been established for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and compliance with guidelines and regulations is closely monitored. Risk assessment has been strengthened to support the Exchange Fund’s increased pace of investment diversification. Risk-control tools are deployed to assess market risks under both normal and adverse market conditions. Detailed performance attribution analyses are also conducted to identify sources of performance, allowing the HKMA to make the best use of the investment skills of internal and external managers.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nThe HKMA is supportive of responsible investment. For instance, the HKMA supports the Principles of Responsible Ownership issued by the Securities and Futures Commission on 7 March 2016, which are voluntary and help investors determine how best to meet their ownership responsibilities in relation to their investments in Hong Kong-listed companies. For the management of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA has encouraged the appointed external fund managers for its Hong Kong equity portfolio to adopt the Principles of Responsible Ownership in managing the investments. Furthermore, the front offices and the Risk Management and Compliance Division have incorporated environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into various internal procedures for making and monitoring investment activities. The HKMA will closely monitor the development of ESG standards and assess how these standards can be further integrated into the investment process.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2017\n\nThe global economy and financial markets in 2017 performed better than expected. On the back of synchronised economic growth in major developed and emerging market economies, strong corporate earnings, and market expectation of slow and gradual tightening of monetary policies by major central banks, the global equity markets performed well. In particular, the Hong Kong equity market rose by 36%, outperforming other major equity markets.\n\nIn the bond markets, short-dated US Treasury yields shot up as the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates three times as expected, and began to reduce its balance sheet in October. Nevertheless, the 10-year US Treasury yield remained stable at about 2.4% over the year. Other major 10-Year government bond yields also ended the year little changed, with the exception of German Bunds which rose on the euro area’s solid economic growth and market expectation of the European Central Bank’s policy tightening.\n\nIn the currency markets, the US dollar weakened against other major currencies, despite the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes and the beginning of its balance sheet reduction. The depreciation of the US dollar was a result of the reviving economic growth in Europe and Japan, and market expectation of diminishing monetary policy divergence between the US and other major economies. The euro and yen appreciated by around 14% and 4% respectively against the US dollar in 2017.\n\nThe performance of major currencies as well as bond and equity markets in 2017 is shown in Table 1.\n\nTable 1 2017 market returns\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$264 billion in 2017. This comprised gains of HK$80.4 billion on overseas equities, gains of HK$58.3 billion on Hong Kong equities, gains of HK$34.4 billion on bonds, a positive currency translation effect of HK$53.5 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets and gains of HK$37.4 billion on other investments held by the investment holding subsidiaries of the Exchange Fund. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$4.5 billion.\n\nThe investment income of HK$264 billion last year is a record high for the Exchange Fund, surpassing the previous record in 2007 (HK$142.2 billion) by HK$121.8 billion.\n\nThe total assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,015.3 billion at year end. The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$235.6 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$157.2 billion and real estate at HK$78.4 billion. Outstanding investment commitments amounted to HK$162.4 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund (excluding the Strategic Portfolio) in 2017 was 7.4%. Specifically, the IP achieved a rate of return of 12.1%, while the BP gained 1.8%. The LTGP recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 13.7% since its inception in 2009.\n\nThe annual return of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2017 is set out in Chart 1. Table 2 shows the 2017 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over several different time horizons. The average return was 2.9% over the past three years, 2.5% over the past five years, 2.2% over the past ten years and 4.9% since 1994. Table 3 shows the currency mix of the Fund’s assets as at 31 December 2017.\n\nHKMA Deputy Chief Executive, Mr Eddie Yue (middle), speaks at the press conference on 2017 Exchange Fund Results.\n\nChart 1 Investment return of the Exchange Fund (1994–2017)\n\nTable 2 Investment return of the Exchange Fund in Hong Kong dollar terms\n\nTable 3 Currency mix of the Exchange Fund’s assets on 31 December 2017 (including forward transactions)\n", "terms": {"10-year US Treasury yield": ["美國十年期國庫債券收益率"], "2008/09 global financial crisis": ["2008至2009年全球金融危機"], "BP": ["支持組合"], "Backing Portfolio": ["支持組合"], "Currency Board": ["貨幣發行局"], "Currency Board arrangements": ["貨幣發行局制度"], "EFAC": ["外匯基金諮詢委員會"], "ESG standards": ["這些因素的相關標準"], "Eddie Yue": ["余偉文"], "European Central Bank": ["歐洲中央銀行"], "Exchange Fund": ["外匯基金"], "Exchange Fund Advisory Committee": ["外匯基金諮詢委員會"], "Financial Secretary": ["財政司司長"], "Future Fund": ["未來基金"], "German Bunds": ["德國政府債券"], "Global equity markets": ["環球股市"], "Government funds": ["政府基金"], "HKMA": ["金管局"], "Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited": ["香港交易及結算所有限公司"], "Hong Kong-listed companies": ["香港上市公司"], "IP": ["投資組合"], "Investment Portfolio": ["投資組合"], "Investment objectives": ["投資目標"], "LTGP": ["長期增長組合"], "Long-Term Growth Portfolio": ["長期增長組合"], "MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND": ["外匯基金的管理"], "Mainland bonds and equities": ["內地債券與股票"], "Monetary Base": ["貨幣基礎"], "Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development": ["經濟合作與發展組織"], "PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND": ["外匯基金的表現"], "Principles of Responsible Ownership": ["《負責任的擁有權原則》"], "Reserves Management": ["儲備管理"], "Reserves Management Department": ["儲備管理部"], "Responsible investment": ["負責任投資"], "Risk Management and Compliance Division": ["風險管理及監察處"], "Securities and Futures Commission": ["證券及期貨事務監察委員會"], "Strategic Portfolio": ["策略性資產組合"], "THE EXCHANGE FUND": ["外匯基金"], "US Treasury": ["美國國庫券"], "US dollar-denominated assets": ["美元資產"], "accumulated surplus": ["累計盈餘"], "annualised internal rate of return": ["內部回報率年率"], "asset classes": ["資產類別"], "asset mix": ["資產分布"], "balance sheet": ["資產負債表"], "corporate earnings": ["企業盈利"], "currency markets": ["貨幣市場"], "custodian fees": ["託管費"], "delegated authority": ["授權"], "derivative overlay portfolios": ["衍生工具"], "emerging market economies": ["新興經濟體"], "environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors": ["環境、社會及管治因素"], "equity portfolio": ["股票組合"], "external fund managers": ["外聘基金經理"], "external managers": ["外聘投資經理"], "financial stability": ["金融穩定"], "financial system": ["金融體系"], "fiscal reserves": ["財政儲備"], "fixed-income markets": ["定息市場"], "forward transactions": ["遠期交易"], "front offices": ["前線投資部門"], "global financial crisis": ["環球金融危機"], "inception": ["開展投資以來"], "international financial centre": ["國際金融中心"], "investment benchmark": ["投資基準"], "investment diversification": ["多元化投資"], "investment expertise": ["專業投資技術"], "investment guidelines": ["投資指引"], "investment holding subsidiaries": ["投資控股附屬公司"], "investment performance": ["投資表現"], "investment process": ["投資程序"], "investment return": ["投資回報率"], "investments under the LTGP": ["長期增長組合的投資"], "liquidity": ["流動性"], "listed equity portfolios": ["上市股票組合"], "macro risk management strategies": ["宏觀風險管理策略"], "major developed and emerging market economies": ["主要先進及新興市場經濟體"], "market risk": ["市場風險"], "market risks": ["市場風險"], "market value": ["市值"], "monetary and financial stability": ["貨幣及金融穩定"], "monetary and financial systems": ["貨幣及金融體系"], "monetary policies": ["貨幣政策"], "monetary policy": ["貨幣政策"], "monetary policy divergence": ["貨幣政策差距"], "performance attribution analyses": ["投資表現因素分析"], "portfolio managers": ["投資組合經理"], "portfolio mix": ["組合比重"], "portfolio structure": ["組合結構"], "press conference": ["新聞發布會"], "private equity": ["私募股權"], "real estate": ["房地產"], "real estate investments": ["房地產投資"], "short-dated": ["短期／短香港銀行同業拆息"], "specialised asset classes": ["特別資產"], "statutory bodies": ["法定組織"], "strategic asset allocation": ["策略性資產分布"], "synchronised economic growth": ["同步經濟增長"], "tactical asset allocation": ["戰略性資產分布"], "total assets": ["資產總值"], "tracking error": ["循跡誤差"], "tracking error limit": ["循跡誤差限額"], "transaction costs": ["交易費"], "valuation gain": ["估值收益"], "Exchange Fund Ordinance": ["《外匯基金條例》（第66章）"], "GE": ["見習經濟師"]}}

Notable examples included the Coin Collection Programme, banking products and services, bankingrelated guidelines and circulars, monetary and economic statistics, prudential measures for property mortgage loans, and prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received since 2014 and Chart 2 provides a breakdown in terms of the nature of enquiries received in 2017.\n\nChart 1 Total number of public enquiries\n\nChart 2 Nature of enquiries received in 2017\n\n# Publications\n\nApart from the HKMA Annual Report, in 2017 the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report and four issues of the Quarterly Bulletin, and released regular updates of the Monthly Statistical Bulletin to provide up-to-date and thematic information and analyses on monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. In addition, the HKMA issued a total of 23 inSight articles, covering various topical issues related to its work.\n\n# HKMA website\n\nThe HKMA corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk), with over 60,000 pages in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, is the public access gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It also contains the register of authorized institutions (AIs) and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the register of stored value facility (SVF) licensees under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance. Dedicated webpages and eye-catching short-cut links are designed to draw public attention to the new initiatives of the HKMA, such as account opening, the regulatory regime for SVFs, the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office and the Fintech Facilitation Office, as well as important and timely information, such as reminders on the need to remain vigilant against bogus telephone calls and the location of Coin Carts under the Coin Collection Programme.\n\n# Public Education Programme\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre is an important resource for introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters. It consists of an exhibition area and a library, and is open to the public six days a week. The exhibition area introduces the work of the HKMA and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong. It also contains reading materials and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nThe new look of the policy section of the Information Centre, which introduces the work of the HKMA and related financial concepts, was re-opened to the public on 24 February 2017 upon completion of the refurbishment work. The revamped policy section contains various interactive games and devices that integrate play into learning and explain complicated financial concepts in a simple way. Feedback from the visitors has been positive.\n\nStudents try out the educational games at the policy section of the Information Centre to learn about the work of the HKMA.\n\nGuided tours of the Information Centre are organised for visitors. During the year, it received more than 59,000 visitors and hosted over 650 guided tours for schools and other groups (Chart 3). More than 645,000 people have visited the Information Centre since it opened in December 2003.\n\nThe library, situated next to the exhibition area, houses more than 23,000 books, journals and other publications for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs and central banking topics. It also maintains the register of AIs and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nThe library in the HKMA Information Centre.\n\nTo reach out to the community and raise public awareness of the HKMA’s work, the HKMA organised four public education seminars for about 2,000 secondary school students and teachers in 2017. Topics covered in the seminars included the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, banking stability, consumer protection, the Deposit Protection Scheme, fintech, the Belt and Road Initiative and careers in the financial industry. More than 58,400 people have participated in this public education programme since its launch in 1998.\n\nStudents and teachers from secondary schools in different districts participate in one of the public education seminars.\n\nChart 3 Types of group visits to the Information Centre in 2017\n\n# HUMAN RESOURCES\n\nThe HKMA recruits, develops and maintains a highly professional workforce to support its policy objectives and respond flexibly to changing work priorities. While the HKMA is an integral part of the Government, it employs staff on terms different from those of the civil service to attract personnel with the right experience and expertise. As a public organisation, the HKMA aims to maintain a lean and flexible structure and, where possible, to redeploy staff resources to undertake new initiatives and meet increasing workload.\n\n# Organisational changes\n\nThe Resolution Office was established on 1 April 2017 to implement the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance enacted in June 2016. The Office aims to ensure that the Hong Kong resolution regime is operational for banks. This is essential to enhancing the resilience of the Hong Kong banking sector in the event of any crisis.\n\n# Staffing\n\nThe establishment of the HKMA in 2017 was 927. This will be increased by 35 to 962 in 2018 (an increase of 3.8%) to ensure that sufficient resources are provided to cope with the new initiatives and the increasing complexity and volume of existing work. The new posts are deployed to the following functions:\n\n- Enhancing banking and financial stability, which includes:\n    – enhancing capacity to support the launch of the Faster Payment System and easy banking initiatives;\n    – strengthening supervisory capacity to deal with the regional and business expansion of banks and to facilitate (i) the wider adoption of fintech in the provision of banking services and (ii) collaboration with other regulatory authorities on cyber security and fintech issues; and\n    – supporting the work of the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce to fight against fraud, money laundering and other types of financial crimes, and strengthening legal support for enforcement actions under legislation governing anti-money laundering and SVFs.\n- Strengthening investment, risk management and other related support for the further expansion and diversification of the Exchange Fund’s investment activities.\n- Stepping up global macro and financial-sector surveillance, and strengthening talent development programmes to ensure that the HKMA has the necessary human capital to meet the long-term development needs of the organisation.\n\nTable 1 gives a breakdown of the establishment and strength of the HKMA.\n\nTable 1 Establishment and strength of the HKMA on 1 January 2018\n\nTemporary resources are deployed to meet other work demands. The HKMA also transfers staff members on secondment to other international or local organisations, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Services Development Council, to assist in activities or policy initiatives in which Hong Kong or the HKMA has an interest. Some staff members are deployed on a full-time or part-time basis to provide operational support to the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board and the Treasury Markets Association.\n\n# Remuneration policies and pay review mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary (FS) determines the pay and conditions of service for HKMA staff on the advice of the Governance Sub-Committee (GSC) through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC), taking into account the prevailing market rates and practices. Remuneration comprises a total cash package and a provident fund scheme, with minimal benefits in kind. The cash package consists of monthly fixed pay (or basic pay) and variable pay, which may be awarded to individual staff members as a lump sum once a year, depending on performance.\n\nPay for HKMA staff is reviewed annually by the FS in the light of recommendations made to him by the GSC through the EFAC, taking into account the GSC’s assessment of the performance of the HKMA in the preceding year, the paysurvey findings of the financial sector conducted by independent human resources consultants, and any other relevant factors. Special pay adjustments may be made from time to time for individual meritorious staff members to maintain their pay competitiveness.\n\nAny approved annual adjustments to the fixed pay and any variable pay awards for the HKMA are distributed to individual staff members based on their performance. Investment professionals in the HKMA are subject to a variable pay system that seeks to strengthen the link between their investment performance and remuneration award. The pay adjustments and awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Executive Director and above are approved by the FS on the advice of the GSC. The staff members concerned are not present at the meetings when their pay is discussed. The pay adjustments and awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Division Head and below are determined by the Chief Executive of the HKMA under delegated authority from the FS and within the approved overall pay awards.\n\n# Remuneration of senior staff members\n\nThe remuneration packages of senior staff members in 2017 are shown in Table 2.\n\nTable 2 Remuneration packages of HKMA senior staff members in 2017\n\n# Manager Trainee (MT) and Graduate Economist (GE) programmes\n\nTo develop a pool of young talent with sharp analytical minds, strong communication skills and good team spirit for a long-term career in central banking, the HKMA runs two trainee programmes: the MT programme and the GE programme. Each programme lasts for a period of two years.\n\nThe MT programme prepares young graduates interested in central banking work to become the HKMA’s future key management staff and contribute to the financial stability and prosperity of Hong Kong. Each MT undergoes on-the-job training in two to three departments to acquire hands-on experience on the important functions of the HKMA. For the GE programme, young graduates interested in economic research are offered the opportunity to harness their research skills in two to three departments to provide important input to the policy formulation process.\n\nBoth the MT and GE programmes provide an all-rounded career development environment for the trainees. Apart from on-the-job training, the MTs and GEs also attend structured foundation central banking courses organised internally and by leading international or regional organisations. Upon successful completion of the respective programme, MTs are offered appointments as Managers and GEs as Economists to continue their pursuit of a professional career in the organisation.\n", "terms": {"Annual Report": ["年報"], "Banking Ordinance": ["《銀行業條例》"], "Belt and Road": ["一帶一路"], "Belt and Road Initiative": ["一帶一路"], "Bond Connect": ["債券通"], "Bond Connect scheme": ["債券通計劃"], "Chief Executive of the HKMA": ["金管局總裁"], "Coin Carts": ["收銀車"], "Coin Collection Programme": ["硬幣收集計劃"], "Corporate Functions": ["機構職能"], "Deposit Protection Scheme": ["存款保障計劃"], "Division Head": ["主管"], "EFAC": ["外匯基金諮詢委員會"], "Exchange Fund": ["外匯基金"], "Exchange Fund Advisory Committee": ["外匯基金諮詢委員會"], "Exchange Fund investments": ["外匯基金投資"], "Faster Payment System": ["快速支付系統"], "Financial Secretary": ["財政司司長"], "Financial Services Development Council": ["金融發展局"], "Fintech": ["金融科技"], "Fintech Facilitation Office": ["金融科技促進辦公室"], "Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce": ["反訛騙及洗黑錢情報工作組"], "GE programme": ["見習經濟師計劃"], "HKMA": ["金管局"], "HKMA Information Centre": ["金管局資訊中心"], "Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report": ["貨幣與金融穩定情況半年度報告"], "Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board": ["香港存款保障委員會"], "Hong Kong banking sector": ["香港銀行體系"], "Hong Kong resolution regime": ["香港處置機制"], "IT security": ["資訊科技保安"], "Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office": ["基建融資促進辦公室"], "International Monetary Fund": ["國際貨幣基金組織"], "MT programme": ["見習經理計劃"], "Media relations": ["傳媒關係"], "Monthly Statistical Bulletin": ["金融數據月報"], "Norman Chan": ["陳德霖"], "Organisational changes": ["組織架構變動"], "Public Education Programme": ["公眾教育計劃"], "Public Enquiry Service": ["公眾查詢服務"], "Quarterly Bulletin": ["季報"], "Remuneration policies and pay review mechanism": ["薪酬福利政策及薪酬檢討機制"], "Resolution Office": ["處置機制辦公室"], "Resolution Regime": ["處置機制"], "Treasury Markets Association": ["財資市場公會"], "anti-money laundering": ["打擊洗錢"], "authorized institutions": ["認可機構"], "banking policies and regulations": ["銀行業政策及規例"], "banking products and services": ["銀行產品及服務"], "banking stability": ["銀行體系穩定"], "bankingrelated guidelines and circulars": ["銀行業相關指引及通告"], "banknotes": ["銀行紙幣"], "careers in the financial industry": ["金融業就業資訊"], "central banking": ["中央銀行"], "central banking topics": ["中央銀行事務"], "consumer banking issues": ["銀行消費者事宜"], "consumer protection": ["消費者保障"], "cyber security": ["網絡保安"], "delegated authority": ["授權"], "easy banking initiatives": ["銀行易措施"], "financial crimes": ["金融罪行"], "financial discipline": ["財政"], "financial stability": ["金融穩定"], "fintech": ["金融科技"], "global macro and financial-sector surveillance": ["環球宏觀及金融體系監察"], "guided tours": ["導賞服務"], "inSight article": ["《匯思》文章"], "inSight articles": ["《匯思》文章"], "investment performance": ["投資表現"], "legislation governing anti-money laundering and SVFs": ["規管打擊洗錢及儲值支付工具的法例"], "media briefings": ["傳媒簡報會"], "media enquiries": ["傳媒查詢"], "monetary and economic issues": ["貨幣及經濟事項"], "monetary and economic statistics": ["貨幣及經濟統計資料"], "mosaic artwork": ["馬賽克作品"], "on-the-job training": ["在職培訓"], "policy formulation process": ["制定政策過程"], "press conference": ["新聞發布會"], "press conferences": ["新聞發布會"], "press events": ["媒體活動"], "prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing": ["打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集"], "professional development": ["專業能力"], "property mortgage loans": ["按揭貸款"], "prudential measures": ["審慎監管措施"], "prudential measures for property mortgage loans": ["物業按揭貸款審慎監管措施"], "public education programmes": ["公眾教育活動"], "register of AIs and local representative offices": ["認可機構及本地代表辦事處紀錄冊"], "register of securities staff of AIs": ["認可機構證券業務員工紀錄冊"], "register of stored value facility (SVF) licensees": ["儲值支付工具持牌人紀錄冊"], "regulatory authorities": ["監管機構"], "regulatory regime for SVFs": ["儲值支付工具監管制度"], "resolution regime": ["處置機制"], "stand-up interviews": ["即場訪問"], "supervisory capacity": ["監理能力"], "talent development programme": ["人才培訓/人才培育計劃"], "talent development programmes": ["人才發展計劃"], "Executive Director": ["助理總裁（銀行監理）"], "FS": ["財政司司長"], "Governance Sub-Committee": ["管治委員會"], "GSC": ["管治委員會"], "Graduate Economist": ["見習經濟師"], "GE": ["見習經濟師"], "Manager Trainee": ["見習經理"], "MT": ["見習經理"], "Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance": ["《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（《支付條例》）"], "AIs": ["認可機構"], "register of authorized institutions": ["認可機構及本地代表辦事處紀錄冊"], "stored value facility": ["儲值支付工具"], "SVF": ["儲值支付工具"]}}
{"en": "# The Exchange Fund\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 157 to 243, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2017, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2017, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards.  My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report.  I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards.  I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017.  These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information.  The other information comprises all the information included in the 2017 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.  If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact.  I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.  I also:\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.  The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.  If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion.  My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report.  However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and\n- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements.  I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit.  I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nDavid Sun\nDirector of Audit\n\n11 April 2018\n\n# 1 PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES\n\nThe Monetary Authority, under delegated authority from the Financial Secretary as Controller of the Exchange Fund (the Fund), manages the Fund in accordance with the provisions of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).  The principal activities of the Fund are safeguarding the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong and maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems.\n\nThe assets of the Fund are managed as four portfolios: the Backing Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio and the Strategic Portfolio.  The assets of the Backing Portfolio fully match the Monetary Base, under Hong Kong’s Currency Board system.  The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.  The Long-Term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments.  The Strategic Portfolio holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited acquired by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) for the account of the Fund for strategic purposes. Operating segment information is set out in note 30.\n\n# 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n# 2.1 Statement of compliance\n\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with all applicable Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRSs), which is a collective term that includes all applicable individual Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, Hong Kong Accounting Standards (HKASs) and Interpretations issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), and accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong.  A summary of the significant accounting policies adopted by the Fund and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) is set out below.\n\nThe HKICPA has issued certain new and revised HKFRSs that are first effective or available for early adoption for the current accounting period.  Note 3 provides information on the changes, if any, in accounting policies resulting from initial adoption of these developments to the extent that they are relevant to the Group for the current and prior accounting periods reflected in these financial statements.\n\n# 2.2 Basis of preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe Group financial statements include the financial statements of the Group as well as the Group’s interests in associates and joint ventures.  The principal activities of the principal subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are shown in notes 16 and 17.\n\nThe measurement basis used in the preparation of the financial statements is historical cost except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair values as explained in the accounting policies set out below:\n- trading financial instruments (note 2.6.2.1);\n- financial assets and financial liabilities designated at fair value (note 2.6.2.2);\n- available-for-sale securities (note 2.6.2.5);\n- gold (note 2.11); and\n- investment properties (note 2.12).\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with HKFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure.  The estimates and associated assumptions are based on experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.  Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nNote 18 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of investment properties.  Note 36 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of financial instruments.  Apart from the accounting judgements involving these fair value estimations, there are no other critical accounting judgements involved in the application of the Group’s accounting policies.\n\n# 2.3 Subsidiaries and non-controlling interests\n\nA subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group.  The Group controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.  When assessing whether the Group has power, only substantive rights (held by the Group and other parties) are considered.\n", "terms": {"2017 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority": ["金融管理局2017年年報"], "Annual Report": ["年報"], "Audit Commission": ["審計署"], "Audit Commission auditing standards": ["審計署審計準則"], "Audit Sub-Committee": ["審核委員會"], "Backing Portfolio": ["支持組合"], "Currency Board": ["貨幣發行局"], "Currency Board system": ["貨幣發行局制度"], "Director of Audit": ["審計署署長"], "Exchange Fund": ["外匯基金"], "Exchange Fund Advisory Committee": ["外匯基金諮詢委員會"], "Financial Reporting Standard": ["財務報告準則"], "Financial Secretary": ["財政司司長"], "Financial Secretary as Controller of the Exchange Fund": ["財政司司長以外匯基金管理人"], "Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region": ["香港特別行政區政府"], "Group financial statements": ["集團財務報表"], "HKFRSs": ["香港財務報告準則"], "HKICPA": ["香港會計師公會"], "HKSAR": ["香港特區"], "Hong Kong Accounting Standards": ["香港會計準則"], "Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited": ["香港交易及結算所有限公司"], "Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards": ["香港財務報告準則"], "Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants": ["香港會計師公會"], "Hong Kong Special Administrative Region": ["香港特別行政區"], "IP": ["投資組合"], "Independent Auditor’s Report": ["獨立審計師報告"], "Investment Portfolio": ["投資組合"], "Long-Term Growth Portfolio": ["長期增長組合"], "Monetary Authority": ["金融管理專員"], "Monetary Base": ["貨幣基礎"], "Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development": ["經濟合作與發展組織"], "Strategic Portfolio": ["策略性資產組合"], "accounting estimates": ["會計估計"], "accounting policies": ["會計政策"], "accounting principles": ["會計準則"], "audit evidence": ["審計憑證"], "available-for-sale securities": ["可供出售證券"], "balance sheet": ["資產負債表"], "delegated authority": ["授權"], "directive of the Chief Executive": ["行政長官所發出的指示"], "fair value": ["公平值"], "financial assets": ["金融資產"], "financial assets and financial liabilities designated at fair value": ["指定以公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債"], "financial liabilities": ["金融負債"], "financial system": ["金融體系"], "going concern": ["持續經營"], "going concern basis of accounting": ["持續經營作為會計基礎"], "group audit": ["集團審計"], "income and expenditure account": ["收支帳目"], "internal control": ["內部控制"], "key audit matters": ["關鍵審計事項"], "monetary and financial systems": ["貨幣及金融體系"], "non-controlling interests": ["非控股權益"], "principal activities": ["主要業務"], "private equity": ["私募股權"], "real estate": ["房地產"], "real estate investments": ["房地產投資"], "safeguarding the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong": ["捍衛港元匯率"], "section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance": ["《外匯基金條例》第7條"], "trading financial instruments": ["交易用途的金融工具"], "Exchange Fund Ordinance": ["《外匯基金條例》（第66章）"], "Cap. 66": ["《外匯基金條例》（第66章）"], "Hong Kong Monetary Authority": ["金管局"], "SIG": ["監管及實施準則小組（SIG小組）"]}}
